okay here's show happy new year
hey there it's the npr politics hot cast its twenty eight team it's an even ear and for a politics pod cast like ours that means one thing it's an election or preview that in a little bit will also talk about what on congress is plate as it returns for a new here i'm scott debt heroic effort congress
npr and tamer he thank him for the white house and i'm susan davis i also have a congress at the new year everybody happy new year
can i can i push one thing i stole this idea for my cousin on new year's eve and it was a great idea and i'm an evangelist for now in addition to the phil collins midnight thing which had to do and it was great
she and her kids take a lemon and right bad things from the last year on the lemon and then shortly before midnight throw it out the window you're going to say they make lemonade they don't make lemonade
throw it out the window i co opted that and used a large sweet potato because they're are a bunch of people in my house and then just toss the sweet potato where did you throw at you live in the city i have a yard i gave it a high arc in the yard i did not throw it into the street so there's just a sweet potato laying in your yard and the next morning i pick it up and threw it away okay and that i was really really frozen my dog was like really and
agreed but i threw it before the dog could the sweet potato i think you should bury it in your yard that seems like more of a symbolic thing about saying about of the year the thing is i thought of this to do at eleven fifty seven so there wasn't time got it
so listening to your intro it made me think oh gosh i can no longer say it's too soon to talk about twenty eighteen know it's twenty eight and we're doing like we're it is now game on we get to talk about the midterms and we don't even have to apologize well this will make you feel better we will talk about the mid terms in the second
half of the pod cast we will start with what's coming up in congress the tax bill as we know is behind us that it's signed into law but congress has a lot on his plate and sue the to do list sounds to me very suspiciously like the december to do list and to do list that sounds suspiciously like things we've talked about a lot
the number one priority is to keep the government open before they left for the christmas break they passed a short term stopgap funding measure it keeps the government running until january nineteenth and in the meantime they're trying to negotiate all sorts of unfinished business with the intention of hopefully using this final say
funding bill as a likely vehicle to pass all this unfinished legislation so there was a lot of stuff in the air that was secondary to the main funding the government issue
just the mix of them dhaka chip healthcare stabilization five of all of those what is the most important in the short term the first thing they have to do before they can move forward on pretty much anything else is they need to find bipartisan agreement on what the spending levels for the government should be that is why that is the first
priority this week for congressional leaders who were meeting with senior white house officials to try and basically just get an agreement on a number for both how much money the government's going to spend on defense spending and for all the other priorities they can't really move forward on all these other negotiations until they just kind of get that top line figure tam there's a meeting with with white house
officials and correctional leaders tomorrow and then over the weekend present and trump gets together with mitch mcconnell and paul ryan at camp david are there any priorities the white house is pushing for when it comes to shifting funding around adding some places taking it away other places
the main priority that president trump has had his big he wants more money for defense obviously he'd also like to fund his wall but that may have to come with the negotiations over dhaka and in reality that may have to go by the wayside during the negotiations over over the dream a given
so what's actually talk about that for a minute because in september
we all talked about the fact that that dhaka was probably going to be pointed to december because democrats had leverage than democrats chose to not use that leverage in december so the question is what do democrats push for in a couple of weeks when it comes to saying we won't do x or else when it comes to dhaka but i guess the other question is where president trunk actually stands on that because remember
he initially was on board with the big picture idea of some sort of compromise but then he had that real hard one document that came out but said you know these twenty things are my immigration priorities
yeah where where as he between those two positions right now i he at the moment i think is closer to that hardline document in addition to saying that he wants funding for the wall he also wants to in what's called chain migration that's what they call it where it's immigration policy based on it least
in part on family ties he wants it to be based on merit and like who has a lot of education or the potential for a good job that would be like a complete rewriting of the immigration system and is a complete rewriting of the system that doesn't actually even have a ton of republicans support much less debt
craddock support
and now comes the moment when i would like to for my first time in this calendar year read a trump tweet he has been treating about doctor just this morning he says quote democrats are doing nothing for dhaka just interested in politics dhaka activists and hispanics will go hard again stems will
falling in love with republicans and their president exclamation point we are about results so important reminder here
the deferred action for travel arrivals program is ending because president trump made a decision to end it he set the date for march fifth sue at the time he said that seemed pretty far off march fifth not that far away at this point into he did and we should also note he made the decision to end it because the program was being challenged in the court system it was an obama error prone
graham which many republicans believed they would have been victorious in the courts that the president does not have unilateral authority to do that kind of immigration policy now the challenge that they're going to have and i think the challenge or going to see if he magically throughout two thousand and eighteen
is there is no solution to the immigration question that isn't bipartisan there is no immigration bill they can pass the house the two hundred and eighteen republican votes nothing can get through the senate without sixty votes they're going to need at least nine democrats can't do anything unless the president agrees he's going to sign it so the challenges are the dynamics the legislative demands
what thousand and eighteen is asking for fundamentally call for more bipartisan solutions than the big legislative priorities of twenty seventeen which were we're appealing and replacing the affordable care act and passing comprehensive tax legislation and there was talk about some sort of group forming jeff flake from arizona was one of the people talking about that saying we feel like in mid january
have some sort of bipartisan conversation on the center for absolutely and i will say that one of the reasons that democrats left town without putting up a bigger fight over immigration is by every measure as in the senate there are sincere bipartisan ongoing negotiations going for a comprehensive immigration bill and jeff flake said that he's been given
in assurances by senate majority leader mitch mcconnell that that will get a vote potentially as early as january mitch mcconnell and said he will bring an immigration bill to the floor if he knows it has the sixty votes to pass the democrats have said all along they're never going to vote for a wall ending chain migration is a pretty drastic change that doesn't seem like it would have sixty votes
what do either of you think democrats could realistically except in exchange for protection for these eight hundred thousand or so people who are in the country i think democrats would give a metaphorical wall they would be more than happy to have significant increases in funding for border security
drones along the border of things like that
but an actual physical walled the president trump compound on and say this is my thing that i got they are not going to say yes to that and they're going to make the case and they already are making the case like you can't hold these seven hundred eight hundred thousand young people hostage for your wall but the president has me also been sort of
he's waffled a bit on the wall as well right i mean it at times he said it's going to be a big beautiful wall going to be a physical structure but he has cracked the door to negotiating a wall in terms of you know he's talked about using drones are other forms of border security i mean it seems like the intention is really to give some measure of of certainty
the us mexico border is more tightly controlled for illegal immigration which in the past many democrats have also said that they do support yeah i mean i think it depends on the day gather it is a physical wall that he can touch whether it is see through or not see through how tall it is what it's made of and you know we could be
this comes down to how do you define wall and can president from claim victory in this case so we've talked about this and the cover from different parts before and this is something that that as you said is complicated has been tried and not resolved several times in the past when there were a republican majority is when they were
democratic majority is when it was mixed government so seems to me like it's very unlikely or at least a very high bar to reach for this to be resolved within the next month
there is i don't think we have a good read yet of were those senate negotiations are like i said todd negotiators people like illinois democrat dick durbin who the dream act has been one of his driving issues in congress has also sounded like he believes there is a bipartisan solution to be had we know we know what democrats want right
know that they won a path the either legal status or citizenship for the so called dreamers what we're not entirely sure yet is how much they're willing to give and how much they need to give in order to get republicans and president trump on board they've done this before the senate has done this before they know how to do it they have the tools they probably have the votes the
question is is the timing rate is the political incentive right and you know for democrats how how hard do they want to draw red line and not negotiate on these issues because i do think again as we enter this midterm election year they see keeping things like their base and hispanic minority voters and others excited about this issue they have an incentive there
okay so the things we just talked about are probably going to dominate the next few weeks and as i mentioned before or mentioned again here just just to some other thing still in the air the children's health insurance program that had expired
put enough money to keep it going for another month or so but they're going to have to resolve that in a long term way soon same with a law authorizing foreign surveillance finds a law that was renewed for about another month and then there's the question of again something we've been talking about for several months is there going to be some sort of stabilization for the health care market susan collins had a sister
damn it in exchange for a vote on tax cards it didn't happen but she feels comp and up and this month
that all being said turning the page to a broader look at two thousand and eighteen it was pretty to multi this year for the most part for the president and his own party and congress but it ended on a really positive know getting that big accomplishment done i mean does that keep things going in a smooth way for twenty eight hundred is that all depend on what happens in the next two or three
luke's well i didn't want to be predictive in two thousand and seventeen and i don't want to be too pretty do two hundred eighteen either
january second you can just turn that resolution out the door that's
you're absolutely right sky i mean they ended with a republican party ended two thousand and seventeen
on a very high note the party in terms of the relationship between capitol hill in the white house is probably the strongest it's ever been i think they have found a path to how to work together i think the president sees what it feels like to have a big legislative when and probably wants to have that feeling again in two thousand and eighteen
the demands of an election year just different historically the bulk of the legislative work in an election year tends to be pretty much wrapped up by the summer time
you don't really get a lot of big legislative victories in the fall of an election year so i think we're looking for a january through spring time crunch in terms of the big legislative push and how successful they're going to be and the thing that i would look to and maybe this will all be worked out by the end of the week with this
retreat at camp david and they will do like trust fall and everyone will be on the same page but at the moment the president the house speaker and the majority leader all republicans are all emphasizing different priority yeah for the year ahead and and that seems like not the best
way to proceed rapidly two words one goal so you have have mitch mcconnell saying everything needs to be done in a more bipartisan way i mean he's either looking at the reality of the senate he's looking at the numbers he's looking at the midterms he's looking in a lot of things you have paul ryan who wants to take on the so called entitlement reform possibly met
care medicaid social security talking about doing reconciliation again this this process that makes things have a lower bar
fifty one vote majority in the senate and then you have the president talking about infrastructure dhaka and and welfare reform which is somewhat different than what paul ryan is talking about the president's idea according to aids spoken demoralizing of what welfare reform is sort of means to
tested government programs so that could be medicaid but it wouldn't be medicare and it wouldn't be social security it would be things like food stamps and possibly medicaid i think it'll crystallize a little bit more later in the month i do think that congressional leaders when one party controls everything they are certainly looking to the president to set the tone for the agenda for the earrings probably
going to do that in his state of the union address later this month and then shortly after the sea of the union republicans and democrats do this too but republicans will have their annual retreat where they they leave washington they go away for the weekend and they kind of fade out and work out what they want their priorities to be for the year
i need a circle back and something the term said
if you had to be caught in a trust fall by donald trump paul ryan or mitch mcconnell who would you pick as most trustworthy palmer morality ninety x baby mainly because he is the strongest yeah yeah he's going to catch you based stuff o'connell trump has treated his allies and cabinet members he would be picked number three for me to to be caught in a trust
i could just see him walking away i also the people really trust mitch mcconnell but if we're just going on strength here you want the guy that sky like the six pack that you mentioned and strength you actually do you want the guy that's made like fitness a priority because you know that he's going to like any like still when he's like i got this i'm going to catch you yeah ok
so paul ryan to mitch mcconnell three donald trump that's our power rankings trust for interests while he has fire okay and i think that's a great point to take a quick break will come back

we are back as we said it is an even number year it is a midterm election year and much just start by looking at the big picture historic picture and this is generally not great news for president trump and republicans because why marge no matter who you are in your second year as president there
it's a good chance your party is going to lose seats if you are not popular there is an even greater chance your party is going to lose seats
so what all do you think about when you think about is this going to be a good you're a bad year for the incumbent party in a midterm so i think the most important thing to remember out about them mid term's especially in the modern era as they are essentially a referendum on the president it's your first chance to cast a federal vote since the president's been in office so one of
the most important things that people look at is what does the president's approval rating and right now president trump is going into an election year with an approval rating that hovers in the high thirty's i think it's around thirty eight percent right now
oftentimes they say they use forty five percent as the bar for over under on how well you do if the president's of polling about forty five percent the losses tend to be less severe than the deeper you go under forty five percent it tends to get pretty ugly and actually in two thousand and ten president obama was just around forty five percent and he lost sixty
three seats so in sixteen of the last eighteen mid term elections the president and power has lost seats in the midterm election one of the most notable in recent exceptions to that was george w bush and that was after nine eleven so you've got that in another number that we've been hearing a lot about lately is the what
be generic ballot number and why don't we have just explain what that is to start with tam can you walk us through the so that is like a pollster calls you up and says are you more inclined to vote for a republican or democrat it's not are you more inclined to vote for your representative it is do you ah
republican in the congressional seat or do you want a democrat in the seat because it is not looking good for republicans on that front either we're talking about consistent double digit lead for democrats on that and over the last month it was something like fifteen point eighteen point advantages for democrats and the other thing that i would just point to and
we've said this time and time again that special elections are not necessarily indicators of anything or they are they are special for a reason and there they can be out layers but there has been sort of a pattern in in almost all of this special elections in two thousand and seventeen which is dead the a democrat
it's outperformed significantly hillary clinton in the special elections and the republicans significantly underperformed donald trump
now that doesn't mean in most of those raises the republican one anyway because they were safe republican seats but if you were to sort of extrapolate that out that enthusiasm the democrats showed no lot of these races to see to with narrower republican majorities then things get interesting into any eighteen especially when you to talk about those generic
numbers that you brought up scotty in the polls that have them if if the polls are actually in the polls hold and you're talking about a generic advantages of fifteen eighteen points those are not wave numbers or tsunami numbers i mean that those are numbers that should scare speaker paul ryan and the he should be thinking about that number when he goes to bed at night if they hold obviously we're going to say this
yeah but it's still really early but the signs that we're seeing the tremors that we're seeing are potentially very encouraging good factors for democrats to have a good men term but there are a couple asterisk and course i feel like last time i said asterisk risks i got yelled at a lot by the internet so how did you say it as direct now i actually don't remember when someone or
let us know caviar it's just a cat and some caveats here play it safe one is that when you're talking about the generic ballot number there is not a national congressional election of course the seats are divided into districts and the districts do not exactly reflect the the populace they lean republican because republicans by a march were the ones drawing
i'm ten years ago so they've got that in their favor republicans do the other thing is that the one other thing you tend to look at is the economy the unemployment ramp and by mars that doing really well lately it's been doing really well and i also think you're going to hear a lot and we saw a lot of of russia these news stories before the holiday and i think republicans are going to do
their part to make sure every voter is aware of them going into the mid terms is not only that the economy is doing well but that after they pass their tax legislation this wave of stories about companies giving bonuses or raising wages are doing things like dan and i think that they're trying to make an argument going into them in terms that you are better off
because republicans are in control you're going to have more money in your wallet your wages are going to go out whether that's a compelling argument or not i don't know but that is that is the ground that republicans would like to be fighting the twenty and ten terms tam how much is the white house as president trump planning on actively campaigning and how much do the republicans in the tougher
aces want to be campaigning with him i think that remains an open question and something that they are trying to figure out i mean if you if you look at the way president like in that new york times interview last week or in his tweets perceives his ability to affect candidates fortunes he sees himself
as a kingmaker he sees himself as somebody who can bring you up twenty point even if both of his candidates in the alabama senate race ultimately ended up losing but his perception is that he is the best thing to happen to any possible candidate and why wouldn't everyone want to campaign with him be me like past press
residents in mid term years here thank you but no thank you from people in competitive races and i think the other thing to look at is also what happens with steve bannon or not just steve ban and but what he represents which is this idea of more trump be in outsider away
outsider republicans challenging the the incumbent republicans and do those do those people make it through the primaries do those primaries beat up those republicans and give democrats openings particularly and senate seats were they the map is not really in their favor when democrats favor but
does mitch mcconnell is worst nightmare come true and and you have a bunch of primary challenges i also think in twenty eight thousand in the senate
republicans just have a really strong built in advantage the way the map shakes out this time around they're much more on offense democrats are much more on defense and i think he magically what you're going to be hearing about all of twenty eighteen is these democrats in red states running for reelection and say to the downtown not just one but one big people like joe mansion in west virginia
camp in north dakota and how did democrats navigate this path of trying to run for reelection in places where the president has actually still quite popular yeah and i'm thinking like claire mccaskill in misery also but then on the other side of the ledger looking at nevada for instance where there's a challenger to dean heller and dean heller the republican senator there is
wildly unpopular there's a republican challenger who happens to be someone would like the losing his record in congressional races but still a challenger with a name to arcane in which is familiar to you in l v basketball fans because i think it was his father was the coach at you and l v one race i'm going to be paying attention
to that has absolutely nothing to do with control of the senate but it's still pretty interesting is the primary in the california san race i'm going to be yeah fixing a lot on democratic dynamics over the next year and that is a race where you have dianne feinstein running against to challenger kevin daily own who's the president of the state senate who has really carved out a lie
hash tag resist her persona for himself against someone who's been criticized for trying to be one of those governing lawmakers in the senate trying to reach consensus deals not always coming out with flaming criticism of donald trump so where's the democratic electorate right now it's incredibly one place to watch and sue we also keep waiting for more shoes to drop
on the sexual harassment stuff yeah absolutely i mean that's i think that storyline is going to continue into the midterm election year we have to sitting congressmen one democrat one republican who are facing these allegations who are in the middle of ethics investigations both and said they will not run for reelection but they're not going to leave congress and we know that this month there is
bipartisan legislation being work through that's going to introduce this month the chief sponsor of greg harper he's the chairman of the house administration committee says he'd like to have that bill passed out of the house by the end of the month essentially what it would do is remake the process on capitol hill by which people file sexual harassment complaints and would do things like if a member of congress
is involved in a complaint personally that they'd have to pay any settlement out of their own pocket
there is so are running tally for twenty eight team of the election is a long way off his as of this pod cast one a believe i think we just sit at one time we will probably say three hundred times this year
but let's let's end this shifting from an election that's eleven months away to be consequences of a recent election and that is the fact that this week doug jones will be sworn in as the new senator from alabama
how much of a difference does fifty one forty nine make compared to fifty to forty eight when it comes to the republican democrat breakdown in the summer
when you're talking about majority's this narrow every vote really does count the thing that we said so much in this pod cast in two thousand and seventeen when we're talking about what the senate could do as we said how many times that we all say there is only fifty two republican senators they can only lose two votes and still pass it i mean i don't even italian
i can't even imagine that was the election is a long way off of twenty exactly and the context for that was always that republicans were using a special budget process to try and get through on republican votes alone their bills on health care and taxes this year if you take mitch mcconnell and his word that he wants things to be more bipartisan really to do anyway
bipartisan legislation in the senate or any legislation through the normal legislative process you need sixty votes so the number i think we're going to talk about a lot in twenty eighteen is not in which is the number of democrats for people like mitch mcconnell are going to need to get on board to pass any kind of bipartisan legislation so one other one other number ten maybe you might know
this because you've covered pence such a narrow margin means that my pants is probably going to vote for more tie breaking votes he had six votes last year that was one of the most every first year vice president does anyone know the vice president who holds the record for tie breaking vote in this century dick cheney no not in this country he's a statue you pass them in the capital sometimes
i don't know john c calhoun
renault wanted know that we shouldn't we also know to that there's another new senator this week there and it's yeah lieutenant governor genus months she's a minnesota democrat will be sworn into the seat of former senator al franken one more reminder of the repercussions of the sexual harassment allegation stories that have affected us politics she's close
political ally of democratic governor mark dayton and she is expected to obviously be the appointee for the sea but she is already indicated that she plans to run for the seat in a special election this year to carry out his term and franken resignation was effective today believe he had lingered in the senate after announcing he was going to resign and created some awkward
some some questions about whether he was rethinking that but no as of today al franken no longer than minnesota senator
all right that is a rap for today happy new year other fun fact this is the fourth calendar year with pod cast it now
if it's like a new thing and twenty fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen array happy new year would hold me back on your feet with our second part gas to twenty eight thousand on thursday the meantime you can keep up with all of our coverage on npr dot org on your local public radio station and on the npr one app i'm scott debt relic of congress for npr i'm tammy ricky think

hey there it's the npr politics broadcast year with our weekly roundup of political news president trumps lawyer has since cease and desist letters just the banning and the author and publisher of a forthcoming book fire and theory inside the trump white house prompt in an official white house statement
he said that when fan and lost his job he lost his mind
also with utah sen orrin hatch retiring all eyes are on mitt romney who has already changed his location on twitter from massachusetts to utah
the president's controversial election integrity commission is no more dissolved i'm to hammer keys i cover the white house for npr i'm scott that heroic of congress i'm healthy now i also cover congress and i'm more elias a national political correspondent guess so it is the fourth in it feels like it should be february already this has been
some of them
lot going on
you know there's like yesterday i woke up but i thought this day is going to be it about north korea oh it was not designed more and
end up by evening it's like a them thing there's a lot of meditation books out lately you just have to be calm and present and see which way the news waves going to take cuba and the news wave took us to one steve ban and and one president donald trump and a feud i guess is what has happened
this book from michael wolff called fire in theory isn't even out yet but excerpts came out and then the president released this
very unusual for paragraph statement really just going after steve ban and who was quoted heavily in those excerpts scott tetro you have read every single drop of this way i have read all the things where would you like to start do you want to start with the trump statement do you want to start with what steve band and said do you want to
start with the overall theme of the book length of many directions okay so yeah this is a book by michael wall from was a long time new york media calmness and author and had read a lot of stories about the trump campaign the trump administration early on he is someone who wrote a story in the week or so after the
the election
which is an interesting thing to think about in retrospect receive them and said i view myself as the thomas cromwell of the trump administration
a story arc that kind of fits
oh he was beheaded wasn't he was beheaded yes so so far being blasted by the president is better than being beheaded but both of them at one point were very influential in their realms and this book was seems to be written from the couch in steve bands office because michael walk out on have access to the white house which the white house
has admitted yeah i spent a lot of time there and the result is a book with really eye popping on the record quotes from tons of trump administration staffers not receive ban and katie wall she was number two to rights previous is quoted saying very cutting things about the president many other people as well and will get to
the ban and quotes in a minute but the overarching themes that this book is laying out at least the excerpts that we've seen so far
do fall in line with a lot of other reporting we've seen over the past year and that is that president trump is disengaged from the details of the policy in the white house that he spends a lot of time watching cable news and raging about it and that a lot of his staff can be very critical of him and then times dis respect him i mean
i had reports months ago of of secretary of state rex terrorists in calling trump a blanking moron allegedly and there are many quotes in similar veins throughout this book one of the other things about this is steep ban and this is not the first time steve bannon has been in the media saying critical things some trump and trumps
anger about him and what he's been saying has really been building up remember first he went on sixty minutes to say that firing me was the dumbest political decision and history then he went in vanity fair where i think among other things he said the president wouldn't last his term now he
is in this book saying the president's and narcissus his daughters dumb as a brick and his son took a meeting with russians that he considered treason us and are we getting out of prison is before we get to the bigger picture bannon thing i do think we should say that one other carrier to say when it comes to this book and the stuff in it is that there has been a lot of push back from people quoted in this book
from people in the white house saying a lot of his reporting is just wrong and people have been pointing to the fact that wolf has a reputation as a very lively writer but has he been admitted in some past a profiles that have been dug up that that sometimes the details are not his strong suit but like i said before a lot of the big picture things mere other reports we've seen over
the last year and steve bannon has not been one of the people denying that on some of the push back i'm hearing from people on the hill is that this is part of their overall complain about off the record or background sourcing is that it makes it easier to make claims without having somebody to
go back to you too can corroborate it and know this is a big part of the way a lot of reporting it's done in washington but it is definitely something that is is becoming more and more an issue of debate in this era when a lot of things get background information and gets challenges fake news the crazy thing here is he has full on the ditto
failed conversations sped he is chronicling with quotes quoting people having these conversations so dance what bob woodward does but michael wolff does have the reputation of writing really juicy books not all of his anecdotes can be supported yeah i guess what we're saying it had a little bit of a reputation going in that
different from like from bob were not bob woodward yeah let's let's call it a big grain of salt all right so let's walk through some of the high profile ban and quotes and maybe i'll get bleep tear it could be could be an exciting my on chest yeah so the first thing that got a lot of the attention or comments that first reported in the guardian back
in talking about that infamous june two thousand and sixteen trump tower meeting between donald trump junior paul and jared kushner and this russian intermediary who'd come they're promising damaging information about hillary clinton this is the if you say what it is i love it meeting much discussed on the part guess so here's what them and has to say even if you thought this was not treason as or
unpatriotic or bad
and i happen to think it's all of that you should have called the f b i immediately then he says the chance that don junior did not walk these demos up to his father's office on the twenty sixth floor is zero wait what does a geo it's like a schmuck
well i talk to somebody had great barton said that that to ben and uses this word a lot and it was a typo it's meant to be gym oak all that land text to me and i'm like well i think it's like jamaica that's what yeah so much more is a height so it's something that apparently according to this person or bright but she bent on says a lot so it's like a jumbo
fuck which i think is how you said like
i get like a character yeah okay i anyone to solve so basically he's saying i think the don junior took these guys up to me trump which he's not saying factually huge just saying seems to me that would make sense and that would blow a big hole in how trump world has framed this meeting all long saying president drug knew nothing about it why has continued
to say president trump knew nothing about it yeah and couple other key quotes talking about the muller investigation they're going to crack down junior like an egg on national t v and he also says he realized where this is going this is all about money laundering mahler chose in your prosecutor andrew weisman first and he's a money laundering guy the path to trump there was a self it at their go
goes right through parliament for don junior and jared kushner it's as plain as the hair on your face of those were the first round of key quote that went into the cable news ecosystem and led to that trump response yes which i would like to read just a bit of because it is it his unorthodox you know there have been in the context of what we're used to see
rate even in the context of president trumps twitter feed and even in the context of other white house's who have hated books about their internal workings because every white house gets a book like this they're not like this and every white house hate those books generally okay official statement from the president of the united states
steve ban and has nothing to do with me or my presidency when he was fired he not only lost his job he lost his mind steve was a staffer who worked for me after i had already won the nomination by defeating seventeen candidates often described as the most talented field ever assembled in the republican party now that he's on his own steve is
learning that winning isn't as easy as i make it look steve had very little to do with our historic victory which was delivered by the forgotten men and women of this country
steve had everything to do with the laws of a senate seat in alabama held for more than thirty years by republicans and later claimed that leaking to the media is the only thing that steve ban and does well i have a question about another part of what he said here is so those and also says that steve was really in a one on one meeting with me and my question
not that as i understand from other reporting is that there weren't a whole lot of one on one meetings with trunk to begin with that people didn't want any one other person to be left alone with him unless they have a better source
towards the president's ear is that right is it is that kind of a yes
this direction here yes i think this is this goes under the he doth protest too much category that thing that i the really left out at me in the statement first of all it's length is extraordinary that's what i'm saying he doth protest too much it's way longer than anyone would need to totally crushed like a bug a former
advisor if that's what you wanted to do but at the end he says you know many members of congress and candidates and people are supportive of my make america great again agenda he says they're helping to finally take our country back and build it up rather than simply seeking to burn it all down and when i read that i thought whoa michael wolff and steve ban and have thrown down
trump into the arms of mitch mcconnell because that is that sounded like mitch mcconnell you know his argument against the ban and and of course shortly after that i notice that the mitch mcconnell folks had sent out a not only a email with this statement but also a picture of mitch mcconnell smiling yes and he was a cat that ate the can enter it was a much shared give oh yeah
behind a desk grinning so this is all been son more palace intrigue of the trump white house it's like you know sport but what does this mean big picture what does this mean for their relationship with congress what does this mean for two thousand and eighteen are their political implications of this divorce that may or may not stick with steve
bam and well i think it means that steve van and stock as the leader of the insurrection against the establishment in congress otherwise known as mitch mcconnell has just taken a huge hit kelly ward who was one of his and surgeon candidates who was running in arizona for the scene being vacated by jeff flake
distance herself from steve bannon this is a huge victory for mitch mcconnell the president is allying himself with the establishment nod with the nationalist populist insurrection the steve ban and said that he was going to run all over the country it was going to find people to challenge senate incumbency was going to the criteria he was going to use where people who were not willing
to vote for mitch mcconnell as majority leader but not only did the president just kneecap him or as charlie sykes of conservative commentator said he ran over him on the south lawn and put the car in neutral and ran over him again but he also seems to have lost one of his biggest financial backers rebecca mercer and mitch mcconnell couldn't be happier
he was at his press conferences weekly press conference today he said i'd like to associate myself with what the president had to say about steve ban and mm just want to say when we were describing met earlier i don't think we fall into the just so i would encourage you if you're listening to look it up it was on mitch mcconnell official campaign twitter account which i think his team underscore mich
yes that is his campaign version he has a separate one for his governing what do they believe at majority leader which probably doesn't send as many gifts know can i go back to the the fact checking of how influential than and was when president tromp was driving from location to location during the campaign i would be there who got out of the car after president from steve bannon
when president tramples boarding airforce wander in the first few months of his administration who was walking right behind him steve man and well he does the chairman of the campaign and he was the karl rove and david axelrod of the white house example is the role he played so there's a little bit of reinterpreting history here if he was never that important because that's not true and and was given a position on the national security council
i don't think that that has ever been given to a political advisor before and i'll briefly i mean he was removed but there was one of the many things that happened in two thousand and seventeen that had already like left my mind until your might have been so another reminder of twenty seventeen that we're seeing play out yet again is the trump administration and the president himself doing things and saying things on twitter or information leaking out and then
getting back up here to capitol hill and every single republican saying i don't know what you're talking about or i haven't seen that or i'm just going to shut my mouth and run into an elevator that is the trend of two thousand and seventeen that is not going away in two thousand eighty which is incredible because twenty eight team was supposed to be the golden age for republicans they just had the
incredible victory the dow is a twenty five thousand the economy was doing great and all of a sudden donald trump has made sure to start twenty eight thousand and we've only had a very few days with this huge fight with steve bannon and a bunch of pushing the envelope tweets even for donald trump
so let's get to one of those pushing the envelope tweets this tweet came on the evening of january second it came and then only twenty minutes later he treated about the fake news awards that he was going to do so it was just one of a stream of tweets that seemed to have been in response to something he had seen on fox news there was a segment about this
thing that kim jong own head said about having a nuclear button on his desk so present and trump says i see your nuclear button and hear his tweet north korean leader kim jong un just stated that the nuclear button is on his desk at all times will someone from his depleted and food starved rouge
jean please inform him that i too have a nuclear button but it is much bigger and more powerful than his and my button works exclamation point show that tweet came out and it caused there were a lot of people who were actively worried well because he's talking about nuclear war so like i am
understand where the worry would come from i mean there's been as as were in year three year for depending on when you want started of a world of donald trump tweets oh he just says do on twitter oh you should take it lightly but i mean this as a country with that we have no diplomatic relationship with that we don't know much
about and they don't know much about us and there's very little to go on so when you have the president the united states making comments and jokes about nuclear war nuclear weapons
i think you have a right to be worried the people who know a lot about this are really nervous not only is north korea the number one foreign policy problem on donald trump's plate as this new year starts but as scott just said this is the kind of situation where miscalculations can lead and misunderstandings and miss interpretations can lead to
disaster
what's really interesting
to me is that yes he's threatened fire in theory before for north korea he's flirted with this idea that the north only understands one thing you should talk to them but real things are happening with north korea for instance south korea has decided to take him drunk own up on his offer to talk to them
south korea is nervous about donald trump's bellicose language because in the event of a nuclear war planned or unplanned hundreds of thousands of south koreans would be the first casualties yes there are also thousands of american troops on the peninsula but they would bear the brunt of it and what's really interesting is after prime minister
moon took up the north on their offer of talks donald trump treated again and he said with all of the failed experts weighing in does anyone really believe the talks and dialogue would be going on between north and south korea right now if i wasn't from strong and willing to commit our total night against the north fools but talks are a good thing the south
is pursuing a different strategy than donald trump but he's taking credit for it anyway this also makes me think about the pure politics of this a little bit there are a number of people who have had discomfort with a the way the president makes comments like my button is bigger than your button or the little hands conversation have
particularly evangelical voters don't like that about him they also don't like the big blustery bellicose way of talking about nuclear war and about things that are of grave important and this may come back to the president later on when these people who voted for him on the idea that he was going to be
be a non interventionist and who would toned down when he became president
possibility that this please into the broader rhetoric that has been alienating them one thing that happened today is that president trump spoke with president moon of south korea and they talked about the olympics which you're coming up very soon in south korea and president trump said that they're going to send a high level delegation but the thing that's really notable hear that comes
at the end of the statement from the white house about it is that the two leaders agreed to deep conflict the olympics and our military exercises so that united states and republic of korea forces can focus on ensuring security of the games said they had some exercises planned as i to have regular exercisers that
kim jong un hates and wants to step yes and they have just agreed to employees at least temporarily not do those exercises so that is that is actually a you know a diplomatic decompression so you have the bellicose rhetoric but the actual strategy is being conducted by south korea
you are we're going to take a quick break right now and when we come back long time utah sen orrin hatch is retiring and now all eyes are on a sometimes trump nemesis mitt romney

i'm stacey antics now i'm part of garcia and we are here with a new shell the indicator for planet money on every show we take some number in the news and we dive into it kind of vague idea of get it on npr one or wherever you go on yes
all right we're back and long time youtube republican senator orrin hatch announced this week that he is retiring there have been a bunch of other retirements announced this week to over on the how side and hatches decision to retire comes despite president trumps attempt to persuade him to
run for another term and almost immediately after that announcement from hatch one that mitt romney or probably what mitt romney aid went onto mitt romney's twitter account and change to use location from mitt romney massachusetts to mitt romney utah conveniently met
money does own a home in utah at least one and also is something of like a utah a hero because of the way he saved the winter olympics in two thousand and two we are talking about the olympics a lot and this pod cast and that was cited yes we love the winter olympics can't wait okay so kelsey that situation
is both unsurprising and impact full if that it's possible to be both things he has a little longest serving send are currently in this building but he has some hips hamster glasses that make it illegal oh yeah and he's gotten hits her staffers who are treating fun things for him on his official account but on eyes are and say right
but hatch i mean hatch has fueled speculation about his political future
on his own he has changed his mind publicly several times and there was a lot of talk about his overall physical and general health playing and his decision he has had his physical ailment had become more prominent overtime you should say he's eighty three years old and he has chosen to lead but his decision leaves a
huge void i mean he is the chairman of the finance committee which handles healthcare and taxes and a number of other things
he is one of the most senior people on health education and labor and pensions committee which is a really long way of saying they handled the other entire rest of the healthcare system and he's also really high up at the judiciary committee he is one of these elder statesman types who was also known as a big bipartisan dealmaker and it's a time right now
we're seeing a lot of losses in that apartment we're seeing people who are reliably viewed as republican dealmakers seen that there is just no point in running for reelection in this political environment people like bob quarter of tennessee jeff flake of arizona these are people who you know democrats would turn to when they would want to make a deal and were
president would turn to them to reach out to democrats when they needed people to get on board with you know complicated marginally bipartisan issue and unlike flake and quarter orrin hatch it was very loyal to president drop like set over the top have link the about him especially recently as they were getting this tax
which he carried over the finish line through the senate yeah he was absolutely one of the architects of that legislation
it is a loss that people are not quite sure who will fill that space
and the idea right now is that will be mitt romney but mitt romney does not fulfill that space of being you know the guy who's going to stand by president up and you know in terms of filling a space i have been obsessing about mitt romney taking or and had seat for many months as people here know because he would fill a different kind of space he if
as he is widely expected to do run and win easily he would immediately fill the space being vacated by jeff lake bob quarter he would be automatically the republican in congress with the most stature respected even beloved former presidential
candidate by his party and he would become the center of gravity for the kind of anti trump to the extent that there is that sentiment on capitol hill and a trump republican anti trip republican a lot of democrats for the heads even though right now since the quarter mccain like george w bush and flake kind of
explosions of criticism we've had radio silence from republicans but mitt romney just by being there he doesn't even have to say anything he represents the alternative for the republican party has learned to trump i don't undercut himself when he talked to trump about the secretary of state job there's a criticism
from a lot of people that that when romney went and have that incredibly awkward but amazingly photographed french dinner with pros drug drug frogs legs and immerse it looked like it was in cloud city a lot of people said he undercut all of the very harsh criticism that he had made of trump he seemed to approach it as if i can help this country
especially in an administration where he may have concerns about it i'm happy to have that conversation he apparently talk to hillary clinton before he went and have that meter i also think that that idea put him in a different camp than flake or from a coworker who say they want to push back against the president but they're leaving he saying i want to push back against the present
and i am volunteering to go into the breach and since we're talking about jeff flake he made some news today on all things considered kelsey jeff flake was asked whether he would consider running against president trump and twenty twenty and he said that he wouldn't rule it out
that is by no means and him saying that he will do it but he says that he also said of course that he didn't know that for sure that the president one run again in two thousand and twenty but he says that he don't think than an independent challenge will be coming and he wouldn't be surprised if a republican challenge came but he wouldn't say it will be him he wouldn't say which is the
politician way of answering a question okay let's move on to another thing which is last night the white house announced dead president tromp has dissolved the president's advisory commission on election integrity the president had created it back in may after claiming that he would have won the poppy
miller vote in two thousand and sixteen against hillary clinton if not for all of the millions of illegal votes were cast but then the president and his aides were never able to back that up with any proof whatsoever of widespread voter fraud they created this commission the commission was controversial from the
day it was created yeah and again mostly goes back to the fact that a lot of people viewed this entire commission as nothing more than a way to validate a tweet that there was no evidence for democrats are off the bat and repeated those claims again when this was dissolved said that that the purpose of this was nothing more
this is chuck schumer quote a front to suppress the vote perpetrate dangerous and baseless claims it was ridiculed from one end of the country to the other the fact is this commission never really did that march it was it may realize yeah and it was led by a vice president pants but kansas secretary of state chris coble took the lead on
he is a controversial figure in this world yes a lot of states just refused to hand over the voter data that the commission requested but there were also a lot of lawsuits and it wasn't just lawsuits it was the fact that these lawsuits had gotten to the point where they could credibly ask for information about communications about internal discussion
within the commission and at that point the commission just basically stopped doing any work yeah a lot of states refused to turn over voter data that was requested by the commission including chris kovacs own state so there was that a member of the commission actually sued the commission the whole thing was a mirage
ass and highly highly problematic that the white house in a statement said that not only is the president dissolving it because of these issues but is turning the issue over the over to the department of homeland security to review the commission's initial findings editorial note there were none and to determine the next call
voices of action one interesting thing about having it over in the department of homeland security is that there could be public records request for information about what is being done on this issue
we're going to take one more quick break and when we come back that tide race in virginia for a house of delegates seat has been decided by a drying and also can't let it go

hey sam sanders a happy new year i am popping into plug a new episode of mining pod cast show was called it's been a minute and this week we have a really good conversation with a republican member of the house
this really big swing district in texas and situation kind of represents the challenge a lotta republicans will face in twenty eight yes the president is the titular head of the republican party but he is not the only voice is the loudest voice right now of course he's allowed his voice but guess what i'm also a voice in a wing of the road
public important congressmen and former cia officer will heard check it out it's been a minute where wherever you get your pod cast
we're back and we've got an update on one of the craziest political stories of late republican david yancy has won a seat in virginia house of delegates in a tie breaking draw
will it is
and the way this was drawn why can't they just flip a coin it's so crazy number so they had a more canisters in a ball with the name of candidates and each then they took the first canister out of the ball was the winner than they took the second and show it just to show both candidates were in there
why not just let the coin also how weirdly specific is it to have film canister it's there could be any number of containers but film canisters let's find something that really highlights just how arcane this system is weird i guess our our our concerns here early based on the premise that the best way to to resolve a day
ty election is a fifty fifty chance thing but i don't know what else you can do other than revolt
and it wasn't just a fifty fifty election it would have determined the mature again that has delegates which which which would have been fifty fifty if the democrats had one and is a particularly high stakes in virginia where they had a number of issues that have been thought pretty significantly in recent years and where the democratic governor is and
odds with a republican legislature and so this is not one of the situations where nothing is at stake they possible expansion of medicaid in the state of virginia is one of those things that is at stake though it potentially could still happen will have to wait and see as the president would say if you had strong thoughts on this election and you slept in the internet been
thinking about it
i think that more than anything this this situation points out a reality of our system which is imperfect and is particularly in perfect when it comes to disputed elections and elections where it's a tie or a where there are disputed ballots it's just it just gets a little bit messy
in close races speaking of messy no not messy the fun part of our show it's time for can't let it go and thing that we always do and we talked about things we can't stop thinking about this we politics or otherwise kelsey right i'll go first because mine is about the weather
it is if you are in the east coast are basically anywhere a walk
east of the mississippi i think you are thinking about cold snaps and snow while i can't let go those interview that our local npr stationed to you and you did with peter seiko his the host of the npr shall wait wait don't tell me they called him up to ask him what his advice was for washingtonians about dealing
with the cold because he living in chicago and as we've established before i'm a chicago and and you're all smug about
i don't know if you notice that about iran and me we talk about it sometimes but this idea that there's like a half an inch of snow outside here in dc and people are complaining they are so worried about how they're going to get to work and what they're going to do so you know w a m you called peter say go up and this is what he had to say do not
plain about it
because that's not cool don't walk and go oh my god i can't feel my hands walk him from minus whatever degrees and maybe you've got ice and your beard
first of all grow a beard and then you walk and innovation your beard and are like little briscoe so and then shake your beard so the little snow crystals tinkle on the table in front of you and you will be the coolest i love this i love this because my husband came home yesterday and he was a see it's okay that i still have my b c
facial hair
i mean where the type of people who each own four or five winter coat because we see them as fashion statements so the
i definitely can't let that go can i say two things about that one i heard this live and i was doing dishes and not in a position where i could like touch my radio and change it it went on for so long
great little little too much
i did have a beard for a while and it is a very satisfying feeling when there is snow and your beard and you have an icy crusty snowbird you feel really cool about yourself
i cannot identify the only one who don't speak to that in the pod cast it's a true thing okay i'm going next right after president trump treated about his nuclear button being bigger than kim jong owns nuclear button he then made an announcement that he will be doing a fake news awards
ceremony or a war we're still trying to get the details on exactly what it will be but he will be awarding his fake news awards on monday night well one steven kolb bear saw that is a an invitation to campaign because he wants to win a fake news award
personally i'm excited for the most dishonest and corrupt video awards of the year as we call this the fake is because nothing gives you more credibility than donald trump calling you a liar and i of course don't want to get snob
that's why it's tonight and this is true while i have placed a billboard in times square the failing near times square
purchased a full page
add on my twitter feed
a for your consideration eggs
for me the best part is that bob mondello our film review or is one of the people who was quoted in this campaign literature that steven kobe or has created he is quoted not talking about steven kolb era his show but in fact about the movie dunkirk because why not
right mara
okay just to show you when we talk about can't let it go we really really mean it
lot of weeks ago my can't let it go was roy more his wife kayla more announcing at a rally to refute criticisms that she and her husband were anti semitic she stood up and said news would tell you that we don't care for jews
my tell you all this because i've seen it also i just want to set the record straight while they're here

one of our attorneys is a you and then she let it hang in the air with a little smile on her face it turns out which i thought was an extraordinary moment in the campaign one of our attorneys is a jew not jewish but is a jew and the forward which is in public
nation that has a big jewish audience it's jewish oriented publication went to work to find out who was roy moore's jewish attorney and they came up with someone who fits the description his name is richard jaffe and this is like a month long investigate as he he is someone who defended the more son caleb
wasn't a campaign attorney but he was one of their attorneys but it turns out that richard jaffe is not only a enthusiastic supporter of doug jones who beat really more in that senate race he was on the stage at roy more his victory celebration and he was that his swearing in in the senate this week
that's my can't let ago and i think that sideways well god is on here to talk about hanukkah very specifically use technically over but it is
and i actually have not been able to let this go because it is a song and it has been stuck in my head for a week including throughout the entire taping of this pod cast to be honest with you
and that's not necessarily a great thing as well hear from the song because this is a hanukkah song about a decade ago
by orrin hatch


oh hanukkah
yeah
they had like many older members of the most of whom i think of no retired and likes to write a song and he's per
john ashcroft also wrote songs right and they staying together yes so
the chorus
so

right so had at the request of one of his friends wrote a song it was filmed and this is a music video and i love that the video it's like it's a landed a nice little jewish girl singing this but my belly cut in the album in the studio exactly they're all just kind of awkward list
i or it hatches just like sitting there looking at lyrics fun
but but i listen to this many times a day
he retired
on it

hey this is david cohen north attleboro massachusetts where i'm already know the bomb clone this broadcast was recorded at one ten eastern on monday january eight things may have changed by the time you hear that keep up with all of them peers political coverage and pr dot org on the pier one up
and under local public radio station okay here's the show
there it's the npr politics pod cast president trump spent much of that weekend at camp david with other republican leaders they were there to talk about an agenda for two thousand and eighteen but that was not the headline from the weekend instead we're talking about the fact that president trump is in his words a very
a stable genius trumps defense of his mental state that debate to the forefront will talk about that and we will also yes get to some of the other government news that overshadowed i'm scott metro i cover congress friend the are i'm tamer key think over the white house and i'm holding hundred your correspondent good monday to both of you i suppose
i suppose you could say the tam there's a lot of stuff to talk about from camp david but i want to start with the fact that house speaker paul ryan wore a shirt
then he wore a fleece then he wore a blazer over the fleece slot people so i better yet
i have a thought my thought is we know it was cold there we also know that they were supposed to be on a retreat so paul ryan probably thought he could wear retreat close and then all of a sudden he shows up for this avail and everybody's put on their blazers and their ties and stuff and he's like so take the fleece off i'm pro fleece i'm pro casual blazer mix
but you know
my only thing is just zip the least make it a quarter zip any could have gotten away with it but like the the unzip down to your belly button fleece doesn't work by way of actual explanation wisconsin paul ryan he's from wisconsin and people who is going to learn to dress in layers let's get
let's let's table this conversation and i don't even know where to start on the rest of it
tam why what's just start with this why was present and trump feeling the need in tweets and and statements at a press conference to tell us all that he's a very stable genius who went to the best colleges or college we could go on like set the stage for why this was the thing we're talking about right now there are two reasons that this is a thing one
there's this little book they came out on friday that people have been talking about a little bit overweight people have been talking about it nonstop it is called fire in theory it is written by a man named michael waltz there are lots of questions about this book that we can get into later and we've gotten into before but there was a fox news
news fox and friends segment about that book and in particular about parts of the book where wolf calls into question president trumps stability and sort of ability to do the job of president of the united states
quoting as sometimes by name and sometimes not by name members of the trump administration and then this tweet came very quickly after that segment aired on fox and friends and we should say the book fire and fury did bring a lot of this stuff up but this has been a lingering conversation for a while let's go back
this summer when bob quarter republican from tennessee this is one of the first things that quarter said that was really critical of president trump of course he has said many more critical things of president from but this was bob quarter that summer the president has not yet
not yet and then i'm all in demonstrated ability
nor some of the components
he needs to demonstrate in order to be successful stability incompetent so again this is something that that critics especially democratic critics have been increasingly loud about and we should say it's something when it comes to stability and trumps temperament that was a big part of the two thousand and sixteen campaign
but but ron president from made a decision to defend himself on this front and of course when he does that it becomes all we talk about can you walk us through what specifically trump said this weekend let the record reflect that i am reading the verbatim tweak of our president as noted actually throughout my life my two greatest assets have been
mental stability and being like really smart
crooked hillary clinton also played these cards very hard and as everyone knows went down in flames i went from very all caps successful businessman to top tv star to president of the united states on my first try i think that would qualify as not smart but genius and a very
stable genius had that so he says that this is something he goes on to talk about at the press availability he had a camp david
warning or thinking about sure why did you feel the need to tweet about that
college

what
drew decisions
with
hear
new
into the
there's a broader conversation here and that is a lot of people in the political system and and observers saying the present is not mentally stable and that's a problem because he's the commander in chief it's a serious conversation and it just so happens we have someone here at npr who recently wrote an article
called why mental health is a poor measure of a president seems like a good person to talk to you that is john hamilton and science correspondent john thanks for coming to hang out with us my pleasure
hey so you made a lot of good points and that and let's work through them one at a time one is that there is a lot of skepticism in the professional mental health community about the idea of diagnosing someone based on what you see on tv and what you read on your twitter feed the it's absolutely road
more than skepticism it is considered unethical to do armchair diagnoses a public figures in one of the reasons of course is that if you really going to diagnose somebody with a mental illness you need to have sat down with that person and talk to them for a very long time and there's been sort of a long standing tradition of not doing that
but the in the last six months or so it seems like the mental health community some members of the mental health community have said we're making an exception that's exactly right in fact the professions have stayed out of this since barry goldwater back in the sixties and that was because a number of mental
professionals weighed in on his mental status and it ended up in a lawsuit and it was pretty ugly and so ever since then both the american psychological association and the american psychiatric association have had policies that say you won't do this they in you do point out though that aside from those policies being in place this is kind of a
semi regular conversation or arm chair diagnoses are analysis of a lot of different presidents throughout history bill clinton john kennedy you could go on yeah there seems to be a little less hesitant to talk about previous presidents the current ones and indeed
there was somebody did a study a few years ago that looked at all the presidents up until i think it was nineteen seventy four and concluded that that about forty percent of them a little more than that actually had some sort of diagnose mental disorder so this is not necessarily uncommon this is fascinating because there's been a move in american culture and
in medicine to have parity between mental health and physical health and to and to say that mental health challenges are not a disability that it should be treated just like diabetes or other healthcare problems and yet there's this stigma that exists around mental health and politics politics could be said
to be the last bastion of prejudice on this as so many other subjects but but john and iran you make the point that it's a waste of time and it's unethical to try and diagnose someone based on on your news consumption or based on what they post on the internet there's a real argument that using it as
as an insult are concerned he's mentally ill raises a stigma for people in the mental health community but what is the right approach if you're a policymaker if you're in congress which has the job of oversight and you see the president saying things taking actions that take mental health out of it make you question his approach
watched of the job his seriousness of the job the erratic ness of his behavior well i will say that one of the reasons that people bring up mental health is because they're trying to think of some way to explain his behavior which otherwise is so far outside the presidential context we haven't had a president who communicated in this way and so as a result
just takes so many people by surprise including his own staff it looks erratic and that begs an explanation john you talked to a lot of experts about this what's the best way to think about this and talk about this well
lot of the people in mental health professions say is they say why make this about mental health you can have a president who is completely unfit to be in office yet has no diagnose mental health problems so why make this sort of leap for saying that if somehow you could get a panel that decided he had a disorder
you could put a label on that that would somehow qualify to remove him from office and you talked to a lot of experts but you also talk to people in the mental health community who frankly are kind of insulted by the tone of this conversation walk us through their concerns well understandably this kind of talk is is really pretty disturb
being to people who have mental disorders mental illness
because to them it looks like you're saying if you diagnose me that gives you the right to remove me from my job and that's not a message they think is fair or is when they want to have out in public is there a different way to make that same point that that they would suggest instead of the president is mentally ill
i think they'd say is that the twenty fifth amendment goes to fitness it does not talk about whether you have a diagnosis of a mental illness it talks about whether you are fit for office and i think people in the mental health community would like to keep the conversation on do your words and actions show somebody who is fit to be in that office or
or not
john hamilton thank you very much for talking to us about this her a few minutes my pleasure john's a science correspondent on npr and he wrote a story on this exact topic you can find it online it's why mental health is a poor measure of a president definitely worth reading or listening to as as this conversation continues hope you and your at the park
yeah i did with he's and tam tapping into the thousands of hours of your life that you spent following hillary clinton around in two thousand and sixteen which you know what is not last year anymore also realize that in two thousand and sixteen tam you are there for most of the clinton campaign true
jumps approach to governing trumps stability was a big part of her campaign wasn't it yeah in particular as she made the turn from the primary to the general election began main this very much an issue of the campaign had on talking about present in trumps stability
as she did at the democratic convention imagine if you dare imagine imagine him in the oval office facing a real crisis
a man you can pay with a tweet is not a man we can try now play are
and here we are two years later and a week ago president trump tweet it about nuclear exchange is i mean this is exactly what was she was talking about and you can make the argument she made that argument lot of democrats may have that argument then he was elected president within like a week before the election maybe two weeks before the election she actually had
this campaign event where she brought in a man who worked with nuclear weapons who was one of the people who have the president had said it's time to push the button he would have actually made it happen and i mean talk about dark and grin and and laying out the stakes in the clearest way you possibly can and that event
an ohio hillary clinton lost the state of ohio and handily so wrong again what steps can you take if you're someone in a position of power who is worried about this
or do you just have to accept the fact that america voted present interim president he's president for four years and part of president being president is making these decisions
those things are clearly true he is president he is going to be president for four years unless he is impeached there have been quixotic efforts to have some sort of an impeachment road on the floor of the house near not realistic in any sense perhaps if the democratic party were to recapture control of the house in november of that would be a different conversation but
as things stand now that is the only way that someone could actually interfere with the president's authority unless you do hear people talking about the twenty fifth amendment to the constitution it does have a provision whereby the executive branch with the cooperation of the vice president and the president's cabinet could move to
have in some sense or another strain to or a removal even have a sitting president who was deemed by that group of people to be in some sense unfit but that would be of his own cabinet and vice president so tam as is often the case when trump tweets about something when he
he defends himself in an extended way that becomes the focal point of the conversation but he was responding to the claims that came out of his book over the last week that that's what started this latest wave off and in the book michael wolff says that it's a near universal concern among trump advisors but the
fact is we did have a lot of trump cabinet members trump advisors on the air this weekend same they don't actually do it that way and i guess that's what you would expect them to come in
they they certainly whether they were saying it privately or not lake publicly they're going to go out and support the president which they did in a big way new had steven miller who is an adviser talking on cnn about how president trump as a candidate was totally sharp end they'd they'd find out some new
news item and in twenty minutes he'd have
a whole new section of his speech sketched out and deliver it perfectly you had the cia director mike pump hail out on television as well my observation is that
my dealings with the present on some of the most important issues that the president has to face our as professional and they start for as the american people deserve the presence handling these duties in a way that i'm incredibly proud to be part of his team so last point on all of this let's take the mental health issue out of it because we have to
oct just now about the ways that that can be misleading or troubling but let's just talk about president crumbs approach to the job and it's statements i think the fact is that this book and a ton of other reporting that their continued to be more and more questions and more and more blind quote from advisers making their way and the news at least about trumps approach to the job
about the seriousness he takes of the job and about you know the way he spends his day watching tv and treating as opposed to working all the time
what comes next because this seems to keep being wrapped up and it seems to be a unique point to be in just a year into anyone's presidency so there does appear to be an end this was observed in national review this is a little bit like those comparisons that were made during the campaign of taking donald trump literally
we're taking him seriously
his opponents were trying to take him literally but not seriously where as his supporters took him seriously but did not hold him to the exactitude of every little thing that he said
this is probably true of this wolf book as well there are errors their inconsistency is there are things that don't stand up to fact checking
there is however the possibility that there is an overall cast to what he is saying about white house
book carries with it a certain amount of weight in the media community and certain amount of weight and political community in part because it does not come from nowhere it does not come into an unprepared consciousness everybody has heard clings to this effect before we are going to take a quick break in when we come back we will
talk about the rest of what happened at camp david beyond the unfortunate fleece blazer combination and beyond the conversation about president trumps mental health
each and every morning there are a whole lot of places you can look for news try this instead doubt listen to up first first as the morning news broadcast from npr one tap and ten minutes later you have started the day informed kind up first on the m p r one app and wherever he listened to by gas
right we are back and as we said at the top of the show there was actually a lot of conversation this weekend about policy about what congress is going to spend the rest of the year doing things that are really important and have a big effect on the government of the united states that were of course
was overshadowed by twitter as is often the case but let's walk through first of all what happened at camp david this weekend tam what was interesting to me is that republicans are coming off this big legislative accomplishment passing attacks overhaul but they're not quite sure what they want to do next and it seems like this
can did not fix that problem so last week we speculated about possible trust falls and other team building exercises they could possibly happen at this retreat and in some ways it sounds like that's the biggest thing of what it was not necessarily that they were transpires we have not gotten confirmation on that and we don't think it actually happened but the republican leaders in the president watch to move
together they spend time together and they talked about what they wanted to be on their agenda they didn't come out and say and here is exactly what we've figured out but we got a few clues that some of their priorities may be shifting a little bit so so so for example what is happening with the idea
of poverty reform as paul ryan sometimes cause it or what other people might call welfare reform and where the president has called welfare reform and what before this retreat president trump in the last few weeks of the year was saying as soon as we do taxes to in taxes are down it's on to welfare reform and he'd center that rallies and they'll be big applause at least one
a huge applause
not so much anymore is basically the answer and does that also mean that they will be going after entitlements that people might not consider welfare such as social security and medicare i think social security and medicare are have fallen way off of the agenda and something like food stamps or
or maybe like the temporary assistance for needy families program could still be something that they would consider may be trying to go after but what the president said and he was pushed on it because he didn't bring it up himself which is generally a sign that is not a priority for you what president said was that all of this is going to need to be bipartisan
the remarkable thing about this retreat is that he went in sounding like president trump and he came out largely sounding like mitch mcconnell the senate majority leader on policy and on things like whether he would support challengers to republicans in primaries
suddenly he was he was like it was like all hugs and channeling mitch mcconnell so there's the big picture stuff for the rest of the year that they were talking about that but they were also walking through their approach to a much more short term issue and that's what to do about dhaka it expires in early march but there has been a push on both sides for some sort of fix in the next few weeks
so what did they decide on their approach for doctor also there are a bipartisan negotiations that are underway well underway as we've talked about on the pod cast before president trump in his remarks at this press conference at camp david made very clear that that he's still very much wants his wall that
did he wants to to draw a line on the wall it says that he needs wall funding in order to do a dark effects but nothing is done until it's done
and at the moment the wall could be immovable object don't trump very good at negotiating this kind of thing you insist on exactly what you want until exactly the last minute and then you take something a little less and you say you one and and real sense you would be winning as oh joshi ate in reserves for him in what universe
think it's both
you framed a negotiation
as something that has to be all or nothing you get a little bit less maybe a lot less but then you say you one and you say you got your wall and who's going to actually go down there and inspect who gets build it's going to be less probably than what donald trump wants certainly overnight it will be less and in the meantime both parties would really like to have some sort of solution
to the deferred action for childhood arrivals doctor the dreamers and the framing is important on the democratic side too because democrats all along have said they'd be willing to vote for increased funding for border security beefing up what we already have been do anything that looks like trump getting his way on expanding a wall they're not going to vote for their saying and they will say they didn't
and donald trump will say i got my wall okay so there's other stuff going on to we should say that this meeting with paul ryan and mitch mcconnell came right as trans relationship with his former chief strategist steve ban and totally blew up that's something we talked at extended length about in our thursday round up
but over the course of the weekend steve ban and tried in a little bit of a belated way to walk things back what he said about donald trump junior praise president trump ron is steve ban and if he doesn't make a comeback if he hears off the scene in terms of the conservative movement doesn't make much of an impact or with steve ban and really more hat
than cattle when it came to his influence it may now seem as though he was more than cattle but what it was inevitably was a threat to certain republican incumbents in states where they might have been challenged from their own right if you will challenge by populist conservatives a little bit the way roy more shut down and through strange in alabama with the
help of steam ban and now it's a lot more difficult for them to do that if he has not seen as being kind of out of the white house wing man for president trump that was the true source of his power the other source of power aligned with donald trump was the money that he was getting from the mercer family that's robert mercer and his daughter rebecca
they seem to have cut him loose at this moment at least temporarily as you say if he does not get that source of funding back or a substitute for it he's not really in a position to run a lot of candidates in those red states that are reelecting a republican senator this year to threatened that republican incumbent last question about
this retreat
historically some big pieces of legislation has passed and even numbered years and midterm election years obama care is a great example but that's something that had been worked on for much of the preceding year historically if you don't have an agenda going into the second year of a congressional term if you don't have stuff you're already working on does much tend to her
happen in it know historically the second year of a congressional session the even numbered year as you say is about the election and so people don't want to take on something like entitlements social security and medicare people probably don't even want to take on popular programs that might be called welfare by some people one of the things we would
spec them to do would be to not show the government on on january nineteenth so some sort of a negotiation there between the dreamers to the doctor the different action and poor childhood arrivals program and donald trump's wall on southern border those kinds of things we do expect to see but some big new initiative and that kind of the president has talked
about maybe not so likely in an election year i went effect about one more really important thing that happened this weekend and that thing is oprah
let's let's first well let's take a listen oprah winfrey one the cecil be demille lifetime achievement award at the golden globes last night and she went up on stage and gave a barn burner of a speech
interviewed in portrayed people who have withstood some of the ugliest things like can throw at you but the one quality all of them seem to share is an ability to maintain hope for a bright and morning
even during our darkest nights so i want all the girls watching here and now to know that a new day is on the horizon
in a world where donald trump is president of the united states we have to take the possibility of oprah winfrey running for president of the united states seriously just in general but she got all this buzz last night she has been mentioned as some sort of outsider candidate before and her partner steadman tells the l a times last night it's up to the people
she would absolutely do it
in the world of power rankings of who would or would not run for president how seriously would you have to think about oprah for president
as seriously issue that if she decides she really wants it really wants to get into it really wants to try to put something together she would be obviously a highly unconventional candidate but s has says for itself as speaks its own name the comparison to donald trump is going to be very hard to avoid he had a car
kind of celebrity that no other person running for president in two thousand and sixteen hand and osha with oprah winfrey very hard to imagine anyone else eclipsing her in that regard in the democratic field or as an independent and any other way that she might choose to do it so if she really means to do this and she's been highly ambivalent about and to put it mildly if she really means to do this
then i believe we will be talking a great deal about oprah winfrey time she has a lot of favors to cash in with among other people president and michelle obama she was a very big endorsement for a candidate obama in two thousand and eight and her endorsement was was significant that she came out and sort of made it
okay for people to support barack obama and and i think that she does raise this other idea and talking about obama races this other idea that you know we've had now two presidents elected in a row who do not have what you would traditionally consider their resume of someone being alive
president president obama came in after he was running for president after he'd only been senator for two years that is not very long and in america likes president trump and and it is an interesting concept that the the reaction to trump would be to run to another celebrity
and oprah is not the only person who's been discussed you also have like mark zuckerberg a facebook or mark cuban from shark tank and the and the dallas mavericks
about iraq that child remember running away and then as are ignoring the rock but there's a broader i mean you can make the pendulum argument of of there would be a really compelling argument for someone with a lot of government experience of the steady hand but you know what can you make a point that we elected to people in a row without the traditional experience they've also
so if you go through the list of presidential losers most of them actually did have the on paper resume experience to be president and found that used against them will invariably john kerry an election and
voted for romney year
yeah so the point is it's going to be very unknown next couple of years and i guess that's why among other things we pod cast multiple times a week to translate it
going to end on that will be back in your feet thursday in the meantime you can catch our coverage on npr dot org on your local public radio station and on the npr one app there are still a few tickets available for the live show were doing up a warner theater on january eighteenth in go to npr presents or to check that
yeah i'm scott that heroic effort congress for npr i'm tamer keith the white house and i'm ron hoving editor correspondent thank you for listening to the npr politics part

yeah


hey world this is justin from red check productions coming to you from pop culture trivia night at tapestry brewing in purge been michigan

this pod cast was recorded at one fifty three pm on thursday february we made into february first things may have changed when time year this keep up with npr political coverage it npr that or the npr app or your local npr station okay here's the show
hey there each the npr politics five cast here with our weekly roundup of political news stand off between the f b i and the white house over the public release of a classified memo we haven't read it but it purports to be about f b i surveillance and missteps in the russian investigation prison
trump once released that the guy says it has quote grave concerns plus congressional retirements a fatal train accident on the way to a republican retreat and in case you didn't notice peace love and understanding have not broken out since the state of the union address earlier this week i'm tamer keats i covered the white house for npr
and lucas like over the justice department and danielle coach slaven political reporter on kelsey is now like of congress and i'm ron hundred or correspondent and kelsey enron are currently sharing a microphone in this clown car of a studio there are so many of
we just don't have microphones role of them so that is that and that is because we have ryan here in the studio at least for the first half of the pod cast to update us on the memo the hash tag memo memo good memo released the memo memo memo okay let's explain what this is this is a
not secret because everybody's talking about it he knows that it exists
yes vote at this point yes it is classified it was created by republicans on the house intelligence committee or there was it was drawn up by the chairman of the host intelligence committee a republican by the name of the newness as well as his staff we don't know exactly what's in it yet because it has not been released
remains classified but from talking to people who have reddit what we know is that it alleges beyond the department of justice
abuse their surveillance powers in the early days of the russian investigation purportedly deals with surveillance on quarter page who was a foreign policy advisor for the trunk campaign
basically saying that the f b i leaned on material in the infamous trump russia dossier to get court approval to conduct the surveillance on quarter page that's what it purportedly says we'll find out once it's actually released and depending on who you ask it is either highly damaging
or it is a nothing burger what does the f b i said about it well the f b i
put out a statement
on wednesday that was really pretty stunning and in many ways that came out and said that they have grave concerns about the memo they have concerns about factual inaccuracies i could be misleading
lead to improper interpretations of what actually went down it's rare that you get enough be coming out so strongly against something that the president himself has made clear he wants to have come out now the justice department did come out before them it came out several days earlier and said that it that releasing the memo would be extraordinarily reckless
endangered national security ongoing investigations so you have the justice department and the f b i both same do not let this see the light of day and the white house signaling that we want this out there without having seen the memo do we have any clear sense at all of specifically what the f b i is concerned about
what type of thing the f b i is concerned about we do not we do not specifically they do not get into
details with it was to paragraph statement
it was an unsigned statement from the f b i part of the concern when you talk to to former officials i talk to a couple last night is that in a memo like this it's difficult for the f b i to counter because to present counter arguments you would have to reveal classified information which is something that the f b i is loath to do so it puts them
in this sort of impossible situation of well we don't think it's right but we can't tell you why it's not right and what do we do well the thing is politicians notice you will often hear from national security folks that when they go into hearings they will be berated by by members of congress who will come up with theories about
y z and people at the f b d o j
basically can't count of these arguments they just say well we can't come an ongoing investigations are we can't say that there's an investigation or not could we at least hypothesize maybe looking at and different set of circumstances and another time as to what it would be in a memo like this that would compromise confidential information is it the revealing of sources
his have been we're talking about who we are we reading out somebody somewhere has been helping me feel there's there's always the concern about exposing sources and methods
eventually compromising an ongoing investigation and obviously something that the intelligence community is deeply concerned about and always is would be sources and methods of how they conduct investigations and how they attain intelligence can information
they have and leans heavily on the sources and methods thing talking to a former f the official last night who said he feels that it's largely concerns about being able to push back on what they see as this kind of misleading narrative that concocted in the allegedly concocted in the memo that there could be areas of a mission
exactly and earlier today on morning edition the former cia director michael hayden was interviewed by some of our colleagues and he talked about some of this stuff seeger let's let's hear it from one of the experts let let's i of it the bureau and the broader department of justice has been very vocal and very public which is very hard for career
professionals to do and then there are going back pushing back on on three tracks number one that you really can't do this without revealing critical sources and methods
the second is that you are injecting politics into a process that should have no politics attached and so you're setting up a a horrible
horrible precedent year and then finally they simply saying that the memo itself is so cherry picked evidence available out there that it leads to a faulty conclusion i want to talk about politics and because enron i'd like to get your perspective on this to this does not seem normal in the normal
of course of things that every time i've ever seen the intelligence community and and the executive branch involved in something it has been that the executive branch is working in tandem with the intelligence community to try to prevent something from being really started to trying to protect sources and methods and this time you
you have the f b i and the justice department on one side and you have the white house and the president on the other side that's right you're scrambling the branches in the usual warfare and putting people on different sides if you look at the basics of the f b i and the justice department
i very much part of the executive branch they are not the creatures of congress but what we have here is elements of congress that are determined to defend the president against what they see as elements of the executive branch who are not loyal to the president but are loyal to themselves do something that is sometimes characterized as the deep south
state that is to say the government as it exists irrespective of who has just won an election the people who are the professionals the people we count on to be there whoever wins the election in the military the intelligence services the law enforcement people and what we have here is a very aggressive characterization of those professionals as being
actually politically motivated and in some sense or another devoted to torpedoing donald trump
and now you have the chairman of the house intelligence committee devon nunez responding to the f b i saying well of course they would push back on this
it's pretty difficult to argue with known as if you believe that newness is correct in that there is a conspiracy by the so called deep state then is it that much of a jump to believe that the f b i and the deal are going to push back against allegation that they abuse or surveillance powers to target the trump camping so like the f b i can't win know speaking of republican push back on this
one other thing that i think maybe they're kelsey orion can answer for me is you know
i saw paul ryan saying the following this is a completely separate matter from bob mahler's investigation and his investigation to be allowed to take its course now as a person who does not cover this and is not neck deep in all of this can you explain to me like what kind of a line is he drying there and watch what should i make of that well he's not the only one who is drawing on that loan i spoke with
conway who's basically taken over the russian investigation for the republicans on the house intelligence committee wants newness had stepped side because of an ethics investigation that's a whole other tangent
no longer really stepping aside at all but the let's get back but back to the question of how this does or does not relate to the mother investigation certainly republicans are trying to say this doesn't have anything to do with the murder investigation we're not trying to hamstring it this is merely about a legit abuses by the f b i n d o j and that's something that isn't
the interests of the american people to learn more about to make sure that it doesn't happen again the problem with that reason mean is this does tie directly back into the mother investigation because it alleges that the foundation of the russia investigation is off is wrong it was it was unfairly concocted and is basically
i to try to bring the president down the foundation being the steel does the in the steel dossier which was funded by democrats in there for this is all part of a political hit job we don't actually know that any clear we ran and there's a lot of evidence out there that there was an additional evidence like a lot of it beyond the steel that's absolutely in part
the issue with the the allegations that republicans are making about the surveillance this ties into something known as far as a surveillance and this would be surveilling people in the us
maybe believe to be the subject of a of a foreign power but the thing is when you apply for a pfizer want to conduct surveillance
it is a painstaking process current and former officials say to get this done it's not like you just go to the court and say hey we wanted conduct surveillance on this an individual and they go done know it has a long process that involves many many people former f b i folks say that there are various layers of oversight to make sure within the bureau before you get to the o j
to make sure that this is all above board
and then you get it to the court sometimes the applications are fifty sixty seventy pages long and you have to prove to the court that there's probable cause to believe that this individual may be acting as an agent of a foreign power so basically this is a long way of saying that in order to get approval from the court to conduct surveillance on someone like quarter page
it wouldn't just be the dossier that's it in it would be part of a very kind of expensive bit of documentation to justify it and this is something that republicans in general are trying to do is they're trying to parse the team things and there a lot of people out there who don't understand those distinctions i don't understand those differences and speaker ryan has tried to kind of
say well i've you these things separately what this is not is an indictment on or institutions of our justice system this family's not indictment of the f b i have an armored justice
it does not impugn the muller investigation or the deputy attorney general
what it is is the congress is legitimate function of oversight to make sure that the pfizer process is being used correctly and that if it wasn't being used correctly that needs to come to light and people need to be held accountable so that we do not have problems and again because this does in fact our civil liberties
and voters who don't know a lot about it will listen to that and will understand that i think that there's also are normal give him the benefit of the out but then there are also counting on lots of people can fleeting it all right and it's important to have some context to this is matt ryan has tried to stay back from this as much as he can except for the fact
he has a close relationship with data nunez they work together on a lot of budget issues they were close on the tax writing ways and means committee
ryan has been a supporter of nunez in the past and so he isn't a very strange position here where he is in charge of the chairman of these committees he could say that this person's to step down as we saw today and democrats minority leader nancy pelosi and leader in the senate chuck schumer are saying that
you know that devon nunez should be out and that's a call that ryan could make and he is in a very tough place but i wonder what do you think about these democrats saying that nunez should be gone you think that means anything i think that it's political signaling but i don't think there's any chance that ryan's going to do it
if democrats lose nothing by calling for for nunez to step aside but as you said ryan has been close with with news for a while and he has signalled ryan has signalled that he is going to back us in this fight he backed them when the director of the f b i and the deputy attorney general rather rosenstein
came up
to push back against requests for documents involved in this investigation and ryan stood behind unison said no you have to provide these and we should mention that last year
newness started the year as the chairman of the house intelligence committee and he was looking into all this and then there was an incident in march where he produced some information that he said well this ought to be adventurous to the white house i'm going to tell them about this and it was related to all of these same manner said we've been talking about and it came to light that he had gotten that information by going to the
white house he got the information from the way things out the information from the white house and then proclaimed that he had obtain this information and said he was going to report on it to the white house all of which caused him to have to step back for a period of time recuse himself from the entire investigation and a lot of people had thought that he was still recused but him cause he has
resurfaced because among people paul ryan decided that that would be okay so the responsibility for devon newness and his role in all this at this point is rather squarely in the speakers and democrats will so that newness never really stepped back because he's still held subpoena power
with the russian investigation he was not running a day to day but he could determine who would come in and who had no and that is something that we heard them talk about a lot let's do after he had been removed and had stepped aside democrats were constantly saying that they firmly believe that nunez was heavily involved and let's just say also devon nunez was on the transition team for president
he is one of the members of congress who is most low i mean there are a lot of people who are in congress who were loyal the present and trump he is very very loyal to present and trump this memo it's not out yet there was some thought that it would be out by now we had sources telling us that it would be out by now
and can just walk through the process this is such a confusing process
as a classified memo
using some sort of arcane the house rule i've never never even knew existed that actually members of the committee will say that they've never used before so what this basically transpired is
the committee voted on this memo on monday to release it to the public that the nona purely part on an purely party line vote that sends it to the white house and the president has five days to either give it a thumbs up thumbs down if he gives it a thumbs down then goes back to the house the coming
can kick it to the full house and a full house can vote on whether to release it basically overrule the president now that looks unlikely to happen because the president and the white house of certainly signal that they are in favor of release him as i'm pretty sure he said one hundred percent that he did indeed he was cut on a on a hot mike
said the union same at one of our editor said what did he say that they ship has sailed off the map it most certainly has the i have another question in this is i know smaller potatoes compared to the republican memo but there's a democrat memo apparently as well right like what do we know about that that's an important point the don't cry
prepare to memo to counter essentially rebut all of the points in the republican memo it's about ten pages long they brought it up for a vote on monday in the same meeting where they voted to release the republican memo on a street party line vote it was shut down they are not releasing it to the public right now they are allowing the full house to see it republicans say that they will then
hello a new vote on releasing the democratic memo but what democrats countered by saying is a look what you're allowing happiness to have the republican memo at first that will set the narrative around this question and then a week ten days later the democratic counterpoint to will will come up by that point the republican narrative will be set in
the minds of the american people so a lot of this is really a typical because when a committee issues and report like this we often see and majority report and minority report and then the agency involved gets you issue their own side of things and in this case we're only seeing a majority report and they're there people who are criticizing the process for not providing the full breath
that information and one thing that that people within the legal community m f b r d o j will say is that there is already an inspector general investigation into all of these matters and that is the proper venue for this to be done
unless the reason we're not doing regular word ruin reason we are doing irregular order if you will is because there is a larger met a purpose here and that we are laying the groundwork for the president to justify removing some people from office who he has a problem with and now in pa
possibly include raw rosenstein who appointed robert more to do his investigation is currently the deputy attorney general but he's in charge of that investigation because jeff sessions the attorney general recused himself because he had been part of the trump campaign and it could also include christopher ray who was appointed the of the director
after president trump fired james call me so that's a lot of names i understand and it gets confusing and it's kind of a welter of names but all of these people are in some sense or another
in the cross hairs because they have been at odds with the president and what we see happening now looks to the president's critics as some kind of pretend to being set up for the president to remove all of these people who have been in his mind be doubling in and those critics are not just democrats
the grid
there are there are republican there are lots of people who are very worried about this absolutely and there are a number of people who believe that and paul ryan said earlier this week that rosenstein should remain in the job he should
been doing his work as it needs to be done and he should be left alone
so the top of this we i sort of joked about hash tag released the memo
but is that part of this story
yes
there are certainly groups that monitor online activities by russian bought one is called the alliance for securing democracy which is based in dc and they say that russian bought have been pushing the hash tag release the memo campaign
he's helped drive the conversation on line certainly hasn't been the only thing driving this conversation i mean i a lot of coverage on rattling media sean hannity has been pushing that's pretty hard as i understand that but yes but it's also been a conversation that spent on c n n m s n b c
kind of consumed washington over the past two weeks but yes the russian boats have played into this and you know that
not the first time that they've kind of pushed a conversation along in the us political room end again it's kind of wild that this is all our maybe it's not wild at all it's very partisan this has turned into something of a partisan food side which it leads to all of them you know the usual like well he said
and then he said and then it's just a big money mess and everybody is talking about what did the f b i do wrong
and this is why it's been very effective for republicans to bring this memo to the public which is it one we're not talking about mothers investigation or talking about a legit possible abuses by the f b i and the justice department in the russia investigation
and also kind of laying the foundations for sewing doubts raising questions about any conclusions that special counsel covered mother may come to in the russian investigation and any conclusions that the congressional committees may come to in their investigations and this does not happen in a vacuum
president trump four months literally months has been beating up on the intelligence community beating up on the f b i and calling all russia investigations a great big hoax and which are one of our human players needs to leave the studio and go keep reporting so ryan lucas
thank you for being with this thank you for having me always a pleasure goodbye
we will miss you got a good work
and in the meantime we will be right back to talk about congress and stuff

this is ken jennings from jeopardy this is john rocker from the ban the long winters twice a week we're adding a new entry to the omnibus a time capsule for the future when we preserve fascinating stories from my we don't wait for the apocalypse checkout omnibus today
we are back it has been two days since the state of the union it was relatively quiet two days on twitter from present and trump until this morning and although the state of the union address was billed as this thing that was going to create unity and bipartisanship moving forward
it seems pretty clear at this point that weather was the intended result or not it is certainly not what actually happened and what has resulted today president trump is speaking at the annual retreat of congressional republicans and this is what he said about democrats and when i made that statement the other night
there was zero movement from the democrats they set their stone cold no smile no applause you would have thought that on that when they would have sort of at least clapped a little bit
which tells you perhaps they'd rather not do well that's your country do great and that's not good that's not good
we have to change that was a direct attack on democrats essentially saying like they don't love america because they hate me and were how are we going to get anywhere
and the reality is that this is a potential problem given some things that are on the calendar ray chelsea he out so just for some calendar awareness we are in a extraordinarily messy moment we are between a government shutdown and a deadline to keep the government open again and congress is scheduled to be
in session for two days before that deadline happens to and a half if we're being generous oh my god i don't even realize we do not have a spending bill released yet
we expect that republicans are going to ask for a spending bill that will go through the end of march democrat i talk to you say they don't support that and will not vote for it they have not voted for the previous several short term spending bills this would be the fifth short term spending bill since president trump picking yes there are conservatives who really don't like this
idea people whose to we call them defense hawks are military hoc say this is extraordinarily bad for the military because they can't make long term investment on short term spending bills and there is just disagreement chaos and a sense that nobody has a map and two well and to two
just sort of give more evidence of trump saying these things about democrats and calendar awareness he treated this morning march fifth is rapidly approaching and the democrats are doing nothing about dhaka they resist blame complain and obstruct and do nothing start pushing nancy pelosi and the dams to work out a doc affects all caps now exclamation we are wrangling at least five different
narratives on every important deadline facing us that as a spending bill that is darker and that also includes the debt limit is coming up in february now those alone would be really difficult things to handle but they need to do all of them in a very short amount of time and i have never i've been covering congress for about eight years which is not the longest time in the world
but i've seen varying levels of agreement and disagreement and i don't think even including the tea party came in i don't think i have seen this much disorganization and distrust and the greatest cities in a sense of the dead limit because while we have not talked about it very much and it has a headache of the topic
it has been accelerated as a deadline and this is when they can't keep pushing off it was in april when it was going to be late march now it looks like early march may even be february because hey the tax cuts mean less revenue especially from corporate tax revenues so as a result we're going to bang up against that that limit and all the extraordinary measures treasury is taking now
our going to be unveiling in a matter of a few weeks for all of our pod cast listeners who have not been following every twist and turn of congress for the past five years
the debt limit the debt limit is a recurring problem it is and it is also becoming one of those very familiar arguments where we talk about each side having their own fact now the can we do explain what the heck it gatlin it is that's part of where the everybody's on facts come from is that the debt limit is allows the government to keep
on borrowing money to pay for every day operations now some sometimes you'll hear and republicans particularly those who oppose increasing the debt limit saying that you don't want to give somebody a credit card this doesn't have anything to do with knew that this is this is just dealing with the finances met him
already occurred and now this is incredibly important because if it is not handled there's a good chance that credit rating agencies were downgrade the value of us bonds and that could be very destabilizing to the us economy right what's scary i mean first of all what's scary is what we could imagine could happen and what is also scary is what we can't imagine will
happened because we can't imagine it and i have flirted with this before us and in twenty eleven the us got its first sovereign debt downgrade and fortunately no chaos happened but good heavens it's not a thing we want to experiment with and actually into any eleven there was a fair amount of damage done yet the mortgage for quite a god
and it was the worst year of the markets have had a number of years certain missions two thousand and eight and there it was largely a consequence of that particular failure in washington and to deal with the debt limit and perception in the markets that things were coming unglued
the lovely fell apart
that is true but this time we're at the very very top of a very frothy choppy looking market yes where we're setting new records every day where the dow jones out of the thousand points in two weeks and our major disruption such as the limit could be the occasion for the sell off that a lot of people think has to come sooner or later so for all those people who think
that we now have markets that only go up that's one of those opportunities to learn better there is a lot of anxiety and every phone call that i had made today has been met with somebody who is nervous anxious and has no answer her what's gonna happen next and i'm talking people on republicans democrats house senate there is just a sense that told
know what's coming and that's pretty scary i think for a lot of people on the hill who are used to having some level of understanding about you know yes we run into deadlines but we get things done and that's not always clear anymore
and yet in the midst of all that what is our main focus in washington right now it's a four page memo
people haven't seen yet and that they might not see and that might be completely bogus but that's what we're all focused on and that seems to be with the white house is obsessed with as well as one more way of just stressing how important the debt limit is despite the fact that it could get buried under all of this other and sanity it's just the fact that like global credit markets like one of the
the underlying assumptions is that the you ask pays his debts and it is like that is that is the assumption exactly like that this could be like this could be very very bad it's like that discussion in ghostbusters of crossing that you know out he would want to get into that because that's making a native sale in are you talking about this day facto slip up marshmallow man are you
history crossing the streams i thought that it was very bad that's too silly like really i like this could be so bad
if we smash through the debt ceiling is what i'm trying to be clear we are not hearing anybody say they that there's a chance that they think rows of chance that we will not increase the data limit what we're saying is that they don't have a plan for how to address it and it is rapidly approaching it is possible congress has proven time and again that they can see a rapidly approaching deadline cobbled to go
either a quick solution and move on but as it stands right now on thursday february first we don't have a plan well i suspect we will talk about that a lot more in the weeks ahead one just side note end it was a pretty significant side note is that on the way to this republican retreat in west virginia
yeah a bunch of republican lawmakers were riding on a train i think was like a turn around your isn't as a chartered amtrak there are at this retreat in a white silver springs west virginia
at the green briar resort it's part of every single year both democrats and republicans leave washington for three or four days and they have what they call on issues conference or a policy or tree so they can go through and talk about the year ahead so republicans were headed out to their is when they're trained struck a garbage truck that was obstructing the tracks and one of the people
who was on the truck passed away
it as a result of that that accident there were several more injury as though it appears that some people have been released from the hospital at this point in it was a pretty gruesome scene and it's another case in such a weird twelve months of republican lawmakers all of a sudden finding themselves in the middle of like a trauma see
trying to rescue people are help people senator jeff flake who was also on the scene for the shooting at the baseball practice our last year last year yeah
last year
he had to help then written be one of the first responders in that situation and he again stepped in and was with helping out with this situation there are multiple doctors among the delegation that was on that
and they were involved now
alright so speaking of just like people who are retiring has we got news yesterday right around the time that all of this was happening that a republican congressmen who his name will sound very familiar to a lot of people trade gatti from south carolina he led to the congressional investigation and
been god see the last investigation and bengals you several yeah so he is retiring
and you just add his name to the list stray yeah he's retiring and says he's going back to judicial work with don't know what that means right now there's a lot of speculation
former prosecutor is a former prosecutor he reportedly turn down a job offer from the white house
but yeah we don't know exactly where he's going but he makes number thirty for the thirty fourth republican in the house to decide not to run again that is a record breaking number wait so so what does that mean like as a lady who doesn't cover congress
and some of them had like pretty significant job yes hi so gowdy is unlike a lot of the other chairman who were terminated so republican rules make it so that people can only serve as chairman of committees for short amount of time and by and large one of the only ways to have influence in congress is to be the chairman of the committee
or to be rising towards that now it's it's not uncommon for people to retire once their term women as up as chair but many of these people are retiring without that been the case and most most significant among them would be rotten newsreel inclusion who is the chairman of the house appropriations committee some would say the
prime committee chairmanship of all and perhaps one of the six most important people in congress and he just decided that he had had enough that he was going to leave the seat that he had that his father before him from own suburban new jersey outside of new york city area and he did this with four years left
run as chairman of the most powerful committee in the house in his case it might have something to do with the difficulty of being reelected but in many of these germans cases they would probably be pretty safe to be reelected in november and also critically involved in keeping the government open and funded like that that is the committee that is involved with all of these
spending bill correct one thing i want to add is so our own just taylor has been tracking these retirements and i am looking right now at a table she has made of all of them while i'm thing that stands out here is the overwhelming majority of these seats where are these people are retiring or you know running for senate or doing whatever
leaving the house the overwhelming majority are republican bleeding yes i'm looking at this one is democrat leaning two or even the rest are varying shades of red but there are varying shades of red and states there are varying shades of purple okay and that's an important thing here is that so to answer your earlier question i would say a couple of take always hear things that we should
remember one were thinking about this one i talked to a lot of republicans for a piece couple of weeks ago when this trend was kind of starting about why they were leaving why they thought this was happening one answer is it to them it felt a lot like earlier elections particularly two thousand and six where they had a really bad year where they were beat up on the campaign
trail and then people lost and there are a lot of people who don't want to go through a terrible bruising campaign or a really bad primary and then lose it's a lot of work and it isn't fun or to just end up when after all that and wind up in the minority pretend right edge is also not fun know what being in the minority particularly in the
house is not a fun game
personally have you been very recently in the majority and you are still tumbling down her and there are a number of republicans in the house who do not know what it is like to be in the minority
and there's a real reality check that kind of happens when you have to decide whether you're not go whether or not you're going to run for office again is to look at the prospects for your power because at the end the day in washington power matters that's why people go to washington is to serve it is to get their point across but you can't get your point across
last pass bills and do anything without some power but the part of this i think a take away why this matters is that republicans are nervous and that's something that we should be thinking like that is going to come into play here particularly republicans and the suburbs there is a lot of concerned that there are voters who are just not going to
show up people who are disillusioned people who are not happy with the direction the country is going people who didn't get what they wanted out of this president and in the midterm election after a new president comes into office it is not uncommon for the president's party to lose seats but in this case in particular there is concern
that the president has been so divisive that there could be a pretty dramatic wave and people are nervous as long as we're talking about retirements there's one we would be remiss not mentioning janet yellen fed share had not a member of god not a member of congress pointedly not political that's kind of the job of the fed chair jan
yellen her last day as fed chair is tomorrow friday and it's just something that is worth mentioning one in part because she is arguably
i don't even know if it would be arguable one of the most powerful women ever and i do mean ever like she is in charge of monetary policy in the global economic superpower end the fed chair actually has a lot more power of the economy than say the president of the united states or anyone oh right right
slowly and part of why it's easy to not think about that is because part of what the fed chairs job is to be is to is to not rattle people and just blend into the wallpaper
one and she has had to do that while having the really remarkably difficult job of starting the long process of unwinding these extraordinary measures that the central bank had to undertake posts recession you know multiple rounds of quantitative easing a huge balance sheet it was an unenviable job and your own power
the whole take over after her is going to have to continue that we're going to take one more quick break and when we come back can't let it go
do you love trivia puzzles nerdy games and humor what about interviews with actors musicians and people from all walks of life yeah then join me off your eyes were closed of empires ask me another every week on the b r one app and wherever you listen to by guests
we're back and it is time to the show as we always do with a little levity i hope can't let it go where we all share one thing we can not stop thinking about this week politics or otherwise who wants to go first i'll go because mine is super otherwise
kelsey a rating it gives moto article from yes know from today

the he's a part of a broader bio metric surveillance process there's some talk about ways to surveil chickens also so that you that could be coming down the pike
well i love this so i don't know where chickens i think to start over from scratch
oh rod
run my can't you let go of i'm going to go back to politics if you don't mind the state of the union this year which in many respects and in many people's minds was quite successful the president put out that he was going to call for unity and most of the newspaper headlines and money of the guy runs you saw and told me and said president calls for unity but
i believe this is probably going to go down in history as a monumental missed opportunity for the president in terms of just exactly that because while we did get a lot of headlines that use the word unity
many opportunities to create unity in the speech
we're not taken the president could have come out with something concrete about immigration but instead renewed all of the grinding away at the angriest elements of the immigration debate so there were many opportunities he might even have tried to diffuse some of the tension around the mall or investigation
not that that would necessarily have worked but it would have been atmosphere buckley unifying so there really were not a lot of unifying moments real outreach substitute moments in that speech
so he missed an opportunity or a that was a downer
sorry
no no no that's i mean i mean it wasn't an upper like bovine facial that
it's good contacts but like our air danielle what can you know like i i want to talk to you about heroes today to talk to you about a great american hero that walks among us and his name is scott horsley the i really need new year's super human oh oh no you don't know the depths of it
so before the seat of the union were all sitting around eating our our dinner and i don't remember how this came up but scott horsley starts talking about some story he did twenty five years ago at the member station in san diego
and the story was have no idea yes it was a story about occupation a licensing it was specifically oh your face kelsey it gets better specifically it's a story about exotic dancers needing to be license to do their jobs now class so gorgeous just want to be clear i'm not ready this have to be sophomore because because
i'm not saying that strip clubs are inherently funny know what's funny is scott horsley these magnificent delivery of the story has everything it involve the police sergeant named and paradise
who was in charge of policing the paradise wow no but he was in charge of licensing which meant of course he got to deliver the line would be dancers have to see paradise before customers get to see them
had so you get these the you get the seat of these dances at a class where a very matter of fact policeman is in front of the though

okay is the show
he there it's the npr politics cast here with another special edition the much hyped classified memo put together by republicans on the house intelligence committee is out president trump fully declassified it and in short order it was posted for all to see this
despite quote grave concerns from the f b i and the memo alleges among other things that top officials are both the f b i and justice department used information from a source who they knew was biased against trump to get a warrant for surveillance of a former trump campaign adviser and they didn't tell the court i'm jammer keith i covered the white house
for npr i'm running look like over the justice department and i'm kelsey it's not like our congress
right now we have it we've reddit mine has yellow highlight are all over it
ryan
i attempted to describe what it says but let's just walked through it it's only four pages
three and a half to be generous it's i'm four pieces of its own four pieces of paper so
basically the broad outlines of this have been known for a week two weeks but kind of drill down a bit as to what it says more specifically the allegations in it revolve around a surveillance warrant that was obtained by the f b i against a former trump foreign policy advisor by the name of quarter page a name that has been out in the public for quite some time and
he was former at the time that it was obtained yes although when page exactly left the trump orbit is difficult to say i'm not sure that there's an actual concrete data on that but yes he's by that point he's he's basically basically able to campaign so as as the memo tells it the f b i and justice department relied on the
he'll dossier the trump pressure dossier the dossier that was put together by a former british operative by the name of christopher steal at the behest of a political research firm that was hired by the democratic national committee and the hillary clinton campaign
according to the memo the f b i and justice department use that dossier to get approval from the court to conduct surveillance on page the memo says that the f b i didn't tell the court that the democrats were paying for the dossier that's a big question in this in this memo that it raises the other thing that it says is that the f b i he allegedly left out that the dark
he is author christopher steel dislike trump had told f b i or justice department officials as much and that steel was leaking information to the media that was then used in the f b i surveillance application before the court okay so what republicans who are in favor of this memo coming out said in the white house said is that the
point of this is to look at this this surveillance system and and how the weren't was obtained and whether that system which is largely unseen by the public whether it is operating the way it should be operating
very complicated procedure and i spoke to a a former senior official who used to oversee counterintelligence investigations i spoke to her today
and asked her about the dossier and kind of heard her take on it and there were a couple of things that that stood out and stood up for me and it's up for her and it's the question of the warrant that were granted by the court to conduct surveillance on on quarter page the fact that to get a surveillance weren't under
the of court you have to present a ton of information to the court in order to get approval it's not like you show up with a piece of paper and say this is who we want to conduct surveillance on in the courts as good you're going to go fifty sixty one hundred pages i was told that as many as thirty people at the justice department and f b i will go through this application
for it actually gets presented to record this is not one person who just deals with there's all kinds of own it's a long time it takes a long time it's a very labor intensive process to get done now
the deal with the surveillance on carter page the memo in a sense provides justification for the russia investigation bolsters the case for the russia investigation because it says that the f b i and justice department obtained the warrant from the pfizer court repeatedly these warrants run for ninety days in the case of page they got
it renewed three times in order to get it renewed you have to prove to the court that you are getting intelligence from the surveillance you have to prove that it's pain off so this means that on multiple occasions the f b i and justice department could go to the court and say this is providing us intelligence in our investigation
and possible coordination between the trump campaign and russia and the court saw probable cause to continue this surveillance let me turn some math in hearing you talk about these applications being fifty or one hundred pages long
steel dossier was like thirty pages long so there had to be end the memo the republican memo here is a little wishy washy on this there had to be more than the steel das yeah we don't know what always in the application but what we do know is that the dossier was not the saw part of the application was not the sole justification for the app
occasion and the other thing that's important in this memo that that undermines the narrative that we've heard from republicans and ties back into the question of the broader russia investigation
is the memo says that the f b i was russia investigation began in late july twenty sixteen because of information related to george papadopoulos not quarter page george papadopoulos another foreign policy advisor on the campaign and someone whose name we've heard a lot like a few months ago because he pleaded guilty to lying to the
about his own contacts with russians and is cooperating with the mahler investigation exactly but the memo really makes it seem like aside from this little mention of the papadopoulos thing it really makes it seem like the steel does is the crux of the whole thing is is the centerpiece of
pfizer worried and all of the renewals it does presented case that way remember that the f b i have said that there's a lot of omission in here and that was a lot of the concerns about releasing the memo
you're right the memo certainly does present the case that it is the dossier that is the foundational document of of the investigation and actually it even quotes the forward deputy director of the f b i andrew mccabe it says that he testified before the committee in december of last year that no surveillance warrant would have been sought from the court
without information from the sealed us you can just jump in because that really stood out to me also as like whoa that's a thing and then i tied gosh why didn't i see that testimony and i went and tried to find it and it's because their testimony was behind closed doors so then i tried to
if there was a transcript of that testimony because they don't actually quote mccain testimony they just sort of paraphrase it and there is no transcript that has been released to the public so like we as readers of this memo can't verify whether that is an accurate characterization or not
a senior democratic official with the intelligence committee told me that it makes mischaracterized the testimony but we know we can prove that either
this is something that's that's that holds true in this whole saga of of the memo
it puts the f b i and a very difficult position in that it cannot and i've said this before it cannot fight back because to counter the accusations in the memo would likely require them to reveal classified information and that's something that they are loath to do this is something that a helix we have talked about so many times here where it's that conundrum
an elephant in the dark you don't know what part of the elephant you're touching i mean is there ever a time when we will be able to see the whole elephant are we just going to have to be okay with the fact that we're only at a and see bits and pieces of us
if you're asking about the full russia investigation i doubt that we will ever see the for elephant in terms of the memo and what it is alleging i think that we may learn more from the the democratic response which they have voted on in the committee they wanted to have
democrats wanted to have released in tandem with the memo mother came out today
republican shut that down along party line boats
they say that they will bring it back up for another vote soon so that this can be so that the democratic memo which is purportedly a point by point rebuttal of everything that is in the the republican memo
so that it can be released to the public as well a different view of the elephant a different view of the elephant but still not the whole elephant and as we learned today that has peter paul and does want to see their mental come out at some point in time
we had a statement from his spokesman actually strong saying the speaker is in favor of greater transparency if it is scrubbed to ensure it it does not reveal sources and methods of our intelligence gathering the speaker supports the released at the democrats memo and the white house also put out a statement saying
i'm gonna paraphrase year we hear there's a democratic memo and we are open to reviewing it for sources and methods yeah and as we discussed yesterday's pod if people wanna go back and listen to it typically these to report would have come out at the same time
and
cases like this they would come out at the same time but this is also this is very different than than a traditional report that comes out from the congressional committee this is not a typical congressional committee this is the intelligence committee this committee in theory in the past has worked largely in a non partisan way it certainly would have bumps from time to time
see some see some turbulence but generally the idea would be to set aside partisan concerns to focus on national security and the countries and the country's interests
what this russia investigation has done is largely blow that committee it seems like it's totally scrambled political alliances till and the i'm sitting here swimming in a pile of press releases about this memo
and they came all over the place like this grassley really is in front of me what the headline is investigation should be about fact finding that undermining political adversaries that would be chuck grassley from ohio or who is chairman of the senate judiciary committee as ira yeah so yesterday
our own moralizing heard from sources that president trump had been telling friends that he thought that this memo would undermine robber mahler's special counsel investigation into russian meddling in the election and possible involvement of
trump campaign and also possible obstruction of justice by present and trump or those around him that is of course not the stated purpose of this memo
but it it does seem like that has to have been part of the goal of this memo it's certainly dovetails with a broader campaign that we've seen from republicans over the past couple of months particularly republicans in the house
to raise questions about the integrity of the have to raise questions about a legit political bias on the special councils team in we've seen them really push that line for the past couple of months and folks and the conservative media pundits on fox news in other outlets of certainly pick that up and run
so if the goal if the goal as we have heard through mars reporting is to discredit the investigator to how's that fit in to the investigation i mean is that on the that they will take into account that there was an effort to discredited well it doesn't matter first to step back quickly and so why why it's important that
what discredit in the in the investigation how that helps the president any conclusions that the special councils team comes to in its investigation
would then be up for question if if this is a team full of hillary clinton supporters and democrats than the president's allegation that this is just a witch hunt well that rings true with a lot of people in the american public when we got this memo and i opened it up when i got my highlight and i started reading and then i got to the end and i was like
he wait a second i feel like i've heard basically every thing in year on fox in conservative media and coming from the president's allies in congress for weeks now
it didn't feel like there was a huge surprise well and that's perhaps perhaps that speaks to a degree of over hyping among a lot of republicans on the hill in the house who were talking about this been an epic scandal and bigger than watergate and there were some republicans who are saying
let's not get too carried away with this let's just talk about this and com simple terms but they didn't this was really ginned up as a massive massive scandal and when you look at the three and a half pages in their it follows a little flat a little short of a of a scandal though maybe not surprisingly win
the president was asked about what he thought of what was in this memo today he made it pretty clear that he thinks it's it's troubling i think it's a disgrace what's happening in our country
and when you look at that and you see that and so many other things what's going on
lot of people should be ashamed of themselves and much worse than their earlier this morning and what i considered like a pre game to eat president trump tweet it out the top leadership and investigators of the f b i and the justice department head politicized this sacred investigative process in favor of democrat
and against republicans so basically if you're a person who is inclined to leave the president you're probably going to be the president on this if you're a person is inclined to think that democrats are right about the broader russia investigation you're probably going to agree with democrat on this to this actually move the conversation forward i don't think so no
two points that i want to make about what the president has said today one in the tweet and then a little bit later in the at the white house one this is he has consistently gone after the f b i and the justice department
and there's the russia investigation aspect of this and then there's the potential long term damage to the institutions of the justice department and the f b i and there's a lot of concern among folks from the d o j and the f b or about what this is doing to those two institutions and the fate of the american public housing them this is not a
day by day thing this is something that has long term impact potentially the other thing is that he was asked about deputy attorney general rod rosenstein and rosenstein is the man who is overseeing the russia investigation his supervising it as deputy attorney general because attorney general jeff sessions has had to recuse himself
yeah
figure that one out you figure that went out not a ringing endorsement yes i am a few months ago i with the reporter shouting do you have confidence in rex tellers and the secretary of state and president trump responded firmly quickly absolutely i have confidence in him and guess who is still at this moment secretary of state
eight rex tiller cent now when president trump has been asked about whether he has confidence in michael flynn steve ban in tom price these are all people who are no longer in the administration and in every case he gave sort of a wishy washy like you'll have to see kind of answer an answer
there is much more like what he said about rod rosenstein than what he said about rex tillotson so i checked in with the white house about this with spokesman brian shaw and i was like what did he mean today and rise pointed me back to what sarah sanders the press secretary he said very recently quote when the president know
longer has confidence in someone yell now okay so i don't know that clears it up then
it does he really doesn't clear cleared out no not at all but it definitely leaves that cliff hanger out there well and i think it's important to make clear why rosenstein matters and all of this is because as i said earlier he is supervising special counsel rubber most investigation into the trunk campaign events
possible coordination with russia
and the concern is that the memo and these attacks on the f b i and the justice department will be used as a way to push rosenstein out to allow the white house to potentially put somebody in that position who is more amenable to the white house has concerns about the rush investigation and at that point the star
watching all those people who said that it for as i was pushed out of my was pushed out that that would be a bright red line for them and that they would view that as a serious infection by the president and that's why it's important to remember that there are basically two parallel worlds exist right now you have the criminal muller investigation and then you have the police
local room
and the question in the political realm is what are republicans going to do if it gets to the point that the president is moving against the special counsel or the justice department questions that we will not answer today certainly because we can only see a tiny little piece of the elephant is chris cornell er tale
just don't now

here's the show
it's the npr politics pod cast here with our weekly round up of political news guns are still dominating washington but congress has come and gone this week without taking any major steps toward passing anything president trunk took the gun debate and turned it on it yesterday with another me
made for t the meeting where he agreed with democrats more than republicans and at the end of this week president from finds himself more isolated than ever one of his closest and most trusted aide hope x is stepping down and his son in law jared kushner has lost his top secret security clearance i'm scott debt heroic of congress for npr
i was going to work with the white house and less mythology political reporter and i'm wrong and of your correspondent has everybody doing can i just say i'm very excited to be in a pod cast me to scott study see cleared been in the pod cast which is before that's true yeah because you had left before the to scott era really fully began this is quite novel for me
so i just like this national very honored
this was yet another one of those weeks that i've started to think if we didn't start the fire weeks with there's so many different stories you could just kind of round the whole song now if you wanted to but the main theme this week as it was last week was god's we've been talking a lot lately in the pod casts about guns that about the moment we're in for the shooting at marjorie still
douglas high school in florida whether there's something different going on that might actually lead to policy changes or not and this week felt a bit more like it was in the or not category at least in congress but on the other hand there was one of those off script white house meetings with trumpet lawmakers were once again at least in that
meaning and that is something we will talk about trump sounded more like a democrat or republican i like taking the generally like in this case just impatient
as far as shit
she couldn't lose shit but the goes first go through precious
so i said it sounded more like a democrat but in that moment saying take the guns that's the character of the democratic views or something they push back on but here he is a republican president saying that ended me say this like in response to mike pence his own v p coming out and and suggesting somewhat of a more nuanced stands i mean that sort of amazing
yeah there's a lot here and there's a lot of specific moments and exchanges with democrats than republicans but you know we've done this so many times before where we're kind of standard gawk looking at a live unscripted moment that does not have much president so i think in this conversation let's try and like take a step back and ron just the setting
scripted miss what trump were saying are not saying what stuck out to you about this moment having seen the movie before scott we've seen it a couple of times we saw it back in the fall when the president sat down with quote remember this chuck and nancy
and also a bunch of republican leaders from congress and sided with the two democratic leaders of the house and senate on a raft of issues that the republicans thought he was going to stand firm on and said you know i think we can get a deal on dhaka and we can get that done really quickly check nancy didn't know what to say they were so taken aback and then we saw it again on immigration just a few weeks
oh and the president had another one of these live white house gatherings whole hour live on tv when you've got a bunch of republicans and bunch of democrats and he starts right in insulting some of his own republican members of congress sam to pat toomey of pennsylvania for example you sound like you're afraid of the and our a because you won't raise or the gun age to twenty one
and then and then saying a lot of things that implied for example to dianne feinstein that he might be okay with going back to the assault weapons ban yeah that was the biggest anathema of the last fifty years for the end so this was an astonishing thing but the first two ended with president not doing any of those things that he said he would do in those comp
francis and an act aggressively tanking proposals to do those things the parallel would be as if to me and mansion and chris murphy and john corner and come back to the president and say mr president we did just what you told us we've put together a package deal to have universal background checks we think we can get sixty votes and then trump turn around said okay that's good
but now you got an ad concealed carry and torpedoed it that's that would be what we saw have been on immigration and ran and veto that's right
if they don't what once wasn't one of those moments that ron you mention in i'm on it and what get your thoughts on the whole situation because it's a back and forth with pat toomey who's a republican senator from pennsylvania who right after sandy hook he and joe manage in west virginia democrat put together a background check measure that got more than fifty votes in the center
but not the sixty it needed pat toomey really in that moment put his neck out and was criticized by the and are a and here's what trump says to to me in the cabinet room will
well think the fed
they were doing great people are great
but that doesn't mean we have to
it doesn't make sense that the weight off twenty one thing going to get this it
searchers just curious
we didn't interest think annoying
so awesome a pat to me is one of the republicans who clearly kept trying to keep trump as far away as possible in two thousand and sixteen he never rejected trumps candidacy he tried to do the arms length dance he did end up voting for trumpet he clearly wasn't happy about it but he
like many republicans have made this really uncomfortable peace with the president and where do they get for it they get him insulting him on live television and pushing these policies that republicans disagree with it is in in scotland strikes me so much about what we heard the president say in that meeting is the in some ways it seems like he's speaking to his republican base voters are
what do you mean by that is actually we just pulled recently with abscess on essentially what both republicans and democrats feel around gun policy and the football come out tomorrow but just a glimpse of it is that actually over ninety percent of americans do support mandatory background checks for organ buyers
we're seeing an increasing number of both republicans and democrats calling for stricter gun laws and when i hear the president makes me feel as if he actually understands what the republican voters want any speaking to then perhaps you could argue he's even a little bit maybe more in sync with them then sort of traditional republican
medical officials who do seem very loyal to the energy and who knows where the president's going to be right in terms of the enter a one day he saying that other folks have to sort of in bed with the and hurry but the next day he's talking about in treating about his support for the enter a but i think that we're we're seeing him talk about overall wanting some comprehensive gun reform bill
thanks to the fact that a lot of republican voters at this point also feel that way what exactly they want in it who knows but they want some sort of change and were beginning to see that in polling as well and joe mansion the conservative democrat from a conservative state of west virginia made an interesting point yesterday were
the president was suggesting that the reason to me mansion failed in two thousand and thirteen was the former president obama just didn't try hard enough to push the bill across the finish line president obama put an awful lot of political capital on the line early in his second term to try to get that done and just couldn't imagine said is what's different is trump hands credibility
with gun owners with second amendment supporters with and are a members that barack obama did not and so there is kind of a nixon in to opportunity here though and trump to win some kind of gun safety measure that would have been out of reach with a democrat in the white house the ron it doesn't seem like trump were saying i firmly believe this
specific thing is the solution it seemed like there were a lot of moments where he just wanted to say i stand up to the enter a more than you do more than obama he seemed to have a scattershot approach here jumping on a lot of different proposals arming teachers hardening schools as sites
making sure that this age for long guns is raised to twenty one a number of things by the way that all paul well all paul well and when the president had his television do dog several weeks ago on immigration he was again taking a series of positions that all paul well then the next day he's treating to is
space and even back last fall in the budget issue nobody likes government shutdowns so the president was trying to avoid government shutdown but then in the end didn't do any of the things that he was offering to the democrats so he has a very high sensitivity to the polling results were the american people are he likes to speak to that but then he feels to play
deeply free could turn around the next day and do something utterly different on policy from enron you're so right about how acutely aware he is of a polling rate i mean we've seen sort of widespread support for a whole number of gun control policy suggestions and actually in our poll that's going to come out tomorrow the only gun control policy
that was opposed by a majority of americans is the idea of training teachers to carry guns in schools but would i find so interesting is that is something for which there are clear deep partisan divide and the issue and you do have a majority of republicans supporting that idea so it kind of makes sense that we hear the president speaking out of one side of his mouth that he wants to raise the age they to purchase again
also favors the idea of training teachers it's precisely what we see some voters want the persons report cold water on a related idea to arming teachers though and that's this concealed carry reciprocity bill that has been pushing their number one priority has been a bill that would let someone who has a permit to carry concealed weapon in one state carry in all fifty
states and even though the present himself says he's for that he argued against folding it into this overall bill because he said it would it's chances you couldn't get the votes in the senate i think
maybe some pitch
if you're going to put conceal carry between fit into this pill which talking about all the wall
you know i'm when he would let it be a separate
this conceal carry to this you'll never get
he's right about that so as were all saying it's hard to put too much stock in meetings like this and the question is what comes next right so soon after the meaning chris murphy democrat from connecticut who has been probably the leading democratic voice on on gun measures tweets of the present it just committed to support universal background checks protective orders and
raising the age for rifle purchases if he he's the deal maker he says he is he only has to get a few republican votes to make it all happen republicans came back from this meeting pretty agitated just a couple statements that summon up ben stats from nebraska though i don't know if he was actually enemy me a chance was not the meeting but but but he points out that statement saying i'm going back to that first quote we heard from
we're not getting any constitutional protections simply because the last person the president talked to today doesn't like them
and let's listen to a clip from john corner in texas republican number two republican in the senate who was pretty agitated walking back into the capital

the
and he went on to say it's it's still unclear to me what can actually pass my experiences these things are harder to do than they sound so any sense what happens next i mean osment we've seen what pulls well but there's usually a pretty big gap between what polls well and what happens
today we saw as ryan said the exact same thing with immigration what i will point out there is that maybe this is slightly different and i don't know because we are leading up to a midterm election and the president has remarkably had a really good handle on what his they supporters one and i actually just was
in ohio i spent some time talking to folks who specifically had voted for president obama you know either in two thousand and eight or two thousand and twelve and then chose president trend in twenty sixteen and i connected with former retired elementary school teacher her name is lisa more and some how we ended up talking about guns and she actually had this
about the idea of arming teachers in schools i knew i wouldn't volunteer to be trained with a guy that i know there would be teachers that would cover have them come sign up to see who has to be concealed carry they should have one for each grade level
thain either force and you know and i think they'd be a good idea what strikes me as she's the type of voter who switched over to support donald trump he is very aware of those types of voters wine enzo so add me know he he is going to be talking a lot about it but whether that will actually the lead to any legislative action
i am somewhat skeptical given that we sort of feel like we've seen this movie before when it comes to immigration one last reaction to this that's worth flagging this is lindsay graham kind of acting like the political analyst that he often plays the role of as well in addition to being a senator it's the president has another one of these sessions and he doesn't follow through it's going to hurt him
it's going to hurt the republican party i've seen this movie before it ends up like immigration he's done himself a lot of harm wonder if the audience limbs or grams talking about their though is the millions of people who might have watched the television program but the the one hundred folks on capitol hill who who were actually counting on the president to broker something and whose words
been tested once might not withstand being touted as i can turn so while congress has not made much progress on this there was some action on the corporate side of things you had dick's sporting goods and walmart both making big decisions that said basically will congress may not be raising the age anytime soon
but but that's what we're gonna do yes
dicks which is an enormous sporting goods chain has decided to stop selling a are fifteen that's a change that are other notable walmart which is of course the behemoths of retailing as said that it's not going to sell long guns to people under twenty one we've already seen of course a number of car rental companies and other about number of airlines people saying we don't want to have
counts for the array anymore we don't want to endorse the organization in that fashion they've had some blow back on that as well so this is also being fought out in the courts public opinion and also in the marketplace so we are in a different space in terms of talking about guns post parkland i interviewed chris murphy right before he went to the white house yesterday and i asked him about the dicks
decision it's often the private sector companies that lead congress to make changes so take a look at the fate for marriage equality
it was fortune five hundred companies that decided to treat their employees the same regardless of sexual orientation that finally led state legislatures and the supreme court to make the same decision
so i think it's ridiculous that congress hasn't passed legislation that ninety seven percent of americans support but i do think that this wave of private companies that are standing up to the gun lobby
will ultimately be dispositive the debate we have here in congress like is that a chicken or egg thing to the company's only start to act because public opinion is already shift and i mean end of the opinion that yes they do re the he even gave the example around gay marriage but we began to see public opinion change i mean companies have a financial responsibility to dig into their share
holder's they're they're not gonna be jumping into a hotly debated political issue unless they believe in addition to the moral argument they don't have loads to lose financially yeah i think i think fixes made the calculation that there is more downside risk of being the company that sold a gun to a guy who goes into
a school and shoots a bunch of people them there is the heat that you might get from some one hundred and come in and find the shelves empty of a particular weapon that they were looking for dicks had sold a weapon to nicholas group but it was not one of the weapons that are used in the shooting but that still seems to clearly alarm dicks executives are i were going to take a quick break and when we come back the

okay we are back and the white house confirmed yesterday that communications director whole picks his resigning likely sometime in the next few weeks hicks has been communications director since august but she's been with trump for three years longer than many people at the white house she was a day one campaign staff
you almost never heard from her even read that many quote attributed to her but she's one of comes closest and most trusted aide scott this was a little bit of a surprise like i guess like most things in the trump white house but this this was one of those things that kind of snapped a lot of max when it when it was announced it's always surprising when you see hope picks his name in a news story because she did
good job of staying out of the spotlight until two weeks ago or so but as or murky said on the radio yesterday and she she's been in the spotlight and in the headlines in recent weeks for all the wrong reasons she was being questioned this week by congressional investigators is looking into the russian affair and she acknowledged
doing told white lies for the president although not in relation to to russia before that she was tied up in the whole rob porter scandal she was having a romantic relationship with rob porter help to craft the talking points that were initially used to discuss the staff secretary who was ultimately forced out of the white house with allegations of domestic violence
so the sort of behind the scenes player was under the microscope
even though the white house says this departure was in the works for a long time and not related to those recent events
get all hot for opec's ron depending on your generation communications director is either drummer for spinal tap or defense against the dark arts professor of the trump administration i'm all those generation
what first of all how important is the communications director what is this person do in the typical white house and what does this person done in the trump white house most people think of the spokesperson for the white house that is in this particular case or sanders as being in a sense the real voice of the administration they don't really think
indications director and back through a sequence of communications director is back over many administration's that job has been relatively faceless sometimes we don't even see that person at all and that is what hope he would have preferred she was trying to be behind the scenes and have role in shaping communications policy for the white house deciding with the white house might say about things
but then having somebody else go out front center and actually say them and be on camera that was not a role that she wanted that was not an impact it was a role that she quite actively shunned and throughout the time that she worked for donald trump so this is a moment in which people will ask the question what does a communications director do i think it's varied quite widely from what i've been
illustration to another some of them have been enormously important critical even and an administration but in this particular one it's a title that's been passed on so often
no anthony's caramel g at it for a period of hours and this is something at this administration who knows what the communications director and totally responsible for but even though her public role was was was largely invisible her made the most important role as a security blanket for donald trump with somebody he liked having around she had traveled with him for years
and this is one more way in which this president has kind of losing the close allies who have been around him throughout his short and stormy tenure in the white house and in skype can ask questions
which ones came
got to clarify scott h is came a day after she testified for hours and hours and i understand you're saying that people are saying that this is a predetermined decision but she's also a white house or saying my yeah but she's a cons director and that's when he don't understand is like there's clearly the optics evidence and if field
cons directors jobs they're supposed to be too you know and understand the optics of communication decisions that they make you mean a communications professional might say if i let it be known that i'm quitting the day after i testify between before the house intelligence committee people might connect the dots and think i'm leaving for that reason exactly on the other hand there's probably no great time for the car mr
hector to walk out the door when people won't ask isn't this a bad time isn't this a bad moment when you talk about the president security blanket he had a person who had been his body man for a number of years who is a security person but who also was clearly a confidant of the president somebody who he felt comfortable around his name was key schiller and he is gone
and it has been gone now for a number of months
these are people that the president relies upon to maintain his basically comfort zone and his comfort zone is getting to be quite narrow monday so yeah this week on we also learn the president's son in law and senior adviser slash sometimes shadow secretary of state slash guy who early on was assigned every single job and the white house jared kushner has lost his
top secret security clearance it had been an interim clearance and even now more than a year into his time at the white house coaster still have not been approved for a permanent clearance scott first of all what does this matter that he loses this interim clearance that he has been knocked down to secret how does that affect him in the way he does his job
well it depends on who you talk to the the strokes people for the white house insisted will have very little effect on the jared kushner will still be fully able to carry out his vast and wide ranging duties when you talk to people from previous administrations they say they don't understand how he could possibly for example be in charge of the middle east peace process said
no longer have access to the most sensitive classified information hell no longer for example be able to read the president's daily intelligence briefing which is something he had been able to do under his his interim clearance know can trump just override that on an ad hoc basis if he feels like it he can however he told reporters last week that he wasn't going to do that
if he would he would let his chief of staff john kelly make the decision about what jared kushner got to read and didn't get to read how do you get an interim clearance by the way it because i mean i was an intern man just a lowly intern at the state department some years ago and there's like a pretty lengthy process to get through just even get like a basic clearance for an intern so
i don't fully understand how you get an interim clearance and how that just isn't resolved within a defined amount of time run that was the problem right among many other problems questioner kept not putting all the information he needed into these applications especially when it came to what people from foreign governments had you met with that's right there was delay after
delay and that eventually led to more suspicions and more suspicions and one of the things about this process is that if you push back on the process the process has ways of along gaining itself and seeing your push back as in and of itself a question mark on whether or not you should be getting a final clarence so this was a serious error on the part of the
white house allowing that to happen and it now has reached this pretty point as far as why this really matters and whether or not he can continue his duties let's assume he really had all those duties that he was putative the carrying out the it's called hamilton here i want to be in the rumor and happens you aren't in the room where it happens unless you have full access to all the intel
you simply aren't you might be physically sitting in the physical room but you are not possessed of the information you need to be part of the process can i meant something really embarrassing
i did not listen to hamilton start to finish until like three weeks and they don't have any or heard him on data is if as happened and it costs a lot of money to see a i now when it doesn't cost very much money to hear it and it's really really where i found that it lived up to the hype and it was really like me into two thousand and eighteen to listen to it
that's actually a year behind me i'm and early man who was gonna and i he's listeners but i think i'm really hip and cool
now they be like she'd never listen hell it
get a lot of email now i own an adult link and eleven either what is this a hamlet and thing
so last thing i'm kirschner and then we've gotta move on but cushion or this comes during a week where it just headline after headline that that's pretty damaging be him there's there's headlines about foreign governments trying to target and manipulate him there's headlines about companies giving loans to his family business possibly right after they met with kirschner about official
business his spokesperson is stepping down somebody who'd worked very closely with kirschner and his wife of august so not a good stretch for somebody who's in the pretty close orbit and one of the remaining close orbit people got a lot of that has like pretty serious stuff it's very serious stuff and what was new for example in the washington post reporter
based on intercepts of foreign governments communicating amongst themselves just confirmed what i think a lot of foreign policy professionals
i had been worried about which was the suspicion that jared kushner was in over his head he was giving being given a lot of responsibilities for which he was not prepared and he was not a veiling himself of the all the support and all the experience at the state department and in the foreign policy apparatus he was out there
freelancing while the middle east on china
and that he was ran the risk of stepping in it and also that he ran the risk of serious conflicts of interest because even as he was doing this he was part of a family with deep debts out there trying to raise money to finance various real estate projects and even though cushion head
nominally separated himself from the the family business in most ways it's still the family business and what is thicker than white house disclosure form right to one more quick break we're going to come back or no talk about terrorists and can't let it go

okay were back in one more thing that happened today present trump announced that he's imposing new tariffs on imported steel and aluminum one thousand five percent on steel ten percent on aluminum scott can you explain to us what trump announced today what he didn't quite announced today what we thought
do you might have been announcing today and why all of that matters years he announced plans to raise not lower res terrorists
imported steel and aluminum this is a response to an investigation that it's been going on for them about the last year looking at whether those imports are putting so much downward pressure on the domestic steel and aluminum industries that they could go out of business and jeopardize national security and so
commerce department recommended that he raised not lower rain on
got a pair of
showbiz this is choice but to tend to you the flavor this and the congress were mentally that sort of several options
a combination of tariffs are quote is to to try to curtail steel imported steel and aluminum the dow jones as as we record this is off five hundred sixteen points as the stock market anticipates the likely retaliation from trading partners and the potential for a mini trade war here so this isn't this is a controversial move certainly
in the economic world it's also controversial within the white house there was there was a lot of tug of war within the white house and so much so it didn't appear that trump was actually supposed to make this announcement today he didn't actually have an order ready to sign he said i'm going to order this the next week
maybe you will but that that at least hints at the possibility that maybe there's still a little tug of war and there have been times when the president's announced that he's going to do something only did not actually do it so we'll see if these materializes but it's a it's a pretty major market moving economic move that the president has taken here in defense of the domestic steel and aluminum indeed
trees but one which could have negative rebound effects on both businesses that use steel and aluminum what you're going to pay higher prices but also other companies that want to export to other countries and other countries have already said they're prepared to retaliate in a pretty politically targeted way for example going after kentucky bourbon a major industry
in the home state of senate majority leader mitch mcconnell or wisconsin cheese maybe that same at the house bigger and as or a florida orange juice and important swing state that going to have a senate race in the upcoming midterms so the the the rest
the world will also have a say in this but but the congress will not know this
the president acting under existing legal authority he doesn't need a congressional vote on and it was also widely reported that this morning both gary coleman who's supposed to be the number one economic advisor and the president and also steve minutiae who is in the treasury secretary and also a major and guys are on economic policy to the president had both strongly in aid against these tariffs
kind of like how the defense secretary and secretary of state where both strongly against undoing their own deal that's right and they're very upset about other countries being upset about these tariffs as well so you've got a big chunk of the senior most members of the top members of the cabinet all being against this will be ross was in rural and he was there and a not an approved and say over it commerce
we think that these tags are just great to me this is just so clear that it rain we've systematically seen president trend really not often care about the consequences on a macro level that he cares essentially what his base voters things and it just feels like in some ways it is a genius political move to shore up simple
from a key part of his coalition right he's already please say the traditional wealthy are republicans with attacks now is already plead similar social conservatives many supreme court pack and and now he is purportedly at trying to please send these more blue collar working class democrats who became republicans is
supporting him all throughout the midwest in and again like i was just in ohio who hear a lot of this really resonates with folks in whether or not it actually is going to make the situation better for towns were still males were essentially the only industry in town i don't know that that actually matters to people it's just the fact that it indicates that president trump cares and that he's paying
attention to them and i think for seventy six that may be enough and it just to me shows that the president again care is most about his popularity among his base of supporters perhaps more than he cares about really the political consequences or the economic consequences and and donald trump has strong protectionist instincts i mean this is part of the core
trump brand going back for decades it is something he campaigned on very strongly so this is not something you know even the tax cut was maybe sort of a break from what he what he campaigned on this is very much in line with the trunk campaign right
to the disappointment of everyone who wants to hear another extended conversation on tariffs which guess they are very important and this is an important story with broad implications but i still even talk about the quotas i'm going to do the unpopular listener move here of shifting gears to can't let it go where we all talk about one thing we just can't stop thinking about this week paul
takes or otherwise scott honestly
well i was reminded of this by an interesting essay on the fox news website today about laura mcgann the headline is when this whole picks get to be a wunderkind instead of a former model and sort of complains about the fact that every news story about hope he makes reference to the fact that
in her teens she worked as a fashion model isn't it just a question of wunderkind to being a little too long a word for headline
to your point of this thing that she did briefly as a teenager that makes it into every profile what is a random thing called that she was also a model for ralph lauren it's not like a no name brand that we've never heard that i feel like ralph lauren is kind of like classic iconic american ray like i actually do think that
a lot of can like who we are and where we come from matters about sort of who we are where we are now a wunderkind is somebody who is amazing at a very early age at something that people don't do all that well at that age and so in case of whole picks one could argue that to get this far into the inner circle of
any powerful politician let alone the present in the united states to have risen from job to job a job to have survived through many many purges in his inner circle and to have been this powerful whatever exactly she was doing as communications director to have that title
means that she must have a great deal of talent and then she must be contributing something of great importance to the work of our president at the highest levels of our government speaking of things that shavers asthma we have been trying out a new thing on the pod gas where nobody tells each other they're can't let it goes accent an editor and
except we had the same way light so we were flagged because you and i even though we do not sit next to each other anymore because you're in and had the exact same can't let it go and you can do it for both of us so thank you for letting me have this can't let it go so what i having not been able to like go is jen whites pod cast making obama i have been
weirdly obsessed with this car guess what i have and so fascinating is it's a glimpse into the biography behind the president as it relates specifically to the city of chicago say no around you would actually you might actually quite interesting i mean it basically goes through the idea of how this man came to be president because of the place that he came
from and i can find that a pretty profound idea that like a lot of us are products of the places that we came from and those places shape who we are and ultimately what we end up doing i mean i yeah as a price sick and tired of hearing the time that indiana but i always do because i feel so fundamentally that it
it is a big part of who i am and it helped me understand things that we saw during the last election cycle and i don't know that i would have been able to understand those things if i had not come in from indiana so anyhow i was listening to one of the episodes where they talk about harold washington last night i don't know how much you knew about him but for me like this this is basically like a forty five minute detour
into the media to chicago his first black mayor who i i guess i knew who he was i knew his name but i didn't know the details that much and it was just like this this this total detour but that gives you so much context about the political moment and and just kind of what obama was thinking and feeling as he was thinking about going into politics any helps you understand this that obama
came to chicago that at that point was under the may all lead you could say the city's first black mayor and that was really unusual and apply to have you added no part of me i guess is like a thought experiment always wonder if this hadn't happened with this have happened if this hadn't happened it's dangerous to go too far down he may end up at the civil war but i like to think of what historical
tracks could happen and i think with president obama you could make the case that had harold washington not been mayor of chicago when obama was there that are arguably maybe obama would never have really engaged in politics the way that he did and arguably perhaps never become president it's a really good park so asthma we're going to have to keep comparing notes
just a new episode drops ron what can i go my can't let it go scott is about to solution that i have experienced disillusionment i didn't think i could still experience disillusionment after thirty some years in washington but in fact i have and worries it's pretty shocking okay
i have just learned that people who are nominated for the top orange in the oscars my best actor
they and they don't when they leave there
some of them don't stay for the rest of the ceremony they actually get up and leave the dorothy chandler pavilion or wherever they're having it and they actually have people who come in and sit in their seat in their place so that it won't glare as an empty seat so the cameras might be attracted to show that so until until it so might have left in peace
leave after not being named best actor best supporting actor what have they don't stay and carry on in the general honoring of their colleagues and i found that very disheartening added you on this i learned it through the media skirt
the best ever because i usually when people lose they have a good like i'm happy for you face but the best ever earlier and not pretending was bill murray when he should have won for lost in translation one of the best movies ever soldier a man it's been in atlanta way he was stricken and he was he was another way because he knew that i don't even remember see i don't even remember both denzel spaces
casey affleck oh yeah well as a total denzel for a while at least then they'll know he'd get back there bill murray was like i'm not on my show this is my short lifetime achievement with kerry shack or so
okay so i'm going to go last and this is a true can't let it go because it is a song that has been stuck in my head all week and it is great so here's the setup it's a youtube video it's a six year old girl named charity joy and it's her dad see more harrison charities a girl scout
as we all know it is girl scout cookies and we have all inhaled sleeves girl scout cookies here on the newsroom but she and her dad came up with a cookie selling song to to read bone from childish gambino and it is great
good
music

sitting in the backseat of a card arenas
here


the
and then he comes in he sounds great
cool
just so impressed with the modern girls can do that girl scout we went door to door well this is great i think she is sought a lot more cookies because of this include sell as many as a little girl in colorado who set up products are the marijuana oh yeah man
yeah i've got a good clique to but donald glover met her on steven cold air show and bought like more than one hundred boxes of cookies from her she is doing while i call that a normal porter

this pod cast was recorded at one forty pm on monday march fear things may have changed by the time you listen to it keep up with all of them purest political coverage and pr dot org the npr one up and your local public radio station
okay here's the show
hey there it's the npr politics pod cast and primary season officially get underway this week texas is a first tomorrow for the first time in years democrats are fielding a candidate in every congressional district there and in early voting democratic turnout surpass
republican turn out but how much if texas could really be in play for democrats and president trump has driven a wedge between himself and a big chunk of the republican establishment on trade today he said he isn't backing down i'm team or keep i cover the white house for npr i'm susan davis like ah fuck
congress and just retailer political reporter and i'm run over your correspondent and take oh god don't oh yeah we need it
you need to explain on the last pod cast scott death row admitted that he had only just recently listened to hamilton all the way through for the time
i know i thought learned and he'd never know that certainly josh recent just recently i've never worn like wow it's not overrated actually that sounds pretty interesting scouted have a lot of people seen and heard this before
i feel like maybe i've heard it a few times you know i don't know most people can only hope to someday see it once in a high school production in twenty thirty two
which is when i plan on
so guys i have to admit that i have been in denial about the fact that the year is two thousand and eighteen and that means it it is in fact an election year however reality is smacking me in the face the sleek because texas is having primaries tomorrow
yeah voting people will be voting people already have been voting in fact what has early voting so it is under way it is underway and texas is getting a lot of attention probably in part because it's first but just tell me why for people in the rest of the forty nine states
we should actually be paying attention to tax senior we've seen the signs of democratic enthusiasm happening for a while there have been thirty nine state legislator districts that flips and trump was elected flipped from republican to democratic hands we had big wins last year in virginia and new jersey and ever for democrats and of course the women's marches in protest scenario
too so there's been evidence of this but this is the first time we will get actual concrete voting numbers and we're already getting some dad and because texas had eleven days of early voting and the enthusiasm that is there for democrats in a red state like texas of all places is astounding so not only did democrats surpass republicans in the early
voting numbers and the largest counties in texas that we looked at which comprise about two thirds of the state's population
they outpaced their thousand sixteen numbers which is when you typically have larger turn out certain way because it's a presidential year and they doubled their numbers from two thousand and fourteen so you know the democrats have been talking for our texas is eventually going to turn blue because it's trending that way but i mean this is sort of the first concrete evidence that
yeah i've seen of real swell and the fact that it's happening in our state that typically vote so republican is certainly noteworthy how many open seats are like there are there were a bunch of retirements right is is there a potential and this seems even crazy to ask because it's texas but is there a potential for demo
crashed actually pick up seats
in texas that when how many right so they're eight open seats six republicans and democrats are retiring the majority of those are really safe republicans eat whoever wins the primary is going to probably be the next congressmen or congresswoman i think the ones that we are focusing on here are those three seats that were won by hillary clinton so it's john
person's suburban houston seat pete session suburban dallas eat and then we'll heard seat which is usually only been the one swing seat in texas really after they did the redistricting and he's someone who is sort of cut more of a moderate profile and the house and he may not be as easy to knock off as the numbers would show and it's still a
lime and even democrats that i talk to for my story on this even admitted you know it's going to be tough even with this surge as we mentioned before but let's just like actually talk about it for the first time in twenty five years democrats are fielding candidates and every single congressional race and taxes
they're not going to win and a lot of these places but it shows that people are willing to step up to run and you know given the crazy political environment that were and you can't rule out some type of scandal or something happening and you can't win a race unless you have a candidate there and democrats have seen that happen in races before also it when you have potential wave years like twenty eight
team is part of the argument to have just a candidate on the ballot is that a lot of times in a wave your candidates when in places were not even watching that they washed out incumbents who nobody was wasn't on anybody's radar and you can't beat people if you don't have somebody on the ballot this was the same tactic that republicans employ
in two thousand and ten were some of the candidates that one night year the and r c c which is the counterpart to democrats didn't even know who they were when they won their elections is one more race in texas and it's getting a lot of attention and that would be the senate race texas senator ted cruz a republican is up for reelection and he is
getting more legit than usual challenge that's right and people have been ask you why don't we hear so much from ted cruz the stage was he not as noisy as he's been in his first five years in the senate and one of the reasons is he's back home trying to get himself elected trying to do the right things from that he doesn't suddenly find his political career could
short before he can run for president again and the democrats have an actual candidate and better rourke who is a young guy some people call him the texans version of young john f kennedy that's probably not long while lawyer
not would you want to hear in some parts from texas he's quite liberal for texas but he has a populist air and these are populist times and perhaps the most energy and the democratic party even even in a texas is now on the left so he is a man of his times he may not very well be ted cruz that is probably
a little bit high as the bar but he was going to make it more competitive than anyone would have imagined a few months ago and the more democrats turn out to vote and congressional districts because they've got a candidate for the more state wide enthusiasm there is even in very deeply republican district the better chance there is the crews would be in trouble and he out raised cruise last quarter to and that was
largely from small dollar donations like ones so we saw bernie sanders getting so that's another measure of enthusiasm for a candidate as well yeah and that iraq has been having these town halls and the his rallies these events in the parking lots or fall people are showing up in it's in republican areas yeah and it's march some of that is anti trump
someone that isn't a cruise and some of it is twenty two
although i think we should say that i think ted cruz still enters this race heavily favored in the general election and if if texas does become truly a competitive toss up ray says the field of the year developed than democrats are in a much better position to gain seats or even the majority in the senate if texas isn't play on the senate level and absolutely yeah
they crazy thing about texas is dead in two thousand and sixteen hillary clinton actually lost by less in texas than she did in iowa and ohio and there's another weird thing that's happening in texas right now that i think has another reason why people are watching what happens in these primaries it's also a state where
president trump is not doing very well right now according to tracking poll data his approval rating is hovering at or just below forty percent which is a really weird position for a republican president to be in texas one caviar about this polling data is that the approval ratings track all adults
not just likely voters so there could be a different kind of microcosm of where voters are but to have a republican president so upside down given all the other atmospherics just could make for some very weird outcomes in texas run do you have any idea why trump
probably not be doing as well in texas as in other places because his immigration policies which would please in the republican party of the texas so the mentality but do not by and large please the average person in the southwest even people who are not hispanics even people who are anglos
are not happy about the divisiveness of solve the president's rhetoric they're not crazy about the wall the not crazy about the way that it changes their culture
certainly true and parts of arizona obviously true in new mexico even more humble mostly drew in southern california so all across the stage that would actually be affected by the wall there a great deal of disaffection about it there it's also what they have in texas is a considerable number of a lot of the demographic we're gonna talk a lot about in the mid term elections is white college educated vote
voters the texas economy is doing really well right now in the suburbs of cities like houston and dallas are popping and the kind of affluent educated voter there was kind of a very traditional bush republican in a bush style republican a mitt romney style republican and they are less and number of donald trump's republican party well and those
so you just pointed out those are there were actually three congressional districts and texas that are held by republicans currently that voted for hillary clinton you have john cooper since suburban houston district you have pete session suburban dallas district and and will herds he represents a border district that's really expansive reach saw the way from el paso to san antonio
and republicans that i've talked to i talked to one republican strategist there in the state derek ryan who's been doing a lot of analysis into this data here and the thing that he pointed out that i think should really worry republicans is that democrats are getting low propensity voters to the polls and what we mean by that is that typically in mid term's you see republicans turn out that we will
older voters wider voters and things like that but democrats are getting their voters to the polls in this election and he found that nearly a quarter of the early vote through last week was new voters that had registered since two thousand and six team that first time primary voters they may maybe voted in a presidential election but they hadn't voted in a midterm election before
democrats that made up twenty two percent of the early vote up from fourteen percent in two thousand and fourteen but for republicans it only made up about ten percent or so of first time primary voters and that's actually a dip from twenty fourteen for him mid terms that have typically been lower turnout election into big big
number when you go from the mid term elections where we elect congress and governors and song to a presidential election the electorate nationwide goes up fifty percent it's half again as big and the difference is almost entirely accounted for by women voters hundred thirty and people of color and also texas is always
in the bottom five of states a voter turn out this is not a state that has a lot of voter turn out so this big surge and on the democratic side that's another thing that i think is really really important to note i think specifically to you were watching hispanic turn out i mean that texas is a state that has a critical mass of hispanic voters who historically don't show up in winter
collections that's exactly who you're talking about just that low propensity voter that shows up in a presidential year but since this one out and considering the immigration debate we're having in this country over dhaka and dream mac legislation and and everything is fresh in voters' minds mean today is march fifth the eve of this election was originally the deadline that the president had said
to end the a program obviously that's going to be extended and we're going to continue to have this immigration fight but it's kind of the first real test of how angry are hispanic voters are they showing up and are they voting for democrats to i just want to put a pin and something you said which is this is march fifth this is the day that as an interim head set for the end of day
aka but it's not ending because of various court rulings including the supreme court last week saying hey we're not going to rule on this early and kicking it back to the ninth circuit if yo would like more detail on that we have a pod cast in your feed from early last week where scott death row and dominica montenegro and moralizing get into way
a more detail about that case but suffice it to say congress' not moving with due haste at the moment
okay so once texas is over then you know we have many other states to come are there any mistakes in particular primaries in particular that you guys have your eyes on think california will certainly tell us a lot and new york these big states are places where democrats need to pick up seats if they are going to win
back the house but also ohio pennsylvania know we have so in two weeks we have illinois will be the next primary that we have and then there's little bit of a break it doesn't start again until may but then may june there's a break in july onward it's going to be primary primary primary enron the this isn't a prime
mary but next week there is an election in pennsylvania a special election
it outside of pittsburgh that is generating a lot of heat this is the southwestern pennsylvania district that is absolute ground zero for donald trump and his issues he has been very popular he wanted in two thousand and sixteen handily going away absolutely clobbered hillary clinton in this district even known twenty thirty years ago it was kind of a democratic district
it's a perfect example of how blue collar voters have shifted over because of donald trump now the two candidates are pretty strong reaction a cone has raised a lot of money on the republican side you've got the president coming to just outside to change would be district to district ruins running we expected he would probably say nice things about the guy since he's certainly said a lot of nice things about donald trump
on the other side we've got the democrat
connor lamb young man very attractive very well spoken democrats are very high on him normally we would consider him i'm sorry a sacrificial lamb but in this instance he may have just personal characteristics and again it's because twenty eighteen the energy is running the other way even in very trump district and they're spending so much
both parties are spending a lot of money in this district but it's even going to exist in november as the crazy advice district is because of redistricting
pennsylvania is going through the court ordered redrawing of the lines this district simply doesn't exist neither of the candidates will even live in the new version of it but you know i remember talking with homework and strategist even two months ago and didn't even seem as competitive as it is now and them saying this is the canary in the coal my yeah this is the day
we will look at to see whether this is going to be a really really bad year for republicans bang on watts of canaries to work out for in the next week or so
and we are going to come back and talk about trade just you are leaving us thank you for bringing the knowledge and you for having me and we will be right back
support for this pod has than the following message come from simply say home secured getting a good night's sleep is easier said than done especially if you hear a noise downstairs you could turn on all the lights and keep watch or you can rest easy knowing that your home and family are protected with civilization he simply save system is

invisibility years back for new season new stories about small personal battles in a different person now your fate and huge cultural issues this is probably use somebody killed so tune in for invisible season four
we are back and last week president trump announced his intention to impose terrorists on steel and aluminum imports and the reaction from republicans has been less than positive the decision isn't final yeah he says it's coming this week
president has signed anything yet and so there is this intensive lobbying effort underway to get him to change his mind and one of the people doing the lobbying to his house speaker paul ryan how speaker paul ryan and i would say essentially every congressional republicans i mean this is an issue where probably for the first
first time since he's been in office this is really an issue where donald trump has broken with the republican party this is his decision to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports go directly at the heart of traditional republican philosophical views on trade in the free market it is fair to say how speaker paul ryan strongly
opposes the president on this decision as does ways and means chairman kevin brady his committee overseas taxes and trade policy senate republicans are you know almost unanimously again said according to senators we talked to on friday so the president is really at odds with the hill on this and the question now is can they change his mind
mind and what would they like to see him do if they can't can they mitigate the effects of this in any way we did see the president today at the white house is well one of his top advisors peter navarro show no indication that they are willing to wiggle it all on these new tariffs if anything the president said very explicitly today we're not going to back
down
no end up back in mexico

or factories have left our country our jobs have left our country for many years nafta has been a disaster
we are renegotiating after as i said i would make a deal alterman nafta
what if i do make a deal which is fair to the workers on to the american people that would be i would imagine what are the points or will negotiate and will be care of storms feel for canada
and from mexico so we'll see what happens but right now one hundred percent here's the argument that people like paul ryan are making and republicans on the hell are broadly making that their fear is that new terrorists will mitigate all of the economic gains that they are hoping to see from policies like their tax cuts and
mitigate all of your economic gains in this election year you put your majorities in congress even further at risk so they think it is policy wise the wrong thing to do and politically a loser for the republican party enter the thing about president trump as he has been talking about how america is getting a bad deal on trade for like one hundred and fifty years
or at least thirty this is of all the issues that he has dealt with as president of the united states have all the things that have come before congress
this is the thing where he has a rock solid ideology yeah this is an issue on trade policies donald trump as a real estate developer as a presidential candidate as a reality tv star now as president has always been consistent in his views on trade and on cracking down on china and on cracking down on trade
it's and is your right sam it's not like tax policy or gun policy that we saw last week or other immigration or integration where he is shown of flexibility to change his mind or be hard to peg down or or say one thing one day and something different the next on this issue he has always been very consistent so that's why i think one
that there's more concerned coming from capitol hill that this is going to happen and they won't be able to change his mind because they know that about him that this is a strongly held view and that could mean consequences and let's also congress in some respects invited back some years ago when they gave the president's authority to impose certain
tariffs in situations where the president determined on his own that there was a threat to national security and donald trump believes that are steel and aluminum industries are on their last legs and obviously we need to do and aluminum in national security terms in the long run to build new tanks and new weaponry
president has basically carte blanche to put in these terrorists and congress is not going to be asked for their approval they're going to have to figure out some way to actually express their disapproval
so i heard from a g o p source that congressional leaders won't roll out potential action down the line but so i don't know what that means theoretically congress could undermine the president unless they have given the president the authority to do these things and they could technically take that authority to a way it is in their constant
juvenile we'll house to pass some kind of legislative recourse if they wanted to combat the president on tariffs oh wouldn't that be something to say well it's it's difficult for a lot of reasons one just take the raw politics i think reasonable people can conclude that there's probably not a huge willingness among republicans to take on president
trump within the republican party in an election year
and from a practical matter as it was described to me by one republican saying it would be an extraordinary move to try and do something like this because philosophically the way these trade deals are written the trade authorities given to the president are written in a way that we give our commander in chief a very long latitude to decide the rules of internet
national trade so if congress isn't really interested in setting a precedent in which you get to second guess the president on any kind of decision that he makes year but i do think the fact that congressional leaders are sort of winking at that time and saying well we're not taking that off the table speaks more to the fact of how much they oppose this and how much it
odds they are with his white house and i think right now the most they can do is talk a little tough and if they were to move forward with this which is many many many steps down this process they would likely need veto proof majorities in the house and senate to be able to undermine the president on this and this is one of those issues where the president has some allies in congress they just happen
to be democrats democrats what here we are again and there are no good options other than to persuade the president not to actually carry through with a talk tough i want to trade war they're easy to win rhetoric and i once had a top aide to the president tell me that the best way to get donald trump
to do something is to tell him not to do it or tell him he can't and if you want to make further make leaders heads explode like senate majority leader mitch mcconnell to of the voices that were quick to come out last week when this decision was first announced or democrats like shared brown a democrat in ohio and bob casey a democrat from pennsylvania to traditional steel friendly
it's coming out and applauding the president and talk about giving democrats pretty good cover on an issue that's important to their home states in an election year in an election year when those democrats are on ballot for goes to n just to make this more fun and i think we've talked about this before but leg among the products that europe is talking about placing
it's own tariffs on our harley davidson motorcycles from wisconsin they don't tell in retaliation for nothing
tackle you urban from wisconsin cheese right so our allies in the rest of the world that are potentially trying to make this even more painful for the people who should be the president's close supporters shore and the president for his part has been very dismissive of those concerns i would say that those concerns are very real
when you're someone les paul ryan from the state of wisconsin or mitch mcconnell from the state of kentucky but trump just kind of waved it off today at the white house and said i don't think you're gonna have a trade war he just does not believe the threats that are coming his way and he thinks that the us will come out on top of this
i don't think he has also treated that trade wars are good an easy to when they're easy to wear while we're gonna find out

where's the show
hey there it's the npr politics pod cast president trump said today he's considering sending the military to guard parts of the us mexico border because what he calls week immigration laws or two we could have a proper security we're going to be gone
our order with the villager the president has been treating for days about immigration we'll talk about why and a whole bunch of cities and states are suing to try to remove a question from the twenty twenty census i'm tamer keep the white house for npr i'm i'm medical much in our own political editor and more elias a national police
correspondent hello amara you were in this press conference the president trump just had that's right i was it was an interesting press conference and it leads to watch on t v because it was president trump and three leaders of baltic nations sets right so there are four liters altogether in the east room but right before that when he sat down
with the baltic leaders in the cabinet room he talked for fifteen minutes so he kind of had to press conferences today and he kind of set a lot of staff yes he answered a lot of questions and in particular he talked a lot about immigration which happens to be this thing that he has been treating about ever since he treated
happy easter well the president has been really focused on immigration for the last couple of days he's been treating that there's not going to be a doc a deal he's been very fixated on this caravan this group of mostly hondurans that have been traveling through mexico headed for the us border that something that he has been seeing a lot
what about on fox news and he announced today that he is going to be sending the military to guard the border with mexico or two we could have a wall and proper security were bit of regarding our order with the villager that's a big step we really haven't done that before certainly not very much
well he knows that we have done it before and that's why he added that qualifier because both george w bush and president barack obama did deploy national guard troops at least to the border but he said he's going to be meeting with defense secretary matters to talk about the details of this it's not as easy as he makes it sound because the us military does not patrol
in civilian areas unless they're unless the national guard is called up by the governors of those states and president obama did that for a couple different reasons most notably politics because he was trying to get a comprehensive immigration reform bill through so couple of years after when he had sent more of those national guard to go there but also because
cause of the increase in border crossings or were far more people coming across the border in two thousand and ten than there are today except that they are anticipating a surge because we're getting to the summer season and they're anticipating a surge of and accompanied alien children is what they call them you a sees but you know what's really
interesting about this is that if politics were behind the president obama deploying national guard troops to the border politics are definitely behind donald trump's current moves he wants to be seen as being active he's worried about his base for the first time ever donald trump did something that angered his base which was he say
sign that big omnibus spending bill which did not include full funding for his border wall and he's gotten a lot of push back because of that and now he's trying to show that he's an activist he's working hard stop illegal immigration he's been talking about sending military troops to the border talking about know dhaka deal so
he is intent on trying to satisfy his supporters so all of this to eating and talking about the border had me thinking about i did this story about president trump and and how he performs in depositions and in two thousand and sixteen he sat down for a deposition
related to an argument over a restaurant and his hotel and it stemmed from his comments about mexico not sending its best people it was a dispute about that and in that deposition he talks about how you know he's really tapped into something that talking about mexico talking about immigration he
has tapped into something in america and that it's working for him and he was very assertive
clear eyed about the naked politics of it all in that deposition and this just feels like he's going back to this thing that worked for absolutely i mean look in august of last year went back and looked when i wrote this piece about president trump going back to grievance politics and his poll numbers were sliding and that's when he brought
in tom cotton and center purdue from georgia cotton been senator from arkansas to talk about trying to reduce legal immigration so he always seems to come back to immigration as the thing to try to fire up his base and let's be honest congress is to do much of anything between now and november so
so in order to keep the republican base of the base that was buying prison trump behind him and behind republicans he brings this up and brings up it seems immigration almost out of the blue to be able to have something that he can push a message on this is something you're gonna see i think regularly between now and know
ember he's going to look for every opportunity he can to join up the base because as we know from polling the democrats are more excited and energized than the republicans and he needs he's always paid attention to his bases never seem to care much about expanding his base but for those thirty to forty percent of americans who like him he's going to be looking for opportunities whether it's him
gracious stories about a caravan i wouldn't be surprised if you see other things like athletes kneeling during the national anthem things that are cultural flashpoints that he can focus on because this is what got him to the white house and he thinks this is what's going to help him and his party in november third dominican can we just quickly talk about this caravan
it is a caravan of people of migrants that are mostly came from honduras
we don't even really know if they're headed for the united states necessarily would you know that mexico has basically stopped it at this point
president noted in that press conference that it happened twelve minutes ago as of twelve minutes ago i don't think it was that specific
it had happened a little bit before that but that i guess you know he was watching this supposed caravan of people coming from honduras which by the way hundred vs one of the most dangerous countries in this hemisphere you might remember in two thousand and fourteen there was the unaccompanied minors crisis because of the uptick in violence in some of those central american
countries and then those folks are seeking asylum and they're also interestingly according to our colleague carry this is sort of a publicity stunt like in part the caravan was about trying to generate publicity for the plight of these migrants and then bam they get picked up
by the president of the united states and it becomes it's good politics all around right i mean they get to be able to raise the issue get some attention president trump is always going to take this paid because he wants this to be an issue the white house did this conference call yesterday where they were saying that they have concerns about the immigration was da
the deferred action for childhood arrivals that doesn't seem like the white house feels like there is some sort of a legislative fix for that at this point and it's caught up in the courts but they are talking about maybe a new package of legislation earth does that just feel like not really it almost feels like sometimes the president tweet something
thing and then they have to back filled with substance and potential the legislation they also say that anytime the congress discussing conveying some kind of a benefit or relief on people who are in the country illegally it acts as a quote poll factor it encourages other people to come to the country and be here illegally
so that's that's their argument but donald trump started this whole discussion when he ended darker when he lifted the protection from deportation on these kids and started talking about perhaps legislating darker doing something he said he loved these kids and the question this raises is when and if the courts resolve this
well he began deporting them or will the courts not resolve it in that direction we don't know we don't know okay
so there there was some other news or kind of a lot of other news but we're just going to pick a couple of things from the various times that we are from president trump today
one thing that he has eluded to before but he put a finer point on today was syria the us has boots on the ground in syria we may not technically call them boots on the ground but the us has military operations in syria united just have a casualty in syria there was an american
soldier who was killed by a roadside bomb as well as several other coalition members in an area by the way they used to be fairly safe according to our correspondent tom and and this is a big deal in his rally in ohio last week the president said he wanted troops to come out of syria very soon and this is not just something that the president bush
about he had already frozen about two hundred million dollars in assistance for syria in the effort to rebuild the country and he is said today i want to get out of syria i want to bring our troops home i want to rebuild our nation we've spent seven trillion dollars
in the middle east over seventeen years we haven't gotten anything out of it he has said that many that many times he said we've got nothing except for death and destruction but the interesting thing to me is this is exactly what he campaigned against pulling us troops out of syria now would be a huge gift to iran and russia and potentially isis which the press
that and says one of the reasons he wants to pull out his were pretty much done with our job of decimating isis but he campaigned against obama putting an end date on military involvement in certain countries he said the bad guys just wait you out when you tell them that you're leaving and this is something that i know he's getting pushed back from the pentagon about
but this has deep instinct he ran against getting involved in foreign wars his base doesn't want the are spending money abroad they want the us government spending money here so this is something that he feels very strong about it's kind of along with immigration and trade not getting bogged down or involved with boots on the ground in other country
is something that's really part of base trump isn't it but it almost sounds like it it sounded like you were just contradicting yourself
i mean it always morals
no longer so i know the i'm united states the fact is this trump doctrine is unclear this foreign policy doctrine is inconsistent when it comes to the ideological doctrine of like what do you wind up doing what do you believe you should do it's very unclear for the united states and for its our
lies around the world it's unclear because it's hard to be a hawkish isolationist i mean yeah yes i'm a and wants to project strength strength and toughness is the bedrock of the trump brand as he sees it he wants to be strong against iran against north korea but he doesn't like spending
money and doing the hard slogging work of not just vanquished thing enemies like isis but once they're vanquished what do you do to make sure they don't come back what do you do to make sure that a country like syria can be stable and what do you do to make sure that iran and russia don't fill the vacuum that
you're creating by pulling out so those are those are questions that that you know he doesn't really have the answer to but we know that jim mantis my pump hail and certainly john bolton when he arrives do have opinions
i just wonder looking at twenty twenty and the president going up for reelection how he might have to wind twisting himself into something of a pretzel in china make the case because it's really easy when you run against something that you're so the polar opposite of to be able to make a very simple argument rather than
a nuanced one trying to defend what you've done because he was able to save and we should just bomb them and take the oil
just say that today again he said yeah i always said we should keep the oil we didn't keep the whale isis got the right but when you look at what the united states is undergoing with emissions that they're trying to put in place he owns the stuff now and it's not as simple as saying bomb them take the oil and then people look and see what is actually
opening on the ground in a place that's very complicated like the middle east like iraq like syria those are areas that don't i've never had simple solutions he had campaigned on those but what's so interesting to me is i get why he's talking about mexico and the caravan his base is upset and he wants to show them with his signature issue that he still
working hard to build the wall stop illegal immigration etc
syria to me is more interesting because it kind of came out of the blue it's not like we're seeing syria and the headlines every day it's not like there's a kind of big discussion in the united states about whether we should be in syria i think we have a couple thousand and true blown syria
that's pretty interesting that's just his deep instincts
one more news item and we will keep this brief but this week all eyes are on scott pruitt the administrator now we have no reason to believe that he is eminently leaving however he is clouded in controversy there are a number of stories about potential ethical lapses
around him and their mara has been some word coming from the white house on that well we know the donald trump talk to scott brewer and everything else that i have heard is that proves on thin ice i think if you had a white house pull and asked white house aides whether he would survive and
not they would be betting heavily against him there are people in the white house who feels that his ethical problems are just too many you know he was accused of renting a room at a below market rate from a lobbyist and he'd made a ruling that was in favor of that lobbyists client he's been criticized
for high price travel and other expenses and these thing the kinds of things that are mounting up are very similar to the kinds of problems that put an end to the career of tom price the ha just secretary so i wouldn't bet that scott drew it is going to stick around for very long though this is all coming and it's really interesting time at the
just today scott pruitt announced a rollback of emissions standards vehicle emissions standards this is a reversal of obama era environmental policy it's a big win for president trump this is part of his regulatory roll back and pruitt is doing
exactly what president trump and many republicans want the administrator to do however the other stuff is getting more headlines in many ways there's been no more important time if you're a supporter of president trumps for what's happening at the right now because of the roll back
it's that they are undergoing and yes of course they could put in place somebody who could push through president trumps anti regulation agenda but scott pro it is somebody who knows where the bodies are buried at the he he sued the several times when he was the attorney general and okay
palmer this is a job he was made for the undoing of the regulatory structure at the and i think president trump ban trouble with the white house know that and maybe maybe they're going to push through some of these rollbacks and then you might see him depart who knows yeah and the other thing is that one of the keys to surviving
the in the trunk cabinet is to not have a higher profile than the president on anything and there has been some grumbling in the white house about scott prove it's obvious ambitions to either be the attorney general if jeff sessions should ever be removed from that position and he also wants to run for hire
office in oklahoma and i think that he hasn't kept his head down and played by the rule yet because there have been a lot of rumors that if jeff sessions goes because remember president trump had his sights focused on jeff sessions for quite some time on twitter and there are a lot of blind quotes in a lot of places floating scott
druids name and there's a lot of suspicions within the white house of where that came from was talking to a republican yesterday who was telling me you know it's probably not a coincidence that all of these articles are coming out about pruitt right now that all of these documents are being leaked that in this environment with this level of backbiting
that scott peru it has found himself in the cross hairs also remember a week before a charming master was ousted from the white house president trump had said that he has confidence and make master sarah sand or so that there was no problems
they both get along so maybe it's a little bit like a scene from one of those bob movies you bring them closer he give a big kiss on the lips might be close but he's never good for the roi yeah so let's hear what that sounds like president tramp was asked today about his feelings about skype
i hope he's gonna be great remember when he said about rex tellers and after he fired i'm i'm sure rex is going to be happier now
has anyone checked in with for extortion
i bet he's happier now
okay we're going to take a quick break we're going to say goodbye to demean ago and mara bye bye guys think you and when we come back we will talk census you know you guys want to hear about the us census and the tramp administration has announced it's adding a citizenship question to the twenty twenty census and it's causing a
a lot of controversy you gotta knock some sense essence of this pod cast who whole group
and that's pretty good
billy right
i'm linda hand there's more stuff to watch these days than you can ever get to that's why he made pop culture happy hour twice a week we give you the lowdown on what's worth your time and what's not find pop culture happy hour on the npr one app or wherever you get your pardon
and we're back and we are going to talk about the us census there are a whole bunch of cities and states suing to try to remove a question from the two thousand and two thousand census the trump administration said last week that every single person filling out the census this time around will be asked
whether or not there a us citizen the justice department had asked for that information and i am join now by none other than ronaldo being hello term iran and we have a very special guest huntley low long hello honky hate him hey hey so we have you here with us because you
anything census i do end you've been very busy here
so we're going to dig into the controversy surrounding in particular this one question about citizenship and some other things but first let's just bare bones why does the census matter so much sense as manner so much because it's one of the few requirements the founding fathers wrote in the constitution so
something that we actually have to carry out which is a head count every person living in the us every ten years in order to reapportionment seats in congress every ten years yeah so ron the politics part of this matters enormously how many people there are in your state because that determines how many seats you get in congress above the minimum
mama one and then matters within the state because where these people are then becomes the guide for drawing the maps for determining how you're going to elect those representatives from among the people in your state so that's the first thing and then after that the federal government relies on this highly important statistical base to do strip
butte all kind of funds basically all kinds of discretionary funds that are spent domestically things other than social security and medicare are distributed on the basis of where the people are where the population may live so these numbers guide the dollars for the next ten years and by the way we should mention because it might be
more than casual interest to some people that how many seats a state has in the house of representatives also determines how many votes it has in the electoral college that chooses the president of the united states are the analogy i like to use is that the census it's like the plumbing that makes her democracy work you don't think about it but when it's not working
no it's a big deal so
i want to get to this controversy this thing that was sort of sprung last week in was i guess it wasn't a surprise to your hands he because you've been covering the census but there is going to be a new question on that form that goes to every american what is that question so this question
going to ask is this person a citizen of the united states and you'll have five options one of which obviously is no not a us citizen but if you are a us citizen you can specify if you're born in the united states and puerto rico guam where the territory's born abroad of us citizen parent or parents or your you're a citizen by naturalization
and you print the year of your naturalization and this is the wording that's currently used in a smaller census bureau survey known as the american community survey goes out to more than three point five million people a year in the united states now sarah sanders the white house press secretary last week when this announcement was made sheets
it down played it
let's hear what she had to say this is a question that's been included in every since the since nine hundred and sixty five with the exception of twenty ten hour when it was removed
we've contained to this question that's provided data that's necessary for the department of justice to protect voters
specifically to help us better comply with the voting rights act there's some nuance hear what is true is that the last time the census asked all us households about citizenship was in nineteen fifty
and after that the earth
census that was presented to all us households did not have a citizenship question but there was a thing known as the long form questionnaire the census which broken up into a short form and long form questionnaires and beginning and nine hundred and seventy the long form questionnaire included citizenship question but the long form did not
go to every us household
and that long from is now known as the american community survey which goes out to more than three point five million households every year but three point five million is not one hundred and how many households do we have in america one hundred fifty million two hundred twenty seven oh thank you and but i think the point is that for more than half century
every household in the us has not been required to answer a question about citizenship soaps who it is a really big deal
so sensitive question too because the the fear on the part of many who advocate for the community of immigrants and people who are recent immigrant is that if you do have anyone in your household who has any question about their legality you are going to be highly wary of filling out a form that identify
thighs that pack and identifies that person and then of course when someone comes to your door following up because you didn't turn in your census form you're going to have the same set of fears you're going to think well this is the law this is ice this is the homeland security department coming to look for that person in my home so
it's not going to be a great incentive to cooperate to fill out this form completely an answer all those questions about everyone who might be in home and this is actually confirmed by census bureau's own research it does research leading up to the big count and its own researchers in the field testing out the questions i'm actually not including the citizenship question because we only just got this
news but they have noticed especially an increased fear amongst immigrants when just doing testing of the senses and we should say that it is not legal to use census information for law enforcement purpose
federal law prohibits the census bureau from releasing any data that would identify and individual but something to keep in mind is that the census bureau can release to federal agencies information about specific population groups so wouldn't specify someone's name but it could identify specific characteristics of a group and i guess a lot of people probably i mean like what
oh that this is part of the the roll out of the census every every ten years
is a big advertising campaign
to put that messaging out there yes i'm from the government i'm here to help you and you can trust me i won't use this data in any way that might be inimical to your interests except of course but the reason we're asking this citizenship question is because the secretary of commerce wilbur ross says he's doing it to help law enforcement
he's doing it to help the department of justice so what is one to conclude from that statement what is one to conclude from that arrangement between justice and commerce if not that this is being done in some sense to help law enforcement now maybe people are going to be able to parse one kind of helping law enforcement statistically
came from the kind of helping law enforcement that means turning people over to the man and this is really the core of the arguments that new york and sixteen other states as well as california which found a lawsuit last week
this is part of the argument they're trying to make in their complaints against wilbur us and the census bureau yeah let's talk about that this suit is being filed today there was the one filed last week by the state of california what is their main legal argument what is their main concern first that adding a question about citizenship is unconstitutional because the constitution requires a government to do
what the actual warnings actual enumeration and so they're arguing that we know that based on research and based on the current anti immigrant sentiment that this will they alleged decrease their response rate of the census especially amongst immigrant populations and so therefore the government can't carry out its constitution of responsibility of counting
every person that seats and so therefore it's unconstitutional and then the other main argument is that this is against what is known as the administrative procedure act and essentially prohibits federal agencies from taking actions that are arbitrary and really is a misuse of discretion
it's citing number of reasons these different complaints of why it feels that this is very arbitrary partly what i just stated about the decrease response rate also that this question has not been tested which this is a point of contention between the commerce secretary and these different states here
cities and the us conference of mayors that has this question been tested commerce secretary argues that since we're using the wording of the citizens strip question that is currently on the american community survey therefore we know how respondents may may take to this question but the seats are arguing you see these are arguing the earth's conference of mayors arguing
arguing that the census bureau has not tested this question in the context of what is known as the sentinels census is not tested it in the question that's going to go out to all us households so this is kind of new territory and the census bureau generally does not do this because this has could have big impact on dave equality and wed wilbur ross
in his commerce secretary and his justification for this what he said i think is that while there is no empirical evidence that it will do that bad things that everybody says it will do and it sounds like what you're saying is there's also no empirical evidence that at well that's the rub essentially and secretary
ross saying this is on its memo that they came out a monday night which kicked off all of this proving the justice department's requests he basically said the need for a better count of us citizens outweighs all these concerns my impression is that there is a good deal of evidence that if you ask people questions that get them started
wondering about whether or not answering them honestly is going to get them into trouble
you are almost automatically and i believe there is evidence for this you are our most automatically a depressing the number of people who are going to find so for example it's been estimated in past years and i'm not talking about this next census where the last one but that in past years as many as six percent of all the african americans in the united
states were not counted because for one reason or another they didn't cooperate with a census perception is a really really big part of you know whether you get an accurate count or not and the census bureau has as run was mentioning a long history of their number of what what is known as hard to count populations they include immigrant populations especially on author
the many immigrants and communities of color so this is a big concern and there's also another lawsuit filed by the end of p last week really concerned that the sense spirits not prepared to carry out a full accurate count especially of communities of color now these these states and cities that are suing to try to block this are they all blue
states is this lake another red stay blue state thing or what are these states have in common
a lot of the seats are blue states but it's also a number of cities like new york philadelphia seattle san francisco but also includes a bipartisan group of mayors in the unites in the us conference of mayors i was at the recent conference of the us conference of mayors a recent meeting in d dc and you had a republican and democratic marriage
saying were really concerned this will affect our population counts and and also affect the case that we can make essentially saying you know our population has grown or or specific changes within the demographics of our population is going to hurt them when they're trying to make their case for more federal dollars from or services
and also affect them local for local planning were to improve roads where to invest more in schools based on the population count
but this isn't quite answer your question camden
well you know there are a lot of blue states that are suing it's true but the effect that this would have might very well be more broadly distributed for example texas and florida have very large populations of people who might have either an acquaintance who is undocumented or might have someone who is undocumented living in their home arizona also far
in that category and if we're talking largely about poor households people of color or people who for one reason or another
might have some concerns about filling out the census those are also disproportionately states that voted for donald trump or that would be considered red states states with very high proportions of low income households okay so one question that i saw a bunch floating around on line is this idea of or why
should even be counting people who aren't citizens so let me pose that to you guys why why why is the us counting people who aren't americans the constitution doesn't make a distinction between citizens and non citizens when doing this headcount is a rate run that is correct i was gonna say the simplest answer is because we
i always have the effect of the matter is it supposed to be measuring how many people are in the country not how many people in the country are citizens it's supposed to be measuring where people are and who people or and that is what it is all about an actual enumeration so the constitution is pretty clear
people would like to be well people would like not to use statistical sampling to replace the actual enumeration because statistical sampling if it's done scientifically would not have a lot of the problems of inaccuracy of the problem of people's refusal that we have with the current enumeration but the supreme court decided back
nineteen ninety eight that the constitution was plain about saying actual enumeration a nose count a headcount whichever you want to call it not statistical sampling not the best evidence of what science can produce but an actual headcount and the constitution is also plane in terms of including every one so for those who want to stick with
constitution they would have to take the part of that they don't like as was the part they do although it's important to remember it originally the constitution required that are enslaved people be counted as root three fifths of a person so before he leaves your hands there are other questions that are sort of new or then the work there there's potential the
learn new things in this census that's right tell us about that well when really interesting changes to the race question for the first time people who mark off the boxes for white or black are going to be asked to rate in their non hispanic origins and on the form the census bureau going to provide examples
something like german irish african american or jamaican and so that's good to be a really interesting
that's going to be really interesting set of data and then the other interesting change if we have time for it is relationship question so the census spear always asks within a household how people are related
for the first time the boxes among the boxes are going to be options that will differentiate between same sex and opposite sex couples how does it differentiate between married and not married or yes so there's a box for same sex and opposite sex
husband wife spouse
and then also another one for same sex or opposite sex
unmarried partner and this is not the first time the census bureau bureau's tried to count the number of same sex couples nine hundred ninety when it added a category for unmarried partner
it started basically taking how people respond to the relationship question and matching that with how people answered the question about their sex and then figure it out okay these are the people were same sex couples he are people who are opposite sex with different sex couples and
in two thousand and twenty ten actually
reports about these numbers and what it found was that difference some different sex couples accidentally mark the wrong box for their sex and so they were accidentally counted as same sex couples in the census bureau's initial estimates so this change adding this change of differentiating between same sex opposite sex couples and it is
way the census bureau says in order is a way to collect more accurate data about same sex couples which for now is a really small percentage of the population and so just having a few mistakes demographers you're telling me that can really distort the numbers that we get about same sex couples estimates that spirit puts out so in terms of controversy these days
two changes do not rank anywhere near this isn't citizenship question or do they well certainly we haven't seen a lawsuits over these changes but i think the thing is is that it's only two thousand and eighteen
and unless you've been listening to n p r you may not have heard about these changes and so when i'm really curious i'm really really curious once all of america sees the actual form
in the mail on the phone
when they try to answer on the phone or they go online for the first time to respond to the census what they will think about these new questions these new check boxes
i had i think that is it for today hands he thank you so much for joining us you're very welcome bring in all that census knowledge i suspect we will have you back talk radicals again that's that's fine thank you for having and for the rest of you we will be back in your feed soon i keep up with

a joy dance yes that's true i like this guy as last easement mustard the boat
this the our politics pod and we're here with our weekly round up of political news president trump is deploying national guard troops to the us mexico border it's not technically a trade war yet more like a trained skirmish but china is leading back at the us the terrorists it's out targeted at truck
country and with ceo mark zuckerberg preparing to testify before congress next week facebook is now saying that some eighty seven million people had their data harvested and shared with the political consulting firm cambridge analytical that's a lot and it's also a lot more than facebook originally said i'm tamer key
cover the white house for npr i was going to oscillate massacre of the white house and danielle current slaven political reporter and i'm more alliance and national political correspondent i just want us to know that this week for the first time ever and loaded my dishwasher handles down and how has it for her so much cleaner
my life has changed you know black is white up is down
food taste better
absolutely off a little food scraps from last night's dinner left in them and dear liz is i have stopped putting wooden spoons in the dishwasher and result of some scolding i received
so we talked about this a bit on the pod cast on tuesday but president trump has been back to railing about immigration and border security a lot in the past few days mostly on twitter but his exit and twitter income into the real world and yesterday he signed a memorandum to deploy
oi national guard troops to the us mexico border homeland security secretary cures to nielsen made the announcement yesterday at the white house press briefing we continue to see unacceptable levels of illegal drugs dangerous gang activity transnational criminal organizations an illegal immigration fled across that border
threatens not only the safety of our communities and children but also were very rule of law and although they announced it there are still a lot of questions about exactly how this would work and they seem to be questions that nielsen and the white house are having trouble answering at this point but i'd like to hear from the governor's is what it is good
they want that's not anything that we have proposed that we've we want to get to border security so i think that we're saying here we're going to hear any kind of view and until until and when congress acts mara
can you say about what's the is the plan right now according to the secretary nielsen is that she's going to be talking with governors of the border states to figure out how many national guard troops they would need and the ways that they could be the most helpful in a national guard troops act as backups they free a border
patrol officers but the backdrop for all of this is that immigration has become the number one election year issue for the white house and the president just as we started this pod cast was in west virginia giving a speech that was supposed to be about tax reform but it actually was a lot about immigration
describing and great gory detail how m s thirteen which is a gang how they kill and maim their victims and all the horrible things that are happening because of immigration they believe this isn't this isn't an issue that does fire up the trump base firing up the bases very important
number one political strategy for the white house keep their base energize get them out to the polls and a tough midterm election but there's also something else going on which is the president has been very frustrated that he hasn't been able to get full funding for his wall and as a matter of fact when he called for national guard troops to go down to the border he said they'll stay there until the wall
is built he got some pushed back from his conservative base when he signed a big omnibus spending bill that did not include full funding for the wall this is the first time he's ever done anything really that cause this much grumbling from his conservative base and he wants to show them that he's been tough and even though he can't get the wall build he's doing something else and that was the
impetus for this news new policy now technically politics cannot be the official impetus can be the unofficial impetus but there has to be in theory a reason why this is happening and and scott the white house and the department of homeland security
says there is a reason that remember the pros and spent a lot of last year bragging about how much he and his get tough stance on border policing have done to depress the number of illegal border crossings and in fact if you look at the numbers from the department homeland security we did see a drum
man drop in the number of illegal border crosses last year that was called the trump effect but we sort of sort
the little border crossings would have bottomed out about this time last year and they slowly begun creeping up again and just this week we got the numbers for the march border crossings and it was pretty dramatic spike they were up thirty seven percent in march from february and they were three
three times as high in march of two thousand and eighteen as they were in march of two thousand and seventeen remember march twenty seventeen a peak trump effect so it's kind of bouncing back off of an artificially low for and what we're really seeing is illegal border crossings returning to sort of kind of normal level that they've been at for the last five or six years but
as a substantial increase from where we were a year ago and that's what the white house and saying it had on here this is not the first time that a recent president of the united states has sent in the national guard to help along the border how do the current numbers even the spike numbers compare to what it was like when george w bush was sin
people in or when president obama sent in something like fifteen hundred national guard troops back in two thousand and six just before the recession
we saw illegal immigration was really it kind of a a long time peak
those days we were seeing more than a million illegal border crosses every year even if we would have see the border crossings we saw in march disdain for this whole year it would be way below that be maybe the neighborhood of four hundred thousand so less than half of what we saw in two thousand and six when when president bush that at the national guard like than the recession happened and people
didn't want to come here when the recession have when we actually saw him out migration a lot of folks who had come here for economic reasons to try to find work for finding work and home
we've also seen a change in the composition of the migrants and it's fewer mexicans now coming for work and so a lot more central americans coming often fleeing violence or or oppression in their in their home countries more children more families and well in the president's mind and we heard this yesterday from the homeland security secretary to this is also
completed with illegal drugs and gangs and a national security threat there's really no hard evidence that links this recent flow of immigrants again about a third of them children and families to those kinds of criminal problem with the white house and d h s were talking about absolutely and you so you can sort of see what
trump strategy here is then you know as as opposed to you know in the past you know if there has been a crisis the president said a crisis of some sort of the president has said okay let's put these let's send in these national guard troops trump is painting a crisis
a crisis of violence and drug dealers coming out across the border now let me send sundays national guard troops one other thing i wanted to add though and terms of contacts in terms of people in the country illegally is it's really easy to focus on people crossing the border illegally but a large share of people who are in the us illegally
did not cross the border illegally they came here legally and they overstayed their visas st louis and on vacation they came as a worker have some especially as workers yes and so it's it's one key thing to keep in mind that this is not trump has a big problem
with undocumented immigrants but it's not just about getting tough on the border and this is why during the twenty six thousand campaign you saw a lot of the republican candidates in particular
talk not just about amp up the border which is of course with trump talks a lot about but finding some other way of tracking so overseas and in terms of policy scary you talk about young people or these unaccompanied minors are families coming in
the way the trump administration is presenting that is that they are sort of abusing the current laws that they are coming in and they're not saying we're coming for work they're saying we're coming because we're afraid and because of that the law treats them differently than they if they were just like a dude who said i'm coming for work there is a
big increase in the number of people who have come across the border and say they've come because they have a legitimate fear of something going on back home the trump administration described that as folks taking advantage of the system could also mean that there's a lot going on back home that they are afraid of but it is true that the law requires the government to treat young
by themselves and also families differently than they would say a single man coming over for economic reasons families can only be held for twenty days young people if they're coming from central america generally have to be turned over to sponsors in this country off and family members as opposed to being sent quickly back home so there there is a
legal framework that makes young people and families from central america a bigger challenge for immigration authorities then then historical border crossings you know this is what the president and the administration cause catch and release and that they are forced by law to release certain immigrants
undocumented immigrants from detention
in advance of their court dates and today the president was talking about how and then they disappear and they don't show up for their court date and they are proposing they say the white house a legislative package that would correct these loopholes and would put an end to this catch and release effect
the chances of congress passing map this year i think our next to zero but yesterday a senior white house official said that the politics of this are good for them and an election year because he said how long can democrats filibuster in favor of illegal immigrants that's going to be very unpopular
unnamed white house official said and i think that as much as i cover politics but i'm extremely interested in policy the policy here is so unimportant this is really not this didn't come from a kind of policy wellspring this is a political initiative and go by
back to the summer of two thousand and fifteen when donald trump wrote down the escalator and talked about mexicans sending drug dealers and ranged across the border a lot of people wrote off his candidacy on that day but he obviously tapped into some vein of american politics and wrote it all the way to the white house and you know people say that they didn't that his supporters didn't
really expect him to build the wall they took him seriously but not literally it turns out they took him seriously and literally and some of the loudest voices on the right are saying if you don't build the wall why did we vote for you and that the president has felt very frustrated about this that he hasn't gotten the wall and what's so interesting about this week in particular one day
the president talks about tweets about lacks porter laws and that he wants those things fixed and about that he seizes on this news story of a caravan which and in stocks which has been stopped but he seizes on this new story look there's a caravan traveling through mexico to our border and the white house scrambles catches that holds a brief
about all of the loop holes which they called catch and release in the law that they'd like fixed not a single word about the national guard or militarize in the border the next day the president seemingly impromptu says we're going to send the military to the border okay and they have to scramble and catch up for that come up with some kind of policy have briefings have the
department of homeland secretary come out to say this is happening i mean this is how policy is made on this way to that as as far as what prompted this i mean aside from watching a fox news story about caravans and i'm not suggesting that that prompted this whole policy roll out you might call it what i'm wondering is what did prompt us then because even though trumps base may have
been upset at that omnibus that didn't include a big giant border wall i mean what did prompt us because we haven't seen his base abandoning hands and now now he has very high approval ratings among republicans but i think that the president acts as if he is in constant fear of losing his base i know that he's being told by someone
his advisors in and out of the white house that if he doesn't deliver on the wall if he doesn't double down on being tough on undocumented immigration that he's in danger of not so much losing his base but that they would be less enthusiastic and coming out in a midterm election when he's not on the ballot don't forget he has to try to transfer his party
hilarity to other republican candidates which doesn't always work just as barack obama in two thousand and ten and two thousand and fourteen so i think that was a number of things it was the omnibus it was his frustration worry about the mid term elections and then room and then a return as scott just said to the number one core issue
you that he wrote to the white house and that's illegal immigration we are going to take a quick break and when we come back china retaliate against president trumps new tariffs

we are back and so our fears of a possible trade war with china in response to president trumps recent decision to impose tariffs on imported steel and aluminum china has announced that it too will be imposing tariffs on certain us
products scattered danielle open floor here can you please explain where we are in this tit for tat several let me just start with what happened this week so it started on monday when china impose tariffs on three billion dollars worth of american goods it was one hundred and twenty eight products in total
including for example a lot of fruit a lot of nuts grown in the us and a lot of pork raised in the us and that was in response to tariffs that the us had imposed so then on tuesday trump announced tariffs on thirteen hundred chinese products now that was not a volley back at those tariffs
beijing and rather this was sort of fulfilling a thing that the united states had announced a couple of weeks ago a couple weeks know he said
we're gonna come out with a list of stuff and this was our list of stuff thirteen hundred thirty and hundred different products around fifty billion dollars worth and so in response the next day china said our we're fifty billion dollars worth of stuff so we neither of those last two things as fifty billion dollar rounds of threats
they have not been imposed impose yeah they've just been threatened were waiting until those actually come into effect so some of the tariffs so we've been talking about aren't already employs steel and aluminum tariffs for example although a lot of the big suppliers those medals have given gotten an exemption and then china's shot across the bow pork producers and and grow
that's that's an effect and we've seen a dramatic
drop in them presently hogs only seen almost growers worried about where it was going to have their market and pistachio growers in central valley of california but the really big second round rare of the the work at china over his handling of intellectual property and then the pushed back by china against soybeans and commercial aircraft cut
extortion united states those are in advance for the time being and we had larry kudlow the new economic advisor at the white house go on cable tv and say you know those by never go into effect that's that's really just a a bargaining chip we've put that off on them table and now we're going to see if we can make a deal in the stock market read the big sigh of relief when they heard como se the night
it's a trade war i think there's going to be intense negotiations on both sides but look when you look at this whole picture
gain china don't blame president trumps a solution
pablo has been saying is like president trump is this incredible negotiator we've thrown those out here now let's go negotiate this thing which is also a way of saying the you know larry kudlow who came to the administration from c n b c the cable news network for people who care about what's happening with the markets
kudlow is trying to put up like a big bad sign that says just chill this could not this could not actually happened maybe like margaret breathe the big early when they heard that the market which opened about five hundred points down ran on wednesday came back and of the day plus two hundred so but it's not that there are no repercussions here
i mean we have been careful here at npr and a lot of news organisations have been to say no listen it's haven't got into effect yet larry kudlow really stressed that but there are still results in the market for example the soybean market the price of soybeans dropped around four percent all at once and that has soybean growers very worried
read as the resident island i can tell you that you know a roughly one third of america's soybeans go to china like if one of our biggest export markets for one of our biggest agricultural exports
suddenly closes even a bit like that's going to be very very bad for a lot of people who by the way voted for president and it's only been going on the list that came from china renato soybeans go make tofu right
mara they do
hey
and so i saw a tornado they also feed easy
and the chinese with a growing middle class have been eating a lot more american meet by the way that aside from that one thing i want to add here is like this whole idea of us wanting to retaliate against china for unfair trade practices i mean a lot of economists will say like you know we're not wrong trump isn't wrong to say that they're stealing our and
property that there's force technology transfers anything like that it's it's just that tariffs might not be a are not a good way to solve this is what a lot of economists would say what are lots of business groups
appreciate the president's goal here they're just writing his means to that end and well there's at least temporary reassurance from larry kudlow that this is all just a bargaining chip america lost track record of predictions on economic issues is not all that great he's got a record of get things wrong and again and again and again but you know it's interesting to me
and this goes into the unpredictability or the suspense that's involved with every single trump policy initiative is if you look at the headlines on the washington post it says trump defiant as china ads trade penalties the big headline on the new york times white house edges back from brink of trade war so we do
don't know if there's going to be trade were not what i think is so interesting is that just as we were all the conventional wisdom was concealing around this idea that trumps second year in office was going to be about more isolation is more protectionist he was going to have fewer advisors who were going to push back against him along comes larry kudlow
who wrote famously and op ed piece saying that tariffs were taxes when president from first raise these then got hired to be a top economic advisor and as scott said he was out there yesterday sending a message to the markets calm down this is just a negotiating tactic it's not gonna really end up with these tariffs that are going to harm us and we don't know how
this is gonna come out i want to just turn back to our resident iowan here danielle because
this is not abstract now if you're a soybean farmer in iowa rape and you happened to maybe i don't know be related to a silly been farmer in iowa i just might be their decisions that are being made absolutely as a farm right now this is happening interestingly just as farmers in iowa and i imagine and other places
are ramping up to plant soybeans for the year so if you're a farmer in iowa illinois southern minnesota wherever you have a choice to make what do you want to plant in your field you on a plant soybeans you want a plant corn is often the alternative well if i'm a farmer and i look around that i see that the soybean prices depressed i might very well decide well i'm not going to
plant soybeans i'm going to plant corn this year or plant something else so like what you might end up with is a glut of corn yields come this far so i mean really
varian and we should say both corn and being prices have been depressed for a couple years and several years no solar farm income has been down for the last four years this is a really tough time for farm country to be hit with these kinds of trade and corn prices dropped a bit this week as well not as much as as soybeans dead if i'm right on
but him but they did drop so i mean this is definitely something that farmers are quite worried about i mean farming is a volatile business anyway well you know i wonder what politically farm farm country is trump country more or less i wonder if this is something that would make farmers
farm voters and farm country think differently about donald trump i don't know the answer to that maybe they're there
their belief and him early transcends these kinds of issues but you know the other thing that goes into the category of wrong answer to the right question is this is the only issue that i can think of where you have had such a loud chorus of republicans in congress disagreeing with the president i can't think of anything else where you've had this pushed back
against tariffs and as a matter of fact when you think about the political fallout from this even though this is something he ran on this is going to go under the promise fulfilled column for donald trump the people who are happiest about these tariffs are rust belt democrats running for reelection yeah and that's what's so interesting i mean he he is helping sherrod brown and know
higher with these tariffs no doubt about it by the way i mean trumped does have someone very close to him in this fight who knows the impact this could have on islands and that's a guy named terry brant said who was a long time governor of iowa now he is the us ambassador to china and who his buddies was president siege
paying of china so terry brant said this week was saying he was saying the company line on you know listen china really has been a bad actor and trade and so on but terry brant is also very intimately aware of the potential repercussions of of what should happen if we did impose a whole bunch of
tariffs on china or of china and positive bunch of tariffs on our stuff and so you have to be wondering what he is thinking right now and you know it's so interesting is that when you ask people will gee if this is the wrong answer to the right question of china really is a cheater and china is stealing our intellectual property what would be the answer and most people will tell you well the answer instead of these terrorists would be to work in
concert with a whole bunch of other countries to force that i needed to change guess that there used to be something called the t p p the transposed civic partnership which excluded china and excluded china for exactly this purpose to try to correct some of these problems and you know trump famously cancelled that that was both the w bush and obama long game on this
so the trump team i guess is trying a new strategy one more thing before we take a quick break that may or may not be completely blown out of the water by whatever happens next scott pruitt the administrator we talked about him on the last pod cast he continues to be insured of a
what do you call it cabinet purgatory where it's not clear what his fate might be the president today did when asked if he had confidence in him the president said i do
although sometimes when trumps shows i do he only means for a little while
screw it is a skeptic of the science around and climate change but he is certainly feeling the heat himself as right now from a mounting array of ethical challenges and it sounds as if the white house is whatever confidence the president still house in his administrator the war
houses put some distance we heard a white house spokesman out about him to do he he just totally decline to to come to approach defense right because earlier this week didn't president trumps say something like i hope i hope he is going to be great writing on going to own who's been in office for over that is not the definite
son of a full throated a doors and then sarah sanders went on to be when she was asked his trumpet okay with pruitt living arrangements he said he's not okay and that they were taking the controversies very seriously it's said every thing i've heard that the white house this week has been that pruitt is on very thin ice and not for anything he's
as the now i'm certainly not like the like wow
oh fuel economy standards rolling back the clean power plant that's all very consistent with the trump agenda but he has created a spectacle of himself and in all the wrong was and this is the kind of thing that doesn't like because it goes against his brand that he's draining the swamp and as a matter of fact and that fox news interview when pruitt was asked a question about those key
what do you think about this and trump promise to drain the swamp he said that was a very inappropriate question already we're going to take another quick break and scott you are leaving us making away from iowa
my better male counterpart
tim mac is coming after the break and we're going to talk about facebook and
i had get over it over facebook yes well we can't have two people on this pod cast you've never been on facebook before they these guys so we will be right back

fifty years ago this week to civil rights leaders were killed one you know dr martin luther king jr in one you may not this week conclude switch the final days of the lives of to lead to fall into fighting for justice find a dome in pure one or ever you get your pockets
we're back and we have a new friend in the studio
tim mag hello hi to him and we just bring you here when facebook is in trouble
i do a lot of other things i do really i just younger loring i don't actually have i have other town this and other are
we're going over fact checker kind of that out you know
so left him you were here you are talking about facebook and the political consulting firm cambridge analytical cambridge analytic a did work for the trump campaign among many others
and how cambridge analytic i had gotten at hand somewhat questionable on the data have some fifty million facebook users well we are having you back as facebook announces that upset if it was actually maybe more like eighty seven million right so facebook is revised assessments it saying hey we are
using the maximum projection we can figure out exactly how many people's information was taken through this scandal that's involved with cambridge analytical another saying hate eighty seven million it's not fifty million as we as previously said do we have any idea of how they were off by a factor of what seventy five per se
said well this is the the major problem with this whole facebook scandal right it's it's the idea that facebook has put out all of this information and it doesn't have any definitive way to track precisely each of these pieces of data where it goes what happens to it and what people use it for so they are merely making an estimate
about how many people were potentially affected and that could change and they can't get it back like he gone
that's the nature of information if i tell you something and you tell three other people and they tell for the people that information is out there in the world and you can't retrieve that nor can i ever figure out how he will actually saw it what with that information be used for you know it's interesting you use it for a number of ways but the political aspect of this
right is is to develop profiles of people to be able to target individuals politically with advertising with get out the vote efforts and so on and so forth based on information that they've taken from facebook profiles whether that's where you live what your political party is whether you prefer certain types of television shows weather
you have children all these things can be used to better targeted political advertising towards you or propaganda depending on your point of view depending on where you stand
so next week and this is a pretty big news and will be a big deal next week mark zuckerberg the ceo and creator of facebook will testify on capitol hill
he'll be there for two days have been to couple of different hearings joint hearing of the senate judiciary and commerce committee is followed by the house energy and commerce committee
and it almost feels like this week they're doing clean up on i'll i'm about to have to testify before congress
okay so this is not just limited to the cambridge analytical problem they've got a number of different issues ranging from how russia use facebook as a platform to in two thousand and sixteen election
to influence the american political process and they just announced something on that too yeah this week facebook announced that it had shut down hundreds of facebook and instagram account that word used by russia's internet research agency this is that troll for that that company that was actively trying to create device
i'd in the american electorate you know trying to incite the laugh trying to incite the right creating fake accounts on facebook and twitter to provoke people and to ultimately boost the campaigns of bernie sanders and donald trump and harm hillary clinton's can end they were indicted as part of the most
solar probe as part of the russian investigation and also i have been targeted by sanctions from the tramp administration that's correct
but ultimately it gets to a deeper problem in the american political system which is how do we know what kind of information
we're providing to facebook and powerful tech companies what do they do with it and how do we know what information they're providing back to us in the form of advertising who controls and the the level of transparency their facebook must provide us when we see information white so so next week zuckerberg is going to go before this congressional
committee and they're all going to grandstand him for a while but that but he's probably gonna have to wear a suit and not a honey
most of this is the most important part of this but the next most important part is about like they're going to a small these questions but do we have a sense of what kinds of policies has anybody proposed anything in terms of how do we prevent this in the future like is it all about transparency is it about it
what data they take or no take well there are a couple of major issues here one is that the internet research agency as an example they spent tens of thousands of dollars putting forward advertisements on facebook and other social media platforms and there was no accountability transparency about where that money came from so there are
proposed regulations that would require just like on television when you see a political advertisement it says it's sponsored by some political candidate some sponsored by is sponsored by the patriotic americans of america exactly i mean what does that mom and apple pie and arena but at least at least of is sponsored by the patriotic americans of america that is a committee that's ready
you could walk wherever they would have to actually register yeah well theoretically that will be the only reason for this kind of regulation right that you would need to have a chain of accountability behind whatever it is so if you get an advertisement on facebook right now there's not there's not a regulation that says hey you must tell people
cool where this money is coming from whose funding this campaign well let me ask you a broader question about congress because i've heard congress members of congress to described facebook in a lot of different ways do you think there's a consensus that facebook is either a giant unregulated utility the most powerful publisher on the planet a pipeline version
began to or some kind of consumer surveillance tool i mean how do members of congress see facebook now
there's a wide variety of views on the hill from left to right right that but ultimately the we have to see facebook for what it is which is that it is taking our personal information as part of its business model and selling it to advertise we're we we're in different if the services for a year the product
that facebook may have money basically by trying to figure out who we are in the particulars of our lives and then selling that customize asian to advertisers right if advertisers want to find people who live in washington dc who own to catch and they really liked a particular book that's the level of specificity
eighty that facebook can offer advertisers so they so advertising in turn need to pay less to reach the individuals they want to talk so you're saying tim that the biggest the most urgent issue seems to be the privacy issue well yes said that there are more than then russia use facebook to corrupt american american i don't want to rank the as problem because
both major problems you know there's the privacy problem and there's the accountability problem right
they're on the privacy side they're on the e u for example has regulations to say you have a right to know what kind of data that tech companies collect on you and you have a right also to be to be shown what that data is and to request it be deleted if you ask
for it you know that's not necessarily something that that congress is totally on board with but mark zuckerberg has said that's the spirit the general idea of regulations that with that facebook would move towards or would be more supportive of do we have a sense of how big of a priority this is not for alarming
but for americans themselves i mean how i know i've seen pulling that democrats favor ability of facebook has fallen by more than it has for republicans but in general how how worried are americans are people giving up their facebook accounts left and right
zuckerberg himself or said look this is not something that has this campaign to delete facebook hasn't had a substantial impact on a number of users and most people aren't paying that much attention you know who the folks here
who a lot of the folks here listening to the pot right now aren't going to ultimately delete their facebook has the thing about this is that it's an incredibly useful social tool them i use it all the time to figure out what what my friends are up to what they're doing who likes wide and what's interesting amongst the people whose views
i care about and we can't forget can just abandon or forget about that in the context of this conversation people keep facebook as long as they believe that the benefits of that social connection that you create with your family and friends outweighs any loss of privacy i mean all all sorts of
things that we do with our modern life now
have cost in terms of losing our privacy whether it's you know i'm going for iran and my tip is going to track my route
you know or
or you know i'm going to use a diet app and i'm going to track a number of calories that i'm using and that's a social thing for some reason or i use van mo and for some reason i need to broadcast to all my friends exactly why i'm doing the financial transactions i'm doing or yes yeah all my friends know every time i ran because that person faced work i my goodness i appreciate
it actually
idea listeners the good news for you is we will be talking even more about facebook we're going to have a pod cast that will come out after that first hearing so i mean look for it in your feet probably wednesday morning is what i would guess or if you're a night owl tuesday night
and now it is time for that thing that we do at the end of the show called can't let it go where we talk about one thing we cannot stop thinking about this week politics or otherwise tim this is your first time in the can't let it go chair
the spotlight is on and i think we should start with you as a result
so the thing i can't like oh is that you had a story this week about the evolving technologies behind the creation of faith audio that we can now create people have audio clips of people saying things they never said you know there's a small monetary i'll start up it's called liar bird and basically you feed i arbor liar e o l y
whoa
firebird and and they basically feed them a minute of someone talking with you or me
or a politician like barack obama donald trump
feed them a minute of someone speaking the new types of tax and the next thing you know you have been able to mimic that person speaking you've created a fake audio clip of them saying something and this is deep deep group repercussions for american society and politics whether we can trust what we're hearing a weather new
news is legitimate or illegitimate and he could be used both to create audio that or quotes that never happened or it can be used because this technology exists for politicians to say oh well i never actually said that that would fake through technology while so i first learned about the sick
the after rogue one the star wars movie came out because i know i know i know
all comes back eurostar where your brand a strong well because my mind was blown with how they had created all of this video that look just like the actors who were no longer living and i called my brother and he was like oh yeah you think that's crazy they can do the audio to and i've been freaking out for like how long has it been since rogue one came out and
now i never even thought to connect it to politics and you're connecting to politics and it's scary you had the technology has evolved into dramatic way i think we have a clip on hi everybody
this is i'm happy to share with you will smaller announcement of articles for wherever they want to bury their website where you can create a digital copy of your wars
you to record one volume
this is just the beginning and they are working hard to improve your results it's a combination of obama and his speak and spell
it's not perfect but that was their original effort when they first launched the beta right
early on a year ago or more than a year ago and here's the thing the technology is only going to get better there are only so many specific sounds in the human voice and so basically they use artificial intelligence to identify how each individual says the sounds combine them together and smooth it out to mimic
real speech well how far away from video being able to be pretty much they're in pretty much there in the sense that you could create a video that audio clip we just heard was that there is a accompanying video of barack obama lips moving along with that audio clip so we're at a place where it could
to me that we can't trust our eyes can't trust our ears when we see and hear things from disreputable sources
okay
that is depressing
mind blown
danielle why can't you like other girl from the ball that i'm in yes series
and i don't know if we can bring you back i'm scared you yeah me too
let me try so i wanted sucked to you guys ever movie recommendation it's for my favorite fantasy movie from the nineteen nineties
i happened across it last night on amazon and i thought i have to watch this again and it's a movie called dave that's not a new middle way ever heard of no no no so that is not true bara have you heard of day of course i love gay guy with a great movie with kevin kline who is the accidental president right for people who are listing in this is a movie that
i'm out in nineteen ninety two three nineteen ninety three so is so i bring this up in part because like a i rediscovered it you should go watch it
it's ridiculous it's kind of upsetting but also i discovered it is the twenty fifth anniversary
a couple of weeks here
australia makes feel old now if we have seen it i mean yeah a little bit i mean i'm old to hear but like watching it last night i was live tweet to get i was having a hell of a time because i don't have a life and i read but like it's so the plot of the movie is this kevin kline he plays both the president and this guy named dave the president has a stroke while actually hour
if his mistress and so the sort of oily evil figures surrounding the president higher the look alike other kevin kline to go play the president and do their bidding and as it turns out because of the great american myth that any man would be great at being a president that the every man kevin kline strolls into the white house and doesn't
better job that the president did briggs it is see charles grodin to adjust the federal budget
it's really realistic fashion and
also is a better husband to the first lady and sigourney weaver falls in love with him etc etc
it's an absolutely right and and there's a cameo for me to tote murder words yeah yeah
you should definitely go watch this marla ago
okay but i can't let go of is this really great story that was on the internet that everybody has to go and read about the hotel
tory a british columbia yeah for gave a guest who many many years ago seventeen years ago had trashed one of their rooms and when you read this facebook post okay i'm giving facebook
brand of applause for this this guy was from nova scotia described how he brought a lot of special pepperoni to give to his navy buddies in victoria but there wasn't a fridge in his room and he wanted to keep the meat cool so he left it on the window sill it was a kind of a cold april day
like it is today in washington he went out when he came back he found his room full of sea goals
i've been eating the pepperoni and as he says as he as he explains pepperoni does something really horrendous to the sea gulls digestive
has room was covered with with with chunks of pepperoni and coop and feathers and everything was trashed when he came in and started trying to get them out they flew around and crashed into things and broke lamps and the the coffee table and then he had a he says in a moment of clarity i grabbed a bath towel and through it over one
the birds and then threw it out the window but the seagull wrapped in the bathtub tell landed on some tourists terminal arriving at this hotel for their famous high tea he also tried to get rid of the the birds by throwing one of his shoes at them the shoe and the bird went out the window and then he real
he had to go to a dinner a business dinner any only one shooting ran out he grabbed the shoe we watched enough he used a hair dryer to dry it but then the power in the hotel went off it was like a better than a marx brothers movie and cleaning lady came up and he looked at her and he just said i'm sorry and he went out to dinner he will ban he got a lifetime ban
and from the hotel seventeen years later he wrote to the hotel to say i think i've served my time could i come back and and be a pain gets to your hotel and they granted him a pardon and there is a picture of him talking to two women at the front desk of though tell and they are laughing and tears streaming down their face just like they were when i
i read this story isn't really worth it it's going to cheer you up

thursday may third things might have changed by the time you heard it keep up with all of your m b our politics coverage on the npr one app m p r dot org and of course your local npr station now here's a show
it's the npr politics pod cast here with our weekly roundup of political news it has been a week of big revelations in the russia investigation and surrounding legal challenges the president trumpets facing last night former new york city mayor rudy giuliani provided yet another one giuliani
new member of trumps legal team said the president did in fact reimburse a lawyer for a payment made to a porn star and he suggested the president would not sit down for an interview with the special counsel will get to that and everything else we learned about the muller probe this week plus the rest of the week's news and of course we will end the show with what we just
can't let go of this week i'm scott death row i cover congress i'm carrie towns and justice correspondent and nicer roscoe i covered the white house and i'm to mac i cover national security and politics and everybody so we were going to start with all the mall stuff right like that was already planned and then rudy giuliani just threw a wrench in that let's just
just dig into rudy should we their hits keep countered with rudy absolutely so let's just go rudy giuliani of course is a new member to a legal team that has seen a whole lot of shake us we will get to those shakeups momentarily so he goes on fox news wednesday night and says yes present interim did reimburse michael cohen for that one hundred thirty thousand dollar pay me
may two stormy daniels in exchange for daniels keeping quiet about an alleged affair that was money that was paid by by his lawyer the way i would do out of his for from fun so whatever funds doesn't matter the president reimbursed that over a period of several made so there's a lot of context
work through here but let's just start with this what rudy giuliani said and prompted on fox news to the surprise of sean hannity asia that really contradicts what both president trump has said and what michael cohen has said right yes so president trump was asked about this on air force one not long ago and he
he was as where did the money come from and he said he didn't now and sell wow that and maybe could be technically true that he didn't know where michael cohen got the money it seems relevant to mention that he might have been reimbursing cohen for the payment and the implication when that question was asked how he didn't know him
anything about the payment and sold there had always been this kind of lingering how did this work where you have this personal attorney for down or donald trump
going and making this arrangement and the president didn't know about it he wasn't present at the time but the he didn't know about it and so now there is there still questions
giuliani was saying that the president did he knew generally what was going on the he didn't know the specifics and he giuliani and saying that he only found out about ten days ago the full extent of the arrangement carry can you connect the dots for and i feel it the dots frequently need to be reconnected in this com
decision about what this payment made in october two thousand and sixteen how that ties into the broader legal conversation right now why this matters
mostly manners because michael cohen has been raided by the f b i in recent weeks his hotel room his residence and his law office where all rated and we know investigators took a lot of material from those premises and their sifting through it right now michael cohen is under active criminal and
masturbation by prosecutors in the us attorney's office in the southern from new york which rudy giuliani used to lead by the way and there's been a ton of speculation about whether michael cohen is going to be under so much pressure that he might flip on the president of the united states where the he knows something about trumps activities during the campaign or some other active
cities that he might want to share with a special counsel team or other prosecutors now of course michael cohen is wrong doing says he's not gonna flip on the present a united states but the legal pressure is getting hotter on michael cohen and rudy giuliani didn't help them all that much last night yeah now
a big payment made that benefits somebody running for president in an election just a few weeks away might not be a payment right there's a lot of campaign finance implications here right so the big question here is whether or not this payment was made in order to influence or affect him election in some way and there's the law and then
the application a little odd though so before we get too far ahead on whether they're going to bust michael cohen for suppose it violation of campaign finance law have to really take a look at the reality of how that might work the federal election commission is really deeply deadlocked and in order to actually investigate and then
impose penalties for violation of campaign finance law it would have to almost unanimously agree to go ahead with this and republicans on the commission are unlikely to let this move into the investigation stage let alone
the point where we'd have penalties
so how would we describe the planned or and big sure of out what is the best way to describe the tone and the frantic this of the white house reaction after rudy giuliani just share information on fox news will it's clear the white house staff
f was caught off guard sarah sanders said today that the first time she learned that president trump reimbursed michael collins was last night on fox fox news so it seems like some members of the team were not clued in that this was going to happen in their first response the first responses from the white house on
this were essentially we're not gonna comment on an ongoing legal manner but of course that contradicts because they had talked about this issue maybe not deeply but they had talked about the president he's made clear his position that he didn't know anything about it they've talked about sarah is even talked about arbitration with stormy daniels
throughout all of that it was notable how little president trump said about it because this is someone who can not not comment on anything cannot not comment on anything on television and stormy daniel sits down with sixty minutes and trump doesn't say anything aside from that brief back and forth on air force one that change this morning president trump went on twitter whole big tweets store
from taken full advantage of the world of two hundred whatever characters and i will just give the highlights here mr cohen an attorney received a monthly retainer not from the campaign and having nothing to do with the campaign from which he entered into through reimbursement a private contract between two parties known as non disclosure agreement or these
agreements are very common among celebrities and people of wealth in this case it is in full force and effect in will be used in arbitration for damages against miss clifford parentheses daniels the agreement was used to stop the false and extortionist accusations made by her about an affair despite already having signed a detail letter admitting that there was no affair
prior to that violation by mr clifford and her attorney this was a private agreement money from the campaign or campaign contributions played no role in this transaction we should i mean these are a paragraph form tweets that while and it is announced just like the way president talks and
there is a typo it the okay little bit of authenticity
you know these tweets i would guess that they did go through an attorney because they're not necessarily in president trumps the usual vernacular but he's making the point this has nothing to do with the campaign and giuliani kind of further elaborate on this morning on fox news saying this was a personal matter
so they're trying to make the argument like this happened yes i i am connected to it in the sense that i reimbursed
michael cohen who's this guy who deals with these kind of crazy issues for me he i think president did refer to it as the crazy stormy dan use isn't but nothing illegal happened let me just jump in here so while both giuliani and trumped maintain that no campaign funds or campaign contributions were used to pay
this alleged trash money
that doesn't necessarily matter under the law what matters is if the money was used to influence the election and we know that this payment was made to stormy day and yours aka stephanie clifford before the election so the timing is suspicious and interesting to lawyers here the other thing that's interesting is the notion
that according to rudy giuliani these funds were paid throughout the course of two thousand and seventeen rudy giuliani says personal funds of president trump obviously investigators are going to be able to see those records and see exactly how much money went out and howard carter michael cohen the question of when the original payments were made
they'd really dies kind of indicate the purpose of the payment right because rudy giuliani on fox and friends this morning he said well look imagine if it came out on october fifteenth in the middle of the last debate with hillary clinton he understands that there is a political dimension to this payment
undercuts the argument right there i mean really giuliani is a long time veteran of the new york tabloids scene but he does have a history of shooting himself in the foot not only on this kind of undercuts the whole legal point which is hey this is not a campaign payment this is a personal payment by
the campaign ramifications of it and you recall that he also shot himself in the foot previously when he insisted that the travel ban that the trump administration and put out there was actually a muslim which undercooked the entire legal rationale for the administration trying to put forward a travel there okay there is so much more to
talk about on this front but this is only the first of many different up to its we need to get through here giuliani talked about a lot of other key things but first we should point out that he is part of trumps legal team now he has a new member of the legal team and there have been shake up since he joined the legal team last night another big change tie
cobb leaves the legal team he has replaced by a lawyer named emmett flood carry why does this matter well ty cobb has been the leading voice within the white house of cooperating with a special counsel he's turned over lots and lots of documents made available dozens of witnesses more than dozens of witnesses inside the way
it has to talk to the special counsel investigators and com is always wanted to be the path of least resistance he is now leaving and they're bringing in a guy from ah what's known as a scorched earth law firm in washington williams and connelly this emmett flood really smart really conservative pedigree former supreme court clerk to the lady
justice antonin scalia and emmett flood has a very interesting background he's one of the lawyers who helped offend president bill clinton during his impeachment travails and emmett flood was also brought in to help vice president dick cheney and george w bush white house when they were having fights about executive privilege with members of congress so it floods arrival
signifies a new phase in the white house approach to the special counsel and maybe a more pugilistic face and so we might expect to see even more criticism directly of robert mahler by the president well i will say this sky the formal announcement the white house put out saying am flag was joining said that in flag was joining
to respond to the witch hunt by a special counsel robert more i don't know how much more how you can get the that of this oh let's get something else giuliani said on fox news last night there's been this ongoing conversation about whether or not president tromp will be interviewed by robert or what the circumstances that would be here's what giuliani said i would lie
to get one not on the rolls i'd wanted a videotaped and not videotape and audiotapes want to make sure that all misrepresent as and shoes but this is an outrageous
miscarriage of justice
do you typically get to make that many demands of how you will talk to investigators if investigators one of the
don't do this at home rather frightening
the point here is that the present in the united states is special person he may have more sway in trying to negotiate with prosecutors who won his testimony than a normal person but the point here is also that no man or woman in america is above the law and if robert mahler really wants the president's testimony
he can always send a subpoena live the white house to try to demand it
rudy giuliani has engaged in trying to set a whole bunch of conditions these are conditions the special prosecutor
might not want to abide by and has no obligation to abide by in fact the president may be better off in agreeing to a voluntary interview because ben his lawyers can show up in health i mean maybe interrupt if he's getting jammed up or you know he can do it in the white house as opposed to go to the courthouse which would be a major league lollapalooza extravaganza
spectacle so rudy who sophisticated about the legal system a former us attorney himself is acting as if he's the man with all the cards in his hand in in fact i don't think he is i could you catches up to speed on what we learned about conversations about possible use of subpoenas this week from a couple different report there was a report that mother
his team had told some of trumps lawyers that they might subpoena hand that they might actually go through with that but it does seem like that was a way of saying look we don't have to play around with you guys you're trying to make all these demands we don't have to do that we don't have to play ball okay so we read these reaper
towards the there was a subpoena floated as part of the ongoing back and forth and we've known for a while carry that there is this ongoing conversation about whether there will be an interview the other big report this week that kind of shed more light on this was a new york times report of a list of forty nine different questions that muller's team is interested in learning the answers to
what jumped out at you from that list of questions there was a whole bunch of questions about possible obstruction of justice the president's relationships with an alleged mistreatment of his attorney general jeff sessions the firing of f b i director james komi various attempts to possibly fire robert muller talk within the white house of getting rid of the special counsel him
self and then there's a whole bunch of questions about the president's business dealings and relationships in the campaign with people who may have had contacts with russia people like national security advisor former national security advisor michael flynn who's gone on to plead guilty and cooperate with investigators there was also a good question in interesting question about former campaign term and pa
oh man afford and whether metaphor may have been engaged and back channel conversation to with russians during the campaign that question may suggest that the special council has evidence for a man fourth right hand man rick gates who recently pleaded guilty to yeah i mean as a national security reporter or what what interests me most is the questions that relate to russia
one question was shed what so what sort of discussions the war there during the campaign if any about possibly meeting with vladimir that was really interesting question to me there were questions about possible real estate deals that he may or may not have been engage with any possibility of of real estate deals in the future is
in russia and one of the things that we have really never understood during the twenty sixteen campaign is why did the president come out with such a a foreign policy that was so friendly towards russia and consistent consistently not only towards russia but on the issues of sanctions and on the issues of how to address
what's going on in ukraine the president has always had a view that's more favorable to the russian point of view there was nothing politically advantageous about taking these positions during the campaign and so mahler's trying to understand how did you come to that conclusion and that is the heart of the quote unquote collusion question yet even though the president we did that
none of these questions
involved collusion and all maybe the word collusion didn't show up as we've discussed here and infant item collusion is not in a federal crime so whereas i certainly won't certainly plenty of questions about that would raise the question of collusion or in what the trunk campaign did or did not do with regards to to russia but i think this
the white house and what backers of the white house when they look at those questions the argument that they are trying to make his aunt look this is a fishing expedition you're looking all over the place you're only supposed to be looking at did this campaign have ties to russia and you're asking about you know when i was thinking when i was fine different people and so that is there
argument that the scope of this investigation has gotten too broad let me just say this if this is a fishing expedition the robert muller special counsel team has already caught rick gates michael flynn george papadopoulos thirteen russians whose names i can run off a taboo who allegedly were engaged in the information
warfare and the course of the game in there there are a fish on the table and just a more recent years

hey i'm kelly recovers from embedded below spencer works at a coal mine in kentucky
when i start to ask him about a future without call and i'm gonna say so
learn whole story on npr one apple or wherever you get into guess and we are back we were mentioning just before the break president trump supporters and the vocal critics of this investigation in the white house in congress the clinics in congress had a pretty loud and eventful
week first report of the washington post that some members of the house freedom caucus which is the tea party wing of the house republican conference had drafted articles of impeachment against rod rosenstein the deputy attorney general who is tasked with over seeing the mall or investigation and in that position has become the focal point of a lot of the
the anger from president trump and and his allies about this investigation rosenstein like robert mahler is often pretty quiet about this often doesn't respond to this criticism that change this week he was giving an appearance at the museum and he had thoughts there were people who the than making threats privately and publicly against me
for quite some time and i think they should understand by now the department of justice is not going to be extorted we're going to do what's required by the rule of law and any kind of threats that anybody makes are not gonna affect the way we do our job carry given how much or how little rosenstein usually says and public have spicy is the statement this is super spy
see for our videos
not rosenstein is a very smart guy he's a career justice department official almost thirty years in the o j five attorneys general nine presidents doesn't normally like to pick fights this was really bold from rod rosenstein i'm liking i'm calling this rods last stand or maybe second to last and here he has
had enough he talked about how these house freedom caucus members didn't even have the courage to put their name on these draft articles of impeachment he said if the justice department when we you somebody of wrong doing we use credible witnesses and evidence we don't just wing documents out there and have people forced to respond to them and he pretty much
he said
he's drawing a red line here he does not want to make any more concessions to some of these people who are acting in bad faith in big picture this is about an investigation that they see as a witch hunt but it's also more specifically about information they're requesting from the department of justice from rosenstein what exactly do they want at this point remember
these members of congress mostly chairmen republican chairman of house committees and others have been demanding from months now information about the or page wiretap application information about various applications for the foreign intelligence surveillance court in other things and related to the hillary clinton investigation the clinton foundation and rescue
and others what appears to be the last straw though is this the mark meadows picture of a leading member of the house freedom caucus wants the justice department to turn over something that rod rosenstein himself wrote in august twenty seventeen memorialize is what special counsel robber mahler a supposed to be investigating and we know someone that mature
ariel involves paul me and a for because it came out in the course of manner fourth case but a lot of fat material is redacted the house members want to know exactly what robert morris investigating the hurt me end of the ongoing criminal investigation in the justice department says no way so behind the scenes there
he is an agreement between the house judiciary committee and the as permanent about the transfer of documents right well there appears to be in agreement to which people like trade gatti one of the one of the chairman has body and to but this faction of the house freedom caucus is not on board with that him and remember the president has
threatening rod rosenstein himself all year long or really since last year and the thinking among democrats in the house is they are just itching for a reason to get trump to fire rod rosenstein and members of the house freedom caucus among others keep throwing issues in the air wondering will this be the one will best
be the one and so this guy has been walking on a tight rope since the special counsel was appointed in may of two thousand and seventeen that's not a great feeling
trump weight and yet again after after the he did so he treated about this is a rig system they don't want to turn over documents to congress referring to the justice department what are they afraid of why and less redacting why such an equal justice so he said that at some point he will have no
no choice but to use the powers granted to the presidency and get involved so that sounds bad what does that mean what is so it's not exactly clear he has said that he could be more involved in the justice department the president does a broad powers he certainly has powers to fire people and to get who he wants in in so that that
authorities pretty unlimited and so if he wants to get involved he could he has kind of done this will he won't he he's kind play with it flirted with it but not actually gone through yet in some people are betting are republicans in congress in the senate
our senator grassley and other people are saying don't do this this will be a political suicide this could lead to your impeachment if you got rid of rosenstein blood the president is kind of sinning out some signals that you could consider some taken action in terms of the draft bill that we saw in the report i think
often things they get introduced in congress get over simplified and people think oh this is going to happen now i mean a draft bill from one corner of of the house republican conference is a long way from a vote on this is a long way from anything seriously having a chance of passing house speaker paul ryan
senate a majority leader mitch mcconnell have repeatedly said that they support the investigation they support mahler but i think it's really important in this one sense that there has been so much conversation about his congress going to protect robert mahler how his congress going to step in here
the house for your caucus as we've talked a lot especially when it comes to spending bills has a huge say on on what issues will come to a vote on because there are a lot of republican vote and this shows you that the momentum in corners of the republican party is not to protect robert mahler but to in fact do quite the opposite to try and tank this investigation this investor
location that focused on the inner circle of the white house and may be headed toward an interview with the president of the united states himself in other words is their house freedom caucus trying to get information about the investigation to help the president protect himself that now what the the or day is about you and if these are remedies or shingles like you said
likely that these types of legislation would be successful at all but it's kind of the analog to what we saw in the and we discuss in this cast cast this legislation to protect mall or that made its way through the senate judiciary committee that mitch mcconnell said that will not make its way the senate floor but these are signals these are signals to the white house these are signals to the president
on the one hand from the senate hey don't fire mahler on the other hand from the house
we we can mess around with this investigation all here
we could talk for hours more about all this stuff we're going to end it there but i'm pretty sure this will come up in episode after episode after episode of a future pod cast
we're going to shift gears here and talk about john mccain for a few minutes the republican senator from arizona has been battling the brain cancer since last july mccain has a new book coming out and fear was actually given exclusive access to a segment of the audio book this is john mccain reading from the lab
last chapter of the book the clip is about three minutes long and we're going to listen to it
i don't know how much longer be beer maybe i'll have another five years maybe with the advantage i'm in college you will find new treatments for my cancer they will extend my life
maybe i'll be gone before you finish my predicament as well rather on predictable
but i'm prepared for either contingency her least i'm getting prepared
some things i like to take care of first to work good need finishing and some people i need to see and i want to talk to my fellow americans a little more i may
my fellow americans no association more to me
we're not always right well impetuous and impatient and rush into things without knowing what we're really doing we are you over little differences and loosely and exaggerated them the lasting breaches we can be selfish and quick sometimes to shift the blame for our mistakes others but our country tis of the one
very good we've done in the world so much more good than harm he served ourselves of course but we have my gutters free safe and prosperous because we weren't threatened by other people's liberty and success
we need each other
we need friends in the world and they need us
the bell tolls for my friend humanity concern as we are to take measured pride and have not been an island we were involved in mankind so this is john mccain talking at the was clearly the and of a very long career in public service he was in the navy
famously shot down several years as a prisoner of war in vietnam he goes to the house of representatives serves as an arizona senator for decades and in two thousand and eight he was the republican party's nominee for president before i leave i'd like to see our politics begin to return to the purposes in prague dishes the distinguish our history from the history of other name
patients had like to see as recover our sham said we're more alike than different where citizens of public made of shared ideals forged in a new world to replace the tribal enmities the tormented the old one
even in times of political turmoil such as these we share that are some heritage and the responsibility to embrace it
whether we think each other right or wrong and our views on the issues of the day we all each other our respect as long as our character marriage respect and as long as we share for all our differences from all around girls debates and enliven and sometimes to mean our politics a mutual devotion to the ideals our nation was conceived
porn that all are created equal and liberty an equal justice have a natural right of all
those rage and have with the human heart and from there though they may be assailed they can never be wrenched i want to urge americans for as long as i can remember that they shared devotion new human age is our cruised heritage and our most important and loyalty
then i'd like to go back to our valley and she the creek run after the rain and hear the would whisper in the wind i want to smell the and a breeze and feel the schon on my shoulders i want to watch the hawks han from the sycamore and then take my leave town for a place near my old friend check larson in the
cemetery and the severn backward began
that's from john mccain new book called the rest last wave tim what's the best way to describe the space that john mccain is carved out in american politics of the last few decades you know i listen to that last three minutes and he sounds kind of sick kids old he's tired that's not the john mccain i remember
well remember the i'll remember john mccain who
we called him a plot hole maverick but before that he was a genuine american war hero in hours and hours in hanoi traveling a few months ago and i happened to go by the lake where he was shot down in vietnam and there's a monument there and it calls them and air pirate how many among us right
it will ever be known by a moderator like that he's also a really funny guy you don't really get that sense from the book or that segment but one time
there was a foreign trip and we're both on it together and which talking it happened be around thanksgiving and he was talking about frying turkeys he says you know whatever you do make sure you don't do it on your deck i set fire to my deck
but the then came the punchline he said well i've been in worse tech fires
of course to hurricane was on the us as for are still what it when the deck caught fire and a bomb destroyed his airplane and he managed to scramble off the the top of the airplane get to safety
it's like in the senate
typically the more high profile you are wrong less likely you are to spend any time talking to reporters or reflecting on things elizabeth warren literally never talks to reporters at the capitol she'll just walk right past and not talk to you john mccain would stand up and talk as long as you wanted to funny about it
and be irritated about it in snap at reporters elections he thought were irritating but also give you a long explanation and thoughtful explanations and in digging for as long as reporters one would walk up to reporters and his signature line was what
what what do you know when when yeah what do you want and you know and he has he is a very short temper if you ask him a question that he was stupid he would tell you sell and when i least twenty four show just starting to cover the defense industry for political new to the capital john mccain is obviously a big
deal and he just yells at me for a question he didn't like he that it was silly are dumb or whatever but he's the only senator who after casting votes he came back he was looking for me and he wanted to personally apologize for being rude to me earlier i mean he's the kind that's the and he did that out at least two occasions
he does have a hot temper but he also has had of a deep well of conscience like it bugged him it bugged him that he was mean yeah i think it's him which he said i think that really stands out to have a policy and come back and apologize i mean yeah no that's not news
standard the kazan i think that
senator mccain has obviously but come on icon of the senate in recently you know in these years
part of the the thing that or part of what critics would say about president trump one ended things they look at his treatment of senator mccain and even after his diagnosis he still will bring that that senator mccain did not vote for the healthcare bill this is something that he still bring and even now and so critics and president
grant will say that that shows a lack of graciousness on his part and obviously even during the campaign he never apologize for saying that you know he admires people who don't get shot down writers kept her you don't get captured yeah you know i gotta say listening to them as three minutes the quality of his voice
where he is now in his life very moving
i heard him saying once you know what the legacy of human rights the accomplishments america is already great i read that in part as a sub tweet of the current president and i also thought about that famous picture of ulysses ask grant who was dying dying of cancer
and wrote an autobiography to save his family from financial ruin the better of him on the porch finishing that book
john mccain voice in that clip we just heard brought me back to that place another incredible american
well we're going to take one more quick break and we will come back with can't let it go
this message comes from in he our sponsor lisa the mattress with over eleven thousand and five star reviews and mission to and medalist this in america the lisa mattress was designed to provide support and pressure relief to everybody type and sleeps time for a deeper night's sleep
lisa plants a tree for every order and donates a mattress for every ten soul get a one hundred and twenty five dollars of free shipping and one hundred knights to try the lease a mattress go to l e a dot com slash npr
we are six months away from the midterms and i am already passed for predictions wow i was wrong about trouble i thought he lose by about three million votes he
cincinnati a republican strategist on a possible blue whale next time on it's been omitted from npr
okay now it is time to end the show like we do every week with can't let it go where we all share one thing we cannot stop thinking about this week politics or otherwise i'm going to go first and i think mine is a little bit of both now we start the show every week with the time stamp saying things may have changed by the time
here there's pod cast the last time to hammer keith was on the pod cast couple weeks ago her can't let it go was about seth meyers and his wife having a very crazy baby delivery situation that you mention that my wife and i had a little less crazy than seth meyers baby situation that we had a new baby so tam tapes that pod cast
pam goes home later that night before many people have heard that pod cast things changed and tam had her baby little boy named gibson
and then not only that are produced a date or farrington had another baby named agent so three boys have been born to the npr politics team in the last few weeks that as a lot of it is it's a baby boom
congrats to tam tam of course will be hanging out with gives him for a while and she will be back on the pod in a little bit of time asia budget okay so this week i can't let go of and we talked about this guy a little earlier ty cobb but not ty cobb his moustache
it's long and luxurious and a will maintain his hand law i don't know exactly how he gets the curl it's got a buddy some sort of some sort of its it is impressive
he reminds me a little bit of yosemite sam from learning to i really love that that cartoon way it's i mean of course is curls up whereas it's the sam's is down but you know people on twitter when ty cobb it was announced that he was retiring they were saying that
there was a competition between john bolton mustache jump on the new national security advisor and cards mustache and that bolton one out and so that's why
a one much that is exactly and so i can not let go of that mustache john bolton was once asked if if he could repealed iran deal if he just shaved off his master england
and he said he would review review
some things are just too much to ask man is because the thing is for all of the other ways that facial hair has been in the last few years and it seems like it might be going out a little bit but everybody had been everywhere it didn't really penetrate the world of politics that much but you have a lot of robust mustaches the in the trump orbit while remember that many of these gentlemen
our after tom selleck magnum p i era
they're not doing in brooklyn and there are doing like tom selleck now in the array journey i heard the question or coming in and worth
hey bush he must have
moving on from mustaches or not i don't know what you're going to say to him what can you not let go
just as related or know it's it's it's basically i was watching the fox news debate oh they hosted a debate with the republican candidates for west virginia senate and one of the candidates is this guy don blankenship he's a former mining ceo he was convicted to a year in federal prison because
he is mining company who was involved in the upper be branch mine disaster twenty nine people were killed and he was convicted of conspiring to willfully violate mine safety standards and i should say that actually npr did a ton of investigative reporting about that case at the time howard burgers one of our investigative reporters
so that's the best to set up and he's running for senate now and he was asked about the more investigation and essentially he is responsible was hey i know something about the feds i know something about how the justice department rolls over people and he got applause you got tears really yeah i thought that was it was just something i've been thinking about
that about how the current environment where in with the president going after the deal as he dies is really changing the views especially amongst the republican electorate about justice law and order and how are laws work while you know this white house has i've been in some interest in giving people second chances
jared kushner is leading this kind of prison reform
effort and we know this week on approached for clemency bid by kim car to actually in of our people so maybe they're trying to appeal to the redemption of power of redemption
there are a number of people who are running for office this year jaw pio low seriously little harder he was a a grim who's running for congress in staten island
so it's it's really interesting to see how the public see at least some parts of the public seem willing to forgive these sort of criminal convictions
or will see and elections now
they are i don't know if you need fifty plus one but you know
some percentage of americans are willing to overlook this and support you but forgive not in a way of like can trade apology and reform forgiven a away of like the feds came after me absolutely it's almost it's almost like it adds credibility in a way that you have been that the feds have come after you i think our pio
feels that way and i think that by a kinship feels that way well carry you know more about justice stuff than any of us
what can't you go
well i can't let go the twitter habit of george conway or conway of course is a very prominent lawyer
who was up at one point for a job and donald trump's justice department took his name out of a running towards conway also happens to be married to presidential advisor kelly yet conway interrupt conway from time to time tweets things that could be viewed as jabs at the president of the united states this morning for instance as we were
we're all dealing with a fall out from rudy giuliani his remarks on fox watch conway happened to tweet provisions after campaign finance law that have to do with personal gifts and loans and talking about how people even if their relatives or friends of candidates
give money for the purpose of influencing an election for federal office that's not okay under federal campaign finance law so i only time to point that timely time to point that out when you're why a phase one of the people are responding to crises in the white house it just seems to me a very interesting dynamic it's so fascinating that this
keeps happening in kelly and commonly was asked about this and she got very defensive but could you i was just thinking could you imagine if during the obama administration like susan rice had a husband who is treating like look into you should look into being gassed
okay the law is just it's unheard of all right well that is a rap for us for this week we will be back in your feed soon all the time in between our pod cast everybody always gets in touch with were saying hey are you going to do a pod cast about this about that aren't you broadcasting about this in between the pod guess we are always do

one app and under local npr station go care cc in colorado springs
it's the npr politics park cast tomorrow is another primary day so we're going to take a look at some of the big races in west virginia and elsewhere
talk about what to look for and what we could learn this week's results i'm scott tetro congressional correspondent i'm jessica taylor political reporter and under medical mountain air political editor earn everybody so we had a month or so more it was a bit of a law we didn't have that many primaries going on but tuesday's another big primary day and then we've got a steady stream of elections to
care about and cover going forward this is the big kick off very texas and illinois were kind of preseason games and away and there are some really big states on the ballot indiana west virginia ohio and these are big senate races to that are happening i think those are the big states were looking at because of the storylines we should mention north carolina
also has a primary that day to their whole lot of elections coming up from here until november but you know lots of primaries the primary season really kicks off here and there's a lot that we're gonna see when it comes to turn out and the enthusiasm who is really got this fired up mid terms are always years for activists and we're already seeing
the wings on both sides are the most fired up and heading to the polls here okay medical mentioned turn out that's one thing that i think this is the first big tell because we had big democratic races and the other two states we've already had and there's very competitive primaries in west virginia in indiana is that going to drive up turn out republicans going to get out to the polls that
enthusiasm gap i've talked to a lot of strategists over the past week that's something that's really worrisome to them so let's start with west virginia just who are the republicans running in the center primary so there are three major candidates you have evan jenkins who's a congressman he sort of the establishment favorite and republicans really think the he can best eat into democratic senator joe mansions base
sort of appeal to sort of these maybe traditional democrats and independents and know patrick moore he's the attorney general he's running a sort of i'm the true conservative he sued the obama administration a lot on regulations and different things too but he's been sort of pegged as a carpetbagger he ran for house in new jersey before he moved to the state in two thousand and six and he also was a
lobbyists for some pharmaceutical companies and they've really hit him over that and then the big wild card is don blankenship now he is the former ceo of massey energy with actually spent a year in prison after there was a mine explosion that killed twenty nine miners he was convicted of a misdemeanor over federal mine safety regulations he's still under parole
his parole actually ends tuesday night at midnight so right on election night and he is just come out swinging he saying you know i was a victim here of sort of federal prosecution and run run amok and is just hammering at his other opponents and and not just as other opponent mitch mcconnell and he has come out very much against it
the senate majority leader lectures take a moment and listen to one of his ads because i think that that sums it up more than any of us can mom
your gun and for you assume and wrong
mcconnell has created millions of jobs for vagina
so much has gotten route in fact those china family was given in terms of move about to swarm reborn are running false negative herbs are nourishment
oh child ocean recall him english speaker bought and mentally ill
lord and growing the swamp and create jobs for west virginia boy
begun will be joe mentioned image go move crusade to be so what he's referring to their with the china comments that mitch mcconnell is of course married to a chinese american woman elaine chow who is also transportation secretary has a law has had a long career in government her father owns a she
shipping company that's what blankenship is referring to but dominica cocaine mitch china family is this another potential roy more situation for republicans have blankenship gets the nomination yeah and blankenship is engaged sure woman who was born in china so it's just a whole lot of cross currents going on here but
republicans over the past decade have had a huge problem where they've been nominating candidates in places where they should win and it's cost them almost half a dozen seats so when you looking at this race here's another example where they could be nominating somebody who is seen as so odious image
general election that you could cost republicans in a state that donald trump one by more than anywhere else in the country trump in fact this morning tweet it out don't vote for blankenship vote for either of the other two candidates he said remember alabama so remember alabama could become a slogan here and for mitch mcconnell who very well knows what his
majority could have been it's remember delaware and remember nevada and remember lots of other places where republicans could have one in didn't write in because the news cycle moves on somebody times very quick reminder if you forgot this story already alabama roy more former state supreme court justice
this of course was it was accused of soliciting in approaching underage girls for relationships earlier in his in his career when he was in his thirties and as a result of that and a whole other bunch of things a democrat now holds ascendancy from alabama just one of the polls and like a few weeks ago i think republicans were feeling a little bit better they
blankenship kind of drop but in the past few days there's been a lot of concern so i watched a debate last week between the three of them and one thing that was notable was we saw morrissey and jenkins go really really have the against each other blankenship almost kind of felt like an afterthought but i think that negativity really might have propelled some voters to him there was almost
thirty percent of voters undecided here in the primary just today we've had both the more see and the jenkins campaign leaking internal polls showing them blankenship is now narrowly ahead it's almost a virtual tie and there's real concern that he could bomb back out because he's putting his own money into the race he spending millions on air in west virginia where
that some goes really far in a really inexpensive state and he saying i'm sort of this anti trump type person you dominica mentioned his tweet he's almost trying to frame this as okay well the swamps coming coming for me and everything to so i guess president trumps part now part of the swap
this is great news for joe mention the democrat in the race because you know he's got huge name id in the state he was governor of the state people know who he is he's had very favorable ratings in the past with republican voters
so this is again democrats looking at it and saying here's one that republicans should pick off or have a great chance at doing so and shooting themselves in the foot in just before we get to indiana i want to talk about a story that you published on npr or today that get into this there are so
many democrats on the ballot this year defending senate seats in states that donald trump one big in two thousand and sixteen and going into the republicans lot we can pick up a ton of senate seat yeah but the winds look much different and people like joe mansion who on paper should be losing by a lot really seemed to be doing well yes so democrats are defense
ending ten incumbents and states that president trump one of many of them like in west virginia by easily double digit very heavily i think of mansion sort of people i've talked to the kind of think of this and tears and he sort of a second tier race right now and mansions very similar to heidi high camp in north dakota john tester in montana on paper they should
easy pick up speed these are democrats that have been able to sort of solidify their own independent brand they have a lot of crossover appeal and the state and they're really not going to be as easy to knock off and i think in west virginia especially where you have such a messy primary but i think you know if even if it's more see your jenkins that comes out they've been bloodied so
much i had one democrat tell me you know they're airing their dirty laundry for us these are just ready made attack ads that we're going to use made the odds of democrats same at the senate right now are still long i mean they'd have to pick up a total of two seats net and to do so they'd have to win in places like arizona in tennessee which democrats are feeling
a little better about but i still think that they're more difficult
than they are likely because one of these democrats who you know last year when when everybody started first think about twenty eight eighteen they thought wow this guy's going to have are really hard time winning is joe donnelly the democrat representing indiana state that have gotten more and more republican every year it seems bunch people running to go against him in the
fall just give us the rundown of the republican indiana senate primer so this is another three way race you have congressmen toddler akita and luke messer running there and then my brawn is this outsider business of mine he served in the state legislature and he's port a lot of his own money into the race to again he sort of positioning himself as the outsider here saying you know i'm a job creator
the best as he had i've had a lot of people pointless to me as he actually walked around with cardboard cutouts of messer and rookie to and a debate they actually dressed almost similar and red ties and their kind of white middle aged congress man asking people to pick them apart and they couldn't so he sort of lump them together though to be fair it's probably hard for most voters that
most senate candidates area
and very trivial but he's he's been able to of lump them together on the way that they are creatures of washington they've been there and everything to the thing that braun has run a going against him as he was a long time democrat and they've sort of try to pay our way of sort of a wolf in sheep's clothing and you've had both rock to and messer run to travel as much as they can
roque to had an ad where he know he puts on a trump hat and says know i'm going to be with him every way and then messer actually this past week circulated a petition and congress to nominate president trunk for the nobel peace prize for his work on north korea so each trying to get out the base in this election yeah i mean the monaco
such an interesting dynamic and and susan davis to the store and this last week that for all the talk that we here in washington about look at donald trump's approval numbers is he a liability for the republican party and certainly in a lot of suburban house districts he is a liability and that's why the houses and play but you have center is and it's not just in the end of this is happening and so many races occur
across the country where the argument on the republican side is i'm more like donald trump the you even west virginia yeah we just which we were just talking about but yeah they're trying to out trump each other on this and you know the facts here is that you've got rookie to in his tagline of his as he says i'm pro life pro gun pro trump and there's a reason for that right interrupt
vulcan primary indiana is a state where only four counties in the two thousand and sixteen election went democratic now when you add up all of their votes there are a little more than one in four of all of the votes in the entire state those four counties but that's not where republican primaries are won and lost their won and lost in other parts of the state but when you do pivot to
general election us president trump won it by a lot but remember barack obama did when it and pull it out in two thousand and eight so there are some leading democratic voters in some of those places in the state where democrats are hoping that their be able to buoy joe donnelly come the fall and the more than these candidates out trump each other the more liable that make
some and the general election that's going to be tested and i think that's going to be tested in this entire twenty eight team mid term in a lot of different places year and a lot of money has been spent on this to right yeah i mean already we're seeing in this race more than twelve million dollars been spent on advertising in this primary which is a whole lot of money in indiana to be
spending so you see what the stakes are here the thing about india though to republicans feel comfortable with any of these nominees the i don't think they worry about being saddled with someone like blankenship so i think it is a real test their running closer to trump is that going to turn out their base in a general election or is it going to hurt them so just before we shift gears and talk about democrats for a minute any other
is there any particular thing you're looking for in tomorrow night's results when it comes to the senate primaries that i'll tell you something a bigger picture about what we can expect this fall i think that the big as wild wildcard is how blankenship dies if he's the nominee i think that's a race that becomes almost off the table for republicans and they're going to be saddled with someone that to very
like you said and alabama it's very annoying more like with sort of these outrageous comments they can sort of dragged down other nominees we saw this happen in two thousand and twelve that's how claire mccaskill and joe donnelly are still on the center because they had these nominees that said these things about abortion and that sort of drug down people
candidates across the field and then you can turn out these are big republican primaries are people going to come out and vote for them or are some of these trump voter still kind of not really caring or engage and if there's not a big numbers coming out for such competitive races where there's been million spent that's a big worry for republicans were going to take a quick
break when we come back i'm going to talk about some democratic races to watch

okay we're back and i want to talk about the gubernatorial primary in ohio
oh but before we do that i think it's interesting to point out that as we talk about these contentious republican primaries on the senate side the democratic incumbents in the senate by and large have avoided any nasty primary fights and i think that's so interesting because you have so many conservative or moderate democrats running for reelection and there was so much as
energy and the democratic party of the bernie sanders type when trying to pull the party to the left and yet the joe mentions the bob casey the job donnelly is of the world didn't have to fight off the left in the primaries i think that it's also in some of these places north dakota and montana there's not had deep democratic bench so i have been getting someone even on the ballot that would pose
a real threat is going to be harder i think it's much easier to find people in these house races and different things who you're seeing that i am a play out in a lot of house races that really could end up costing democrats unwinnable sees but again these comments are entrenched they have a lot of money in their campaign war chest and probably and high in north dakota heidi hi
kim's the only person that could win their john test or the only person that kid when in montana and i think yet only pragmatism hasn't stopped primary challenge
true but again i mean it's just i just don't know how active they are some of these states that are on the ballot well it's certainly going to affect this next race that we wanna to talk about when it comes to ohio governor's race and we should mention this is a seat held by john k sick for two terms he's term limited so that up for us and an open sea yeah it's an open seat and on the democrat
that side you got richard corliss ray who was an obama appointee to run the consumer financial protection bureau
can you give a quick ten second recap on that before you keep going the consumer financial protection bureau is been set up during the obama administration as a reaction to the two thousand and eight financial collapse to be what it is a bureau to protect consumers against fraudulent activity in the banking market now elizabeth warren's
child getting upset at us she helps set it up people were think that she was going to run it until it was clear she wasn't going to be able to be confirmed and she decided to run for the senate
it's worked out for her which worked out for her she's endorsed right now no one's gonna say elizabeth warren is not a progressive okay but that's been the knock on richard core dray in this primary because he's running against dennis cousineau watch the presidential candidate former congressman from northern ohio also
was the mayor of cleveland don't we can get into solve his tenure when we talk about this race so this has been one of the more interesting damn on them primaries quarter is really still outspending astonished by a lot though and has a lot of the institutional momentum behind them know
he has the establishment candidate in the race but i mean he's not a centrist are sort of squash by any means but the one not that they they kiss in it has hit him on his guns he had passed a rating by the and are a and know he supports tougher background checks but maybe not as many regulations is a lot of progress would like and of course but
you're talking a lot about this with so many tragedies happening democrats really sort of see a momentum on guns and again in a base election this is something that you can capitalize on where to find these wedge issues and city and announces matter for democrats because that's been the biggest storyline of the past decade or so is democrats just losing ground and governor's office have
governor's office state house after state house there's hardly any democratic governors in the country compared to where they were in early in the obama years so this is a state where they feel like they can claw their way back in the competition and the thing is here there's a lot of places in the country where you know politics is on national now like it seems that politics normally we always said
politics is local right but what you have there's a lot of people running on ideology stuff that would matter to a to national electorates but when you have someone like dennis percentage running for example when you try to become a governor of est being a governor is about trying to run the state he's running to be governor here he's not run
to be another congressmen who's talking out against president trump that has nothing to do with what you're doing as a governor in a state and we've seen some republicans actually in other states have difficulty because he ran as ideological candidates and now when it comes to the rubber hitting the road and trying to govern it's
been a lot tougher and they've seen their approval ratings dropped i think sam brownback in kansas is a great example mary fallin in oklahoma when when you put these these talking points into actual policy sometimes the result is not pretty is as kansas saw with its budgets was was but then you have some really centers republicans that are going to be harder to knock off for republicans and places like maryland in massachusetts
that that sort of have run as pragmatists and governed that way and think about that that's why all right so that's the big democratic race to keep an eye on anything else any house races in any of these states that bad yesterday monaco you'll be you'll be watching when you have the seventy five tabs open late tuesday night as results are coming on
there's some that you know we'll see in ohio which nominee gets on the republican side how competitive this can be in different things but i think again
a big big night especially governor's race were also of course looking at but some of the state primaries setting kind of tell us the most about the energy of the electorate and what type of candidate to get nominated by i big picture you've got big senate races but we're going to see where the momentum is do the democrats continue to have the kind of momentum that
side for enthusiasm and what kinds of candidates to they pick are they going to be more pragmatic are they going to be more going toward the wings
it's all going to be tested
once we have result we will be back in your feet on wednesday talking about those results if you can't wait for that pod cast will be telling you about this on the real live radio and your local public radio station also on npr dot org and on npr one one more exciting thing to tell you about we always get tweet from you when you're going to do a live show

we are partnering with w f a e for our latest live show and a huge thanks to them and for their support
morrow we had promised you walk on music beforehand it didn't happen but i feel like there was still pretty good at my work on music is going to be bad to the
so what does them through just say didn't enter another show so like i said we're going to talk a lot about the midterms is the big picture conversation we are now seeing the field fill out we're seeing week after week primaries happened we know who the actual candidates are so dominica when we're looking
when we're sitting there in the newsroom thinking through okay what are the races we need to focus on what's like the center of the balls i have where this race is going to be fodder
well i've said before but i i think the road to the majority runs through bony fish girls you know i mean it's it's it's you know and where do you were cheesecake factory is moot she's sat around yeah i mean you don't find these places in like cool hip cities right i mean they're on the outskirts of know that a sprawl right i mean
lake where where urban sprawl exists and where the people who live in those suburbs kind of wish they were going out for dinner in the city but they're going about fish grill that's
next
comcast spent grill
non speaking from personal experience here you were love it there were going to go at it but
you know six o'clock with the kids it's not a bad time
but the fact the matter is the suburbs are really really important i mean there's a lot of these places where hillary clinton did very well mean she won some two dozen districts
in places where republicans are in those seats currently and those are the prime targets and democrats need to net twenty three seats to win back the house they need to be able to win in those places that hillary clinton won an awesome a key voter in those districts is the type of of voter that you spent a while
the time talking to and we kind of shorthand them like the lukewarm republicans you know the these are districts
that that vote for republicans most years but they they voted for hillary clinton for president and sent a republican in toronto yo john casey yeah so so the question is how are they feeling or that they are they still decide it's i mean it's one thing to not like the president of the party that you belong to and it's another thing
going to go ahead and vote for the other party especially in our tribal world apart
i can tell you this sort of synopsis that i heard from cobb county which is a suburb area around atlanta and hillary clinton did when cobb county and then i'd be curious to hear from you real quick also a sky in a huge gains in those places as well so my quick take is that i do not hear any sense of buyers remorse and then these republicans i make
a make said i would say some of these folks did vote for the president somewhat reluctantly some of them got on board with him fully and a couple of them did not vote for the president at all but when you talk to them about their local races they are energized and excited because they see those people i mean these are your establishment republicans in this case at least
the protagonists but specifically about cobb county it's a really energized republican party you go to the g o p breakfast
get a good one hundred plus people there in a saturday morning so i have not seen as ends at least in this particular county ancients a where people felt and any sense that they were shifting away and moving towards the democratic party so the flip side which we didn't fully plan out but but we have is that i mean i feel like i've gotten a lot of different evidence from from
from scratch i've talked to from the democratic campaigns i've talked to in that in that they don't necessarily feel like they need the john casey marco rubio republican voter to vote for them they just need enough of them to not bother voting because you know american presidential election turnout is is still like that
low compared to a lot of other western countries but the gap between the presidential turn out and the midterm turnout is so much that it's just a question of who's energized who is actually taking the time to vote and on all counts on state house special elections on on all the house special elections we've seen there is a clear trend line of democrats being more
enthusiastic showing up knocking on doors and a lot of those democrats not only sat on the last for midterms but many of them sat out two thousand and sixteen in states that were decided by a narrow margin like north carolina well you know the curse of the democratic party is for some reason they can only get their voters out every four years and instead of every to the republican
the show up every election but less scott said in the special elections and the races we've seen so far they seem to be exercising that curse and other words democrats are turning out republicans are turning out to it's just the democrats are turning out more and they're over performing their past turn out performances
from past mid midterms and that's it the democrats are counting on because what you look at you are one thing about presidential approval i just wanted a dad when you look at the numbers of people who strongly disapprove of trump versus the people who strongly approve of trump the strong disapprove is about twice as much that's a sign of democratic enthusiasm and there's one very specific reason for this it's women i mean
democratic women in when people talk about the year of the woman it's the year of the democratic woman perhaps and
we've seen so far in these primaries democratic women have won a good number of these seats i mean some forty percent of the of the primaries have been won by women that's unprecedented and it doesn't have it's not happening on the republican side and you are seeing
record number of women running for the house they believe there's over three hundred women who are running for seats in the house and that is still a very small number compared to the number of men that running from their seats but it's an uptake any to your point even ago i will wholeheartedly agree that we seen a lot of energy as specifically among women i think the one sort of current
treasury and point i guess i have is you need to echo bit of what you are saying is that democratic voters historically they don't turn out in these elections and so even if you look at again historical voting patterns or eight me they just haven't shown up and if you wanna guess who's and on voter they're more likely to be hispanic they're more likely to be african american and if you want to guess who is a habitual
oh and they tend to be a suburban college educated white person but in a lot of wild cards this year for instance the parkland school shooting yes there is now a huge moved to register high school students they are the least likely to show up newly minted eighteen year old voters but we're seeing registration among those
that age group going up will they show up in november will find that out and today we got more metric suggesting an increasingly strengthening economy we have the lowest unemployment rate since two thousand we have two hundred twenty three thousand new jobs
if the economy is turned around in the way by all indications that looks like it's doing doesn't that pretend a good year for the party in power why are republicans looking at big losses if things are going so well i mean i would make the argument that it's twofold so one is i actually sticking with that republican pollster recently who made the argument
yes the economy looks good so you have three point eight percent unemployment which really is somewhat unprecedented in modern history that's only been the case i think prior to two thousand you'd have to go back to the nineteen sixties but we'd had extreme wage stagnation so you talk to people and often they're feeling like they're one or two months away from a disaster and i would argue
you that many folks say that just sort of it regardless of where they're at and the income ladder and so that's one point is that people have not felt those gains in part because of wage stagnation the other thing though to me as really fascinating that is that as much as the economy is doing well and that sort of translates perhaps in a presidential year you don't actually
see that translating and midterm years it's less of a fact it's very much less than a factor i was speaking with a professor of down at emory university in atlanta his name is alan abramowitz and he basically looked at every election cycle blake going back to world war two and he charted a few different measures to see how like what was a good predictor
who would win which party with when the mean terms and he said that the economy was actually not very helpful as a predictor at all they were other things like the generic ballot which which breaks blaine rails ghana which party do you prefer to control congress generically i don't for the generic democrat and a generic republic yeah and some he said that's actually a much
more helpful factor to see which party will likely win more seats in the house and then the other factor he mentioned his the approval rating be hesitant and then that's a big question donald trump's usually a president's approval rating tracks with the economy the economy's really doing well why isn't donald trump's approval rating higher it's historically low so two theories
one is he is benefiting from the economy without this great economy his approval rating would be in the thirties or or because he has so because he's such a unique figure
he just is divorced from the normal rules of political gravity yeah i mean president has is clearly benefiting from some of the peace and prosperity that were time out i mean back in december his approval rating was averaging about thirty seven percent in the real clear politics average and now it's run forty two percent or so so the
the presidential approval rating at forty two percent is a terrible approval rating historically for how presidents wind up doing in mid term's the thing that you have to realize with this is that presidential approval ratings when they're lower generally they lose more seats their their party loses more
seats in mid term's bill clinton for example when his approval rating up better
over sixty percent democrats did fairly well while controlling congress when you look at george w bush however in his approval rating was at thirty nine percent in two thousand and six republicans wound up losing the house to democrats you look at barack obama his approval rating when it was at forty five percent
democrats wind up losing sixty three seats in two thousand and ten now does that mean that president trump who's approval rating is forty two percent is going to lose more seats or as many seats as democrats did in in two thousand and ten probably not because of some of the structural advantages that republicans have i think
how some of these districts were redrawn in two thousand and eleven
strong economy the fact that democrats are clustered in cities and it's pretty easy to drug districts around those democrats because of that but you know at the same time there is no real aberration away from the idea that if you have a pretty low approval rating your
gonna lose seats and even as president trump has ticked up and that's something we've talked about a lot when it when when it comes down to it it's still way lower than almost any other president at this point in their pregnancy and i think something a young age and one thing about the economy because you mention that so the year that alan and brando it's that
richard emery singled out for me it's kind of the historical parallel he said with nineteen sixty six he had president johnson in affairs sure the president was enormously unpopular and the vietnam war was going on beneath said the economy was actually doing quite well and he did not have is you can see actually the president's party did not do very well that year what we're doing is we're looking at all
all of these indicators that have suggested the size of a incumbent parties losses when you have the white house and both houses of congress and your president is below forty five percent generally that adds up to you're gonna lose big are they gonna lose the twenty three seats that democrats would need in the house to take control
unclear so so so there's all sorts of indicators that we look at and we are not quite sure which one is going to be the operative one so we could talk about this for a while i guess we talk about it like three times a week for the of a year or so
but we have only talked about half of the congressional elections there's the whole set it to talk about as well we're going to shift gears and talk about the senate is not good for democrats
it's bad for them because of the numbers flat out and the geography so you know there are twenty six democrats that are defending seats this year only nine republicans overall and when you look at the burial ground where the state where the states are being fought a lot of them are in places that trump want twenty points or more in them
case in some laser deep red states that mara it's not like this map is bad for democrats because democrats did anything wrong in fact it's the opposite right they happen to win elections in a few states that were surprising for them to win and six years ago when all of these guys were elected those were the years when the tea party was running amok in the
republican primaries and mitch mcconnell haven't yet quite figured out how to bring them to heal so you had a lot of people like christine know daniel you know i am not a witch remember her you know people who were two extremes they would win the primary but they were too extreme to win a general election so you got a lot of democrats and states like indiana and missouri places where democrats taped theory
medically shouldn't win but now that he believes that between the last three election cycles that they lost probably five republican senate see as their husband to get him back based on this really good map but i will say this when i talk to democrats there when i say what's the definition of success in the senate this year they say
just holding our own and other words if they could get the status quo fifty one republicans forty nine democrats after november they would consider that beyond their wildest dreams they take up some lose some but if they end up net net the same they'll be thrilled asthma one thing i learned sitting next to you is that there are no india and they're they're losers
because you are one
so i mean explain to us how much of anomaly a was for a democrat to be representing indiana to begin with and in what the challenges
a democrat like joe donnelly in some of these other you know that around testers of the world face in this climate i mean i think that indiana will be one of those races where i would say it would be extremely hard pressed for joe don way or any democrat to win election against against when mara talks about maintaining the status quo you could also make the case that that would mean picky
up a senate seat somewhere else and forfeiting are losing somebody states that they already hold like indiana so just to give me a bit of perspective indiana as a state that in two thousand and sixteen donald trump one every single county in this state but for that has a lot of counties and historically has always been
in that way there had been democratic senators in the past but it just shows you that sort of overall tilt that you've had in many midwestern states i would argue towards the republican party we saw something i think i kinda that you know beginning in ohio ohio i think the senator their shared brown is quite popular he's a democrat and monaco at the same time republicans
our feeling more defensive than usual in a few of these states i mean president trump went to tennessee this week to campaign because a whole mix of factors had to democrats to feel like even with this uphill climb they might be able to snag a surprise seat and tennessee especially you know six months after they won a senate seat in alabama
and they have a fairly popular person running in that see do cuts sort of moderate
you know
no image which is a nother discussion and internal fight that democrats are having among themselves should you put forward the kinds of candidates who you know or rather manual who ran the house committee to help elect those democrats in two thousand and six believe that you need to put forward these more modern more centrist democrats to
when in places where there are more republicans are more independence and is the party comfortable with that because the energy right now would you look at all the polling is on the most left part of the spectrum for the most part the answer to that question is there pragmatic so far on it they want to find democrats want
candidates that fit their districts and it does it means if you're in california maybe you do on someone from the left but if you're in the heartland
you want somebody who can reflect the district or the state and for the most part if you look at virginia raf northam john's in alabama which was stunning upset connor lamb and the eighteenth district of pennsylvania certainly feel bread us and in tennessee they are all candidates who fit their status or die
districts i'm glad everybody came out tonight and i'm glad that everybody listens to the pod cast on a regular basis but mara i'm or one earnings as away but mara i'm wondering what is the value of all this conversation on june first when it comes down to it like how much how much can change between now and the election and how worthless is a lot of this analysis at this
his point given now where husband are given that there is incredibly high value
first of all you know i call it highly in this way when doesn't lock when does i start to lock in we learned not really why do you like what people believe is that the generic ballot which people are fixated on as a barometer of your normal
i'm not fixated on now but i'm going to be fixated on it after labor day oh so that's when you guys should turn into raving political junkies on the generic valid but there's all sorts of other things to watch for you know what's the economy going to look like this summer you know well that will the wildcard or that of a trade war take it's toll will there be other external events
like a hurricane or more shootings
so there are a lot of things to watch for but i think that we know what the landscape is we know what history tells us and we're watching and candidates matter and who are watching a lot of these individual races and asthma one one trend that we keep seeing every tuesday is that despite the fact that the national headlines
moved on from it after after the latest repeal effort failed week after week voters are going and google in healthcare and they're telling pollsters healthcare is their top issue and democrats feel really good about that which is such a contrast from when these guys were all running six years ago and they were running away from obama care because a lot of voters didn't like it now democrats say
we would love to talk about obama care over and over again and talk about health care and general because you know what that's our new republicans he had that that's the argument that they're making and i do think it is a somewhat complicated argument for voters to always say healthcare equals democrats like i think that some at the democratic operatives will say but then he sort of push them and get us
cent of all how are you coming to that conclusion and they believe that because republicans did try to repeal the affordable care act and portions of it actually were repealed
correct that they feel that they can now associate your rising premiums with the republican party but to your points got in is amazing week after week if you look at google trends every single primary we have seen healthcare medicare medicaid is at the top of the list about everything and two issues that
shout from each side one is health care of the others tax cuts republican still haven't quite figured out how to message on tax cuts it's still sort of an issue when you look at the polls good idea bad idea do i feel it too i'd not
significant a substantive chunk of voters have the taxes actually go up it's complicated there's the argument that even if you get a tax cuts somebody else got a much bigger tax gotten a corporation got a much bigger tax god yeah
and health care i mean you guys are right about the google trends it's also shows up in polling right i mean one of the polls that we did we looked at just like what are your top issues i was stunned to see that health care was far away you know more than double what everybody else talked about for something that needs to be dealt
with immediately right
it surpassed everything else in this was the single biggest failure of the republican congress that they couldn't repeal it and replace it with something better as donald trump promised wait till october when everybody gets their letters thing why their premiums are going to go up against that is the democratic argument that that's going to happen and now you do wonder though how much of the election
one is sort of locked in and big did by that point but
talk about in october surprise
i remember being on the campaign trail with with donald trump in october right when right when those premiums went up and he was talking about that way more than he was talking about the f b i and the in the crowds were responding
last thing on all of this built the house and the senate what's one big thing that each of you is looking for thinking about paying attention to to to give you a sense of which way the big picture is going here yeah
so i am very interested in every primary looking at the rock turnout numbers and it is not like an apples to apples argument by one real quick example whereas in the primary in georgia very recently so there's been a lot of talk about can a democratic governor when in georgia what we saw in the primary
that actually they were more republicans who came out to oh but not by huge margins i think there was about like fifty thousand more republicans and democrats in two thousand and fourteen there were about two hundred thousand more republicans who actually voted then the democrat for governor so many out long story short i think the numbers were seeing in primaries is a good
clue to possibly the way we'll see things turn out in november
yeah i'm watching for what the republicans finally settle on as a message now or in this primary season so you're hearing a lot about immigration because that's the kind of message that works with the republican base you hear donald trump talking about it all the time and his rallies is that going to be that kind of thing that republicans will think will energize their base in a general
election or will they go back to trying to sell the tax cuts which they've had a hard time doing thing is that we talk about president trumps numbers ticking up because of peace and prosperity
i think that those are the two things that are going to be the hinge for him that hold him in place where he is or the bottom falls out
do does the economy start to start to changed is that reverse position doesn't employment take up and how to independence respond to what happens over the next several months whether it's the president's unpredictability or economic measures and stability and they've who do they want
trusting more right while the show is almost done but before we do the final credits a very important piece of business i forgot before shout out to sandy schuster enrich dutch you're rich happy birthday to you from kelsey she said as an email a couple weeks ago asking us to issue you happy birthday happy birthday

this is totally and i'm here with my mom gail he's helping me move to california were passing through sewer nebraska also known as fourth of july city years
this pod cast was recorded at the nice monde help you move its one twenty seven eastern on tuesday july third things may have changed both i mean hear this
here's the show
hey there it's the politics park asked here with a round up of this week stories and yes that's right you're not wrong it is tuesday but we're putting this out before the holidays so you can hear it on road trips and your plane rides and maybe to pre game the fireworks i'm scott tetra cover congress and that's my family and
cover national politics a nicer asked i covered the white house and i'm more alliance and national political correspondent a lot to talk about and we're going to pick up where we left off and that is this big swing vote opening on the supreme court we're also going to get into why a lot of progressive democrats are calling louder and louder voice is for the up
polish meant of the immigration and customs enforcement agency and with so many of the mid term primaries in the rearview we're going to take a few minutes and take stock of what we've learned about both the democratic and republican party so far you guys ready yet ready all right so let's start asia it's hasn't even been a week since just as anthony kennedy
he announced his retirement the white house is moving very fast to fill that was the latest yes so president trump said yesterday that he met with for candidates to feel kennedy's see and we also learned that yesterday he spoke by phone with mightily the republican senator from utah the convent
wisdom as the center really is not a top candidate he only got a phone call but trumpeted meet with four people in person so they are a lot of meetings and they say they're looking for someone with the intellect and the temperament and qualifications who will uphold the law and the constitution of course the question is what does that actually mean yeah
who are these people what do we know about them so one of the people is brett cavanaugh he serves on the us court of appeals for the dc circuit and prior life actually sat in awesome of his hearings on like environmental law the thing about him is that he did help right the nine hundred ninety eight star report to congress that he doesn't
remember that that can have helped lead to the impeachment of bill clinton an independent counsel and us to getting the president that would be an interesting truth
so i so he can a known for that partially one of the interesting things about bread cabin is he came to the conclusion after his experience in the special counsel investigation of bill clinton that presidents should not be distracted by these kinds of investigation so there's a thought that
maybe he would vote if it came before him in favor of the president not being indicted or not being subpoenaed or basically to protect the office of the presidency
and that might be one of the reasons that some people feel that he shouldn't be nominated another person that he met with was a beard she wasn't notre dame professor she's nasa's on the us court of appeals for seventh circuit she was nominated by president trumps so she just kind of got on the bench and it was a little bit controversial
nomination process her own she got questioned a bit about her christian faith some people raise concerns about whether she could separate her christian faith from her decisions on the court
so now and she also wants clerk for antonin scalia and she is actually a wife and mother of seven that's pretty impressive very impressive
another person that the president interviewed was a mall for par he's an appeals court judge on the sixth circuit which covers ohio michigan kentucky and tennessee the most important stayed on that list as kentucky because he's a favorite of senate majority leader mitch mcconnell he is the conventional wisdom is that that's why he's on the list he is not necessarily a top pick some
buddy else that the president met with was roman catholic church also of the sixth circuit he's fifty one years old young guy and a lot of conservatives think that he would be an original list in the tradition of antonin scalia and one of the things that all of these potential nominees haven't come
man is that they satisfy conservatives criteria for people that would probably vote to undermine or overturn roe and this was one of the president's clearest commitments in the campaign he said if he gets elected he'll probably have to or even more openings on the court
phil turns out he's been correct and he said that when that happens row will be returned to the states and asked my want to ask you about that because that's obviously hanging over everything here because anthony kennedy even though he was really conservative was repeatedly a vote to keep roe v wade on the books to not undermine abortion rights
and obviously this is a really emotional and personal topic for people on both sides deeply held views there's an annual march where thousands and thousands of people come to washington dc every year to urge the supreme court overturn roe v wade but a couple of paul's came out over the last week that really shed some light on what the brain
down is when it comes to how many people want to see it overturned verse upheld yeah scott generally speaking in the public if we look at some pulling down by the kaiser family foundation that was before justice kennedy's announcement retirement announcement was made and then also by quinney piano and they pulled after that announcement we see pulling of the public that
looks pretty similar you see about to buy a two to one margin most americans say they would support upholding row so i mean within that you can parse out the numbers and you'll see that there is far more agreement among democrats and at the bottom of the less if you look at all the breakdown of demographics republicans are at the bottom right so i mean you
i think there's about thirty six percent of republicans who would support base and eighty four percent of democrats to huge partisan divide but what i find interesting is when you look at the overall public this is something that is now generally accepted no more in though people are pretty split on abortion itself you know do you favor it or not they are
really overwhelmingly support of this law that's been on the books since nineteen seventy three is that one reason why mara you mentioned president trump campaigning for office saying it will be automatically overturn once he had a couple pigs but over the last week the white house said we're not really talking about that just yeah no no no we're not doing a case by case
litmus test with our nominees they've really started to downplay that idea is that because there were going to these samples and they know that how that would go over of that became write the story was about and these nominees are not going to answer questions about how they stand on road that's a time honored tradition from both nominees
who were put up by democrats or republicans they don't like to talk about how they would roll rules specifically but donald trump was the most explicit on this have any presidential candidate that i can remember where he said flat out because he had something to prove he had to prove to the social issue right evangelicals and conservatives that he was one
of them and then he would enact their agenda so he went pretty far out on a limb to say you will like me i will appoint supreme court justices who will overturn roe and return these decisions about abortion to the street smart yeah so how would that even be sending that's determined because to your point there isn't really this litmus test and we saw
when supreme court justice course which when he was appointed in this question was brought up to him didn't he say that he would have walked out of the door if had asked him yes but he doesn't have to ask him because this list was created by the federalist society who knows
deeply and intimately every single thing about these people's thinking and jurisprudence nobody would be on that list vetted and approved by the federalist society if they weren't considered to be a reliable vote against road that doesn't mean that they overturned it in one fell swoop
that they'd start chipping away at it the right has been burned before republican presidents have put people on the court that did not turn out to be as conservative as their supporters hoped they're not going to let that happen again that's one of the reasons that the federalist society has been cultivating and promoting these law professor
answers and judges for their entire careers and so the the president doesn't have to ask someone point blank would you vote against row what's the timeline going forward when do we get this pic in what happens over the coming days so he is going to meet with some more people and then on monday he is expected to make his announcement of
who he has chosen and the white house said that they can move fast because as mine said they've had this less for for fruit since the campaign even though they've added some names to it so is this guy does any of the opposition know that we've been hearing from some members of congress that they would not necessarily support a justice and
the issue of roe vs wade is that just an entirely new talking point then begins tomorrow as point these just judges have largely been already voted on this issue yeah i think a lot of the votes are already pretty predictable susan davis our colleague who covers congress had a good story this morning saying in the end you're probably really need to focus on just five
senators to get a sense of what's going to happen here and that's to republican women who support abortion rights lisa murkowski of alaska susan collins of main you may be thinking they sound familiar yes these were the same key republican swing vote when it came to whether or not obama care was going to be overturned the internet blocking along
john mccain three democrats to pay attention to our the three democrats who voted for neil gossage last year had a high camp and north dakota joe mention of west virginia joe donnelly of indiana all three happened to be up for reelection next year so they're going to get a lot of pressure in their states so those are the lawmakers to folk
hassan right and also but what's interesting is most democrats feel that the president won't lose any republican votes and when you hear susan collins kind of tortured interviews on this were for she says i won't vote for anyone who would overturn roe vs wade than later she said i don't want to vote for someone who demonstrates hostility to reverse this way and so
the big question i think is the three democrats how much pressure do they feel in their own states devote with the president thereby by breaking with the democratic base who does care about this nomination more than they were cared about any recent supreme court nomination or do they stick with their base
vote against the president who's very popular in their state all right we're going to shift gears here and talk about that other big thing in the news over the last few weeks and that is of course immigration i want to talk for a few minutes about a slogan that's been pumping up more and more recently you may have seen it on protesters signed her or heard senators like elizabeth warren and purist and jeweler brand
talking about it and that's the idea of abolishing ice abolishing the immigration and customs enforcement agency quick recap what exactly is what do they do because one of the push tax has been you're focusing on the wrong agency guys ice does two things it tries to go after drug runners people who do
human trafficking
money laundering bad the crime across the borders but it also is charged with deporting undocumented immigrants in other words it does not police the border and it doesn't separate families those are other agencies that do those things sort of the border patrol border patrol h as right
this was created after nine eleven correct correct who it was largely an edifice and it was created in the argument is much the same way the patriot act these were sort of the vestiges right after nine eleven i mentioned this popping a more and more recently for from democrats alexandria kazuo cortez was campaigning on this idea lot in new york she actually and campaign
the border in the final days of their other race leaving the district to drive home the point how important it was for her campaign seeing it other places too
the white house seems to love this they're very aggressively pointing it out in very aggressively trying to pin democrats to this viewpoint whether or not they actually take a guess this is in line with his idea the immigration is a good issue for republicans so what he's trying to do as he's trying to say all luck
democrats are for abolish eyes and the next they're going to be for getting rid of police officers in general so his interpretation is that old they're against law and order but we republicans we like law and order so he feels like this is a winning arguments for a ham and if he can pin that
scratch than that will weigh them down during midterms small with all the voters you talk to do you get a sense of i mean there's this divide that the president trump think this is the greatest thing republicans can focus on and a lot of these republicans running in the suburban districts are saying like you know let's let's talk about the economy you have a sense of the pros and cons of making
this the centerpiece i mean it certainly plays well in certain districts like the new york fourteen three and these are largely democratic districts but no dad i recall going to some places where president term do really well in two thousand and sixteen and i have heard from voters who felt particularly frustrated by the democrats focus on immigration so i do
you think it's kind of a case by case situation what i know have found fascinating sky is the degree to which this idea that you could argue is sort of a fringe idea maybe even just three weeks ago has now become far more popular and you're hearing other democrats talk about this and in pressure down it were to yeah exactly because i don't
recall cure in july brand actually even being so left on immigration before so it's actually just phenomenal to see this sort of pressure being exerted on democrats to become my what are you more progressive and immigration know what i think is interesting as watching the pressure be resisted and there are a lot of democrats who say just one we had the republicans on the
run on immigration just one we had the republican party split on the family separations policy on the dreamer policy when we looked at polls and showed big majority of people agreeing with us on immigration been a good thing in general dreamer should have a path to citizenship family separation policy is is wrong and offensive why should we get all
tangled up with talking about abolishing a agency that doesn't even do
the things that we don't the things we don't like most but but bulging eyes became a simple bumper sticker slogan kind of like build the wall or abolish the i r s that basically express democrats anger at trumps immigration policies in general
people will feel like democrats need to go bigger and they need to stop being cautious in their wordy and then you've seen with president trump that he leaned into some ideas that seem really out there but that played well with his and so then maybe democrats need to lean into some ideas that
maybe don't fit the standard messaging but that can get their base really motivated to get out there all the stuff applies to so many things beyond immigration and the fact we're going to talk all about that getting into detention points in both parties and where the parties are now that most of the primaries are behind us that's coming up next first were going

i'm sam sam to come up i cast bynum where every friday we catch up on the news and the culture of the week and try to make sense of it all listen on the npr one app for wherever you get your pod cast
and we are back in some primary still to come by and large most of the primaries are now behind us and it's going to be a little while before the next wave of races so we all decided that it would be a good time to hit reset and analyze where the two parties are right now asked my you spend a lot of time looking
the republicans yeah and scott you've spent a lifetime looking at democrats right looking both elected officials and we're the pull of the party is and why don't we start with you because i'm actually really curious to see if we actually are seeing a national poll to the left in the democratic party that some people are talking about under the new york fourteen
yeah yeah chelsea snow and i spent a couple months just every time we were out reporting on one story we we would talk to people about this big picture story as well and put that all together this week
it's interesting because it's a dual track situation like there's no question that nationally the democratic party is being pulled to the left you know that it's got like how do you define that one thing that i keep pointing to because i think it says a lot is that when bernie sanders unveiled the latest version of his bills to introduce a medicare for all single
their healthcare system last year every single person who's probably going to run for president as a democrat in two thousand and twenty in the senate cosponsor sponsored that bill elizabeth warren purist and jeweler brand cory booker karma harris and that was such an outlier even just a few years ago and bernie sanders was running for the democratic nomination but this time around
democrats can't see a path to the presidential nomination unless they're on board with this big picture single payer government plan so that's just one example let's not progressive really haven't been winning in alive democratic primaries they're sort of the exception to the rule when we do see them away and yeah i mean there have been some big examples of that but
but by my by and large like you said they are the exceptions and that's where this dual track comes in because especially if you look at the key races that are going to decide whether republicans or democrats control the house or senate next year by and large it's the moderates winning those races it's the it's the candidates running and platforms of governing and inclusive
in reaching out to independence the exact stuff that that a lot of progressives dismisses republican lite that's the track record at winning in these key suburban races they're trying to flip and it's and look this is really really good reporting and the interesting thing is because the highest profile progressive when and
democrat district fourteen in new york came recently she was a giant killer because she knocked off a member of the leadership and because she's this very compelling attractive young latina and she kind of embodies all of the turmoil inside the democratic party age gender ethnicity it and she got so much pubs
the city and such a big platform after she won it made you think wow progressives democratic socialists are taking over the democratic party when in fact when you look at all these races that's just not true the democratic party still more diverse ideologically and racially and it's still more united around big things despite all this diversity than the republicans are in other words it's for
or some kind of universal healthcare minimum wage it's pro immigrant and that's what's so interesting about this it seems like there's a lot of turmoil and there is huge generational fights but it's a diverse party that's relatively unified ideologically an asp of the one example that i think really jumped out to calcium mean the most
where did this obviously most of the focus is on the house of representatives because that's that's the one that could flip but he actually if you look at the senate democratic primaries that's what's interesting is you have this whole group of really conservative or moderate democrats running and states where they have to play defense states that donald trump one by large margins none of them got a serious
primary challenge job managing job donnelly and heidi high camp or vote for neil gossage they don't get a primary challenge claire mccaskill regularly dismisses medicare for all know primary challenge bob casey at times vote against abortion rights no primary challenge the party leaders said we need to be pragmatic about this we need
no with people who can win the states and the progressive wing actually fell in month yeah that that that really belies this kind of meth or story line that the the democratic party although the energy is on the left and i think we're going to see much more of this in the two thousand and twenty fight for the nomination for president but for the most part democrats have the huge to kind of the first commandment
of politics which is you've got to nominate someone who can win their district or state the idea of a question about how you govern scott rate because you're talking about the idea that the energy is on the left that we're hearing policy platforms
that are calling for medicare for all and yet you're describing a situation in which case after case democrats are opting for these more pragmatic people there doesn't seem to mesh with what you're describing a base want and then what does that mean for how you actually eventually govern they're trying to get in line to be in opposition party right now they're nothing they're going to be providing a check and bad
once to donald trump
we can have this discussion about governing only get to two thousand and twenty but right now they're just trying to be an effective opposition party which means you try to win one house or both of congress and i think nancy pelosi would love to have that problem every time this comes up her answer is just when baby we just need to win this race
and in president trump speaking of nancy pelosi that he even though a lot of these candidates are actually moderates who as you said are winnie president trump really wants to talk about nancy pelosi maxine waters he wants them to be the face of the democratic party he wants to say that these people are very
dream and out there and so that's why you should put democrats back in charge so let's let's talk about your reporting now because a lot of the democratic confidence is based on the premise that voters are getting tired of president trump and mirror some weakness especially in the suburban districts with high income higher education
voters may have voted republican for decades they feel like there's an opening their did you see any evidence of this this weakness among republicans what the president so if the question is right about the weekend within the president's base i'm not seeing that i spent the past couple of months like he's got you know going out around the country specifically i would talk
voters that made up kind of key constituencies of the president space so we're talking about evangelicals veterans white working class main and your kind of traditional establishment country club republicans among all of those people and i spoke to about fifty sixty republicans only one woman told me that she regretted voting for president trip
one hour and fifty yeah the rest of them told me that if they had been perhaps lukewarm on the president they now support him even more and it's got that in sync with polling we've seen we are seeing that the president has roughly and ninety percent approval rating among republicans and that's phenomenally strong okay so you said you talk to more than fifty vote
voters here were there any different groups you ended up sorting all these voters into yet right so we look specifically hunting veterans white working class main country club the republicans and evangelicals and what i found really interesting is that their interest mean are always a line but most everyone spoke to me about a little treat
they feel the president given them and those were different rates when i was in say the sixth district in georgia which is a very highly educated area i heard a lot about the tax cuts when i was in ohio i heard a lot about tariffs when i was in other parts of the country i would hear a lot say with veterans in west virginia i heard about just some of the prestige that they felt the president
giving to veterans in the form say of the veterans' day parade and now is a common theme i will say even though not all of these planks you could say if his coalition have the same interest there is a very common feeling they have of being a victim of being marginalized and they all point similarly to the fact that the media does not
give him any do credit they feel that the president has done good things they pointed the tax cuts they point to the relationship or the negotiations with north korea and they say that look if this was a democrat the media would be treating this entire situation differently and scott that's what i found remarkable is that that's not a sentiment i hear from you know
just as die hard supporters that something i heard from even some folks who would have say that they were lukewarm supporters of the crazy
not so his bases does definitely seemed to be i guess among republicans growing and kind of solidify but does how does that translate in mid terms because isn't that isn't their question of whether they will actually get out and vote because trump is not on the ticket so is he gonna be like
are they enthusiastic enough that they feel like they me to go out and vote for these republicans who are not donald trump that is an excellent question i don't know i mean there were some people who told me they were not sure if they were going to vote but i can say the amount of times that they would tell me they were so enthusiastic about voting for another term for president europe so that is a question i just don't know the answer to
martyrs any of the surprise you know actually we live in such a tribal moment and the media is so divided and most people who consume conservative media are told over and over how elites look down on them and their disrespected and donald trump has this whole kind of grievance the ideology of grievance so it doesn't really surprise me
the one thing that i would watch for and i'm really curious about is when donald trump said i can stand on fifth avenue and shoot someone i would lose any voters what i want to know is could stand in a soybean field and undermine of farmers livelihood and still not lose that guy's support
translator and they have to translate that metaphor to us to the farm belt which is total trump country and just burn it him
when there were they forgive him because what we've heard is that these farmers are losing like ten twelve fifteen percent of their livelihood because of the tariffs well they say look he's just trying his hardest in the right place i'll take the hit for donald trump or will have to press their enthusiasm for coming out and voting for a republican won't vote we saw a sneak preview of that with harley davidson
huge company in pennsylvania and wisconsin too important states for tromp you went around to just blamed harley he said you're looking for you to excuse this is your fault not my policies this is harley davidson his fault but i guess if there's not an obvious villain like harley davidson when you're talking about broader agricultural markets that might be harder it might be harder and also
i don't know what those attacks on a harley davidson have gotten him in other words it certainly hasn't changed harley davidson's behavior they already made motorcycles in different parts of the world before donald trump was elected into barnes point the big question is the folks who work in factories and manufacture harley davidson motorcycles you know whose side will they take the president
or their companies are well we've been talking about big picture looks or the republican party that asked my own and a big picture look at the democratic party that kelsey snow and i wrote both those doors will be online soon it and their politics dot org we're going to take one more quick break and come back with the one thing we just can't let go of this week politics or non politics

and we are back and we're going to end the show like we do every week with the one thing we can't let go politics or otherwise
europe first this league something happened that i just found so fascinating in france there's this guy this gangster read one i believe and he was in he was in jail supposed to be in prison for twenty five years but he escaped and it was like a helicopter
escape in real life in real life so i got was fake but then i lifted up this recently have been so apparently it was this elaborate scheme where the these gangsters working with to break out fried that they hijacked a helicopter from a training school they flew
fluid in on the one part of the prison who didn't have the anti aircraft knitting they use smoke bombs and then these i cut that to cut through were five he just happened to be visiting with his brother and the visitors section and they had like guns but they didn't shoot me batty and the prisoners were like clapping as fuck
he went away and got on the helicopter flew off and he's like there's a massive manhunt for him now i don't i don't know what he did they can't not root for him once they start well so he's accused is obviously he's been in the game for very long time he's like done bank highest and all this stuff so you so use in prison for something serious i probably shouldn't root for yeah
yeah years i think i think is escaped before i think he has he said yes to this is not as far as escape the other escape he likes snuck in explosives or something but he did say so he says that he was inspired by hollywood i'd heist movies and like michael mann yeah heat and that
he's also inspired by scarface okay gone back a while
i'm going on at work and that's a little bit of the beginning of air force one in the cisco systems same so i have theories on this that i won't get into for for legal reasons
i think that of crazy that this man was able to like given the helicopter and fly away and he still on the run and redirect the helicopter know love that he they landed the helicopter burned on the size than they like hijacked my door like stole two cars they've abandoned those images on the run he did break out before
like years ago and he was on the run for maybe like six weeks before he got caught again so we'll see what happens but is pretty crazy and this is why mounted police commissioner because i'm sarah
you put in the
know you can pull that off
it's it's pretty impressive mara
can't let it go this week is about amy barrett who we talked about earlier in the show is one of the people that trump is considering for a supreme court seed and what i can't let go is that she and her husband were the members of a group called people of praise
mostly catholics and as part of this group it's a
devotional group people swear a lifelong of loyalty called a covenant to one another but what i can't go is that they are assigned a personal adviser and those advisors if they're men are called heads but the female advisers are called ham fades
what i'm imagining in the image i can't get out of my head is that if she is nominated and there are hearings you're going to see a lot of protesters in red capes and white pundits milling around in the back of the hearing because of the because of handmade his tail yeah i think that this is just a
piece of trivia about a potential nominee that's made for this moment so i'm going to go to next it's a holiday coming up a holiday there about traditions and sometimes you have organic traditions that have been going on for a long time and sometimes you have to force their tradition and kind of making a thing and that's what i'm doing right here morning edition morning edition
as a wonderful annual tradition of the reading of the declaration of independence and a couple of years ago i thought we should have our own tradition here on the part of a reading of an equally important independence day document and that document i don't think any of you have been around for this and the previous years where i have forced the song have anybody to that document is
the climactic speech from the nineteen ninety six film independence day
was president thomas more an area fifty one it is up on the back of a truck and gives it an inspiring speech through a megaphone and i think we should all do guys i have parts for everybody i hear handed out
we're apart
here's your part i got my part asked where you got your back and asked awesome i know we've talked about the millennial generation so yeah cause you support this kind of course i do think break out here who's doing the last part because it's the best who's are you doing as
no i'm that myself
because i started out
everybody ready reading grant
good morning
and less than an hour aircraft from here will join others from around the world and you will be launching largest aerial battle in this history of mankind
mankind
words to have new meaning for all of us today we can't be consumed by our petty differences anymore we will be united in our common interests perhaps it's fate that today is the fourth of july and you will once again be fighting for our freedom not from tyranny of christian persecution from annihilation were fine
adding for our right to live to exist and should we win the day the fourth of july will no longer be known as an american holiday but as the day when the world declared in one voice we will not go quietly into the night we will not vanished without a fight we're going to live on we're going to survive
can all do the in today
one airline
i have not
the third annual rating of thomas whitmore speech
and asthma if you can if you can top that go ahead
what can you or
i cannot lego is legit the fourth of july the declaration of independence but it's a little bit more solemn and a real ra raw patriotic moment for me not nearly as funny as you're a scout you're sending me from within
i don't want to talk about the actual cause know so so what i will say is on july fourth seventeen seventy six you had this decade continental congress who voted to approve the declaration of independence and now all these years later i use think it's i mean that we all take for granted and my family is from so
south asia and india and pakistan were not free they did not declare themselves free from the british empire until nineteen forty seven
so my grandparents were born subjects of the british empire and to me i every fourth of july it is actually my absolute favorite holiday and just sort of blown away by the idea that this simple document
in essence kind of just and hundred us to the british empire
so merry go and every year there's a whole bunch of places i knew that in boston actually the old statehouse balcony they read the independents ally they've been doing this and seventeen seventy six i have never gone before but you will catch me there tomorrow i intend to go and check it out and rely know be you should send pictures i will write and on that into
aspiring note from asthma
that is a rat for today we will be back the next time there a headline a quick note i will actually not be back for a while i'm going to take some time after hanging out with my baby so i look forward to listening to everybody on the pod cast and i'll talk to you again the end of august i'm scott detroit congress and less mccollough political reporter
i'm sure ask the white house and i'm more elias and national political correspondent thank you for listening to the pure politics


hey this is when in cincinnati ohio where i just get done dropping off my son for his very first day of kindergarten this pod cast was recorded at two forty one eastern on saturdays september first things may have changed by the time you hear it all right here's the show
it's the npr politics cast it's been a week of memorial services for senator john mccain first in arizona than the us capital today leaders from around the country gathered at the national cathedral the site of so many big memorial services to say goodbye to john mccain
i'm scott detroit cover congress and cause it's now i also cover congress and i'm going to cover the white house so we all just watched this funeral it was about two and a half hours president's obama bush clinton were there a ton of other dignitaries scott horsley you and i were here in studio and npr but kelsey you were at the nash
no cathedral just tell us what it was like to be there to really solemn it was very quiet around the cathedral it is in this part of upper northwest washington dc that has already kind of a quiet part of the city the cathedral itself has at the top of a hill and it's very isolated and it felt like it was just a quiet solemn moment and it's just an enormous building in it
it's the closest the country has to westminster abbey type national place for big events we don't do royal wedding is there but we do go there to to honor the lives of people like john mccain yeah prayer services are following the inauguration of several president including obama and it was the site of the national prayer service
for ronald reagan after his passing sort of the official religious home for official washington so we're going to walk through some of the key moments from this funeral in a moment but scott i think one of the key moments was was when they went to the vietnam memorial on the way to the national cathedral absolutely and you have to remember that this entire pageant
that we have witnessed over the last week since john mccain death on the twenty fifth has been carefully planned out to illustrate the various stations of john mccain life his adopted home in arizona his church and arizona the the capital here really and state and then obviously the
normal stop in route to the cathedral this morning where the motorcade paused at the vietnam veterans memorial cindy mccain place a ceremonial wreath there and obviously not only to john mccain own time as a prisoner of war in hanoi which is a central piece of the narrative of john mccain but also a tribute to the tens of
thousands who served in died there and that's particularly important because mccain was central to the normalizing and relationships with between the united states in vietnam and it's something that he thought was very important
in their country needed to remember the war but they also needed to move on and even though the mccain family and said they didn't want president trump at today's funeral or any of the events this week when cindy mccain wouldn't leave that wreath secretary of defense gym maddox was next to her as was chief of staff john kelly the two of them have had a long relationship with nick
pain and part of his job in congress wants to work directly with them so for them
more than just their role in this white house it was about their relationship between the military and john mccain their well i can't think of another person in congress
deeper and more and it involves relationship with the military it's funny though course those are both generals and we heard yesterday from vice president my pants
my parents who sort of course is is a marine
no one was kinder to the enlisted men and women of the us military and no one was tougher on the generals and admirals and we heard similar points during the service today so let's get to the funeral and the national cathedral is jam packed with former president former centers celebrities at one point her as a cutaway shot to
john kerry sitting next to jay leno
and looking through the list it struck me that if you include mccain everyone who lost a general presidential election in the last twenty years was there hillary clinton bob dole mccain carry out gore but i think meghan mccain really set the tone for the whole day with with her eulogy early on john much
keynes daughter she's coast of view on a b c
talk about a lot of personal thing she talked about his public career but also talking about just his role as a dad and mom and she shared with them as a dad and and conversation she had like this one
when my father god's sake
i asked him what he wanted me to do with this year he said
show them how tough you are and i guess she proceeded to do that because after all of these personal stories
she made some some pointed comments that it was pretty clear even though she never said president trump who they were directed at the america of john mccain is generous and welcoming and old she is resourceful confident secure
she meets her responsibilities
she speaks quietly because she's strong america does not both because she has no need to
the america john mccain has no need to be made great again because america was always great

i think it's really interesting
plus start out kind of feigned but then people are kind of testing the waters she's a first person to speak and this has just gotten very political and then the applause really grill at one of the bigger applause lines i think we saw throughout the entire service yeah i mean there were a lot of laughs it at some of the jokes and funny stories that were going to hear later but that was that was definitely a moment that
you know and i was wondering what people like a bunker triumphant jared kushner in the audience thought but there was a lot of applause for that there was one other moment from from meghan mccain speech that we should listen to and it was a mix of those two themes were talking about because she was talking about her personal relationship with her dad but then also contrasting him with with
the way that politics has devolved into personal insult politics he was a great man
we gather here to mourn the passing of american greatness
the real thing not cheap rhetoric from men will never come near the sacrifice he gave so willingly nor the opportunistic appropriation of those who live lives of comfort and privilege while he suffered and served their we hear mccain making a veiled reference to the fact that president trump received a number
or of deference to avoid going to vietnam some are related to him being in school and there was also a medical deferment but he yes he did not serve and it was added the time than john mccain was in a prisoner of war camp when it comes to serving are not serving in vietnam you could go through the whole front row of the funeral and in and look at that as well with president bush and clinton but i think a thing that
meghan mccain was saying pointedly there but that other speakers talked about as well was the idea that john mccain was clearly a partisan person he had a point of view he liked to pick fights and he did so regularly with obama and bush and they both noted that but it wasn't it wasn't a petty lowest common denominator insult just just
trying to tear people down in a way that that a lot of politics seems to be right now but i also think the partisanship that was kind of a repeated target throughout the service today is bigger than just donald trump it was there was a lot of bemoaning of the the pettiness and hasn't affected our politics going back farther than the current presidential administration
appeals to the the ability the john mccain showed two years to be a partisan brawl at times but also to work across the aisle on issues such as immigration reform on issues such as campaign finance reform and there were attributed that from both of the men who beat john mccain in his efforts to win the white house for president george w
bush and former president while and they both were pretty candid at the top of their their eulogies saying that they had pretty nasty battles with the two thousand republican primary was pretty tough the two thousand and a general election was pretty tough and they both joked about it bush said that mccain could be a pain in his side but over the years they've talked
they would go over those old campaigns like he compared it to football players going over a big game moments before my last debate
ever
with senator john kerry in phoenix or are trying to gather
some thought and the holding room
i felt a presence
open my eyes
and six inches from my face was mccain who yelled relax relax
that sounds very relaxed good story
so that that were a lot of the speeches were like them and joe lieberman had all these stories about traveling with with mccain and other countries it's kind of ridiculous moments they found themselves in but speakers like bush always kept back getting back this idea that mccain had this cold he lived by bush talk about it kind of like he was a western character
john was above all a man with a cold
he lived by a set of public virtues that raw strength and purpose to his life and to this country
he was courageous where the kurds that right and his captors and inspired his countrymen
he was honest no matter who get offended
presidents were not fair
he was honorable always recognizing that his opponents were still patriots are human beings he loves freedom with a passion of a man who knew its actions
he respected that dignity and in every life
the that does not stop it borders and cannot be erased by dictators
perhaps above all john detested the abuse of power obviously john mccain had been himself a victim of torture as a p o w and one of the things he and george w bush tangled over was the torture or enhanced interrogation tactics that were used by the united states in the wake of nine eleven
former president bush alluded to those disagreements they have but he said he wanted me to be better he wanted america to be better and before with this into obama i totally missed this when this happened did one of you did either of you catch this cough drop moment in the front row and do we can we explain what what went down it seems like me
maybe michelle obama had like a typical if throw it away as coughing or something and then there is that is little flurry of activity and laura bush handed george w bush something and then he pass it over to michelle and some people thought they were passing notes suddenly turns out it was kidney or a cough drop or something
she was coming through with cough drop in the per
very sweet little moment
i was curious to hear what obama would have to say because we just don't hear that much it from barack obama these days he aside from facebook post is not waited directly into current politics that much and given the tone of the week services of these these subtle and not so subtle rebukes to president true
i was really curious to hear what obama had to say and i think i'd say by and large the bulk of the speech was these themes we talked about before mccain as a statesman mccain is somebody who who tangled but tried to be honorable about it the most important thing i think obama said was that when he and john mccain would fight on policy he said we knew we were on the same team we didn't we
questions each other's views were questions each other's policies but we didn't question each other's patriotism or sincerity we respected that we were both trying to preserve what we thought was a vision of america and the former than obama let is what i think has been closely guarded secret until now which is that while he
was in the office mccain would occasionally make unannounced visits and they would spend time together just talking out of the spotlight talking about family talking about politics talking about their respective visions for the country and disagreeing and obama said that he was fine with that because they disagreed very passionately and thought that was a good thing to talk about the areas where they disagreed
and to still keep talking obama also made reference to something had happened in the two thousand and eight campaign and we've we've seen a lot of reference to this during the course of the week because we've been remembering john mccain that was a moment during that campaign when john mccain confronted one of his own supporters who had falsely claim that
obama was not american
video clip has been shown repeatedly this week and barack obama said at the time he appreciated but he wasn't as he was not surprised and he thought that in doing that john mccain was not defending his on obama is on but also america's honor and the way that campaigns or to be conducted as met this spirit we celebrate this week
that striving to be better
to do better
to be worthy
of the great inheritance that our founders the
so much of our politics
public life our public discourse
can seem small
and me
and petty
trafficking and bomb best an insult
and falling controversies and manufactured outrage
it's a politics that pretends to be
brave and tough but in fact as more fear
john called on us to be bigger than that
he called on us to be better than that and we heard a lot of that during the service today now away from obama and bush for pro other speakers as well who said that one of the reason we've seen such an outpouring
of emotion during this last week surrounding john mccain is that i think a lot of americans do hunger for some sense that we are better than our current politics and there was wish from joe lieberman the former connecticut senator who was almost john mccain is running mate in two thousand eight even those of have been a democrat turn independent
who said it in his death
john mccain has really given americans kind of a reminder of who we have the potential to be i will say i'll be the down or here and symbol of it on is that this is the kind of sentiment that we hear a lot when there been a tragedy or a loss in washington there's us to talk about coming together with happen after baseball shooting
whereas discouragement currency policeman shot just a little over a year ago
and as much as people in washington i think would like their it'd be the spaced for that to happen it just hasn't really happened and things that if anything after the shooting
i've seen one of the most bitter political years museum in a long time whether or not mccain is ever greater stature and or have more weight and that that another question altogether this was the last public ceremony yesterday john mccain was became just the thirty first american to lie in state in the us capital
scott can you fill us in around the last part of the ceremony is what happens next
john mccain is going to be buried on sunday on the grounds of the us naval academy were course he was cadet and he he he racked up a lot of demerits while he was there he was a rebellious cadet courses his both his father and grandfather were highly decorated maybe admirals he is three
asked he hated his time at the naval academy but some of his great old friends have been laid to rest there and that's where he chose to be buried so we're going to end with this we've we've obviously talked a lot about john mccain this week in we're going to and playing a clip that we played earlier this year when it first came out and this was a clip from the afterward
of of the last book that mccain wrote that came out he wrote it knowing he was dying and this afterward was kind of recorded as a as a good goodbye message from john mccain who knew he wasn't going to return to the senate or return to public life for speak through anything to statements three to listen to part of that again have a great good fortune this spend sixty years and the employ of our can
three defending our country security advancing our country's ideals supporting our country indispensable contribution to the progress of humanity
it's not been perfect sure wish to be sure and there were times when the country might have benefited from the last of my help
but i've tried to deserve the privilege and have been we paid a thousand times over with adventure and discoveries with good company and with the satisfaction of serving something more important than my shelf
of being a bit player story
