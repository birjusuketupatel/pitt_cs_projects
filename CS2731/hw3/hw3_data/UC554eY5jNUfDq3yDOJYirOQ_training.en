hello hello I'm doing great
hold on are you gonna make your
microphone stuff louder is that better
yeah oh hey yeah huh okay you have the
email or whatever uh yeah I do
oh sorry this is the first time I've
done something like this so I apologize
I'm a little nervous yeah no problem
it's fine all right real quick just to
establish what is your uh what is your
background
sure so I'm a current senior in
philosophy at UC Berkeley I am
graduating in a month and a half give or
take I am on track to graduate summa [ __ ]
laude so what does that mean
it's nice top of your class or whatever
okay yeah so top 4% of my class um what
is and then what is like your specialty
do you have that as an undergrad in
philosophy or is it just a broad general
yeah so broadly speaking you study
everything um it's really just sort of
personal interests so my personal
interest is definitely ethics and
political philosophy I'm really
interested in questions that sort of
Rawls covers and stuff like that right
yeah it's a little bit more meta ethical
than I like to get mostly because I find
a lot of these discussions to be kind of
misguided at the end of the day but yeah
I agree that yeah it's it's definitely
up my alley
which is why listening to these people
talk about the graph made me a little
bit skeptical okay all right cool um and
then I have no formal background in this
whatsoever I just talked to people like
you to get my opinion so don't you sure
okay okay best all right so let me just
read this okay yeah I wanted to add my
take is a semi-active professional
philosopher to the conversation you had
last night with a why full discloser I
talked with the two of them frequently
and they initially invited me to come on
and discuss last night with you I was
traveling for work I don't defend their
views of ethics though I do think one of
your criticisms is misguided I'm going
to it our most deeper conversation and
focus on one particular issue the issue
in contention is whether the poly
axiomatic ethical system is just use a
little Terry
so this is kind of my I know that she
puts this in quotes but this is just
kind of my first thing so I tried to
search for this has does anybody use the
term poly axiomatic is this like even a
real thing because I can't find like
anything yeah no I've never I've never
heard of anything put like that the
closest thing that I'm aware of that
gets to the idea is value pluralism yeah
but that was different from monism yeah
yeah and I but I don't think we need
when you say hold on one second I got a
[ __ ] fantasy when you say value
pluralism that's the values that you're
talking about there that doesn't have to
do with utilitarianism and deontology
does it well it has to do with the
fundamental values that both of those
principles so utilitarianism and
deontology refer to ethical frameworks
yeah but I don't actually have values in
and of themselves right well they're
built on values right so utilitarianism
is built on values like consequences
pertaining to the pleasure and pain
experienced by rational agents they
ontology is built on values having to do
with the respect that is owed to
rational agents outside of consequences
so they do have to do with values but
they go beyond the values let me try to
be like really clear when I say they
don't have they don't necessarily have
values they themselves don't imply value
so for instance like if I were to say I
am a dant ologist that doesn't
necessarily mean that I think murder is
wrong what it means is that if I think
murder is wrong I can interpret it
through a danto logical framework or
utilitarian framework right like just
saying oh yeah okay okay that's what I
mean okay yeah they don't prescribe
particular action just through the word
itself they prescribed formulas that get
us to answers a gotcha gotcha okay cool
cool so you would have a set of values
first and then you would interpret that
through the framework of de ontology or
consequential or daljeet consequence for
them right I mean that would probably be
the wrong way to go I think both of the
I think most philosophers would say you
should have the framework first and then
use that framework to arrive at your
value system it's sort of motivated
reasoning if you go the other way
okay sure okay okay yeah cool I can
understand it my second part then would
be neither of these things or axioms are
they or are they utilitarianism or
deontology
neither of them are
axioms per se they're built on axioms so
I guess you could boil them down to
really sort of brewed axioms like
pleasure - pain is the right thing to do
or you should always take the action
that is considered to respect agents to
the maximal degree so you can boil down
the systems to certain axioms but you
would probably be doing huge injustice
to the framework in doing so sure well
and then technically you can boil
everything down to an axiom by
definition right yeah yeah which is why
it's problematic okay guys yeah which is
why also the graph doesn't seem to make
sense for me like utilitarianism
probably wouldn't look this pretty
depending on what kind of utilitarianism
you're talking about you're not just
talking about well-being - suffering you
could be talking about total utility
average utility maximal average utility
there are so many different ways to
construe it that by only having one
variable on the graph you open up a lot
of questions
sure okay cool are you familiar with the
term threshold Anthology or I'm not
entirely sure what specifically that's
referring to it seems like it's a
modification on classical Conte anism
where n't you say that you know an
action is right or wrong
unless you're having to choose between a
conflicting action that also has to do
with the respect that is owed to a
particular agent gotcha so this is
something that I think I'm familiar with
okay so if I cut you off I'm just trying
to talk to make sure I have the right
idea before you get in a rut yeah so I'm
not trying to cut you ought to be
reduced tell me tell me if I don't
really have yeah I don't really have
thoughts on threshold de ontology and
I'm not entirely well-versed on it so I
just wanted to sort of put that out
there gotcha okay that's fine so my
understanding of this concept I think I
familiar with is like a classical
challenge to a day intelligence might be
something like Nazi comes to your door
knocks on the door and says are there
any Jews hiding your basement well the
Dan tile just has an imperative not to
lie because honesty is virtuous or
whatever so the so the day intelligence
has to tell the truth which would result
in a Jewish person being killed so I've
heard there are other forms of kind of
augmenting deontology so that you can
respect other agents in a way where
right telling the truth doesn't mean
killing someone right yes so that that
kind of that sounds like what this is
kind of getting at
when you talk about threshold dant ology
or whatever is that if you're gonna
write yeah it might be more helpful to
think of instead of it being a threshold
rather you're just weighing conflicting
obligations that you have so you have an
obligation not to lie to the Nazi but
you also have an obligation to the
people that are hiding in your house as
they are like every party involved is a
rational agent so then you're trying to
weigh what obligations you might have to
them and that's why I think it's more
helpful to understand these kind of
questions through a contractual astray
Merck rather than a strictly classical
Continent framework it is clearly okay
so then continuing on the email it is
clearly not utilitarianism is
simpliciter does that I guess it's a
fancy way of saying simply utilitarian
classical note that anything about
utility about utilitarian we should
general it's consequentialism
I take the following send its main
accurate description of HA okay um so
can I just skip to the end here I think
broadly speaking uh-huh the email is
correct but it doesn't matter so so this
is something that I don't understand so
this is what I have to understand what I
don't get is what so I'm gonna ignore
the fact that it really bothers me that
like phrases are being used here that I
can't find anywhere on the Internet
it's like poly axiomatic ethics this is
a phrase that I can't find anywhere in
anything but no one is any writing on
this whatsoever
well the purposes of the discussion you
can just understand that as referring to
the graph okay sure yeah I guess just
bothers me that if two people with no
background have created like a new
framework for philosophy it rubs me the
wrong way in a lot of different ways
right it's not a framework they're
trying to take some weird spin off of
value pluralism but without engaging
with any of the problems of pluralism
gotcha
or this or maybe threshold ant ology as
well maybe uh so I'm not entirely sure
so it looks like threshold de ontology
is being used here as a synonym but I'm
not sure how it's a synonym because they
ontology the reason why you it's
permissible under some interpretations
of the anthology to lie to the Nazi at
the door
does not have to do per se with
consequences it has to do with
obligations so I'm not even sure how you
would put de ontology as a threshold
concept into the term
they're trying to use in the graph okay
so my problem then with with the thing
that these people with this email is so
if I skip down to like um this statement
is pretty clearly into utilitarian
because it allows for the following true
ethical statements X is obligatory even
though it occurs negative fifty units of
utility X is not obligatory even though
it could it creates five hundred units
of utility how can you take add ant
illogical obligation and measure it in
terms of utility without it being you
thought you can't have so yeah that's
the biggest problem that I had with the
graph so here's I'm trying to find a
good way to put this so they tried to
get around this problem by saying uh
well just replace the ontology with
whatever D could be like the inherent
moral worth of an action but that phrase
moral worth of an action becomes
meaningless insofar as you throw a
ontology out the window so insofar as a
ontology or at least most forms of a
ontology would say that the obligation
that you have to perform or not perform
a specific action is binary not a
gradient so you either can or can't
perform it it's not case-by-case can you
perform it then you can't really
quantify whether something is more de
ontological or less down to logical the
way that you could try to make that work
is by saying instead of a ontology you
make a contractual ism do you know what
I mean when I say contractual ism no
okay so contractual ism you can be
thought of as almost a spinoff off of
the traditional content view basically
the idea is we things to other people
and that's where morality is grounded in
so if I make a promise to somebody then
that obligation to keep the promise
might outweigh my desire to just stay
home so it's not utilitarian right it
doesn't matter what brings you the most
pleasure ever met it matters what the
complications in our obligations are
guys sure yeah
now importantly and this is why it sort
of ties into day ontology even if you
haven't explicitly made a promise to
people you have obligations to other
people in virtue of them being human and
part of like your social group right so
I might not have explicitly promised not
to kill you
but I'm not justified in killing you I
have that obligation sort of de facto
right
kind of approaching like a categorical
norm or something or imperative sort of
the the main deviation between
contractual ISM and a ontology is that
you can weigh those obligations to
decide what actions you altima take so
the main reason why this is considered
better than des ontology in my view is
that it allows you to weigh obligations
that you have to people that you care
about more than strangers so it's better
to keep a promise to my mother than it
is to keep a promise to a random
stranger because of the obligations I
have to my mother right gotcha could
aunt Ella just argue that you have
stronger obligations or whatever to
people that you know versus strangers or
no-cut doesn't really have the tools to
do that in my view that insofar as
they're all reasonable agents in this
set setting then it doesn't matter right
because you have obligations equally
people this is this is the fundamental
problem with mapping de ontology to
utilitarianism like the graph does is
because de ontology fundamentally
assumes that you cannot interchange
people you can't say I'm going to help X
person at the expense of y person
because hey they're interchangeable
right pleasure is pleasure pain is pain
that's not okay
contractual ism says there are
meaningful differences between people
that allows that that changes the nature
of our obligations to them so the reason
why I bring up contractual ism is
because that's one way that you could
potentially order the obligations that
you have to other people such that you
can maybe make some kind of gradients I
don't know how you would put numbers on
that but it certainly would make a lot
more sense than de ontology which just
says you have an obligation period and
it's not a more-or-less obligation
gotcha and then I okay and then just so
I made the statement but I don't
actually know i shouldn'ta made this
statement in Indian Tala G is one action
more wrong than another or do you just
have binary rights and wrongs like say
like murdering one person person versus
murdering two people yeah my
understanding is that and again I could
be wrong I'm not a Content philosopher
but my understanding so the reason why
the dant ologist says in the trolley
problem
don't touch the lever is because you
cannot engage in a system that's going
to be using another as an means to an
end
so even though you could save one person
as opposed to saving five and so you
could argue through your inaction you're
killing the five the deontologist says
no you're refusing to engage with that
thing to do because it is wrong to pull
the lever in either direction
okay wait and then I think I missed the
very beginning of that so would you say
then that they're just binary rights and
wrongs wasn't it more wrong or more
right than another wrong or right my
understanding would say yes yes okay
gotcha
just entangling
I guess I'm kind of confused cuz you
said you broadly agree the email but it
seems like so it seems like we both
agree that we disagree that dant
illogical obligations can be measured in
units of utility right we agree that
that's probably not true
correct I the reason why I agree broadly
speaking is because I'm charitably under
understanding the email says if insofar
as you have some framework that gives
actions some kind of inherent moral
worth then that will that framework will
lead you to a different conclusion yeah
yeah this is my question okay is that
yeah if you have quote unquote inherent
moral worth but then you ascribe that
inherent moral worth some utility so
that you can measure it against other
utility I don't know I guess I'm just
not understand how that's not just
utilitarianism does it does it what'd I
just say makes sense I think so so the
the main thing that confused me about
the email is it seems to me that there's
a confusion in terms because what what
they're trying to do is say that there
is a different framework that so okay
actually maybe I can just answer your
question more directly so utilitarianism
cares only about pleasure and pain right
that's that's the primary thing that's
driving us here using utility in a
seemingly different term
yeah actually well actually let's let's
do this real quick because I might be
wrong here then so I'm not aware that I
thought I thought that utilitarianism
measure
utility where utility can be more
broadly defined than just pleasure and
pain is that not true uh yes it can so
that that gets the distinction between
like the very very traditional
utilitarian coming out of like Bentham
and the more modern form of
utilitarianism that comes out of mill
mill says it's not about pleasure and
pain so much as it is about happiness
yes and where that even happiness
Flexcon yeah it can be very broadly so
like maybe you're happy not maximizing
like maybe a soldier jumping in front of
a grenade might find happiness in that
or whatever even if it doesn't maximize
or something like that right that
happiness doesn't necessarily map onto
strict pleasure and pain or something
well sort of so Mill defines happiness
is sort of define being defined by
higher and lower pleasures lower
pleasures being more in the vein of like
the Bentham pleasures food sex whatever
higher pleasures being more like
intellectual stimulation being able to
sort of find fulfillment in other areas
of your life so it's just a more complex
form of pleasure I suppose you could say
sure how about like it's a better
example somebody becoming a priest and
forgoing sexual activity like even
though I was having lots of sex I'd be
seen as pleasurable yeah the higher
fulfillment or whatever okay yeah Mills
totally on board with discounting lower
pleasures in exchange for higher
pleasures here it seems like they're not
using utility in either of those senses
they mean utility and this is the
problem with the graph and with moral
pluralism more broadly right the the
bigger problem here is that they assume
that there is at some point a place
where the value of that what they're
what they're defining as they ontology
is exceeded by the value of
consequentialism yeah that bright-line
appeals to a third framework that is yet
undefined that says at this point it is
now worth it to take the action or not
take the action okay so insofar as they
do that the utility that the email is
referencing seems to be talking about
utility on that third framework that is
able to met say look that utility isn't
the same as utilitarian utility insofar
as it's going to be
taking you in a different direction so
maybe it's easier to talk in terms of
variables like if we're calling the
variable that the graph is going to spit
out as like the value of an action alpha
and the utility that a strictly Tillet
Arianism would ascribe to the action
beta beta is not going to be the same as
alpha right because they're using
something else to modify alpha another
framework um but it seems like an order
to get to UM in order to arrive at alpha
all right what's up my dude hey it's
nice to talk to you thank you talk to
you too buddy all right what do you got
for me
okay so I'm an anthro major in undergrad
right now okay which isn't that much of
an accomplishment but I'm hoping the
major and get my degree in biological
anthropology but in my cultural
anthropology class what we talked about
was how you really shouldn't call
general female genital mutilation
mutilation you should just call it cut
it and I think you would a group you
would agree with this if you if you
follow what I'm gonna say okay hit me up
okay so basically why you shouldn't call
it mutilation is essentially because
what what do you have in mind
where mutilation is a good thing it's
not yeah so by calling it mutilation
right off the bat you're already telling
them that what they're doing is bad you
have a switch point right yeah right but
what you're supposed to look at from an
anthropological point of view is if
you're looking at another culture and
what they're doing with their culture
you can't assign any sort of you know
context that would be perceived
negatively to their culture so by color
talking it's something like historically
or anthropologically sure yeah that's my
that's my whole point that's why I said
you know being it usually when I refer
to FGM usually it's in the context
talking about male genital mutilation as
well circumcision right right in the I
think the United States know what what
country not the United States what
there's a euro country that just banned
circumcision I want to say Sweden but I
don't remember but I know that yeah
somebody president yeah so I don't know
I don't know why because that's another
question is that how come male genital
mutilation in this case is you know
allowed in the United States and female
genital mutilation isn't and I know
that's like a like a big red flag is
like wow
you know of course it's not you're
cutting off the clitoris of the vagina
that I call about the same thing I mean
I'll refer to I refer to circumcisions
mutilation as well yeah and I mean but
do you believe circumcision should be
banned as well yeah okay that's
generality well because I have beliefs
about respecting the autonomy of people
and when it comes to children making
permanent changes to them requires a
great justification so for instance I
think vaccinations are adequately
justified I mean we can go into I guess
women is justified or not that's a kind
of a side conversation but I don't
believe that mutilating somebody's
genitals is justified generally right
obviously if they're like exceedingly
rare circumstances where it's required
but okay I can get that I brought this
up in the in the in the subreddit mm-hmm
and everyone on the subreddit is very
[ __ ] well I think it's necessarily
that I mean if you're studying
anthropology I mean the onus is on you
to understand why they would respond
that way right right saying like it
would be like saying if there is a
culture in the past and their culture
involved maybe gang raping nine-year-old
boys but they called it like the like
the young boys ceremony I think that
conventionally speaking most people
would probably refer to it as like the
gang rape that they used to do boys in
the past right typically people in
current societies will describe their
current moral systems on to past
societies and judge them by their
current role system right pretty
understandable I mean it's not I guess
talking like a strictly historical sense
I mean you're correct it doesn't make
sense
strictly historically to prescribe our
morals on the past people it doesn't
really make much sense but I mean
convened our I get yeah
I guess what I guess I should call them
not [ __ ] but uninformed on
anthropology because everyone on the on
the subreddit was you know thinking that
I'm arguing for you know key population
and
that's obviously I'm not you know a big
proponent of you know cutting off the
clitoris or sealing up the vagina or you
know whatever uh-huh I'm just I'm just
I'm just I don't know I mean like words
are I mean like the thing is it like
it's very strange that you're confused
by this if you seem to understand the
cultures of the past you should
understand the culture of the present
right like obviously people are going to
act in this way because you if somebody
is if somebody steps into a thread and
they're going to great lengths to defend
the use or to ban the use of a certain
word then you have to start ascribing
motivations to that person and the most
obvious one is that this person doesn't
think that this sort of genital
mutilation is wrong that would be the
first thing I would think of now you can
argue well no in anthropological context
this makes more sense but most people
aren't having anthropological
conversations right right so I mean like
generally mutilation is something that
occurs today still in different
countries and I think that most people
and because we live in a pretty
globalized society right due to the
internet and whatnot I think that we we
tend to share our values across the
globe even if people don't necessarily
say we do this is for instance why we'll
look at some countries and say you know
what they do with their work culture in
Japan is wrong and it's like okay well
can you really say that as a westerner
looking at an Eastern country or we
might say that the way that Muslim women
are treated in certain countries is
wrong and it's like well not really
depending on you know the particular
flavor of Islam or whatever [ __ ] they're
following it's not really wrong but but
that's not how people have these
conversations in today's day and age and
the globalized society that we live and
we tend to we tend to project our moral
systems onto every other person and
every other person seems to project
their mostest want everybody else that
seems to be the way things go right
right sorry I just I guess I was feeling
attacked on the subreddit but what
you're saying makes sense and I think I
got a comment on the subreddit thread
that basically says what you're saying
sure it's like why would you bring this
up on the subreddit yes if there were
people that were engaging in an
anthropological conversation where they
were disagreement with the reason then
in that case I could understand like oh
yeah
like FGM is a morally loaded term it
doesn't really make sense to judge a
past Society by today's morals and it's
not really an accurate way of because
they wouldn't have seen it as that right
they're not seeing as mutilating you
know but but when we were talking today
in the present tense I mean that is how
we describe it right yeah man I had all
these notes had all these notes set up
like how you were gonna say know me it's
mutilation no matter what you way to
look at it I was going to talk about
like how it's a it's the emic and etic
perspectives do you know what emic and
etic are in anthropology nope Emma
kinetic emic is like what they think
it's like if you're right if you're
reading something and it's written from
you know first-hand perspective that's
the emic the etic is what the
anthropologist sees so with the emic
what they would think in the like what
their culture would think is I oh it's a
it's a you know rite of passage it's a
it's just normal you do this when you're
transferring you know you're you're
becoming a woman and the etic would be
this is like the controlling of the
female sexuality it's the denying them
of pleasure and so on and so forth so I
just think that's also important when
you're thinking of calling mutilation or
cutting because I think the UN they were
talking about this in the UN and trying
to like say oh you can't do this to
people but I think they came to a
conclusion that you have to call it
cutting and not mutilation in the
National sense I guess is that actually
true my professor brought it up I'm
looking it up right now
so this was supposedly I don't know when
you took this class trying to find the
date this article was posted but right
now there is on the United Nations
website
I see the International Day of zero
tolerance for female genital mutilation
okay I'm at that too and they're very
clearly using fjm or FGM to describe
this
so FGM is still used I see it on the
w-h-o site as well that was an article
posted this year about nine months ago
interesting so I guess what my professor
was telling me was wrong well not only
does it sound wrong it also like sounds
like actually robbers like it would be
incorrect for the UN to do this because
the UN today should not be respecting
other cultures in this sense it should
be prescribing some sort of moral values
to other cultures that that's the entire
point of the UN well I shouldn't say
that that's way too broad I shouldn't
say but that's one of the purposes of
the UN is to bring other sites morally
in line with or other countries or
states I guess more lay in line with
other states right yeah so like for
instance like if there was some place
that had a practice called had a
practice called you know holy servitude
or something and it was where like all
black people had a duty in society to be
slaves to you know white people I don't
think the UN would say well we shouldn't
call that slavery we should respect
their terminology and called it wholly
servitude they would probably just call
it so it was slavery and said that we
need to end it right or if there was a
practice related to sex trafficking they
would just call it sex trafficking they
wouldn't use whatever nice phrase right
right
yeah I'm not seeing anything here about
the cutting or the mutilation thing sure
but wait in order to break but to bring
these people to like the table doesn't
even talk about saying like in the UN
sense to try and sayin hey stop doing
this you know what why how should they
go about it
holy [ __ ] I have no [ __ ] idea that's
like a intersectional that's like a 50
million different answers there is no
just one way to do it
I mean people from outside organizations
can come in and do like teaching and
education for women that are going to
have children to get them to not do it
to their daughters access to the
economic change
so things that give people access to
media from across the world where they
see that that's not normalized and
they're exposed to that sorts of media
you can get a lot of secularization
there that discourages that stuff people
outside groups coming in and protesting
it directly documentaries or stories
that highlight women that have endured
these kinds of practices and then the
side effects that happened there in
medical training that's sponsored by
outside organizations that comes in and
gets people to stop performing so I mean
there's probably like 50 trillion
different ways you can combat a problem
like this yeah yeah I get that but do
you think calling it cutting instead of
mutilation would make a difference I
don't have data to answer that I don't
not sure I just don't know I'm not
trying to be difficult just I really
don't know I like I understand the point
that you're trying to make is that if
you're more generous with somebody's
point of view you can get them on your
side more but I'm not sure I just don't
know the answer to that it feels like
that the answer one way or another but
my worry would be that calling it
cutting as opposed to FGM would do more
harm than good because anybody that
hears of the practice is going to think
not as poorly of it like you said right
like um where because language could be
prescriptive right
if somebody says FGM immediately you
have a bad thing in your head even if
you don't know about the practice and I
think globally most of us agree that it
is a bad practice so we would want to
call it something that conveys without
immediately whereas there might be a
bunch of people that think of cutting
and it's like oh it's just cutting and
then you have to tell like well wait
that's actually bad I'm like oh I didn't
know it was bad like you know so that
might do more harm than good for
worldwide awareness about it okay
I think we're moving away from
anthropology but yeah I believe yeah
yeah that's the kind of the whole point
was that these aren't anthropological
discussions these are like current-day
philosophical and political discussions
right well I would think that would you
not say that's part of their culture I
mean when it where is female genital
mutilation done outside of you know put
the cultural realm it's not done like as
a recreational type thing or it's not
done you know right when the baby's born
yeah sure so we can back up we can back
up and ask a different question because
we're kind of circling around a more
fundamental question it's just one
culture have the right to tell another
culture that their practices are bad
that's the real question that's being
asked here right right and it sounds
like you're feeling like the answer to
that is no right gotcha I'm because I
think if if you say if you're like
basically calling it mutilation from
your kind of like art yeah again you're
resigning sort of you know what you're
doing is bad and therefore you are bad
like that's a bad thing why are you
doing that mm-hmm right and so my whole
thing is like that's a kind of a
slippery slope when you call what people
do like when you think that yes I
understand what you're saying but the
thing is that like we just live in a
different world today where our society
is so globalized that it would be hard
to tolerate certain types of ideas from
different cultures because we're all
kind of intermingling know like
everybody exists on the world stage
everybody shares entertainment
everybody's connected to each other on
the Internet if there are certain groups
of people that are part of this
globalized society that have these kind
of like horrible practices you would
probably be compelled to condemn it and
call it out and this is ignoring that
the normal moral obligations that a lot
of people feel they have like a lot of
people feel like just you know they just
by virtue of existence that they have
moral obligations to not stand for this
type of treatment a lot of people would
say I don't
slavery or sexual trafficking in other
countries just because it's another
culture like I think that's just a wrong
that should be corrected anywhere so but
we're not even getting into that I think
you can argue from a self-interested
perspective hey you know we live in a
globalized society today all of our
cultures are intermingling I don't want
these toxic aspect of other cultures to
be accepted anywhere because I don't
them to be accepted here at some point
right
okay yeah but what I was I'm just having
trouble with cuz like what did we draw
the line where do we draw the line and
saying Oh something because there's a
culture in the middle in the middle of
Brazil the yanomamö tribe and the
yanomamö tribe you know they think that
everyone else is subhuman other than
them and what like where would you say
like the line is the power of who is the
power to enforce the culture right now
that's the Western world the United
States and its allies okay is who
enforces the culture is whoever is the
most powerful person that's just a fact
of life I can't argue whether or not
it's right or wrong but I mean that's
just how it goes right that was the
whole point of the that was the one of
the events following the world war two
was the fight for a global influence
between the east in the between Russia
and communism I guess in the United
States and her allies and we seem to
have come out on top of that so now the
prerogative is ours to enforce our
culture around the world okay yeah I see
that now
all right well I just wanted to talk to
you about some anthropology memes sure
all right
well hey thanks for the conversation
buddy I appreciate it yeah no problem
all right peace out
[Music]
you
[Music]
Hey what's going on dude yeah heard
you're finally ready to join the
Minecraft ever dude point finally ready
to join the minecraft server what you
mean I'm speculating
what's up doing how you doing I'm doing
great I think my voice is a little I
lost my voice cuz I was screaming at
screaming at propagandist last night all
night as I'm sure I think you saw yeah
we watch the whole thing huh oh you did
whole thing well first of all I'm
honored I'm glad that you uh you took
the time out and debate prep that I
heard that you didn't like a lot of my
my points or you didn't like all of it
um no I mean I think most your points
were pretty good it's more more just
like communicating propaganda
effectively I guess oh yeah
I mean it's so I mean I'm easy it's it's
really like the main the main points
that I like the main issues that I had
with Charlie were outright lying about
certain information every now and then
and then Gish galloping non-stop and in
throwing up completely unrelated
throwing up completely unrelated
statistics bringing up how great the
American economy is and every single
time I turned around I was like this has
nothing to do with the point I'm making
he would then move the goalposts to a
completely different perspective he
would just run away from answering
questions every time I asked them
pointed questions it was just basically
first of all the room was full of Trump
supporters as I'm sure you gathered from
the applause every single time
Charlie would just go back to the same
talking points over and over again
which were his tweets essentially which
could easily be summarized as capitalism
good socialism bad without necessarily
like even though I would break down
exactly the differences and say like
look this is a social democracy I'm not
advocating for full socialism there
actually I don't think full socialism
has ever been completely a mastered
there are different variants and
whatever it didn't matter because he
kept ignoring my points and he just kept
saying his stuff over and over and over
again so it was like one side trying to
have a conversation while the other side
was just there to disseminate missing
for me
to these hordes of hogs sitting in the
crowd [ __ ] like [ __ ] clapping like
Pavlovian dogs dude every single time
they were like yeah [ __ ] unions they
were booing me because of unions yeah I
mean that's sounds like a conservative
talking point yeah I mean like I say
you've like correctly identified kind of
like the primary strategies and they're
very very hard
keep in mind first of all that anything
I say like I don't trust me of all the
people in the world I acknowledge that
this is way [ __ ] harder to deal with
in a live format then to be sitting on
the sidelines watching it's very easy
for me to pick out problems when I was
watching yeah so yeah so so keep in mind
if I say anything like obviously I
totally recognize that doing this in a
life event like I watch my debate
sometimes like oh [ __ ] like why didn't I
[ __ ] catch that like there's so
obvious is so dumb oh yeah no for sure
the guy washer debates all-time and and
you know there's there certainly like
there's certainly on the spot there
certainly elements that you like can't
get to and and the same happen with me
as well yeah and by the way no like be
as brutal as you want because I want
constructive criticism especially
because I'm gonna be debating if Charlie
doesn't back out out to this I'm gonna
be debating him in Dallas and also in
Mesa and in Denver in November during
the midterms after the midterm so I'm
really excited because I need to do a
lot more a lot more of these debates
like this is something that I haven't
ever done before Lima the first time I
ever did a debate was literally in front
of a live audience last year at Politico
know with Charlie and I didn't do a
really good job defending my perspective
but I did a good job of like kind of
unmasked him a little bit trolling him a
little bit getting him angry getting him
on his toes but this year I I was I came
prepared
and I don't know if I focused enough I'm
like actually embarrassing him yeah so
the thing that you have to um the thing
that you have to first figure out is
like why are you there like what is your
goal like are you there to have a debate
where you prove him wrong on an issue
are you there to look good for the
audience or are you there to hash out
and settle like actually debate like
really like 1 or 2 like concrete points
that's like the first thing because how
you how what your ultimate goal is is
going to completely determine the
a rhetorical route that you take you
know there's not a right answer to this
either by the way it could be whatever
you want it to be oh yeah I know my I
have two goals okay one is winning
winning in the marketplace of ideas know
what I mean you laugh but like people
like Bernie did it so I mean it's really
important like I said there are no wrong
answers here yeah absolutely
so one is the primary goal there is
potentially winning over you know the
40-40-20 concept where it's like 23 who
said that what did you get that from
I don't know I i I've I don't know
exactly what it is but like my oh [ __ ]
no I know what you're talking about
that's my concept I even call it a
40-40-20 [ __ ] who's ripping my [ __ ] yeah
but I know exactly you're talking about
but yeah but it's like it's just like
the well I I've never thought about it
in like exact defined metrics but I'm
saying like as far as like they're
impartial people in audience okay
so my goal not only in inside of that
room but also as an aftermath like after
on the Internet to win over some people
who are impartial who look at that and
go oh wow like I learned a lot about
socialism today and this guy looked
embarrassing on the other side and and
and I think the other dude like compose
himself presented himself in a really
like intellectual capacity he did a good
job and he showed he taught me things
that I didn't necessarily think about
before and the other element is just
like owning the cons or owning the libs
even every now and then if that's what's
necessary and and and create like a
highlight reel because that is
absolutely successful as far as
propaganda goes and I think we need to
be doing more of that on the left so
that's essentially what it is this is
not an this is not an intellectual
conversation between two peers who
genuinely want to solve a problem but
this is for entertainment for the most
part mmm-hmm but I want to use that that
element of entertainment that where
people tune in and use that for for for
educating people share not necessarily
just educating people on like how to
debate conservatives which is important
but also educating people on just
allowing them to find allowing them to
look at things in a more open-minded way
especially when it comes to
analyzing and approaching socialism
okay sure yeah I mean that's fine so do
you understand how he functions do you
see kind of what his game is yeah so I
mean you can break it down even further
but I think his game is Gish galloping
and just exclusively [ __ ] we're
playing to the crowd for applauses he
even times out as applause breaks in the
intro if you saw it like yep comedians
do this it's very smart to do this yeah
yeah yeah he knows exactly what's gonna
get an applause break he is like crafted
his messaging for every single issue he
has probably accomplished on like 30
improper data points that he can pull
yeah when he started going on about
certain things like when he started
going into LASIK I know the exact
YouTube video when we were watching it
on stream I'm using exact YouTube video
that he was referring to it's a John
Stossel it's not it is a John Stossel
like like I brought up the video
on-screen we watch like two minutes of
it and he repeated every single talking
point verbatim so yeah as long as I'm
like you I look at this [ __ ] all the
time obsessively from like Thomas owl
and like blacks on welfare all the way
to like all these other conservative
thinkers and like how they create their
talking points but that one wasn't
something I had heard before but it
doesn't matter it's just such a [ __ ]
small focus like it has nothing to do
with the conversation that I was trying
to yeah it had nothing to do with the
conversation that I I wanted to have as
far as like health care like overall
health care or even like a social
democracy there was plenty of points
where I was some people in my chatter
saying assign you should drop socialism
and go with social democracy if he's
gonna be arguing for social democracy
yeah that was that was an interesting
thing to like he can he kept conflating
social democracies the [ __ ] like
Mao's China yeah so like so his goal
what the way that he functions right
conservatives are so [ __ ] good at this
okay and I don't say if I ever say
liberal no no okay so Democrats also
Democrat so I'll try to be clear my
terminology so Democrats historically
have been very bad at this
Republican slash conservatives have been
very good at this is is having
have your play like I've seen it like a
fallout game like a Bethesda game video
game yes yeah okay so like you know when
you start talking to an NPC they have
like pre-programmed dialogue trees this
is what this is what a conservative is
ice up there is so many times in the
debate where he started to do this and I
wasn't sure
and again like I can identify this time
watching with the sidelines it's harder
in person for like when he would start
saying things like oh you want to talk
about a unitary but like Finland Sweden
Norway it's like oh god here it comes -
like it's always the same [ __ ] life
yeah it's always the same like Venezuela
like just like it's the same rehearsed
dialogue tree as soon as he like as soon
as you let him go he will like launch
into a tirade that's like his
pre-planned you know five eight wait you
can almost like it's almost like when
I'm chris Christie like deeper or not
not deprogrammed but like identified
like Rubio's programming during the
debate went when do you remember that
during the Republican debates when when
Chris Christie called out Rubio for like
here goes his pre-planned speech and
Rubio went into the same like you know
to it yeah it's like one of those things
except conservatives actually do this on
ironically like all the [ __ ] time if
you want to have a debate there's two
things there's well there's like three
different ways you can kind of approach
this so the most effective way is
actually um what Bernie Sanders does so
what Bernie Sanders does is like if you
want to talk about like social democracy
or you want to talk about like liberal
like Democrat talking points that [ __ ]
is insanely [ __ ] complicated okay
it's too much to do and win a debate
you're always gonna get like out winded
by your opponent who can just hammer
home a few good talking points right
the thing that you do to take the wind
out of out of the sails of somebody
that's going to get calop a million
[ __ ] facts at you is to pose them
questions at the end that everybody in
the audience can identify with so for
instance Bernie Sanders would always
hammer home like the same three talking
points why are the 1% getting richer and
richer why can nobody afford health care
why does it feel like all of our jobs
suck right like these are the things
they did hammer home you can pose these
questions on the backend of every single
thing that Charlie says and I think he
comes out looking worse for it so when
Charlie says is 50 million like all the
economy blah blah blah blah blah 85
percent of small business mother was
like okay well why is it then if we have
all this stuff why can't we afford
health care for our people why can't we
afford decent education what because
you're giving me all these numbers that
saying everything is good but for
some reason you know nobody can afford a
college education on going $150,000 in
debt like why you know like yeah I watch
the whole thing yeah oh you did okay so
like in the in in the beginning in the
beginning I I started off identifying
the problem and also backing up with
data like talking about you know the
rate of the the number of people living
in poverty in this country the number of
people living in extreme poverty in this
country and like I think I saw one of
your highlighted clips where you were
like oh yeah that's a good point that
you made as far as the as far as like
saying what who cares what our GDP is if
people are you know yeah that was one of
the few times where you need you have to
take the wind out of his sails cuz if
he's gonna sit there and throw a million
facts at you you've got to be ready to
question it and like he does it so much
it's it every time friends are like this
is something I were to call about it
every time I hear him say like oh I'm
35,000 different donors because it
really well what percentage of those
donors our country are making up like
the whole of your donation based sort of
right like you say you've got 35,000
donors well what percentage of your
money comes from like a few donors right
like these on his campaign when he was
running against Cynthia Nixon where
people correctly count called him out
for having massive donors for the most
part he went in and he got like one of
his what are the people in his campaign
went in and purchased and made like 69
donations at one dollar in order to like
you know in order to muddy up the data
and make it seem as though there were
more donors than more small donors and
they do this all the time and that's
precisely what Charlie's doing as well
they know how to [ __ ] operate because
Turning Point USA is essentially a dark
money super PAC that exclu that serves
the exclusive purpose of disseminating
conservative propaganda points but also
eating even worse than that and this is
admitted and this is something I called
him out last year in the political
debate which he lied directly to my face
about is that they want to change their
a super PAC that aims to to change the
outcomes of college campus elections
student student body like they wanna
they want a non representative student
governing body and they do that through
funding millions of dollars in to call
campus elections all around the country
Charlie has admitted I think in 2015
where he said openly where he openly
admitted hey we're not gonna change the
students minds we're not going to get
the teachers fired because they're
tenured but what we can do is change the
student the the governing body of the
the the student government that's
essentially what he was doing and and I
think his Democrats are trying to do it
with immigration
I know and then what's it's all
projection yeah I know
absolute projection and they do a really
good job at it because on the one hand
they're doing it flagrantly and then on
the other hand they're accusing the
Democrats of doing it and it doesn't
matter because if you do enough racial
agitation these [ __ ] hogs are gonna
sit back and say hey you know what this
is fine because at least like they're
protected my best interest you know what
I mean yeah but yeah he's admitted that
and also I think the number is two point
two million dollars in a 2015 pamphlet
that they were handing out to their
donors Jane Mayer found out on a New
Yorker investigation that they literally
were spending 2.2 million dollars on
college campus student elections nice
yeah
so it's ridiculous but yeah as far as
like as far as the talking points go
though like I don't know what else did
you I don't know how to [ __ ] shut him
the [ __ ] up you know what I mean yeah I
mean like basically in a live debate
format like that they're never gonna let
you shut down a Gish gala because you're
because the thing is the thing that
sucks like it's so it's such an
effective debate trick because for you
to shut down a Gish Gallup you have to
come off cross as an [ __ ] you've got
to interrupt your opponent so friends is
like when I bring on people to debate it
like I very clearly I'll say at the very
beginning if I ever say anything that
you disagree with interrupt me
immediately and we can discuss that
premise because I don't don't let me
keep going if you two screws something
and then I'm going to do the same to you
because what happens is is when you
allow somebody to get calop you you've
lost the argument before you can even
respond right if you want to if we want
to talk about like blacks in America and
you let me say okay let's talk about
blacks well firstly it's 100 percent
statistically proven that they have
genetically inferior IQ secondly every
single black person across worlds
committed at least three murders for
eclis every single black person across
the world has 16 on which shows every
single bubble and then I do that and
then the N is like how can you defend
black people it's like holy
[ __ ] well okay well hold on I gotta go
back to the very [ __ ] first thing you
said we're gonna spend five minutes
arguing that point if I'm wrong on even
a single sub point in that first point
it's gonna feel like I've lost every
single point like you absolutely can
never ever if you're trying to have a
real debate and the other guy is
engaging in get out you always lose you
can't win it's just it's not winnable
even if you're correct on everything
you'll never win that debate ever it's a
very effective tactic
yeah that's precisely what happened but
but I think even despite all of that
there were certain moments where I would
interject if I if I caught something not
necessarily just like a prop Oh God when
he said that Cubans have a fifteen-year
lesser lifespan that Americans love just
not true the Cuban health care system is
is well one one of my favorite one of my
favorite talking points are one of my
favorite components of like the Cuban
flex on the health care system is that
they send more dog export a lot of
health care yeah yeah they send more
doctors to areas the disenfranchised
areas then America does like at least
one more I think in every instance not
not like a higher rate of doctors like
more doctors as a totality Oh something
that you you almost did but eventually
he got away from it it's you got a hold
his feet to the fire when he makes
sometimes there I wish I could remember
cuz I was maybe Sonny Chow remember
there was one time we you almost got him
on this where like when he says some
real dumb [ __ ] you got a [ __ ] to make
him justify it and you were so close
sometimes my favorite one was I think
well that that was an okay one but an
even better one because if it's on a
claim that he made is when he said the
Democrat policies were causing black
people kill each other in Chicago I
really want to hear a causal chain for
how advocating for free education leads
to gangsters killing other people in the
street I really want to hear that story
because that sounds fascinating to me I
or to later down the line hey what's up
buddy hey alright perfect you can hear
me well yeah and everything
are you guys like streaming somewhere do
I need to like doing something alright
oh no I'm streaming currently on my
twitch at twitch.tv slash Casa Nabi but
you don't need to link it doesn't matter
like I'm twitch streaming on my twitch
as well what's that wait how do you
spell that say look further people in my
audience that don't know how to spell
that how do you do oh it's a twitch.tv
/h Asin ABI oh I got you okay Chloe yeah
oh by the way what I was gonna say is
for those of you who are on my side of
the stream Destiny's awesome a couple of
the it was like some of my moderators
including space and also some of the
fans like rag bang or telling me that I
should link up with this guy and then I
started watching his videos and they're
excellent I really like what he's about
so I'm excited and I hope you guys get
to know him a little bit better and you
can enjoy his videos as well so that's
what we're doing
he's like huge on he's a professional
Starcraft player I think right destiny
are you a Steve um I I used to be that's
why I initially got popular but um and
then you said [ __ ] all of that I'm gonna
I'm just gonna debate people on the
internet instead know that alienate half
of my audience well that's more than
that I've changed politically quite a
bit but that was um that was a long time
ago like I just started politics like
two years ago and I don't do it's still
a full time it's just like half and half
okay I'm still a gamer play I play video
games know I play video games when i
game I play video games right so let's
go that one well I'm like I'm on the
opposite end of that where I love video
games like I started playing dota never
had a professional level or anything but
when I was in Turkey I played dota and
then I kind of quit for a little bit and
I've always been interested in politics
and then I became a political
commentator and now I'm like going to
the other side where I I'm getting other
games
alright yeah now I play games um I mean
I I have been playing games I just like
started twitch streaming with video
games - OH
gotcha oh yeah well yeah I know it's and
you know I I am like very much a part of
that like edgy early online like 2000
era
you know what I mean and then like I
kind of grew up in that environment this
thing I'm 27 okay yeah I'm 29 I know
what you're talking about yeah so like
so like our different place no no yeah
no no I I grew up in that environment
too like you know game FAQ calm [ __ ]
even though I was in Turkey at the time
so like I kind of understand where you
come from as far as like still being
very much like a part of that gamer
community and and speaking to other
gamers who have like decided that their
entire political perspective is like it
just completely revolves around being
against sjw's on YouTube yeah and I wait
sorry I don't mean to call y'all but if
you want to if you want to turn on
camera we can do like a dual like you
can have your face on here as well um
sure why not hold on do you want to do
that alright I got to kill any doing so
I do that oh [ __ ] oh oh don't kill your
camera on your own stream don't worry
about it then oh you sure yeah no it's
fine okay
it doesn't matter I don't know how to do
the permissions thing like I'm I I quit
what do you call it
I quit [ __ ] using pcs for a while
because I was like exclusively playing
on the console and and then I got back
into Windows PCs because when I started
streaming I needed it and it sucks like
the permissions [ __ ] is like so
difficult I can't comprehend it I don't
know how to I don't know how to work
around that
don't you have like guys for that [ __ ]
isn't that what their job oh no no I the
twitch stuff is just like exclusively on
my own I do it all completely on my own
like I obviously I get like help from my
agents and whatnot a little bit and like
twitch has been very good and very
helpful but it's just all my [ __ ] like
twitch is just my my twitch stream is
just my own gotcha
yeah I don't I don't get any help from
like tea white tea white tea live
streams on YouTube the other thing yeah
and they look me I've got like a whole
studio [ __ ] said I don't think any of
them to tell you yeah they yeah they
have like a full professional streaming
setup there even though they have their
own issues as well streaming is very
difficult anyway but we don't have
talked about that
give us your give us like your your
political perspective and whatnot cuz
I'm very interested to personally find
out cuz like I've seen a lot of your
videos mhm and I feel like I agree with
you on almost everything gosh so I just
wanted to hear what your perspective is
I know that you don't like labels and
whatnot but what would you try to define
your your ideology as yeah are you a
lefty I forget I'm not actually sure oh
no yeah I am I mean but like but I but I
get where you're I get your concerns
about like I'm not I'm not like fully
subscribed to any particular ideology I
think like every single one on the left
especially every time I can generalize I
mean like on social issues I'm probably
gonna align pretty closely with anybody
that's progressive I would imagine and
then on economic issues I probably tend
to fall more oh man I want to say
conservative like I'm a big fan of
markets and market forces and capitalism
knowledge [ __ ] I'm very much like still
a liberal but but I recognize the need
for a healthy amount of government
intervention I think is it like a sock
them yeah yeah Social Democrat would be
like what you've got yeah like a sock to
him I think or the dirty word maybe
neoliberal although those guys seem
pretty [ __ ] crazy sometimes like look
he's like I've heard some neoliberalism
is like neoliberalism is like a full
subscription to like to deny that to
deny that like capitalism has any sort
of faults that that be corrected by
corrected by government regulation I
don't know if I would I'm an ar-10
really careful neoliberal exists there's
like two different types of
neoliberalism one is the insult that
lefties use at anybody that they think
like sucks off corporations massively
they will I call everybody loot
neoliberal but then I'll have people
that will email me and I took that for a
while I was like [ __ ] neoliberal sort
of right are basically like Democrat
they're like um they remind me of the
old libertarians where the guy is like
I'm socially Democrat but I'm actually a
economically conservative you've never
seen someone like me before he's like
okay yeah like that kind of attitude but
then every now and then I'll get an
email from somebody is like hey listen
up like neoliberal is actually
acknowledge there's a ton of fault with
capitalist systems and we totally
advocate for government intervention in
a lot of these things like in health
care and welfare etc so I I'm
uncomfortable maybe you're more a couple
I'm uncomfortable liberal because I
don't [ __ ] know right now like what
the overall binding principles are for
neo liberals but yeah I've heard like
two pretty radically different things
yeah no I mean I guess like right now as
it stands the the defining issue I would
use to figure out if someone is like a
neoliberal or like somewhat more
progressive as a Democrat would be
Medicare for all
like a lot of people including like the
jon favreau like the pod save america
bros all immediately as soon as like
medicare for all was brought up during
the time of like repealing without a
replacement the ACA they immediately
were like well hold up wait a minute
how will we pay for this so as soon as
like if that's your first reaction to
socialized medicine then i would
categorize you as a neoliberal if then
you follow that up by opening up like by
opening that up with with like a
potential think tank that you create
with a bunch of with a bunch of like big
pharma people and and a bunch of other
like journalists and influencers and
then advocate against medicare for all
and claim that it's more important to
like kind of figure out how we can solve
the obamacare which is like a
essentially a market-based solution to
socialized medicine is you I'm sure are
aware of socialized about of the ACA is
like a monumental well they say was
successful in bringing more people under
the insurance umbrella but it was a
failure in every other regard well in
most absolutely absolutely yeah I mean I
guess like I would look to see if things
are affordable I think that's kind of
important depending what we're talking
about but I mean it seems pretty obvious
when you look at health care that it
just can't be done under a private
system it doesn't seem like it's
possible I've never seen it done I think
one country does it well in that
Switzerland but it's literally like the
highest GDP per got a country in the
world like everybody was pretty wealthy
yeah yeah yeah it's all that Nazi gold
that they're stashing
way um but yeah no I I agree with you I
think like ethically it's I mean I don't
know i don't i don't think it's like
viable and and also like other systems
that even offer like the elimination the
profit motive in that regard is is
probably the best thing we can do from
an ethical perspective and it also is
proven not to halt innovation so that's
the way i that's the way i approach that
issue but i wouldn't say like like a lot
of people that immediately are like oh
i'm totally anti i mean or not like i'm
not anti medicare-for-all but i don't
know how we'll pay for this if that's
your first reaction instead of going hm
that seems like a pretty good idea i
would say that your or if you're like
actively taking steps to to put
unnecessary artificial hurdles in front
of that in front of that goal that you
should be in support of then i would
consider you like a neoliberal okay sure
yeah it's like less I would say like
it's like less socially like people who
look at socialism with like disdain
would probably it's a broad
generalization so it sucks obviously
it's very good categorizing people
but like judging by what I've seen of
your of your of your videos I wouldn't
even the the reason why I don't think
you're like a like a neoliberal is
because like I understand you're almost
like a libertarian comes to like free
trade free travel but I guess that's
like you could be it like a libertarian
socialist even in that respect it's
possible yeah I guess like to summarize
my position so I build everything up
fundamentally so well I don't wanna go
that fundamental let's just say that
basically I want the world to be as good
as it can be for as many people as it
can be and that there are lower level
ways that I get to that but that's kind
of like my overall guiding principle so
what I kind of look for are like what
are policies that we can enact that
increase the standards of living for as
many people as possible because in a
roundabout way that tends to increase
the standard of living for everybody
right it kind of makes like a it's like
a feedback thing I guess it's not like
hypothetically like if Mexico became the
best country in the world tomorrow it
would solve our immigration problem
completely you know stuff like that like
those kinds of things yeah we know we're
fully in agreement there to like I think
a lot of the a lot of the issues or a
lot of the things that like Republicans
tend to claim about the issues
surrounding immigration would absolutely
be solved if like the u.s. at a nine
interference policy as far as like
latin-american countries go I'm not
saying that it would be like a wholesale
solution to everything that's happening
in Latin American countries but it would
definitely historically they would have
been in a much better place sure that's
Bombo can I qualify something real quick
that I said earlier yeah so real fast
just I'm trying to be really nice
especially of anybody ever like record
eclipses so earlier when I said that the
ACA failed and then I tried to qualify
that a little the goal of the AC I
believe was to just get more Americans
insured and to in that measure I'm
pretty sure the ACA succeeded the ACA
also provided for a couple of other
important provisions such as making it
so that people could be insured under
their parents till the age of 25 they
made it so that pre-existing conditions
clauses could be eliminated and they
also brought in line a lot of health
care where there were people getting
dropped from the health care for a lot
of like really funky weird reasons they
probably shouldn't have been happening I
know that those are three of the big
things that the ACA did as well when I
say the ACA failed what I what I mean to
say is that we didn't get a significant
reduction in the cost of health care for
the United States people that's
something that didn't happen yeah sorry
I notice someone in your chat saying
that the ACA did help some people and
undoubtedly I think isn't it late like
10 to 15 million people were brought in
under the ACA for for being covered and
there are a lot of younger people that
you know as well that yeah I'm sure
there are a lot of people that were
helped by the ACA it just sucks that we
didn't get something stronger that could
have helped to bring prices down for
health care in the United States and Joe
Lieberman dude but yeah no we're
completely in agreement there I I don't
I don't disagree with anything you said
but and I also think that like or maybe
at least like when I was younger I
assumed that like I had nice intentions
and like wanted to take this as like a
necessary first step towards like you
know socialized medicine which at least
he like mentioned as much even though it
was I'm not even memeing but like on
[ __ ] Marc Maron's podcast that was
like one of the one of the immediate
like places where I remember him like
actually saying look it's the politics
is the art of the possible I'm
paraphrasing at that time like this is
the only thing that was possible that we
could do but it's a very important first
step towards socialized medicine or you
know fully comprehensive like universal
healthcare that is not affordable but
like free at no cost
to the person well yeah no we as far as
like that goes as far as like medicine
goes I think we're in agreement there so
I don't know um but I'm not like even
necessarily looking for things that we
disagree on I just wanted to get a
better feel for like where you where
you're at politically for people in my
chat at least yeah I mean socially I'm
pretty progressive on it basically like
if you want to measure how I feel I'm
Phyllis ugly a consequentialist so I'm
looking for things that increase the
standards of living for most people are
generally going to be the policies that
I'm in favor of so we do typically more
redistributed wealth programs in the
United States are probably gonna be
doing better things that increase the
standards of living for you know lower
class people middle class people easier
generally gonna be things I'm in favor
of yeah no absolutely and I remember
watching I think I watched some of your
videos with like sargon of akkad a
person who definitely does not
appreciate my brand of commentary as
well and by the way I don't know what
you're like audiences where your
audience stands on like The Young Turks
in general I'm a little bit I'm probably
more to the left than the majority of
TYT but CYT I feel like is like a pretty
pretty good gateway to leftist politics
like just an alternative platform for
for more progressive ideas and that's
that's that's the way I see it as like
like a net benefit to two media in
general I don't know if like people in
your audience disagree or even you might
disagree because I think someone said
like you had criticisms of jank or like
the jank bench for your debate maybe
yeah no I mean it's just not necessarily
I guess I'm still a little bit too edgy
for that realm of the Internet so I
don't drive it I guess as much with that
group of people but yeah I I don't know
I haven't dug in enough to the t-80 to
have like go to dota to have like a
strong opinion of them ya know ya know
we're we're we're like more I would say
we're we're we're trying to bring about
social justice but more importantly also
economic justice as well I mean a lot of
those are kind of tied together almost
right and actually yeah absolutely
absolutely but I feel like again
performative neoliberalism would
probably be like exclusively fighting on
social justice and thinking that
capitalism can solve these sort of
capitalism in and of itself can solve
these sort of
Jews with free-market principles when
it's proven not to yeah so like a
neoliberal might say like oh well if you
know a bunch of cake shops want to deny
a gay person to cake other cake shops
will open up right I don't know free
market I feel like there I feel like
their opinion on on social justice like
still it supersedes any like even even
in that instance like they they don't I
don't know if they like rely on
free-market principles I don't know
let's see I let me let me look really
quickly they're like give you because
there's no like actual definition I feel
like of neoliberalism I feel for
everyone in your audience as well that
the book I would recommend everyone
checks out is Chapo or the podcast I
recommend everyone checks out is a chapo
trap house they I feel like they have
built out or carved a brand for
themselves by like [ __ ] on
neoliberalism which kind of in terms
that are similar to the way you
originally said left it's like regard
everyone as neoliberal if they're not
you know yeah I guess the only mimics me
is it really chapo I thought was chapo
is it chapo Chapo
okay the only makes me nervous about
chapo was um I don't even know if I
believe us anymore rights dude I feel so
much less strong about the statement I'm
about to Megan and I thought I would I
don't know if I necessarily like how
much they [ __ ] relentlessly on liberals
although everyday I'm starting to
understand more why people do so I
definitely get that I definitely get
that part it's like it's like the whole
John McCain [ __ ] dude that's like I
think that's a perfect way to describe
another perfect way to describe like
what like u.s. political discourse and
like the hatred that a lot of Americans
feel towards mainstream media and like
legacy publishers in general because
like they're not reflective of the views
of average Americans and we can talk
about whether or not they should be but
but they're this whole idea that like
they uphold and protect oligarchs at all
costs you know what I mean what do you
mean by that didn't you know that
liberals or neoliberal hold up oligarchs
in like mainstream media and and just
like the reason why chapo or even like
ytyt
criticizes a lot of liberals or near
so this debate is going to be about
whether young people should be
progressives conservatives or perhaps
something else and we're gonna hopefully
come to some resolution at the end of
this so with that I want you to give a
huge politican round of applause make
some noise for charlie kirk of
turning-point USA and Hasan [ __ ] of The
Young Turks
[Applause]
I love like Twitter in real life yeah
exactly
I barely fit in this chair okay all
right so okay did you guys have fun last
year I had fun so clearly people are
entertained because they wanted us back
and so here we are and we're gonna
discuss young people in America
especially given how this millennial
demographic is increasingly a major
force in American politics and so what I
want to start with is just some opening
thoughts from both of our panelists here
on some of the major issues facing young
people and there were in a dig deeper
into some of those issues so I'll start
with Charlie first Charlie tell us from
your perspective what you see as some of
the biggest issues facing young people
today and then as part of that why you
think young people should be
conservatives well I'd say the biggest
issue facing our generation is there's
been a bipartisan agreement to continue
to spend money we don't have
grow government at the expense of our
generation concentrate power around
Washington DC to benefit the wealthy few
and the well-connected and this this
shouldn't necessarily be a partisan
issue but it does it becomes and as we
conservatives believe we believe the
bigger the government the smaller the
citizen as we send more money to
Washington DC the IRS gets more powerful
the government bureaucracies get more
powerful and our freedom decreases with
them as we've seen in the last 18 months
what happens when you start to cut taxes
and deregulate the economy the lowest
ever black unemployment rate the lowest
ever Hispanic unemployment rate the
highest ever median income amongst the
Hispanic community economic confidence
at an all-time high four point two
percent GDP rate three point seven
percent unemployment rate this economy
is so great Obama's trying to take
credit for it
[Applause]
and you can start to see the beginning
stages of what happens when you embrace
conservative principles and conservative
ideas juxtapose that with the last eight
years which was mediocrity and
apologizing for being American and it's
great that we have a president that
believes in the free market free
enterprise system and I look forward to
this discussion with Hassan as it's
always lively and never never
disappoints alright so his son you can
respond to some of those points if you
want to but also tell us what you see is
some of the big issues facing young
people today and from your perspective
why you think young people should be
progressive blood I think I'm gonna take
a political approach as well to this
conversation because I like to look at
issues and and identify what they are
and provide what kind of solutions I
think are the best possible ones
currently the economic system that we're
living under is inherently exploitative
its inherently oppressive and we're now
actually feeling the devastating impact
of that more than ever we live in a
country where there are 40 million
Americans we live in the wealthiest
nation that has ever existed the
wealthiest nation on the planet and we
have 40 million Americans living in
poverty we have eighteen point five
million Americans living in extreme
poverty according to the latest UN
reports climate change is happening no
matter how hard people try to deny its
existence and it's it's it's outcomes
are devastating especially for
Millennials and this is something that
we need to focus on and I current and
unfortunately every single time we tried
to bring about any sort of socialized
solutions to these problems that the
free market obviously fails to provide
solutions for we get called socialist
and that that idea is inherently
damaging we believe we live under a
inherently oppressive capitalist Dogma
and I'm here to talk about that because
I think that at least questioning that
and striving to find a better system is
exactly what young people should be
doing right now one of the things that
Bernie did so [ __ ] well was Bernie it
was a really good cheerleader and I feel
like this guy
Hassan needed that I can already see how
this is going to start to
and I feel like it's not gonna favor her
son Bernie was good because Bernie would
get up there and say we need education
that we can afford
we need a healthcare system it doesn't
leave our poor sick in the streets and
we need fair wages for Fair Work some
[ __ ] like that right like some like
three or four real [ __ ] easy points
everybody here is it everybody cheers
there because what's not to love about
free health care for education more
wages easy [ __ ] [ __ ] yeah that kind
of [ __ ] Bernie was so good with [ __ ]
crowds of people I feel like that's um
yeah I feel like that would have done a
lot better here right business owners
are oppressing their employees come on
your hyper link on small business dawg
I'm talking about capitalism versus
Ocean even though 85% of all jobs in
this country are created by small
businesses no that's such a good point
do we take small businesses that don't
provide health care to their employees
they don't provide extended benefits to
their employees
85% of jobs are by small business why
are the businesses still smaller they're
so successful like are these gaping
comprehensive 401k medical dental
packages people anybody that's work for
a small business knows a small business
or [ __ ] [ __ ] to work for there's a
reason why people don't champion going
to work for a [ __ ] small business
okay
but I wish ah [ __ ] that's such a dumb
[ __ ] point didn't poverty rates have
gone to the lowest level in last 65
years do you finish three point nine
million Americans have gone off food
stamps and into the labor force under
this president that should be applauded
by everybody when less people have to go
to government for their for money and
for meaning and they instead are able to
go to a job and have a paycheck that's a
good thing and so the final thing I'll
say is this and you'll find disagreement
yes it's a good thing that people are
off food stamps but that shouldn't be
the bar for success for the country
right which is the main point that
people bring up right like in a day and
age where people are being richer than
they'd ever been in their entire lives
like your bar for success for the
average American is whether or not
they're on or off food stamps right when
Jeff Bezos is making billions and
billions and billions of dollars if his
stock changes a couple points we're
pointing to the fact that less people
are on food stamps how about we look at
the levels of education we're achieving
in our country how
we look at the access to health care
that we have in our country how about we
look at the access to affordable and
quality housing the access to luxury
goods these are the the standards by
which we should measure our success not
how many people on food stamps right ah
[ __ ] because someone gets rich does not
mean someone gets poor in order for you
to get rich in a free market system you
must have a good idea you must create
value
you must employ people you probably
borrowed money and you have an 80%
chance of that business not succeeding
in a free market yes we applaud success
but you must take responsibility for
failure and you have seen the last 100
years the standard of living increased
for all people across the world things
get better prices go down and we are
able to enjoy the abundance that only a
free market system can create you know
what I don't have to call you guys
socialist Bernie Sanders calls himself a
socialist yeah and we should reject
socialism yeah no we should yeah oh
agree with him that looks so weak no you
can't agree with him at the end there
first of all no one's even talking about
socialism we have we've even gotten to
socialism I guess he started off as
critiquing capitalist oh maybe but it's
very nice of you to immediately launch
this accusation that I don't care for
small businesses under a social
democracy kind of similar to small
businesses in Nordic countries and with
with robust economies but with also a
powerful and and protective social
welfare programs and and and and
socialize the socialized safety nets
this exists everywhere around the world
all of the comparable Western democratic
nations one of the reasons why I would
never agree to these formal debate kind
of things are why I really don't like
the idea of them if I were to ever
debate a person like this guy you need
to be able to stop them and go point by
point I would never let some
[ __ ] like this guy
Gish gallop the [ __ ] out of me with 72
[ __ ] stats and then throw it to me at
the end and expect me to have a retort I
mean you could but you would have to
engage in equally I'm kind of like
dubious inequal kind of like [ __ ]
tactics like [ __ ] that [ __ ] I'm not
gonna let this guy stack 50 [ __ ] [ __ ]
claims on me and then throw it to me the
end like I'm supposed to respond to that
deluge of [ __ ] statistical [ __ ]
[ __ ] that [ __ ]
been able to Institute socialist
principles and that's precisely why
their people are a lot happy how do you
think how do you think you would adjust
your style discussion to a format like
this would you try to play to the
comment oh yeah in it like and again
like this way I'm not like interested in
this kind of stuff but in this type of
debate yeah playing the crowd would be
like absolutely amazing right yeah of
course well all you need are a few
numbers on your side and then you have
to ask him why your numbers allow your
numbers to exist right so like cuz
because you can basically the goal would
be to turn his numbers against him right
like oh you say that you know 80% of
Americans have small businesses oh or
85% of small business well right oh you
say that unemployment oh you said that's
right that sounds like everything is
working well why is it that you know 25
million Americans can't afford health
care why is it that the cost of our
education are outpacing every other you
know income metric that we have are
outpacing inflation why is it that
Americans consistently achieve lower on
happiness indexes on access to health
care on access to education on all of
these other metrics around other
countries in the world what's wrong here
explain to me this why your statistics
all say we're doing so well but on all
of these other metrics were failing
compared to other countries right
because then all of the statistics that
he's citing for success they they don't
bear out in the end to benefit your
country okay well now you tell me what's
the problem here
right because then the onus is on him to
explain why his stats like well [ __ ] I
came in here with all my stats thing
everything's good but I mean like
nobody's gonna sit here and say America
is the best education in the world for
all of its citizens we're not the most
educated we fail on every [ __ ] Index
comfort compared to other countries
Scandinavian countries South Korea like
alright nobody's gonna say we have the
most access to health care that's
ridiculous and access is a good way to
measure the quality of health care
because nobody cares how good it is if
you don't have access to it right so
like you would have to turn his stats
against him and then you playing to the
crowd that way and then force him to
explain why you said America's doing so
well why do we fail then on all these
different metrics what's really
important to me is like focusing on
things on the rate of growth and the GDP
is great but you can't answer me you
can't answer this one simple question
who cares what our GDP is if the person
who is dying of abject poverty this is
good it is it can't heal himself then
because we don't have these way to
wording I don't know if he's nervous or
what not but like this is a good point
right why do I care that we have four
point three percent GDP growth
if X percentage of Americans don't have
health insurance right that's a debt
like a less wordy way of saying it right
yeah if you want some health care
solutions happy to talk about it you
brought up Norway Sweden Finland you
would call those socialist country oh
don't ever let somebody do this now I
already see what he's [ __ ] doing
don't ever let somebody try to [ __ ]
dialogue tree you oh my God he's [ __ ]
did this like out of the crowd a book
like you like the Conservatives do this
so often where they hear like well
really what did you talk about did you
talk about the skin and avian countries
I'm glad you brought that up
you talk about oh did you say Finland
Sweden Norway ho ho well hold on one
second did you know that these countries
are in actuality
built all of their wealth on capital
anyway I'm not done yet they built all
their wealth on capitalism before they
started their social democratic nuts and
they're not as large or Dave versus the
United States they don't have as many
black people and breath or I mean sorry
they're not as a culturally diverse as
we are um they're much like right don't
ever let somebody [ __ ] launch
themselves into some bully I guarantee
you I okay I could be wrong but it
sounds like that's exactly what he's
about to do no I wouldn't call them
socialist country he really wants to say
it let me say all this [ __ ] I've got
this whole script memorized for these
three [ __ ] countries please let me do
it ask the very simple question we'll
have a consensus on this first let me
ask you a question okay because this is
like really an improper framing and a
lot of people confuse social as you said
inherently excluded of you you frame the
argument Oh with capitalism yeah I did
it so that's yeah and I rebutted that so
how did you remote that by talking about
just us no by talking about like it
doesn't matter every single business
aside let me let me say one thing every
Norway Sweden and Finland according to
the World Economic Freedom Index are
ranked higher than the United States of
America that is not socialist they have
veterans are actually coming or they're
actually capitalist they build a well
that capitalism okay we got one point
how many we're gonna do lower taxes that
means that you can have socialism and
yet still have successful businesses in
your country thank you for proving my
point for me
love this it's the exact opposite you
know what socialist is Bernie Sanders
wants an 80% tax rate that's not
socialism neither of what these guys are
talking about Assad I don't think the
Scandinavian countries are socialist and
social is has nothing to do with high
taxes what is happening here Oh God
socialist North Korea not socialist was
Vietnam not socialist was with Zimbabwe
not socialist you can laugh all you want
okay do you 100 million people died
under some talking points
I said he's this guy he said at the
start right it's like Twitter and person
he's right it really feels like a
Twitter convo good years and you have
the gumption to the victims families
from Cuba Venezuela and Korea from
Vietnam from Mao's China from Stalin's
Russia the number one killer of citizens
from innocent civilians the last 100
years has been the very idea that you
shamelessly wear on your sleeve every
single day March system has killed more
people than any other ideology over the
last 100 years ok is Marxism isn't
Marxism literally by definition just an
analysis who come of capitalism is it
even anything more than that I I could
be wrong but ok I feel like I need like
my [ __ ] uh I feel like I need my
conservative bingo card here but Jesus
Christ thank you for those words you're
welcome when a hundred million people
die under a communist dictatorship and
some of those millions are also Nazis
which is included there whatever you
blame calm a tional Socialist Workers
Party National Socialists oh [ __ ] it's
right how can you advocate for socialism
but it's right there
national socialism oh right there [ __ ]
shouldn't then you just say like do you
love your country and the guys like yeah
I do
National Socialism nationally I like I
like that this is the level of political
theory discourse look at the word look
at the word in that title
I gotcha you blame socialism but when
seven million people die every year
under our current global capitalist
environment we're just just by famine
alone before we even talk about
imperialism and before we even talk
about that the damaging Wars that are
happening all around the world
then it's the individual so you're
essentially telling every single person
that's poor it's your fault that you're
poor it's your fault that you die under
a capitalist system but if you were
under a comment has ever said that I
mean that's literally what you're saying
no it's not I'm sorry whose fault is it
that seven million people every year die
just by famine related diseases so in
famine in our under our current global
capitalist structure whose individual
fault is it
yeah why is it will assist them when it
comes to communism under editor actually
but it really forty years
don't let him go to make a bucketeer to
the [ __ ] question make him answer
that goddamn question don't let him look
over the lows then why does communism
get the blame for all of the whatever
individual chit Mao and Stalin all your
[ __ ] [ __ ] is done unfortunately how
what's gonna stop there it's unfortunate
when they die oh yes yes Hassan death is
unfortunate yeah I know I understand but
you should have liked it made a bite the
bullet on that easy though cuz because a
common critique of conservatives is that
we do not have a plan for health care
it's quite simple first of all the idea
that we do not have socialized medicine
or a test case for it in the States
isn't correct the veterans that are all
gone hundred and ten billion dollars a
year
what about Medicare or Medicaid one is
for four people one is for old people
and I always mix them up I need to make
create a pneumatic device but what about
the what about Medicaid is for the
poor's okay what about Medicaid how far
better in the Sun let me finish a
hundred eighty billion dollars a year we
spent trying to help our veterans and
they wait in line they die in the
clinics the quality care is unbelievably
low you cannot say that the Veterans
Administration is a well-run government
agency despite us spending a hundred and
eighty billion dollars a year trying to
yeah hey hello hey what's up buddy yeah
nothing much hold up just gonna change
my audio settings because it's coming
through my headphones which I do not
want
yeah no problem you're gonna take the
camera and the audio from my stream
right what was that again sir you're
planning on taking the camera and audio
from my stream for this oh yeah they'll
be great should I get rid of the chat or
do you care um well you probably throw
that to the side
yeah and you have chat on screen that's
all good okay cool I just want your
beautiful face as much as possible in it
gotcha well I'm here
all righty can you give me a good audio
test just to tell me about yours
samurai katana collection yeah testing 1
2 3 3 is how many beautiful samurai
blades I have they are all very sharp
and very shiny and they're folded over a
thousand times with true Japanese new
punch steel they're some of the most
deadly weapons known to man they're the
most efficient are you good yeah that's
to do ok ok so I'll go over basically
what I went on the email so basically it
will have a just a general conversation
about a couple questions and whatnot
roughly bout an hour or so and then so
I'll upload the full thing onto my
channel and I assume you'll probably do
something with it as well and what will
go down on the radio station will just
be basically a couple of segments from
it from whether we talk about something
okay are you allowed to say wait this is
like a college radio thing or what are
you allowed to say here uh yeah yeah
basically it's like Union it's a
university radio station would you
rather I pushed a tool cool no just let
me all hear everything in sunken awesome
awesome awesome awesome um prior
language
what like pg-13 or like nothing or no if
you want like if you I don't know how
passionately you might feel about some
of the questions so you can sort of go
on a different segments because it's
like hell I can like we can have one
second that can be like pg-13 another
one might be like ma oh whatever
ok I'll try to keep everything
age-friendly ok ok cool anyway so auntie
wolves get started and alrighty uh
welcome everyone this is red sri
interview and we're joined by the man
the myth the legend sir Steven bunnell
otherwise known as destiny so thank you
destiny for doing this for me this be
great hey what's up thanks for having me
no problems so for those who sort of
don't know who love because in Australia
is a little known fact that we have
absolutely no internet like I'm speaking
to you right now on a couple of string
so can you please give sort of a brief
introduction on sort of who you are what
you do yeah so I'm a twitch TV streamer
I've been doing it for about eight or
nine years right now you know me because
I either play a lot of video games where
because I do political content that's
about like half and half of what I do at
the moment
listen so how did you initially get
started into string a long time ago hold
on let me just made some time I'm
basically a long time ago I used to play
a lot of video games I mean I still put
a lot of video games but I did it at
high school with a bunch of friends and
we all had a good time it's funny stuff
and around this time I had a friend Kyle
I think recommended me to try to get
into streaming I don't know if he
recommended it directly but he pointed
me to some people that did it and I
thought it'd be fun to try it so I kind
of did it a little bit in the early days
as like for fun thing and then I seemed
to grow and viewership and it kind of
just grew from there
awesome so what about it exactly
initially did it interest you was it
just purely being able to play games and
sort of monetize that I think the social
aspect was a big thing the monetization
was not like a big thing at all in the
early day so until I switched over and
started doing it full-time which was I
think about a year into it but it was
more just the idea of like playing a lot
of games and then making people laugh
and do that kind of stuff it's something
that I've always kind of been good at
okay and I'm not too sure how many
questions also on us point out that
because I know her on streaming one on
there might be a couple questions and
like obviously those two there that a
lot of people have already heard and
whatnot so I apologize in advance I
probably should his own stuff but anyway
you there might be a couple of new a
couple of old ones you've already gone
through yeah that's fine yeah anyway so
and I've you've also talked about sort
of like you say you're sort of unique
case when it comes to streaming in terms
of like how you deal with sort of
criticism in the general community and
so in that case so what fuel self is the
hottest pot of streaming the hardest
part of streaming I mean there's a lot
of hardest parts I guess it depends on
the kind of person you're I guess for me
for me the hardest part is probably
maintaining like it's just
schedule as dumb as that is dealing with
a especially when I do the political
content dealing with all of the massive
amounts of hate you can get online can
be pretty difficult when it bleeds over
into real world stuff people calling the
police and the FBI and whatnot to go to
your house gets pretty rough but I mean
otherwise I enjoy it very much I mean I
consider myself very lucky to have this
job you know I've got hard things that I
do but it's all stuff that I deal with
you know maintaining email relationships
with sponsors and reaching out to
collaborate with people and you know
finding concept for stream and whatnot
so okay and so how many use of insuring
was it being about ten now
well almost I think I got I think I
started in 2010 earlier mid 2010 and
we're coming to the end of 2018 now so
I'd say almost nine years okay cool so
in how have you kept streaming fresh for
yourself the when I approached streaming
I made a very deliberate decision pretty
early on to always make it so that the
content was stuff that I wanted to be
involved in so I've never like done
events that I wasn't interested in and
over played games I didn't want to play
and I've never done things or committed
myself to things that I wasn't
enthusiastic about doing so I think
that's been a big help in maintaining my
drive to stream you know I've always
woken up and I've wanted to stream every
day and I've had a lot of fun doing it I
still have a lot of fun doing it so do
you believe that sort of had any sort of
impact on your potential success in
streaming I mean it's possible that I
could have more viewers doing certain
things playing certain games not playing
certain games it really depends but I
think at your mental health I think a
lot of people devalue your your mental
health you know we can put a price tag
on things like income on things like
viewers on things like sponsors things
like subscriptions and you know all
these different numbers that we quantify
you know the hell out of every single
thing we do but in terms of like mental
happiness people never seem to value
that as much like you know if I could
sacrifice ten thousand dollars a month
you know for more sanity would I do it a
lot of people not really seem to think
about these things so I'm okay for going
a little bit of financial set success to
make sure that I stay mentally sane and
I continue to enjoy doing what I do and
so what do you credit your success
online what are some of the credits you
sort of give yourself on your success
yeah I mean the beginning of I would say
comedy I would say a like humor and
insko probably carried my early
seems a lot probably more so the humor
than anything else I was pretty good at
Starcraft and I think I'm a pretty funny
person I have a pretty diverse
background too like I connect with a lot
of my audience on a pretty personal
level I'm pretty open about most my life
and I think I've had a pretty diverse
set of experiences that have led a lot
of people relate to me in different ways
or just provided entertainment for
others that couldn't okay and what
future goals do you have in streaming
because I've had especially you've done
you've talked about doing sort of a
podcast thing or doing some more IRL but
like at least still things you're sort
of thinking about doing or what other
things you sort of in the midst of the
number one goal for myself the way that
I view my life is I try to make sure
that I'm always happy that's always the
thing that I maximize for myself so I
don't have like I say that because some
people have like drives for like maximum
career fulfillment or establishing a
legacy for the ages or being the best of
the biggest and something and it's not
really my goal you know I really enjoyed
doing what I do and I kind of hope to
just continue to do that you know I kind
of point myself in certain directions
where maybe I'll try to work with other
larger extreme raise maybe I'll take
YouTube a little bit more seriously I'm
trying to build an Instagram right now
and I'm probably gonna be doing some
sort of podcast in the future you know
soon TM I keep saying that but yeah you
know I kind of have things that I point
myself at directions I slowly work
towards but I don't have a huge ambition
to pursue like any particular project or
Qi like any particular goal at the
moment I'm just kind of chugging along
okay
and so you were part of the Eastwood
scene especially with Starcraft 2 so how
did that initially come about sort of
seems like a very nature sort of field
to get into yeah
I hate you for saying that the reason
why witty the reason why it seems niche
is because of how young you are yours
wait how old are you my loadout set oh
you can I am a solid 18 what does that
mean 18 18 years old oh okay you said
you were solid ating solid 18 you know
18 it's a sold a number Oh a solid 18 is
that what you said yes oh I think you
said is Carla dating oh my bad okay I'm
sorry
okay so G's 18 okay
man I started here when you asked 10
years old you were 10 years old and I
started screaming I have a son at 7 geez
anyway sorry to get back to your Nishal
question you asked why Starcraft 2 it
seems kind of me issue so back when I
started screaming StarCraft II was the
largest game on Twitch it was just in TV
back then and then it became twitch but
that's kind of where I started it was I
was the biggest dreamer in the biggest
like game and that's where I kind of you
know grew initially for how people
recognized me early on for video games
but yeah Starcraft it was like the thing
to do back then it was the biggest
streaming game it was arguably the
largest eSport some people who play 1.6
might argue with that at European scenes
but yeah I mean it made sense back then
it was a pretty big thing now it's kind
of niche but ok and did you go into it
sort of enjoying the company like the
competition of it oh you just really
enjoying Starcraft and just thought it
was be like a natural progression when
it comes to competitive games or the
competition is very important to me it
seems a little redundant but like I
can't play any game against another
person or there's not a ladder involved
I can't do it I can't like normals and
League of Legends is boring non ranked
games I can't it's really hard for him
to but if you throw a ladder on it I
know I very much enjoy that aspect of
granting a ladder that being said I
always prioritize my stream over being
like a tournament level player you know
I did a couple tournaments and points in
my career I was pretty competitive but
for the most part I think I focused on
you know tournament related stuff if I'm
playing a competitive game there has to
be a ladder in the competition of
something I enjoy but I prefer to focus
on my extreme I guess over over being
like the most competitive person okay
and you studied music when you're at
college and so what was some of the key
things that you've sort of taken away
from it not necessarily from music as
such or even maybe so but some of the
key lessons maybe that you learn through
your time studying
um I mean in terms of life lessons I you
know anybody that's thinking of going to
school and working full time I would
highly suggest not doing that because it
destroys your college education college
is so much more than than just showing
up for your classes and trying to scrape
by if you if you're going to school for
that you're paying the tuition every
year and then working full-time your
shortchanging yourself out of so much
experience firstly that's just related
to life things in college in terms like
my major specifically I guess you get a
lot of kind of cognitive psychology out
of music you know how do you learn
things how do you practice things and
that's kinda
helped a little bit in terms of gaming
stuff and then if she's kind of broaden
my knowledge base it's given me an
appreciation for music and the ability
to speak about it in a little bit more
depth if we ever talk about things
downstream related in music okay and so
what genre is slash sort of artists do
you really enjoy listening to that's a
really hard question I listen to
everybody says this but I mean I really
do listen to almost everything I mean
like I've got a I mean anything from
like Japanese math rock to Kanye West
and Kendrick Lamar to different I mean
there's like a million different things
video game music like or girls I don't
know just it really depends on the song
I guess okay and obviously you have
talents and seeming multiple interests
raiments so do you have any sort of
goals within the field with music or
just personal things about sort of
whether it's just sort of learning a
pace or sort of producing your own music
I used to work with UW's a long time ago
I used to do some stuff in Ableton when
I mu I'm probably moving soon to
different state in the u.s. probably in
about two or three months I hope to buy
an electric guitar when I move because
that's the a number that I really want
to learn but that's the only musical
related goals that I have right now I
guess okay and so for networking it
seems like you seem to be a sort of
master I guess at networking because
there's so many sort of connections over
the years that you seem to may whether
good or bad and so how do you what's
your usual either way it comes around or
tactic in connecting with people the
networking stuff is something I only
actually started a few years ago my
networking in the first like four to six
years of my career was really bad
because I was pretty much with the
mindset that if I don't like somebody
I'm going to roast them as hard as
possible because I don't value
networking or connections that that hurt
my career a lot in the early days I
guess is it recently I don't know I feel
like I'm a pretty social person and if
you hang out with me we generally would
get along so most of my relationships
have grown pretty organically from that
anything I have Lily to thank Lily
Picchu a lot because we hung out a lot
in Taiwan and then she connected me to a
lot of different people that have been
pretty instrumental in in me connecting
with a lot of other people for instance
I met the ex-ceo of CLG through her and
then I formed connections with a lot of
the people and her I guess like her
gaming house like offline TV because her
very so okay
and is there anything you wish to do
better in terms of sort of how you talk
to people or networking or more events
you possibly want to go to and that sort
of regard I mean I just keep doing what
I'm doing I mean I maintain an email
context a lot of people I'm kind of
collaborating with more people on switch
now in terms of you know a podcast stuff
that I'm on or other people that I'm
talking to a playing games with yeah I'm
trying to grow my tendrils out more it
seems like people that cook that people
that operate within these groups of
streamers tend to be more successful and
have more fun than people that don't so
yeah I'm trying to reach out and do that
a little more okay and alrighty let's
get ready for this section so we've got
let's talk about sort of your sort of
debate history and discussions sort of
videos so I know you've said in the past
sort of that you don't find any of the
sort of Concord debates successful I
don't know about to say successful may
be fruitful would be better but say yeah
good yeah well so how would you define
fruitful in that case I don't know I
like my idea of a debate is to rational
people will come together with different
conclusions those two people will
analyze and take apart each other's
premises to find out which ones are the
most agreeable and then after you know
the dust clears and the premises have
been kind of laid out and settled then
both of you agree on whatever conclusion
would logically follow from said
premises something you're stemming from
the same value systems which I think
most people more or less do whether they
want to admit it or not but instead it
ends up just monkeys throwing food at
each other across you know the table and
then people screeching and jumping
around and throwing things at each other
and calling each other pedophiles and it
doesn't seem like any actual real
argumentation happens so and so because
I was looking through you because you're
talking about like the the Pope flinging
with the monkeys and it seems like a lot
of your sort of own YouTube channel the
more the most successful some of them
were some of your biggest sort of
flaming ones yeah well I mean they're
good for viewership and they're very
entertaining but I enjoy it I like it I
enjoy the conflict I very much like
verbal like exchanges are very fun for
me I enjoy it a lot so but I mean it's a
good debate if you know like a college
professor I was like oh you say you uh
you know if I go to back to school and
he's like oh you said you've engaged in
a lot of debate online and you're in
school to help you you know it's
can you point me to some of your better
debates like I wouldn't be able to like
anything to like be like no I haven't
started yet actually I'm sorry you know
well I you could say you've got a six
hour conversation with five other people
calling you a pedophile no that's that's
a solid one you know that would be a I
mean yeah I just yeah it doesn't seem
like I think he would send me to like
therapy instead of any college class to
deal with that most possibly and so in
that case this might seem a little bit
sort of superficial or a little bit
naive is sort of if you want to enjoy it
and to gain some sort of success from it
financially why have you sort of decided
to blacklist a lot of those people they
started to like the the fans of the
political people so politically I've
evolved significantly over the past like
eight years of my life I went from being
an edgy high school libertarian in my
early 20s to where I'm at now which is
probably somebody's very socially
progressive still a liberal / capitalist
but more so like more so like a social
dumb sock demmer whatever I guess a
social democrat the the so as a result
why do I have to talk to this guy
oh I don't play video games okay what's
happening how you doing man you're me
oka yeah you're fine thanks for having
me thanks for coming on what you want to
talk about um so I kind of called you
out a little bit on the reddit your
subreddit and I wanted to talk to you
about your last video I guess and in
particular but there's a couple things I
guess that have come about through a few
videos of yours but we can discuss yeah
what's up buddy
so I guess before we start you like to
give that little disclosure I don't know
how long you intend this to be but you
know you usually like to say that you
don't like to interrupt anyone or if I'd
misconstrue your point or vice-versa
just interrupt at any time okay I go for
yeah and at that point we'll be able to
kind of reconvene
so my first I guess point is that it's
impossible for me to defend Trump like
at all like you're trying to like I ask
me if I'm if I'm supposed to be
defending Trump in general it's kind of
tough for me to do because it's
impossible to defend any human being
who's imperfect so you're gonna be able
to point things out to me that are
pretty blatantly obvious about Trump
that I don't think are moral or ethical
I can't necessarily defend but any
attempt of mine to compare like him to a
past president or a candidate will be
seen by you as like what about ISM and
it's gonna be dismissed so I want to
stick to a few specific things that you
mentioned within the last video and the
one in particular I wanted to talk to
you about is Trump's handling at the
economy okay and you seem to think that
he's I guess miss handling the economy I
kind of wanted to yeah largely against
protectionist types of policies they
seem really bad and it seems like
there's an economic consensus that these
types of policies are really bad as well
so things like excessive ter opinion I
guess we can focus on the chairs has
been probably the biggest contribution
so far and then I don't know what his
long-term plans are for immigration it's
hard to tell since he spends much time
pushing for the wall I don't know what
he wants to do outside of that but okay
so I guess we can go from protectionism
are you aware of China's tariffs on the
United States goods yeah what about them
um okay so you don't you don't see any
value in reciprocal tariffs no why what
do you mean why
well I'm asking you you're saying that
there's value in reciprocating tariffs
I'm asking why what is the negotiating
table because they rely on their exports
more than we rely on their imports so it
would make sense to use our leverage in
that regard to bring them to the
negotiating table
why am I wrong about that I don't know
it just seems like I mean why because
because in more than one arena and more
what more than one industry we're having
our lunch taken from us by people who
steal our intellectual property don't
allow us to sit on the boards of their
corporations China has a very
protectionist economy I don't really see
why we wouldn't I guess I mean if
somebody wants to terrify us I mean
ultimately aren't they just hurting
their own import market like I don't
know I mean no not necessarily they're
kind of protecting their own their own
markets I'm saying right they all are
one of the things that you mentioned in
the last video that I had a really hard
time understanding is first of all you
seem to kind of like have a hard time
with the fact that Trump's economy is
taken off and the stock markets doing
pretty well well we may be let's one top
at a time okay okay sure yeah okay so my
understanding of it is that if somebody
wants to tariffs us essentially their
customers are just gonna be paying
higher prices for our products but what
do you would explain the going a little
bit more dead for sure so let's say that
we are selling some product to their
country right and they decide to tariffs
that product for whatever reason at the
end of the day they're they're they're
importing business pays the tariff yes
but that has an adverse effect on their
purchase orders that's the whole point
of the tariff ultimately negatively
affects the exporting countries well but
it also negatively impacts their people
as well right because now they have my
point it's it's not supposed to be a
direct impact on the economy in a
beneficial way so when I looked up the
link that you gave velasca and they said
you know a number of economists I think
might have been 100 economists they
asked this question to you know right
whether or not those were beneficial to
the average American workers
and I'm thinking to myself well they're
not meant to be so I have more respect
for the economists that didn't choose
the answer the question then even the
ones who you know answered in the
negatives or in the opposite direction
of most of the other economies the
tariffs are not intended to directly
impact the economy in a beneficial way
they're intended to apply leverage to
the companies that are being careful
that's why they're being tariffs not
just as goods but as individual
countries which you seem to have a hard
time understanding or you just choose to
you know purposefully misunderstand in
order to win a debate
I mean how of the I guess I'd have to
look it up have we successfully lifted
tariffs from China to us since we've
started tariffs a memory what do you
mean successfully lifted terms like have
they undone some of the tariffs on some
of our imports or our exports to them
and then their imports of ours there's
been talks of it which is more you know
I guess along a path was a mutual
understanding than it was before
but regardless admit this is not like a
short-term endeavor it's gonna take a
little while motor for the leverage yeah
I guess I understanding was that the
tariff thing is just gotten worse on
both sides and ultimately this is just
going to cause harm to America that's
kind of the point though the whole point
of a tariff is that you have more
leverage than they do that's that's why
he's willing to get into a trade war a
trade war is going to have a negative
impact in the short run the long term is
what we want from it we want to apply
leverage in order to get things from
them so the things that we want from
China are pretty big things I mean you
can ask anyone in in the text up here
which I'm sure you have context and
about the impact of intellectual
property theft yeah I think is really
where you I'm aware of that I don't know
what the solution to that is going
forward but regardless of whether or not
this particular tariff or that
particular tariff is gonna have a direct
impact on that issue the whole point of
tariffs in general and the whole point
of a trade war is to get them to the
negotiating table so if you're the if
the question is does a tariff positively
help American workers the answer I would
answer is of course no but that's not
the point of a tariff so I don't really
understand that as a
as a strong in criticism of I mean I
guess if you're if you want to come from
like a long game perspective and I guess
that's kind of a separate discussion but
I mean but isn't that what presidents
are supposed to do I mean they're
literally managers of entire countries
they're supposed to play a long game
sure so you're asking me a question it's
completely separate from what this
conversation topic started off and it's
how Trump is impacted the economy so
then we began talking about the tariff
it's not the way you're telling me that
they're a negative impact while you're
trying to defend Trump having a positive
impact on the long-term preservation but
but short in midterm negative impact
long-term potential positive impact
maybe yeah so I mean like that's like
that's true I'm just saying like now we
just finally make let me just finally
make this plan I appreciate you letting
me make the point yeah go so the final
point I want to make is just that you
know when one country has such
protectionist policies against another
one it's it's a lot like holding that
country hostage I mean there's really
any attempt that we anything that we do
from your logical standpoint would be I
guess that even if it has a short-term
negative effect wouldn't be worth it in
the long run just because of the fact
that has a short-term negative effect
I'm trying to understand like where
you're coming at this one
well my from what I've seen it seems
like the best idea is to try to innovate
your economy and continue to do things
that play into your strengths more so in
the u.s. things like tech related stock
or service sector related stuff seems to
be stuff that we do better and then
leave manufacturing related stuff to
countries that do it better and then
just get in here if they're stealing our
intellectual property that has that
seems to have a negative effect on our
tech industry yeah I mean but I haven't
heard anything about tearing China
improving IP laws across I don't even
know how those would be enforced what do
you think was the whole point of the
third listening to Trump I have no
[ __ ] idea I have never know it sounds
like he wants to make it so that
nobody's tariff thing anybody but it
also sounds like he wants to bring back
like manufacturing to the United States
which seems really strange so I don't
know it's really hard to ever figure out
at any point in time what Trump's goals
are because he kind of seems all over
the place okay
well I kind of made my point on the
terrace wait no well no we did it
okay yeah so if you want to argue so the
conversation began on whether or not
Trump is hurting or helping the economy
and then you wanted to bring up tariffs
and then I said it seems like tariffs
are hurting the economy and then you
completely conceded that you say well
they are hurting the economy but there's
a long-term plan so I mean like it's
possible that's the whole point you're
trying to make it seem like I have this
like caveat in my back pocket that I'm
trying to like fall back to but that's
the literal entire objective of a tariff
nobody anticipates no economist would
concede that a tariff has any short-term
positive impact on the economy yes we've
made like 1.4 billion on the steel and
aluminum pairs but that's not the that's
not the end goal he'll tout that as a
way of selling the tariff but the angle
of the tariff was always to bring China
to the negotiating table to lower their
tariffs and also lower their
protectionism in their corporate laws
okay sure so like let's yeah we're
talking about something a little bit
different than just like like helping
the economy right now right I guess like
this is more like long-term kind of
political strategy one of the only it's
one of the only tools of president has
in terms of directly affecting the
economy without without lobbying
Congress okay I don't necessarily
disagree with anything you say I'm just
saying that like the the idea that
tariffs in China is going to get them to
change some fundamental part of how they
run their economy is debatable do you
acknowledge that or do you think that
this is 100 percent going to be
effective I would acknowledge it to the
extent that I would acknowledge like
saying that you know going to war
against Nazi Germany is you know it's
questionable whether or not that will
have a positive impact on Nazi Germany's
internal policy the whole short of war
what other tools that we have in terms
of affecting China's internal economic
policy well the I mean that a president
can do on their own
you mean right yeah sure yeah I'm trying
to I'm racking my mind over other
options as well but yes
yeah I mean I'm not sure this is just
like I just I feel like we've moved off
like pretty far off the conversation of
like oh come on I can't do this I'm
yours do I get conversation oh yeah okay
yeah I got you okay let me let me bring
my - okay so I mean I don't know if
you're gonna turn this into a YouTube
clip or not but like so far it seems
like you you seem at least open to the
idea that it is a tool yeah it might be
okay hold on let me
let's back way way way way way up okay
so my understanding of getting into a
trade war with China is it the idea that
well firstly this is a conversation
about Trump's impacts on the economy
correct so that's what we started this
office I'm not trying to page you know
you or anything but we're talking about
whether or not this is like like whether
or not Trump is having a positive or
negative many topics okay yeah I
understand okay so your so the first
thing you brought it was tariffs and now
what you're arguing I mean it does
relate to the economy but now we're
arguing kind of like long term political
theory that buy tariffs in China it
might be possible to bring them to the
negotiating table on to other topics
such as IP law or whatever if we can
apply pressure to the country via
tariffs correct yeah okay and we
acknowledge that in the short and medium
term we are losing out economically as a
result of said tariffs correct not to
the extent that they are which is the
whole point but yes yeah we you you
think that it hurt yeah it just seems
weird to like sandbag I guess your
economy that way but but okay but that's
that's besides the point so you're
saying okay so hold on a second because
you just made
you just made a remark and I want to
kind of comment on that you said that's
a weird way of you repeat what you just
said it's it feels like you're
sandbagging our economy then you're
basically saying like [ __ ] it we'll take
some losses because they're gonna hurt
more than we are like a selling point
that's the whole point of leverage and
that's why international trade is so
complicated it's because there's there's
people who have different varying levels
of protectionism and any time that they
levia they have a certain policy that's
protectionist it overcomes ours or it
overcomes our inch
we have to respond in some way okay I
don't necessarily disagree that you have
to read sure I don't necessarily
disagree in this I'm just saying that we
started this off as a conversation about
the economy and we've moved it into
trumpets doing something that's bad for
our economy now you tried to say well
not as bad as it is for China's economy
but hold on because you keep going back
to this me saying that Trump is doing
something bad for the economy no I'm
saying that ultimately yes all economic
policy is a long-term vision there's
fiscal policy that's in the short-term I
guess that you can say like the tax law
which I'm sure will eventually get to if
we're gonna stay on the economy but the
long-term policy is always always going
to be it's always going to have you know
a negative ramification at some point
that's the whole point of it there has
to be some sacrifice okay sure so I
don't disagree with what you're saying
okay so what you're saying is that we
are making a short or medium-term
sacrifice for a potential long-term game
correct yes
okay that's yeah okay so it's possible
that in the future maybe we can bring
China to the negotiating table
on economic issues there's no guarantee
of that and then in the current time we
are hurting our economy to do it correct
that just seems like a weird position
characterize it that way characterize it
that way but yeah I guess that's the
effect of it sure like yeah okay when a
company our own internal company our own
one of our own corporations has to pay a
tariff to the United States government
the whole purpose of that in the short
term is not to necessarily get the money
that's going to come from that tariff
it's to lower the purchase orders of
that corporation from China or from
whatever country is being tariffs which
will have a negative impact on their
economy which was only the result of
their protectionist policies that's the
okay sure I understand what you're
saying so I guess like then the
conversation has to become whether or
not we think that China would actually
buckle in in the face of those tariffs
no I think the better conversation is
the degree to which we are willing to go
in order to you know realize those aims
at what point does it become such a
burden on the American consumer economy
and that's an interesting question
because China really doesn't give us any
idle Goods the things that China and
really that things that most of the
world give us are consumer goods you
know we get like TVs we get nice cheap
electronics none of these things are
necessities while we provide much of the
world with foodstuffs and things that
are vital so we do have a lot of
leverage and the Trump is good to use
that leverage in a way that apparently
no other president had weight so you
[ __ ] me i if we're gonna have a debate
on this specific topic I wouldn't need
to be more prepared because it sounds
like a lot of what you're saying is
really wrong so you're what specifically
because we're sure so you're claiming
that we export things to China that they
wouldn't be able to get anywhere else or
produce themselves not no no no I'm
saying that the things that we export to
China and to the rest of the world are
more necessity based I'm trying to think
of it there's a [ __ ] word for it I'm
sorry I can't burst customer-based area
no no no it's it's not commodities but
something very similar to it foodstuffs
things that people are necessities those
are the things that we export as a
country more than any other country and
the things that we import are typically
consumer electronics things that are
frivolous do you disagree with that I
honestly don't know it seems
disagreeable for me I feel like China
there are certain natural resources that
we do import like you know aa steel and
aluminum but those things are used for
things that we're not in shortage of
right now I mean you steel and aluminum
not to get too nuanced into this but
those are used for like multifamily
units for for corporate construction
these are things that we are in surplus
of right now we're in a housing shortage
right now so we do need domestic
manufacturers for the brick for the for
the wood for the timber those are things
that we produce internally in great
numbers but we have a shortage of the
finished product of those things so
we're not really hurting for imports
right now and I don't really see as a
bad thing to utilize the tool the one
tool that the president has it is
disposal his immediate disposal in order
to you know affect global trade I don't
see that as a problem and you know just
because you probably were you know I
don't know more intelligent or more
educated on the matter the
the last guy that you debated I don't
know if he just didn't understand any of
these points or he's not you know
nuanced in in in international trade not
that I am in any way but this is like
basic 101 stuff when it comes to tariff
thing and I don't know if anyone's ever
discussed it with you yeah I just I've
read like a ton of articles from
hold on boys it's time for some underage
sex debates I [ __ ] hate this
push-to-talk [ __ ] alright who wants to
[ __ ] kids in here what's going on no no
no if I just do this quick I don't get
their points through so we can run
through this quicker yeah go for it yeah
so I mean obviously that you know you
would think that there's an agent in
sand right no matter what it is I mean
you've been you think there's an age of
consent for for people to toward be okay
for them to you know consent to thing
yeah real quick let's just hammer out
definitions because we might actually
solve this semantically what is a to
consent mean to you just the age where I
guess the age to like like when you
can't can I try yeah sure I'm the age
where we can say like reasonably that
someone has reached like a decent level
of long term decision-making and
maturity okay call so I think we're more
or less on the same page so my
definition would be in informed consent
or reaching the age of consent is where
you're able to make decisions where you
understand the long-term ramifications
of said decision that would be how I
would look at it okay yeah okay and then
go for it yeah so I was just gonna kind
of like propose name the trait so if
they're the same you know really
relevant traits were present in a nine
year old for example would you think
that it's okay for the nine year old to
consent to sex from like a 100 percent
like if we were god yes new new girl
yeah I would say maybe if we were god
sure but the problem is that in terms of
what exists in people's minds we can
only inductively reason that and I don't
think it's possible to reliably figure
out whether or not a nine year old has
reached a level of maturity this is also
ignoring the entire scientific
background of like the development of
the prefrontal cortex and how that
doesn't really finished here 25 but like
let's say assuming that that wasn't
relevant
if there was some way for a
nine-year-old to fully understand the
ramifications of engaging in sexual
activity we would have no way to
determine that from an out do we again
we have to inductively reason it right
so if a nine or five-year-old were able
to let's say just write an essay like
very articulately eloquently about the
ramifications of sex and like at the
post formal like operational thought
level like they could do it as well as
any adult could would that not be
sufficient evidence yes I me and I we
would have to make sure that the child
wasn't reciting something from memory
given to memorize that whatever but I
mean I guess like theoretically that's
possible I though although I don't know
if the biological mechanisms exist for
that to be possible I don't know if
you've actually a table right now we're
kind of going down this path whether or
not we can actually figure that out but
I just wanna I just wanted an answer you
know if we did know and you would say
it'd be okay yeah theoretically sure
yeah okay alright we are in the same
page well sure but you just have to be
careful because a lot of people a lot of
people want to [ __ ] kids will jump off
this is a profile where they'll say
something like oh well I talked to the
seven-year-old and they sound really
mature so I think I should be able to
[ __ ] them right yeah and also I'm not
even sure if that type of test is even
possible for a five or six year old or a
seven or eight year old or nine year old
to pass because when you talk about
things like societal influence because
like a lot of the ways that we view sex
is done via society right so the
ramifications of sex are also in some
level societal for instance the idea
that you feel used up as a female if you
have sex at an early age that's probably
a societal thing more than some type of
in a biological thing so that that's
something that I don't know if a
nine-year-old can truly understand that
even if they're really intelligent if
they haven't haven't had enough lived
experiences yet to be part of a society
that has these types of expectations
yeah but if but if a nine-year-old did
actually write about that like
particularly eloquently and like
actually demonstrated that concern that
you're just bringing up and you would
say they were sufficiently well yeah I
mean I mean like to be honest you must
be able to develop some test that I'm
sure at least one person could pass but
it's like such a niche case that like
gonna pragmatically I don't know if a
brand acts something like this
like wouldn't it be basically like
taking the consciousness of an 18 year
old and placing that into the body of a
five year old kind of but again like
there's actual biological development
that happens in the brain that makes
that not totally possible yeah I don't
know if this is a possible plausible
thing I just mean like in theory though
there is a test that could exist I
believe that's true yeah I mean in
theory yeah in theory there's one that
could exist because 18 years old for
some people there are probably people
that are ready to have sex and totally
understand everything before 18 and I
know for a fact there are people that
aren't ready and past 25 I mean like
yeah the aging centers I don't wanna say
arbitrary but I mean like there are
people that can probably go above and
below it's just kind of where we've
settled on in different countries it's
just an association between like the
stages of your cognitive development
like most like from 12 to the adulthood
is the like what is formal operational
stage and that's usually like no one I
don't know of a country that goes lower
than 12 but like 12 is like at least in
Japan is the age of consent in like 18
it would be like well you'd keep
building 25 but that's like the highest
bound so oh yeah cuz I'm saying it's not
even necessarily like cognitive
development as well right things like
understanding so sexual activity can
carry with it the risk of for instance
pregnancies or STDs like there are
people that go their whole lives that
aren't really capable of fully
understanding the ramifications of
having a child or you know acquiring
some sort of sexually transmitted
disease like I like yeah I mean so it's
not even necessarily just a biological
thing although the biological thing
plays into it as well it's also kind of
like reaching a level of much maturity
that involves understanding
ramifications of actions as well I'm
just saying those things are associated
with that sort of cognitive development
like e1 moth the ability to think
abstractly logically rationally and
those sort of that's sort of like eight
yeah sure yeah sorry just clarify one
thing destiny so you would say you
pointed to the undeveloped prefrontal
cortex or whatever so you would say that
if a 25 plus year old didn't have full
development of the prefrontal cortex you
wouldn't be okay with them consenting
correct that's it really loaded I don't
like to make normative claims ever but I
mean like in most systems I would say
that yeah the person probably shouldn't
be engaging in that type of activity I
mean we can be more realistic and we can
point to say people
types of mental handicaps all right yeah
would be the the analogous scenario with
our people that could go their whole
lives without really truly being able to
understand the ramification of sexual
activity this is why we assign like
wards and Guardians to mentally disabled
people so that they're not taken
advantage of by other people yeah I just
wanted to just some disabilities are
more extreme than others so I just
wanted to pin down the paper on the
cortex sure what about your own 9-yard
though if you had a nine-year-old girl
oh boy
what about it have sex I mean if there
is a 100% reliable test that could 100 I
mean I don't think this test can exist
in the real world but I mean if it did
then I mean logic now what well now with
a hundred percent certainty cuz I mean
nothing like that actually exists that
without that was our theorized test was
like a 100 percent certain test right
yeah but would you know would you not
accept a 99.9 percent like at that point
that's like cuz your yeah anyway right
well we got to be really careful because
if you want to shift from a from a
conversation of hypothetical ethics to
pragmatically like apply to ethics now
we're in a very different territory so
hypothetically if you were God and you
could determine what somebody was ready
for sexual activity at nine years old
then yeah sure
but if we talk about pragmatic
implementation and the test to say like
99% positive or 99% accurate I don't
know if I would accept that in society
we should have you know most like nine
year olds that pass the test having sex
if one percent of them are literally
getting raped because it seems like that
could manifest in a whole bunch of
really [ __ ] bad ways so no I'm not
sure and also I don't know if nine year
olds need to have sex like there's a ton
of other things that 9 year old should
be doing most of them aren't even
interested in sex yet they haven't begun
that like descendants of puberty and
[ __ ] so yeah things like stuff but
anyway that's sort of fringe basis but
well the point is it's like you you you
would accept like an 18 year old because
of their mental development like
associated with cognitive ability and
like the ability to appreciate
consent and the ramifications of it the
long-term ramifications
I mean kind of I mean I don't think it I
think a files are pretty [ __ ]
[ __ ] I don't know that anybody I go
for whatever the case might be but
because they're demonstrating their
reasoning capacity to understand those
those concerns and for consent and the
long-term ramifications but if someone
of whatever age was able to do that at
the same level or even a higher rate it
doesn't really matter the age just
matters that sort of capacity to do so
right and I'm saying if I test could
reliably like I like super reliably be
able to pinpoint like someone's capacity
to do so that it's like I don't know why
we you would object because we're sort
of just making we are drawing an
arbitrary lines arbitrary line somewhere
but you're still making the assumption
that an 18 year old or someone a 25 can
I guess like maybe this might be I might
be intuitively feeling this which I
would argue as bad but like it feels to
me that like the capacity if somebody at
18 years old has sex before they're
ready for it
that can be a damaging thing if somebody
at nine years old have sex before
they're ready for it that can be like a
life-destroying yeah exactly yeah that's
that's kind of my I guess I could be
wrong on that I would really to truly
make that argument I would need to know
outcomes but yeah it feels like somebody
[ __ ] up with that at nine getting
like [ __ ] it's gonna be way [ __ ]
horrible for that person's life pretty
like anything like to me that just yeah
I like like how did this conversation
even come to fruition in the first place
oh it's because we have a discussion
about Mohammed having sex of a nine year
old are you sure that's the way to do it
also I just wanted to plug in hi I'm
destiny I'm a big band yeah Wow cool for
the Mohammed stuff or thanks I
appreciate it sorry that sounded really
second I say me no sorry the Mohammed
stuff is like really weird I know that
people like to rag on Islam there's a
lot of good reasons to [ __ ] on on a lot
of religions there's I'm included the
Mohammed stuff is really weird I'm not
comfortable I don't think it's
intelligent to judge past people based
on current morals
like I don't know if Muhammad's wife was
like 9 or 12 I know it was some really
early age that everybody likes to like I
don't say super [ __ ] up but even in
the u.s. like even like 50 or 60 years
ago like 14 year olds and [ __ ] we're
getting married off to like adult men
and whatnot so I mean we don't have to
go that far back into our own history to
say that like people pretty much buy
what like 12 or 13 are ready to start
pumping out kids and we would do that
[ __ ] back in the day so I would say you
should proceed with caution if you want
to judge older people based on our
current moral system I mean I guess so
but I feel like I somewhat like because
at least with Mohammed they're claiming
that he's the perfect man and that he is
moral and his job and that he is closest
to God so obviously there's gonna be an
issue here because if something is true
and if something is right it should be
it's a transcend trend know um if you're
religious yeah I guess it would be or
not no I shouldn't say that I mean there
are people that believe that even who
are a religious yeah I don't know if I
really just [ __ ] stupid but yeah I
mean I can definitely see the problems
with that sure I mean like the Bible has
like rules for owning slaves and [ __ ]
too and I don't think people look down
on like Jefferson you know for like
raping his child slaves and [ __ ] even
though if we were to judge a lot of our
past heroes by our current morals a lot
of them would fail miserably of course
and I think that's just really a product
breehn not brainwashing but it I think
it is a product of her culture and so I
think yeah at this age we're starting to
actually look at our founding fathers
and seeing them as people rather than
idols to be worshipped and praised I
mean they made very major contributions
to our society but at the same time we
can't let them get off with immoral
behavior like justifying slavery
excitement yeah like we acknowledge that
that's wrong and that they were
completely not good in that and that
they're valuable people and that they're
not perfect
but the problem is is when you have
Muslims trying to say that Muhammad is
the perfect being you should be looking
up to this man and that is just
something that is not well so like the
way that I would save
and I would have like a variable so if I
was a Muslim what I would say is that
Mohammed didn't he I feel real income
from his argument I should get my muscle
to do this for me but like what I expect
what I expect the Muslims argument would
be is that Mohammed says that it is
virtuous to take a wife at an
appropriate age and father children now
in his time that appropriate age was
[ __ ] 9 or 10 or 11 or whatever the
[ __ ] it was back then but in our time
Muhammed would say that as society grows
and changes now the appropriate age is
like 16 17 18 19 whatever [ __ ]
country you're in
that's what I guess that's what I would
guess Muslims today would say that
Mohammed didn't advocate for taking ten
year old wives he advocated for taking a
wife early as early as society would
allow and then doing it in that way that
would be like my under that would be my
based on the Muslims I've talked to that
would be my understanding of how they
would argue that out essentially you're
trying to like you can't really
disparage Maha Mohammed for like his for
the for the environment that he was you
know came up in or grew up in because
that's just how the culture with yet yes
you can't home to the same standard that
we would hold people now because the
different belts and more than that's I
mean I can though because you're
claiming that I'm so you can't you can't
be culpable well sure if you're using if
you're appealing to the dog yeah like if
we're looking at I'm looking at it
purely through that lens that's my issue
there if Muslims it like concede at the
point that what he did was wrong and
that he was not perfect then I would be
totally okay with that well but I don't
think Muhammad can be not perfect right
something with like Jesus I don't think
these are people that can have flaws
because your entire religious doctrine
is built around them right yeah so
that's why I have that major issue in
contention with Islam at least the Sunni
interpretation of it sure but I mean
that would be where hopefully you would
get Hadees that would step in and kind
of like recontextualize that statement
so that Muslims aren't trying to take
nine-year-old wives I could be wrong but
I don't think that happens a lot in the
u.s. from I think isn't generally
Christian people like an Alabama and
[ __ ] that will try to take like the
really [ __ ] young wives
I feel like Muslims in in the u.s. are
pretty progressive compared to a lot of
Muslims and say like the Middle East
especially the Gulf states yeah I mean
yeah it's it's a it's a problem but like
that the goal I mean like there's either
two ways to go either one you say like
your religion is a bullsh
like [ __ ] off which is not gonna happen
for most religious people or to you try
to find a way to interpret it through
some hadith that you know points you
into a direction where you can live a
virtuous life that abides by societal
standards today which means not [ __ ]
or marrying 9 year olds but also adheres
to the life that Muhammad lived in his
past which means taking a wife at an
early age and fathering children to do
whatever for Allah or whatever right
that would be my guess
I suppose so it's just I find it very
disconcerting and intriguing how you
have liberals and progressives in our
society trying to say that Islamism
Lidge and a piece and should be accepted
when it when it's not it really isn't
like it has very I has a lot of
components that do not but that do not
bode well for a wandering society if we
were to accept it
progressives defense of Muslims I think
has to do more with the defense of
Muslims than it does with the defense of
Islam I mean when it when somebody says
like Islam is a religion of peace I mean
any religion can be a religion of peace
and it can be a religion of war I think
that the reason why people tend to
defend at least progress is tend to
defend Muslims more often than not is
because Muslims are usually attacked for
being brown and not for being Muslim if
you look at Christians in the United
States if they were or I can say
Christians evangelicals or Republicans
for instance if Republicans weren't
racist they would actually find a
massive amount of support from from more
traditional Muslim communities because
their values actually align very closely
with Christian values you know the the
idea that women should be subjugated to
their husband's the idea that children
to be shoot with super obedient the idea
of Sharia or religious law these are all
ideas that Christians are absolutely in
love with
but because Muslims are brown they can't
see past that so like [ __ ] demonize
the [ __ ] out of them for being part of a
different religion or whatever that
seems to be the way that I feel at least
like if you look at for instance view
hopping like Lauren Southern's Twitter
and you look at her making fun of Yogi
as well they would I don't [ __ ] remember
for like wearing yeah yeah for not
wearing enough clothes and that she
deserves to be objectified like any
argument that at rad-con
that a traditional conservative is going
I don't already conceded the point that
me saying that you know it isn't the
word utilize you just a pretentious is
[ __ ] worthy you can just use the word
use instead did someone say new emotes I
feel like there's a slightly different
connotation when I think of you oh man
when I think of utilize I think of
you're using something for something
else but when I think of you I think of
like you use it in and of itself so for
instance like I might use the toilet
like that's it I'm not gonna utilize the
toilet I would use the toilet but I'm
gonna talk about the other way around
though no no yeah yeah I don't think so
that I would say use the toilet or I
might but then I might like I might
utilize a tool in order to remove
something for something else like
utilize use you can also use the tool
but but like English right precision and
connotation all that we use different
which I think utilize that utilize seems
to imply that like you're using
something for something else but you
also I mean use works in that one that
was a bad example right one I you know I
mean you could probably almost always
have to use the English language works
okay we've got a million different words
for a million different things right
okay but this specific one is usually
used in situation or it could just be
used yes well you could say that for a
lot of we're bodies not utilizing the
key tones like why would you ever say
why would you ever say somebody's
despondent when you could just say
really sad well I like you that's a
little different no it's not it's a
little no the connotations old if like
you were saying but for utilized I don't
I don't get that feeling of it would you
ever hear someone say I'm gonna utilize
the toilet no no it sounds pretentious
is for sure but you can utilize
something to achieve like another means
or whatever no like you can use
something to do that to okay and you can
be really sad instead of despondent hold
on let's see use verse utilize hold on
Oh huh I need to read about this [ __ ]
let's see
[Music]
there are few words I despise today's
post is about the one at the very top of
that list this is a grammar party blog
here we go this word is utilized
utilizes one of those smart people work
smart words people throw into cover
letters business reports and research
papers in the hopes of coming off as
sounding super amazingly intelligent I
like this guy and it's true sometimes
this works but it's a cheap trick and
it's easy for a trained eye to see
through this ploy
what's more nine times out of 10 it's
the wrong word to use let's start off by
looking at the definition of these two
words use take hold or deploy something
as a means of accomplishing or achieving
something utilize to make or render
useful to convert to use turn to account
is there a difference between these
words technically yes if you look at the
finish if you look at the definition of
utilized innocent applies taking
something and using it for an unintended
purpose convert to use meanwhile the
definition of use is more
straightforward it means employing any
old thing to achieve your goal whether
or not you use that that any old thing
for its intended purpose so if you are
not actually creating an alternate use
for something utilizes the wrong word
here are two examples to illustrate this
idea the witch uses her cauldron to
prove her potions which utilizes your
cauldron as a drum during the ceremony
in the second example of which uses our
cauldron for something other than its
intended purpose cauldrons or cooking
tools not musical instruments the witch
converted the use of the cauldron to
make her drum because of this is okay to
use utilize but use use works too but I
really want to look smart I have a
prospective employer to impress as I
mentioned before couple letters are one
of the most popular places for utilised
to lurk I'm a professional copy editor
and I can't tell you how many times I've
changed utilize the plain old use
because it's simpler unless pretentious
but if this guy's a professional copy
editor say hahaha I've utilized my
excellent project management skills to
consistently need deadlines revised I
have applied my excellent project
management management skills
consistently need deadlines original my
years of experience have allowed me to
utilize the classic and current
techniques of dog grooming revised my
years of experiments I have experienced
have allowed me to hone of the classic
and current techniques of dog grooming
oh I like home there that's nice I'm
able to utilize multiple programs
simultaneously I'm able to manage
multiple program programs simultaneously
there are plenty of other ways to sound
like the super amazingly intelligent
person I'm sure you are then to
incorrectly use utilised besides you
never know if the person reading your
cover letter is going to be a grammar
stickler like me whoa yeah so this guy
is a really cancerous view of the
English
language I don't know if he works in
like an office for doing something but
like so like can you use words to be
pretentious yeah of course you can but
that's not like unique to use it utilize
but I mean in English we have so many
different synonyms that stand in for
other words there's so many different
connotations of different words I think
that I think that it's good like the
word utilize your body's not utilizing
the Ketones saying your body's not using
the ketones was just fine it's not about
being just fine you're arguing something
that nobody's arguing about literally
nobody in here is saying that that's not
fine do you understand that
oh really yeah like you're saying like
you keep saying like using you can use
use instead of utilize no one is saying
you can't say that no one has said that
I don't think all right having said that
maybe Becca's saying in the background
no no Becca's not arguing with me so I'm
not saying I'm not saying that you can't
use use instead of utilize 99% of the
time it probably fits that's not my
argument what I'm saying is that we have
a lot of different words in the English
language because we get a lot of
different flavor from different words
and that it's okay to employ some and
other means and and others and others
like I mean what I'm saying is the way
people employ the word utilize may not
be yeah sure that's not unique to the
word utilize that could apply it to
literally any word ever mice utilize
more than other words and you know it
really does that's why there's a [ __ ]
that's why the grammar stickler had an
article about it just now right you
can't find that about every word I can't
just Google that and I mean I could find
that about the phrase like I can I can
find it about the phrase begging the
question and I'm sure there's a ton of
other things I could find this about
yeah there's some stuff there's like the
fact that when people say the fact that
that's sure or sometimes Brit bonkers I
think in America we say we do something
on accident but in Britain they say by
accident only a few terms that of
thousands and thousands of terms are a
few words you know yes and I understand
okay okay the problem is that there is a
particular argument you can use against
this word being used incorrectly or or
to potentially by a lot of people I
agree with that but the caution I'm
saying is don't extract a general
universal argument for that you can
apply to every single where the English
language so if you're saying hey I think
we look light everywhere English
language okay but it sounds like the
arguments that you're making like
because if you see if your arguments
were only hey you know a lot of people
use utilize and it feels really
retention when they do it it was like
okay I did not apply say but when you
say
but-but-but your argument to support
that wasn't primarily that a lot of
people use you know utilize spending you
know a lot of people use utilizing
they're being really pretentious mova
the argument used to supply it was why
use utilize when you could just use
another word that's a general universal
argument that I could extract from that
and I could apply that to anything
why use despondent when I could use
really sad why use despair when I could
just say like you know argument for why
not to use utilized wasn't good is what
you're saying what I'm saying is that
the argument can be extracted and
applied to any other word in the English
language it has a synonym that's easier
to understand I'm not talking about
easier to understand people understand
what utilize is like for instance I said
earlier I said employ an argument we
said employ an argument why not use an
argument right let me let me saying is
that using utilize doesn't usually add
something to the sentence compared to
using use whereas but that's not true
Ogden does add something compared to a
very set you know but that's not
necessarily true utilize carries a
connotation with it they can add more
flavor to a sentence or make something
yeah but I'm saying it's unusual use I
need you to understand this you're
making two arguments a don't say you
can't use one instead of the other or
you can use want to say say some people
use this to be pretentious cuz that's a
totally different given I agree with
that okay okay but I have two arguments
then okay some people use this
particular pretentious is one yep I
agree with that one hundred my other one
is that this word more than others is
used in situations where it doesn't add
to a sentence that's the same as the
first one no cuz because the people
using it when it shouldn't be used or
probably okay then that could be a third
argument as long as you don't say you
shouldn't use utilize because other
times you could just use a simpler word
I don't like that argument because
there's a ton of there is a plethora of
words okay a lot a cornucopia of okay a
tremendous amount of words that you
could substitute in other words for to
make them simpler whatever but then you
lose so much flavor in the English
language you don't to do that yeah but
with utilize you don't lose much flavor
but you can okay can you give me one
example
it just it has a connotation to it the
utilization of resources for a certain
would be really hard for you to have to
like Google like an example whereas
whereas with the word like how about
sure your body utilizes your body
utilizes ketones instead of is a glucose
or glycogen or whatever I don't know
what keep doing supposed to take the
place over the crabs like oh but your
body you utilize the ketones for energy
I think sounds better that makes more
sense to me that your body utilizes
something for energy then your body uses
something for energy uses just doesn't
feel right their body uses carbohydrates
for energy feels completely fine
compared to your body utilizes compar
behind strands energy sounds completely
fine to me it I don't know carbohydrates
if we were to think about yeah it does
it does it does sounds yeah your body
utilizes carbohydrates and energy we
wouldn't speak about like we wouldn't
speak about like the usage of cars we
take like the utilization of something
whatever it like it's just it's not
wrong like it can't be done I'm just
saying that the other word carries with
it a slightly different connotation it
okay but your body uses carbohydrates it
does okay it's not wrong neither one is
what is utilize meaning in that sentence
I'm like it like you take something and
then you're kind of using it for a
greater purpose you're extracting some
utility out of it you're utilizing
something and what is used mean in that
sense it's use is so much more vague and
generalized I don't know use can mean a
lot of things but in that sentence what
does it mean well in that sentence I
imagine I mean the same thing but this
is like prescriptive versus descriptive
use of love language like there's we can
employ so that wasn't your example not
the best example no because every part
where you can employ utilize you can
probably use use as well every say
utilizes a different connotation
no cuz not every single time you can use
utilize you can use use just the one
you're just read with the witch cauldron
you can't use use because as a cauldron
isn't usually used for that no you
absolutely can wait what was the example
I mean you could but it does exactly
there you go you can you know in that
situation it actually started different
because it's not the normal use of the
thing you're bought you're the normal
use of the [ __ ] carbohydrate in your
body is for energy no hold on hold on
that's not true let's say that somebody
walks into a witch's house they go ders
I can I say oh [ __ ] like the witch
grabbed the pot and she used it as a
weapon
you don't normally use pots as weapons
but would it sound better to say she
used it as a weapon or she utilized it
as a weapon actually sounds better so
use there okay so which is the opposite
of will be the rule that you just
establish so ISO utilizes completely
useless thank you for proving my point
okay if you got you got a point you got
it in I think that we should eliminate
like half the English language and we
should just make use all the same one
word that's how I'm saying you took it
and generalize it to the entire English
language I'm talking about a single word
and then you say that I'd make the same
logical okay with it being a simple word
no I'm okay with it being so stupid one
single word and then you say oh yeah we
should take the whole English language
and just blah blah blah I'm just saying
this one word isn't that you think you
can't say that one word when you're
using an argument that you know all
English language let's just generalize
this let's make your argument incorrect
by saying I'm gonna generalize this
because in another situation where you
replace the word it's fine
you know and it sounds better I'm gonna
say that because you're trying to
replace the word to make it sound better
than remember you know okay here's what
you're doing here are two statements
okay I'm going to kill John because I
hate John as a person okay okay tell me
something you've rehearsed and this is
off the dome okay John because I hate
John okay wow that person wants to kill
John and it sounds like he personally
knows John and he wants to any ace John
he's gonna kill John that I can't
extract like a universal claim or a
universal thing from that that I think
that purse is going to do all over the
world now if that guy is going to say
I'm gonna kill John because he's got
brown hair then it's like wait hold on
dude there's tons of [ __ ] people with
brown hair that's a dangerous statement
and then you're like we'll hold on I
just said I'm gonna kill John okay what
do you mean judge good you got brown
hair I'm just gonna kill John okay but
one of the arguments used for killing
him was that he had brown hair there's a
lot of people brown hair so when you
tell me about the word utilize okay I
already conceded the point that me
saying that you know I'm saying it
you're doing the train tricks on me okay
you can't say no I can see it at this
point when you have it to see the point
okay because what you're saying is you
using you're utilizing an argument okay
I've already conceded the point that it
wasn't the best argument to say that you
could use the other word instead because
in a lot of situations you can use
another word instead okay that that made
sense okay but I was saying that in this
specific word utilized it doesn't add as
much as a sentence comparing it to use
as a word like depressed compared to sad
or despondent or whatever the [ __ ] you
know it does it doesn't add as much it
doesn't have as much flavor to it
there's other words where it adds so
much it adds as much as a sentence so
there's like a level
it's just - we can spend a lot of time
finding words like this right okay but
this is one of the specific ones that's
pointed out a lot by you know [ __ ]
when you say pointed out a lot you
pointed to one article of somebody that
sounds like there's I actually read a
book where the elements of style yeah
never use the word utilize because it
often takes people use it incorrectly
like there are certain that's not why I
said it it said that it should never be
used in any sentence okay I mean I would
say the same thing if you control off
any college paper you've ever written
you could probably look at the word of
that that's a word that you can almost
always remove from your writing that you
can almost like okay sometimes you need
it to start the restrictive clause
sometimes but like 95% of the time if
you control off if you have an English
paper and you've got the word of that in
it you can almost always just get rid of
the word and your sense will still
actually make sense yeah but sometimes
it doesn't flow as well and you might
want to have it but with utilizes very
rarely does the word of that etat flow
it's usually ruining like I think I
think the more words you take out the
better it is most the time and I agree
with that okay but what your point
you're bringing up has is not I'm gonna
would tweet at merriam-webster and let's
try to get there move utilize let's try
to get the word utilizing Roofing Inc
thrown out okay no that's cool it you
read that book too um that was nice that
I had a reference for when you said that
I just looked at one article because I
was like BAM got you right back no I'd
haven't just look at what I to go sure
The Elements of Style is used for
writing essays for like writing college
papers it's not necessarily used for
literary works which is more what I'm
talking about
right and in elements of style you're
not I could be wrong I don't remember
the book super well but I don't think
that that's a book we're like I want to
get into writing novels somebody would
be like oh well check out the elements
of style like well that's not
necessarily a book for creative people
who wrote novels it might be but I but
my general impression I don't know what
they wrote in terms of novelization but
my general impression of the elements of
style was that people writing essays
that what it helps you do is it helps
you simplify your writing it helps you
make it writing far more concise you
might have read it to help you write
read as to help you write essays cuz you
read it in school but that's not
necessarily what it was for was for
writing in general okay maybe I'll buy
the book and I'll read it again but like
it seems like a the why I know what it
I've read it in high school for writing
I say it's yep did anyone in chat about
opinions because The Elements of Style
seemed like essentially what it
encourage you to do is go back through
your writing and hack out a whole bunch
of a relevant [ __ ] that was like the
summary of the book was to go yeah
that's her gravity
yeah but that's not something that you
necessarily want in like fiction in like
so you guys will just want to get the
[ __ ] started the first question back to
bed these are just these are just ones
that people have been sending me over
like the last couple weeks so if you
don't know how this works this is a
discord ama you can PM me on discord and
I'll ask your question live or
apparently if we're doing it in here
maybe we can just maybe we can just
behave the last question my question
Stanley or no answers with angels
probably not I don't know he just lost
did you pee on me or what
yeah remember I PMD like a long time ago
when my probably not probably not I
don't see you again start asking come on
okay so the first one is from basilisk
he said would you be open to debating
high school and college debaters he
means kind of in like a semi-formal
setting where like people come up and
like propose like a long form debate
where they have like a question you get
prepared and then you do some content I
don't really like doing like I got a lot
of people that email me and I like I am
a debater doing a debate and I don't
really have much of an interest in that
it's usually more of that's like topics
that are relevant to either current
events or something that we're
discussing at the time it's generally
how I do things I don't usually like to
the bed
forsake Oh doing a debate but maybe that
would change for it set up some type of
event or something in the future hmm
okay so the answer is kind of a maybe
the next next next questions from vivvy
10 she wanted to ask it one stream but
she's not here so I'll just ask do
people think you [ __ ] idiot it's a
final fantasy right I should have oh
[ __ ] I should have a wizard I should
have asked for people's pronouns already
we're already on a on a bad path do
people obsess too much on products being
GMO or not my family always buys non GMO
even at a higher price point what's your
opinion on GMOs I don't know everything
I've seen about GMOs seems like they're
fine big problems or things like
pesticides and [ __ ] but that's I'm not
super well researching the topic but
yeah I don't give a [ __ ] about GMOs [ __ ]
yeah but if you literally spray roundup
on rats to get cancer dude did you see I
should write ups
right up as a pesticide that's that was
it's the man I don't know okay um Christ
Standish
I'm just dude I'm sorry I'm just asking
the questions okay what's your position
on trans racialism from inferior design
I have never in my life seen an
incredible scientific investigation that
made transracial ism seem like a real
thing like I know people meme about it
but I've never seen that like documented
anywhere just gonna be silenced and
large yeah that sounds fun [ __ ]
[ __ ]
Bali was gonna ask you this questions
wait Bali should be around Bali should
be around he's always here there's no
life nope he's not here I heard I heard
ethics once characterized as the
generalization of familial relations to
all humanity as the experience of being
a father made you more altruistic or
oriented towards the well-being of
others nah [ __ ] that [ __ ] no [ __ ] that
[ __ ] that way just like did being a
father change you at all ding it made
you like truly love something or
whatever no you made me hate other
parents somewhere do you have like a
certain love for your child that you
could never have for anything else yeah
but I don't think that extends to any
other person or makes me feel sad people
I think I have a worst view of people
that have been in their kids it seems
pretty shitty I'm gay huzzah hey I had a
it's like I had a question when you
worked at the casino where you did did
they not allow you to gamble if you're
like a casino employee you can't gamble
at the establishment I couldn't for my
first year I think because I was on a 19
why does the 19 or 20 wait is it 18 or
21 to gamble 18 yeah okay cuz I was
under 19 for some reason Nebraska I
think one other state our age of
majority is 1980
but yeah I was underage a gun but wait
here as long as you're of age yeah you
can do
I heard that age about that age of
consent debate you had on from the ask
yourself this part the other night yeah
I was pretty good did you just get
pulled into that randomly did somebody
like p.m. you
yeah people ping me on service sometimes
and I'll hop in and me man it's good
dude give it give you ammo to defend
yourself from that Kiwi Farms people
thanks do you think most of the people
in their service are being like
legitimate or are they like trolls
because when we went in there there was
a dude from Ebola land and then another
person that wasn't ask yourselves just
remember that was and he's not give all
the land
if you eat Boland there was another
person doing like a Australian accent
but I don't know if it was real and then
they were claiming to be transgendered
but the child came in and called them
yeah because it was like very I couldn't
tell if anybody was troll I couldn't
tell there's a bunch of trolls trolling
each other at that point I'm not sure
usually the ask yourself crowd is super
serious and they're not they're not in
there to like joke around I don't know
about the other politics channels it's
hard to say sometimes they're in there
to like to convert Carnot's and chew
bubblegum Sami 2 Chainz has a bunch of
questions so we'll read them out kind of
one at a time do you think that the body
positivity movement is going down a
slippery slope how do you feel about
body positivity I think it's stupid for
a variety of reasons but it might be
good for people that was something that
I think I'm aware of I think that um I
think that if you shame people or bully
people I don't think it tends to produce
better changes and how they approach
things people tend to just get depressed
so it's probably okay insofar as like
having people be comfortable with their
body no matter what it looks like is
probably a good thing but if that starts
encouraging people to not change or to
accept like really unhealthy conditions
and that's probably a bad thing
I don't know wait what I feel like if
you're comfortable with your body like
at any state so like
that's really bad because people who are
fat and obese and overweight it's
straight-up unhealthy there is no let me
a call tomorrow when I say being
comfortable with a trait what I mean is
like you can acknowledge a certain flaw
in yourself without [ __ ] hating
yourself right got it yeah you can say
like okay well I weighed 250 pounds and
it's probably a [ __ ] bad thing but I
don't [ __ ] hate myself for it like
that's an okay thing you know because if
I don't think hating yourself or
whatever to tends to make you want to
like change anything whatever but like
as far as like you know the idea of
health at every size is a pretty [ __ ]
stupid concept so yeah did I answer that
enough you think there's some do you
think there's some legitimacy to at
least to like just it to the claim that
that that maybe that the health at every
size thing is kind of a meme but the
idea that you shouldn't judge people if
you're not like a like a medical
professional right I guess I guess you
shouldn't just [ __ ] on people because
they're fat talk about whether you
should or shouldn't do something I mean
sitting like a moral compulsions or just
like did not be an [ __ ] or what do
you mean yeah I suppose I probably
shouldn't judge people in general
because that kind of makes you a dick
right I think most people agree with
that but I mean in terms of like making
it if you're going to judge like making
like a health judgment I mean you can't
I mean like here if some anyways 300
pounds probably not healthy I mean
that's a pretty fair assumption to make
but I mean just because somebody's thin
doesn't necessarily mean they're healthy
I mean here how would that argument the
guy asked me like extend to anti-vaxxer
arguments why it's totally different
what do you mean what wait yeah wait can
you wait where can you phrase that in a
way that makes it it related to auntie
vaccinations my brain well I guess my
point was running it like how he said
like how can you um can we like make
health claims without being doctors
right and I feel like most people
having an opinion on anti-vaxxer without
oh well I think it's more that like I
can look at vaccines and say they're
good
like pretty easily without without just
with I don't need to be doctor to know
that but looking at an individual and
trying to evaluate if they're healthy or
not
while only knowing their weight that's a
much different type of claim right does
that make sense yeah yeah I was just
kind of reductio ad absurdum to argument
I reaction wait what does that mean what
we Jeff go ad absurdum it means to
reduce something to something that's
like to reduce a broad claim to
something that's like pretty silly right
to to make it all the way to one extreme
yeah if it still holds water [ __ ]
idiot
God miss him it in your brain I just
wanna learn of reptiles by the way
though it's not in like hyperbole those
chess memes were [ __ ] gold-plated
memes those were great any man where mr.
moon is losing a lot of good my own ass
I be yeah it was yesterday it was six
five the one where you played like 11
games it was six five it was super close
and you got yeah he's never I'm so
stupid I'm so you got two easy games off
of like the Queen entrapment holy [ __ ] I
just got the say [ __ ] idea what I
should [ __ ] you know Jerry hun [ __ ]
twig uh Jerry the chess guy from
chestnut oh yeah did I should pay like
him and like another chess grandpa to
commentate like a best-of [ __ ]
whatever series between is so [ __ ]
funny dude
coach it alright so this is this is a
question from the same guy and he's
asking can you talk about he's like
preface I'm not American so I don't get
this
can you talk about prescription drug ads
and why you think they're bad I don't
know if I think they're bad why would I
think they're bad I think they like
we're like the only country that allows
people to advertise I mean I think
they're probably bad
you should be picking [ __ ] medicine
based on which commercial use on TV I
don't think that you do though but
there's a lot of bad [ __ ] I think that
goes on with the doctors who are like
they feel they'll see the end no no no
no doctors get really pressured into
prescribing certain types of medications
do - like what insurance pays for and
what not and then agents will oftentimes
request certain medications based on the
piece and ads and [ __ ]
I think [ __ ] I there's so many really
good I've heard so many good like really
long detailed explanations by doctors
about how like [ __ ] it is being a doctor
right now with the way that insurance
companies dictate medicine so you can
prescribe and whatnot it's like a really
cocky experience one of the biggest
things recently right is there is the
the opiate the opiate deal right well
what do you mean by that just like
getting her both ascription drugs and
then so yeah so the idea that they can
both advertise like in doctors offices
directly to patients about like pain
management they can do it like on
television and then there's the aspect
for like they're they're literally like
buying off doctors and stuff that
doesn't really have to do with
advertising Alabama had one point for
one opioid prescriptions per capita in
like 2013 prescriptions per capita is
that like on a yearly what the [ __ ] does
that mean like more person surge yeah
yeah wait wait wait
so every single person plus times 40
plus 140% got person out of a thousand
or a hundred each individual can have
multiple pain management prescriptions
so you're saying it in Alabama there is
everybody in Alabama is on a
prescription medication that's why
that's why I asked if it's all my doing
really what like like based on the
number of people there were one point
four one times that many prescriptions
filled in like a year yeah I don't know
which is pretty which is pretty common
for like areas where there's like pill
mills right in like East Texas which is
close to me used to be a huge pill mill
country right so they're just be they're
basically be like pharmacies were all
Alabama that was raised in the nation
for the number of painkiller
prescriptions per capita
according to Attorney General Steve
Marshall who is sued opioid
manufacturers and co-chaired the state's
opioid overdose an addiction Council in
the Alabama's first congressional
district which includes mobile there
were about 131 prescriptions per 100
people during 26 EMA go grab a cup of
coffee real quick oh yeah that's
actually [ __ ] insane yeah you're be
asking my doctor please give me a
fortune 3 Stanley JFK right now make you
into the bathrooms I can ask from people
all right can I just ask my question
moving or all right so that's me um how
do you argue a hold on man how do you
argue with someone who's speaking from a
position of ignorance but is absolutely
confident in their position just like
just speaking to your experience
obviously oh [ __ ] no what do you mean
how like I seen your arguments like you
go about the way like you try to get
like to the meat of it you try to get to
the truth like you're not really
interested in convincing people that
they are necessarily wrong but you're
trying to but as you said before you're
trying to attain like a higher truth in
these in these arguments but like how
would you go about convincing the other
party that they were wrong though I mean
you have to do it through narratives
right so like you basically weave
together a story that kind of like
brings together your points in a way
that's hopefully convincing actually
there's actually a question about this
like later on but we can just go like
the questions basically right do you
believe in like narrative form
explanations what do you think actually
convinces people like narrative form
explanations or raw data and like are
you nod when you like eat up that story
just to get to somebody and like then
they immediately agreed when before
they're adamant but do you think do you
think most of people most people are
like that lady right that you like
talk about do you think most of them are
fairly mother like the lady right I
would think so
well no I think they are isn't that like
empirically demonstrated I thought maybe
I should go look at a doctor you want to
sneak your question in real quick okay
my question yeah yeah question dude
having six minor points and Gil first in
can't get room I can ask god dude guys
are you like dude can I ask can I ask a
question directly
all right do you think Advanced
Placement or AP classes are more
beneficial to ordinary students than
regular classes or do any of them not
but do any of them matter when you get
to college however many AP classes you
took you're gonna wish you took more
goes holy Nowak that thing is so good
they're so expensive in college it's a
[ __ ] dumb it's like 70 or 80 dollars
for a [ __ ] test a test out of a whole
goddamn [ __ ] ass [ __ ] this is Jack
that's a mean it's a great segue is
college education still worth it in the
United States it's amount of Merak you
have to do you think so worth it i mean
by definite the earnings look at the
average earnings of a college graduate
versus a non graduate it's like fifteen
grand or at least isn't it my boy and as
like an addendum they were asking like
do you think that there's a way to fix
student loan debt quote unquote doesn't
really this go back to like what you're
saying like a few days ago or basically
like when wouldn't you say that like you
have a GED everyone like subconsciously
realizes that that does only mean [ __ ]
that you actually just need a college
education to prove that you have like
some some worth but when looking for a
job
I mean some people think that I mean I
can only go by raw data like college
degree earnings verse no degree I'm
pretty sure is like a twenty thousand
dollar difference or some [ __ ] between
people with high school versus a college
degree average yeah that's a big
difference the average time of the high
school diploma is thirty five thousand
two hundred fifty six dollars the
average salary with a bachelor's degree
is almost $60,000 so I'm sorry it's 25
thousand dollar difference I mean it
really depends on what you go into
there's still like some crafts where
like a GED is fine
right like there's lots of all filled
people that I interact with to basically
have a GED or like worse and they make
six figures but their life is like
hellish right you can still find things
that like make a lot of money but it's
it's pretty tough you can also quit it's
gonna be a video game streaming but not
are you still kind of over the opinion
that like anybody can do it but it's
just not gonna work for everybody
no it's harder to say like anybody can
be a streamer because it's competitive
so like obviously not anymore
because there's none of you is to go
around for every single person right
yeah right you can't have like a million
streamers that's right millions or other
string well not everybody's interesting
or like outgoing - you have to have yeah
but it would be that's a lot of gets
learn about but yeah you would have to
like it's specifically invest a lot of
time into like yeah chit chat has a real
quick question
yeah are you gonna be playing the new
seasonal league you're gonna give it
another try
I'm actually here by the way Oh bring
new changes you want me to play that
chick in I'm not sure if I own a
ironically or ironically not much
watching me but it's enjoyable for me I
don't I don't like because I don't know
how the game works
so watching that is just like okay what
the [ __ ] women learned in small brain
I want to learn another [ __ ] game no
give me really caught all right I've
been no no you're out no no no no
supporting League statements at all okay
that's banner bull no I probably
continued to play with like friends so I
give Lily and damage I want to play I'll
play but otherwise I don't think I'm
listen I've done too much damage to my
own personal health of my streaming
career varnish [ __ ] eyes
amen do your psyche shut the [ __ ] out I
mean you still dying at [ __ ] World of
Warcraft is ruining your life I'm not
playing that game anymore oh you have
like an intervention
I had like a I had like an officer
chained and then one of them got a
girlfriend and then the chain kind of
fell somebody didn't wanna raid lead I
didn't really want to show up on
Thursdays and we want to do two days a
that goes into what I have this idea of
me walking into a house and some old
lady is there with her [ __ ] oxygen
container and I'm like you got 30 days
grandma you've like I'm so happy stand
like I like you've upped your game like
so much on so many levels it's really
crazy yeah but like there's like a lot
of stuff that you could just do better
and you did yeah but I mean like this is
kind of what I was talking to you about
before when you were here right how I
feel like because the way that I see it
is if you're a reasonably intelligent
person if you surround yourself with
successful people
you can't take nothing from that like
you have to pick up something right like
even just you like it's really it sounds
dumb but like you being here and me
picking up that reading habit from you
might actually be like one of the
largest game changers in my life over
the next like five or ten years right
like so for instance like you mean about
buying Jordan Peterson's book but I
could actually do that now and I could
actually like a substantial critique of
him because I'll have actually read the
book just cuz I don't have anything else
to write now like that's actually
possible to do now because I've ripped
that habit from you you know absolutely
yeah and like if you think about it if
you even read one book a month right and
you need 12 books a year then you span
it over five years and you're 60 books
ahead it's actually like that's a lot
like that's that's way ahead of what
almost anybody else is like educated on
doing and you're reading books that are
a focal point on that subject yeah yeah
there's that [ __ ] and then the thing
about being more precise with timetables
on emails like it's not even like big
[ __ ] but like I feel like if you this is
my feeling and maybe it's harder for you
to understand this because I don't know
how much you spend of your professional
life living in the middle of [ __ ]
nowhere but like if I'm around a bunch
of people that are really successful it
like it's really hard not to pick up
something like you kind of have to or at
least I feel like I have to because I
would feel dumb like staying in the same
spot accomplishing or doing nothing if I
was around a bunch of people like you
were dinner whatever right well no you
may be down a little bit if I hung
around and too much I probably served
[ __ ] buying over real estate that
would be the end of my life right yeah I
saw that [ __ ] clip of reckful the
other day that was some [ __ ] stupid
[ __ ] alright well I couldn't believe
that when I heard that wait what clip
saying don't get don't get real estate
because Amazon's go
higher and higher I mean I didn't don't
even know how to respond to that wait
well reckful is uh is rifle trade
securities yeah no no he's not real I
know he's a very I know he's very good
at trading securities but he's he he's
not in real estate no not at all yeah
that's the old quote has never trust a
fat doctor and sometimes sometimes he I
mean he's probably not that
knowledgeable in that dandy you do real
estate like a lot of it yeah okay wait
what do you mean buddy don't wait what
do you mean by don't trust I've had
doctor about reckful if he doesn't trade
real estate or he doesn't do real estate
why would you trust him all sure sure
okay gotcha yeah yeah he's done well in
stock stuff for sure yeah but yeah that
doesn't make a knowledgeable real estate
no for sure breakfast is looking at it
was similar to the way that I would look
at it where it's like with real estate
it's a highly risky volatile
undiversified asset and you can make I
don't want to say guaranteed but you can
make really good returns in the markets
especially for the past two or three
years insane and you're so much more
diversified against all types of risk
and then real estate requires more
active management right with a stock you
can I buy it and forget it not like
long-term but like you buy it and you
just keep tabs on it with a real estate
yeah sure but I mean wait what am I
saying that's so wrong actually because
that's the risky [ __ ] stocks are risky
you know most stocks aren't going to
give any meaningful dividends you're
gonna have something that can go down or
up or stay static where is the real
estate you're getting an income stream
depending on where you get you have the
asset itself appreciating you're able to
leverage to buy it which you can't
effectively do with okay but okay we
can't have this to really have this
discussion we would have to go into
quantifiable data because you're gonna
give me a story right now that sounds no
I'm not gonna give you a story yeah
here's a story you're giving me you're
saying well stocks can have shitty
dividends and sometimes the stock might
go up or down and stocks are very highly
diversified with real estate you get a
stream of income the asset can be
appreciating that's a story you're
telling me right now I can tell you
another story where I say well will the
stock I can buy to sell it very easily
at any time it's very easy to liquidate
I can make massive gains on a stock you
know and then I could sell it or move to
another one with real estate the value
might depreciate I might not be able to
get anybody to fill the actual thing I
might get a bad renter that destroys the
[ __ ] property like and it's very
highly under versified if one bad thing
happens in California it can affect all
of my real estate as opposed to a
security that I can liquidate II mean
like we can tell stories all day right
it just depends at the end of the day
feels like you're putting a tremendous
amount of value on the
to liquidate something right away which
doesn't seem like that should be that
important unless you're literally well
that well I mean if your [ __ ] is
starting to depreciate liquidate is kind
of important know is that you can't
really just leave them alone and like
expect them to do well like you can do
that for like an ETF in the S&P 500
expect to gain like five to seven
percent for your I don't think that
phrase securities you're not normally
like buying and selling like in these 24
hour time frames I don't think is what
Rifle normally does reckful does options
doesn't he if I'm not mistaken any well
I'd be curious to ask him where the
majority of his income is coming from if
it's if it's and I would guess right
it's either options or short term
securities a short term to find is like
yeah yeah yeah because some of these
huge games have come from puts yeah yeah
yeah like stuff like Twitter and [ __ ]
like that I made a lot of money off that
and things like that so the thing with
reckful to keep in mind I don't want to
speak for him but I'm pretty sure if I
talk to me to agree with this he loses
he has a lot of big losses right yeah
sure but his wins are bigger than his
losses yeah for sure so and he also
talks about his wins and not as much of
his losses so like when you hear that he
gets I don't know he said he did he made
that like like some huge amount on
Twitter or something uh-huh that's not
taking into account all of the white
options that didn't work out right it's
just like so those are probably
generally like short-term short short
term trades sure how's the front
probably even less than 15 day time
frames we have to ask him but yeah I
mean he talks about his losses sometimes
but I imagine it's annoying to talk
about because people can't like
contextualize that right well nobody in
twitch tech and [ __ ] conceived the
level he's trading out anyway yeah he's
well I mean like people there are a lot
of people I know that like remember the
fact that reckful is like lost like a
hundred thousand a trade and that's like
oh they know about him and they think
he's like horribly [ __ ] yeah and so I
mean this saying there's there's huge
gains that can be had in real estate if
you think about things objectively as
well you don't need to be there on the
pulse of doing stuff it's a little bit
of waiting and seeing but you know you
have static income from it you can have
if you if you do things right an asset
that appreciates and just the main thing
is that the government wants you to own
real estate and you have all these
advantages that just are not present
there with stocks that alone almost
makes it worth it the seriously
considered real estate the downside
being is that yet you have to deal with
human problems some bad tenants
building managers that might give you
you know be a pain in the ass like these
are the trade-offs but the the good
parts of it make up for it significantly
hey the one thing I agree with Dan on is
that probably real estate has a longer
window that you can sit on it safely
then then securities do I I can't think
of many companies outside of tech in the
last like in recent memory where you
would like gain a really crazy amount by
just sitting on the security I guess and
the crazy thing is just how attached or
it seems like I can understand somebody
like reckful especially and even myself
to some extent like buying real estate I
feel like you're so much more involved
in that process than just even trading
options like it's not let me try to give
you my anecdotal side by the way you
know I don't think anybody should trade
options well no no but I'm saying like
if you wanted to like your commitment
like finding a house you know purchasing
and getting a property manager is like a
lot more like a lot more committed to
having like that's yeah for the initial
onset my anecdotal so I have an
apartment building in San Francisco I
just want to and I know this is a
typical but I want to give you the level
of involvement so maybe this is the
upside that you can expect so I found an
apartment building in San Francisco I
think in 2010 okay and I bought that
place i leveraged so I didn't buy it all
in cash I could have chose not to so I
put down four hundred four hundred K the
place was one point four when I bought
it and then after owning it I put more
money into it remodeling it okay now
that same building right there is worth
over five million dollars
I have probably total of my own money
less than a million dollars into it the
place is worth more than five right now
and I take in more than thirty grand a
month and in the period I I mean I don't
know how that's like more than five
years so I've almost made half of my
money back just collecting rent at this
point doing nothing else but what if you
would have shot that same money into
like Amazon stock or even Amazon and
leave that'll be up let's see you think
I'd be up 6x if I put it in Amazon how
long he can like 2010 right well what
I'm curious about is that it normal is
that something you can normally expect
from as a return from like a real estate
deal like you also own some you own that
warehouse in New York now right
also yeah okay so yeah and like okay if
you would put that money and haul it
real quick if you would put that money
in a 2010 you would be up one thousand
four hundred seventy five percent you
okay well that's with the Amazon yeah
but you also sound like you have like a
really good deal to like but you would
also this Steven you would also have to
have the foresight to know that Amazon
was going to be that kind of sure but we
play these same games with real estate
like when you have to have the foresight
to know because there's not does not the
downside protection you knew buying
house there's a floor value especially
people felt that way in two thousand of
the cost to build a house okay there's a
cost to build the house especially no
that's not true those costs can be
inflated based on the current markets
though but Stephen if you even in the
2008 crash or whatever if you held on to
that house and you had it now it would
be worth way more like I don't know if
that's true I don't know if every single
place is recovered in that way I don't
think that's true Chris reals I'm
talking on my ass a little bit going by
it what I know my parents house in
Florida because I know that hasn't
recovered in value and a lot of things
in a bird but that might be specific so
if someone in chat knows more about that
I could be wrong I'm sure that like
major areas so like la New York Seattle
like these places like Austin but these
places probably recovered but I don't
know if every place recovered after the
housing crash all right why even if
every one of them didn't if 95% of them
did so like that that way I guess what
the the picture that Dan is trying to
paint I think is that in general real
estate is actually less risky than
securities is that right then yeah
there's no ongoing work I don't I don't
do actually yeah I guess like might the
way that I look at it and maybe I'm just
applying a heuristic that's too simple
for this and I shouldn't be doing it is
it like what Dan is selling me a deal
that sounds too good to be true that's
the only reason I don't believe it I
guess like what that I could just dump a
ton of money into real estate and
consistently outperform the markets that
sound I think then why why doesn't
everybody do it I'll tell you right now
yeah because everybody doesn't have a
[ __ ] hundred thousand dollars in free
folk crash like you do to be able to do
it that is why because people can't
invest in real estate because their
income is insufficient to do it this is
this is this only if I was in a Tele
pricing right now and I would just empty
my [ __ ] I would liquidate all my ETFs
and I would he's going [ __ ] to
leverage that unrealistic Versa fi'in
Ida first if I'm the first fight all
over the [ __ ] place
I'm just saying real estate is an
important part of that diversification
for sure there's no way you would ever
catch me having all of my stuff in socks
in nothing in real estate real estate is
a good
for a [ __ ] reason because there's
again for no other reason besides the
fact that the government gives you a
thousand and one [ __ ] reasons to buy
real estate those reasons those
incentives have to be priced into the
real estate already though that that has
to be there no Steven so Steven Ali's an
analogy in securities okay do you know
you know like hedge funds do an
accredited investor is somebody that's
authorized to borrow like a [ __ ] ton of
money or something for big banks is like
no no sure is a person who earns out of
tune of $50,000 a year or has a net
worth of over a million dollars okay the
investor is a very specific type of
thing it's a it's an actual thing that
you are okay if you were to credit
investor you have access to securities
that other people literally do not have
access to they cannot legally invest in
them okay okay and those and those
securities are usually hedge funds so if
you invest in a hedge fund with as a
credit investor you could expect much
higher returns than other securities
that other people that poor people
literally can't invest in wait wait how
much money do I need to be an accredited
investor $250,000 a year in in net
income or 1 million dollars in cash
assets cash assets so that doesn't
include like a house and car you just
have to show that the equity that you
have okay
wait and then I can just buy hedge wait
how do i buy hedge funds which site can
I do that advant go ahead well one way
you can kind of get into it so there's a
site called Angel list right an angel
list is but we're all the tech startups
for the most part will list their stuff
for fund raising you have to bug that
[ __ ] on there yeah but they have funds
on there then they have funds that are
perfect on the net assets ever but it's
in equity asset it's equity asset right
now yep so if you had a yeah yeah like
what is like a hedge fund return as
opposed to like stock market returns you
can expect ten to fifteen percent from
hedge funds no problem and sometimes
higher and with much more predictable
results we'd that sounds like cheating
it is yeah what's like you do Chi what
your energy expression the rich get
richer yeah wait wait what's your what's
your what's your minimum hundred grand
and then you just you get like shares of
a hedge fund like et yeah or how does it
work oh no you can go
I don't want this I don't want angel to
say I'm not afeared whatever real
conversation about this off-white we can
get I could introduce you to bunch of
people okay like like yeah so but yeah
hedge funds could expect a much higher
return and so yeah that's the point it's
like the Dan [ __ ] I was originally
trying to support you on this because
what I'm saying is that barrier exists
in real estate but it's a it's a what do
they call it what it's like a phantom
barrier like like it's it's sure a
person that makes 30k a year could buy
an apartment complex in some in theory
right but they're never gonna yeah yeah
they're never gonna be able to because
they don't have the initial income
they're never gonna get a loan approved
and what Dan is saying about real estate
something that Dan said that was really
[ __ ] smart is what you can't do in
securities is leverage real is leverage
money but while you can it's called
options well no I know what you mean
yeah you're right you can't leverage
money because you only have to put like
20% down or whatever and you leverage a
huge amount of money to make a bigger
income from you take a loan out for for
real estate property and then have your
rent or your or your or that your income
from it pay back the huge disparity on
that as well like yeah borrow money at
like three and a half percent I oh and
you could be taking in the equivalent of
like you know depending on the caps
seven to ten percent like that's insane
so you want to borrow as much as you can
you can leverage the [ __ ] out of [ __ ]
it's like a huge advantage oh wait that
Warren Buffett challenge was over
managed hedge funds wasn't it I have no
idea what wait [ __ ] hedge funds
nevermind oh don't do this you're gonna
I know what meme you're gonna pull right
you're gonna be like hedge funds don't
Matt perform the market man yeah the
team is gonna pull weight anyway yes
they [ __ ] do it's that there's a
difference between hedge funds that are
publicly managed by people like Charles
Schwab and people like fidelity which
those yes they don't outperform the
market very rarely and private hedge
funds that you can invest in which
almost always outperform the market so
the stats on it are like let's see what
did they say it was something like is it
like ninety percent or ninety two
percent of hedge funds don't at perform
the market okay this is the eight
percent that do their behind private
walls that you can like if you invest
with great values guys at Bridgewater
any of those
they've outperformed the market for like
40 straight years can you source me this
is this like recorded somewhere well
yeah I mean I have read you can just
check his you can just check out
Bridgewater
yeah like Bridgewater is a good example
of like a regular I perform they have a
method called the all-season and
portfolio wait where can I see like
their like I'm like history like out
like return history they're actually by
I hate my [ __ ] country because of
people like you okay I actually [ __ ]
hate you okay I really do from the
bottom of my [ __ ] heart I think that
people like you are destroyed like when
I have to argue with commies and
socialists that tell me [ __ ] like
liberals get the bullet first [ __ ]
liberalism is dead it's because of
people like you that I can't really
disagree with them hey what's that buddy
yeah no problem
all right you commented on my Instagram
because you were upset because I think
all Republicans are stupid and you say
I'm just talking to the wrong
Republicans I think you just you do this
thing where it's like you criticize
people for like their viewpoints and
stuff which is valid criticism for the
most part but then you apply it's like
this whole group of people so like I I
just don't like it when you say like all
types of people are a major why are you
dog label an entire group or like you
know like so I don't think there's
anything necessarily wrong with an
entire you know I don't think there's
anything wrong with labeling a group if
that's that group stated ideology so for
instance I think I can I think it's fair
for me to criticize Republicans on
health care and generalize that to the
party when their entire platform is
typically like anti ACA and whatnot I
think it's fair for me to love you that
criticism at Republicans or say when it
comes to climate change or stuff like
that I think that's fair to do so yeah
but even within the Republican Party
there's so many different like not
everyone agrees on the same thing like
yeah they may have like a general
consensus of like what they would like
to see happen within health care but
when you get down to like the specific
details of the issue there's still a
wide range of like you know a variety of
different ideas and stuff of how that
they want to implement you know what
they want to implement and all that so
know where it is
no we're equivocating really hard here
the Republicans presented a unified
front against the ACA and that's why
they defunded it there wasn't a lot of
debate that's only what the ACA is just
one it's like the one it's one part of
the entire health care debate
that's happening it's not just like I
mean it's not there's more
to it than just that okay what more
Republicans proposed to it what was
their replacement for the ACA
well that's the thing there was a bunch
of different suggestions like yeah but
wait legislation I don't care about what
whoever random person or Facebook I want
to know what did Republicans replace the
ACA way yeah like almost pretty much
every Republican in Congress was like
wanting to do a different thing and I'm
pretty sure like the the conservative
group that they have in there they were
proposing a certain thing and the you
know there's a bunch of different people
wanting to do a bunch of different stuff
and that's part of the reason why I was
so hard to get rid of it is cuz you know
Democrats had a good point and they were
like what are you gonna do after it's
gone and a lot of a lot of people are
just kind of like well we're not sure
yet we're gonna figure it out okay so
let's say that you're a person who has
diabetes and now you're losing your
health insurance because the ACA is
being defunded do you think that that
person cares that there's a lot of
different ideas in the Republican Party
about what to do with healthcare if none
of it got to the legislative stage I
mean in that specific example I don't
know what else matters besides that
though I mean everything else I don't
know I mean if it's not policy at the
end of the day what let's say that an
entire party agreed on one thing but
they couldn't pass any legislation for
it wasn't ratified got an entire party
with across the United States that's
gonna agree on one thing one specific
thing
okay well careful we were equivocating
again because the Democrats agreed
enough to pass the ACA so even though
they didn't agree on the specifics of
everything that we're still able to get
something passed so right you see what
I'm saying is they're still Democrats
out there who didn't fully agree with it
so if I were to come out and say
something like divisive like oh you know
all [ __ ] Democrats are [ __ ]
because they passed the ACA that would
be sort of not true necessarily because
yeah as a group they did this thing but
there's still people within that group
we didn't necessarily fully support it
or there might be specifics within that
issue that they may have had a problem
with so when you say stuff like you know
all Republicans talk this way that's
just simply not true there's people out
there who are more intelligent about
certain things that you could talk to I
mean you reference like Sargon it's fine
like you could talk to him but he's on
it exactly like you know a spokesperson
for every single Republican out there
conservative okay
so when I look at Republican
spokespeople I see Rush Limbaugh I see
Sean hey
I see you know everybody else at FoxNews
you know people like Bill O'Reilly I
guess people like everybody else at Fox
News is conservative I don't know man
Fox News is like the largest
conservative cable news station yeah
Rush Limbaugh's lead largest talk show
radio is in there I wouldn't necessarily
say they're conservative okay we're
equivocating again so I guess maybe
Republican I mean like who do I look to
for do you say like the problem is that
like I can't pin down like any belief
we're gonna equivocate everything out of
existence when I say equivocate what I
mean is we kind of like mince words so
much that like nothing really means
anything or matters anything at all like
well you can't really say Republicans
believe this thing because I can find a
couple people a central messaging from
the top down that is consistent from
Trump to FoxNews to all of talk radio I
can't criticize Republicans on these
points in general it's not just one
thing it's not just like a it's not like
okay we're all gonna you know like agree
on this one thing that's the beauty of
is everyone has their own different
that's not no that's not the beauty of
it okay Republicans came together and
they agreed on one thing which was
defunding the ACA and they didn't
propose a solution for for health care
so what am I supposed to think about
that party of people okay not every
Republican did though right wait so if
we were to go to the Senate voting
record on getting rid of the individual
mandate you don't think that the
majority of Republicans in the Senate
voted to already yes yeah but not like
I'm sorry no I'm pretty sure every
single Republican in this I'm sorry the
majority of the Senate every single
Republican senator voted to repeal the
mandate I didn't know that was true yeah
I mean if that's true then yeah I guess
you what you said was correct I was
pretty sure that there was a few that
didn't because of that exact reason
because there was no thing I'm pretty
sure like every single one except for
like McCain like well I mean if you want
to look it up you can't I don't know but
I'm just telling you I thought that
there was more that we're not or that
we're voting not to get rid of are not
voting to get rid of it because there
was nothing proposed afterwards I
thought in my head I thought that there
were more but if you're saying there's
only one then I'm pretty sure it was
Jess McCain I don't understand this
point that like I can't criticize a
platform of a party when they in general
it's just that it's divisive and it
doesn't help anything all you're doing
is just like drawing these lines and
being like us versus them and it's just
not helpful to anything and all you're
you're not really like yeah
like what's the point of it I don't get
it like you're just kind of you know
stirring the pot I guess like I mean
that's fine I'm not saying you can't do
it it just annoys me that's why I
comments it the way I did because I was
like annoyed by it I think the
frustrating thing is that there are a
lot of people right now in the United
States that are individually impacted by
policy decisions that Republicans are
making right that are incredibly
detrimental to their lives so for
instance there will be millions of
people that will lose their health
insurance because the ACA is being
defunded and to those people it's very
frustrating that if they try to if they
try to attack the Republican Party on
their stance on health care that people
like you can hand waive those complaints
well hold on they don't all agree on
this one thing the important thing isn't
that they that they didn't that they
don't agree on a specific implementation
of health care they don't agree on a
specific solution to health care it's
that they all came together and they
agreed to get rid of what currently
existed and the fact that the party has
no consensus on what to do with health
care now is almost as bad as them having
a consensus to destroy it because both
of them are effectively going to be the
same thing sure I see what you're saying
and I'm not trying to use this as a way
to like to like ride the fence on every
single issue I'm not saying that
whenever something controversial is said
about a subject that you can just say oh
well not all no I'm not trying to use it
that way I'm trying to say that if
you're going to criticize something
criticize the actual like the policy or
whatever it is you're talking about
don't criticize like the the the whole
other half of the country that may
disagree with you because these these
aren't just like one-sided things these
aren't just like oh clearly this is the
answer and clearly this is right and
clearly this is wrong it's very there's
nuance and detail that go into every
single thing you're talking about even
this health care thing although the
examples you're giving are really sad
and like you know I feel bad for those
people that are that's happening to
there's more to it than just that it's
not just those people only in the
country and I agree that I should we
should have sympathy for those kind of
cases and stuff but what I'm trying to
say is when you use these blanket
statements of like all Republicans like
it's just it's not helpful I feel like
all you're doing is just dividing people
and making them seem like it's us.first
them and then it becomes more tribal and
then people just get into these
entrenched ideas where it's like oh well
this is a Republican idea so I believe
with that and this is a Democrat so I
believe that and
they don't they don't actually think
about the issues all they do is just say
oh it's a D or R and that's all I'm
gonna decide on the issues on okay so
the prior stand what you're saying but
the problem is that like I maybe if I
was like a persuasive person and my goal
was to persuade more people over my side
I would care but that's not really what
I'm concerned with I'm concerned of just
looking at the facts of the issue and
the fact of the matter is that the
Republicans right now are just flatly
wrong on a lot of the issues there
aren't two sides to things like climate
change the side that says it's a hoax
perpetuated by China to make our
manufacturing non-competitive that's not
a real sight to the debate and the idea
that I would humor that side is
something that needs to be debated is
woefully uninformed there is not two
sides or something like that's dangerous
right because no matter how stupid
something like someone saying Oh China
made up climate change even though
that's I agree it's more than likely not
correct you still have to engage those
people and explain to them why what
they're saying is so stupid
how do I engage people that don't even
care to engage with factual arguments
though when X then yes you have to it
you have to at some point say okay you
know like I have to walk away this but
just just to say like I mean there's a
lot of people I tried to engage these
people in fact and we've tried how many
people right now are you might even be
one of them believes safer ends is that
Hillary sold one fifth of our uranium
reserves if you already believe that
there is no engaging in fact with this
person it's easier to call them stupid
and move on to people that can actually
be persuaded by your easier for you yeah
easier for me easier for everybody why
would I waste time debating somebody
gives 95% of their news from Alex Jones
and The Daily wire I'm not necessary
necessarily saying you have to engage in
like a full-on debate with them but I
just think it's dangerous to dismiss
someone's ideas just because you think
they're stupid I mean you think it's
dangerous to dismiss ratings I think
it's dangerous easy people are allowed
to vote have children I mean like I
don't understand what you mean by it's
dangerous to dismiss that's the thing in
some world but yeah that's what I mean
that's the dangerous world I'm talking
about if you if it came down to you know
like I think it's dangerous for this
person to have kids and stuff because
they're not smart like they're not as
smart or whatever you you know what I'm
saying like you could make it into a
very like dangerous situation real quick
if you just start dismissing people as
but this is always the problem this is
the prime
defense sitting centrist is you always
said like it could be dangerous it could
be dangerous
so right now no no no that's not the
real danger the real danger isn't that
you hurt too many conservatives feelings
by calling them stupid the real danger
is that right now it's possible that
we've already done we're already on an
irreversible path to extinction due to
climate change
right now we are already on a path where
millions of people will lose them okay
so you're one of the people that don't
believe in it I mean maybe you're young
enough that maybe you'll get to suffer
through your lifetime in it I mean you
are it's funny I mean you are basically
saying we already are it's okay but like
what I'm saying is it's I don't care to
argue because you would be one of the
people that I was just call stupid right
off I understand but I'm saying that the
problem is I don't know about you you
take someone's someone that something
says that might be a nuanced view like I
just there is not a who wants to view on
this though that's the problem so wait
do you think there's a nuanced view on
whether or not climate change is
happening and is being caused by humans
no I agree that it is in that it has it
is happening by humans then what's the
nuanced view because like I just said
haven't they been saying that for years
that climate change is irreversible and
there's no way that we can get around it
and it's gonna it's gonna eventually
just swallow up the whole world
no I think they said that if we stay on
the current path it will be no I've from
everything that I've heard and that I've
read I've seen things that politicians
have said from interviews way back when
and other scientists and stuff like that
that say in a couple years
Puerto Rico is gonna be underwater and I
mean like there have been some absurd
hyperbolic print 50 sure and sometimes
the medical sometimes the medical
Surgeon General or whatever like
recommend certain vaccines and they
don't work out as well so do we just
abandon like every single flu shot what
I'm saying is that's that's no I'm not
saying we should and that's why that's
where some of the nuance comes is like
yeah well what is maybe once maybe they
said something that wasn't necessarily
fully true but that doesn't mean that
everything they said was wrong yeah
climate change may does still exist but
that doesn't mean you know maybe they
weren't a little bit harsh when they
were making these estimates of okay but
the problem is half the Republican Party
doesn't even believe it exists right now
that's a huge problem how do you wanna
communicate with a parent like how do
you convince somebody that we need to
convince it
not by saying oh you said one thing that
money that might have a somewhat
questioning view of this therefore I'm
just gonna totally dismiss you as
[ __ ] and not have a conversation
with you why would I waste my time
talking to somebody that thinks that
climate change is like a total hoax how
my present just thought that I was one
of those people and I just told you that
I'm not one of those people because of
the conversation we're having I hope you
understand now that I am NOT one of
those people because I outwardly
admitted that's you okay sure yeah but
most Republicans won't I know that's
most won't but some will and those are
the people you should try to talk to you
I think I don't think it helps you to
try to just bang your head against the
wall and say oh well obviously you know
this person is like for whatever is
religion for whatever reason religion or
whatever there there's no way you're
gonna convince them of certain things so
that's fine like I understand that
there's some people out there or like
that okay but you're gonna identify with
Authority right and they say what why
the [ __ ] should I even bother trying to
have a conversation with this guy he's
gonna dismiss me if I even try to you
know say one thing that might contradict
what he thinks I mean if you say
something really [ __ ] [ __ ] you
can't defend it then yeah of course I'm
gonna call that person an idiot right as
you should but you shouldn't just
completely you know dismiss everything
they have to say maybe they have
something that's I mean like if you
willingly put yourself in a group with
other Republicans and then you vote for
people like Trump or other Republicans
so I know that you're supporting in a
policy position things related to
tariffs and our economy things related
to immigration policy things related to
health care things related to science
and environmental regulations I mean
like what am I supposed to think this
person like I think you should think of
them as a person and say that yeah even
though they may have voted for this
person like you know just because you
vote for Trump doesn't necessarily mean
it doesn't necessarily mean you agree
with every single thing he does maybe
you just you that person probably just
thinks hey like you know it's better
than the alternative or I agree with
enough of what this person is saying
that I think it's worth voting for them
what is it well why does the enough of
what the person says that they're worth
voting for for a Republican why do you
like a trump supporter I mean yeah I
voted for I didn't vote for him in the
primary but I voted for so woody woody
what did you vote for Trump for in in
the yeah what did you think he was worth
voting for for what reasons
I mean I just thought he was better than
the alternative I saw that in what ways
with respect to way well I mean honestly
mm-hmm if you're asking me personally
I'm I feel like I myself am more of a
go hey what's up buddy how's it gone too
bad yourself pretty good how you done I
just asked you okay what's up what do
you wanna chat about man there's so many
things we could chat about like I
mentioned in the email interested in
your position on youth rights I haven't
ever heard you discuss it talked about
determinism and your ethical egoism any
of those I am really you know there's
any number of things that I'd be happy
to to discuss with you because I'm
curious okay yeah which one you want to
do first go for it well first just you
know tell me what you are what your
position is on youth rights because I'm
curious because you seem to be generally
relatively consistent in your positions
sure so I'm pretty much a
consequentialist I guess so I just look
at outcome so it seems like youth
probably need a lot of Rights revoked
from them because they would make
horrible decisions otherwise that would
lead to worse outcomes for ultimately me
but then definitely societally so is
that what you're asking in terms like
how we give rights to young people or
because I'm curious how that works out
with well what your position on abortion
which is actually I think exactly my
position on abortion and that there's no
other line you have to treat this person
there's a human and therefore they have
human rights and you can't take their
life away you might use a different word
than rights yeah I definitely wouldn't
though legally speaking if you can't do
something when that person has a right
preventing you from doing that thing
okay so in law school it's it's where I
got most of my philosophy or where I
continued with philosophy and so shyam
the so I said tend to see things and
rights duties etc so I'm curious how
that works because it doesn't seem to be
I know you say consequentialist but I
thought you were a rational egoist and
so I don't know how that how it ties in
how you get from rational egoism to to
depriving youth of right or of freedoms
however you want to phrase it well I
mean like I'm an egoist and such that
like I want everything ultimately to
benefit myself and I think those are the
only things that I can truly be
compelled to act on and then I look at
that through a consequentialist
framework I guess you okay I hear I
really don't like I don't I don't like
the abortion I get it I just I really
don't have a strong commitment to this
and it's got it gets so hairy and so
many wasted time talking about this
here's my position on on abortion right
real quick okay the reason why you let
me just get this real quick the reason
why I don't like abortion is because it
makes me uncomfortable in my okay so
here's the big crux of this is that I
view a fetus is a human life or the
reason why is because I haven't found a
better definition for human life than
the moment your DNA comes together so
that's my definition human life so I
consider as I go to be the moment of
human existence when you say that
abortion is permissible activity what
you're saying is it's okay to murder
some people for the convenience of other
people now from a rural utilitarian
point of view if you've crafted that
rule for society that murdering some
people is okay for benefits others it
makes me nervous that I might be
susceptible to that rule at a later
point of my life say hypothetically
somebody says passed the age of 65 you
no longer benefit society we're gonna
kill all 65 year olds well I feel like
if I've said abortion is okay then it
seems like you know that might be a
world that I should be okay where there
would be harder to make one of the other
now maybe there were holes you can poke
me but that's generally how I reason
that out it has nothing to do with like
natural rights of people or anything
else like that like that's just you yeah
okay all right question the consistency
because I've obtained from a utilitarian
point of view the same thing would apply
to youth rights then if it's all right
to take rights away from youth because
they might not have quite as much and
obviously it depends on the youth then
you could say the same thing
for people after a certain age which
would apply to you sure okay so I would
think from that perspective it would
make sense to say okay
you can't deny rights based on age based
on something arbitrary well no no no no
you have to be careful not to move past
or higher order things so I don't care
about age really that age isn't the
important thing its capability to act in
ways which produce good outcomes for
society so children are not capable of
independently acting in ways that are
beneficial for society for instance if I
have been endowed with whatever rights I
would get as an adult as a child I
probably would have never went to school
I probably wouldn't eat might like
properly I probably eat candy all day I
probably run around in the streets
[ __ ] naked and murdering Caleb I
don't know I would do whatever crazy
[ __ ] [ __ ] kids envision right so I
don't think that children are capable of
making rational decision I don't really
care about the age I'm not like
concerned with like by you know 16 you
can sign a contract or buy whatever so
it's not like an H stamp focused on its
rather you know what are the ages that
children are around approximately where
they can make to society it's not based
on an actual it doesn't matter if you
can if you're better than an 18 year old
I'm okay with it if cognitively if I'm
not yeah if I can't functionally drive a
car most seventy year old
okay I need money imagine should there
be some way to test people at that age
like I'm okay with requiring like okay
but I still don't like these I still
think this is a false equivalency
because like by the reason why old
people can't can't drive vehicles has to
do with the degradation of several of
our systems are visual and auditory
systems and are reflexive what not they
vary greatly from person to person
there is no twelve-year-old with a fully
developed prefrontal cortex right like
these are actual physiological changes
in the brain that do occur as
goes on like there's not gonna be a test
for a ten-year-old that we can give them
in order to see if they can properly
manage like an investment account or
something right like or deal with like
long or short term risks and responsible
ways no I mean like I wouldn't be
totally opposed to and it to some ways
even in society we already do recognize
this for instance in many states like 14
and 15 year olds can apply for early
driver's licenses or learner's permits
more particularly depending on where you
live
so I mean in some ways we already kind
of do do this in society right it's
someone we don't we base it on we don't
base it on sure and I totally understand
this is the thing is that this is not
we're not having a discussion of ethics
now we're moving into like total
practicality like in the real world it
would be nice to create like
individualized tests for every single
person a testament every single
circumstance to see what they're capable
of like reasoning out but realistically
we can't do that is she's not possible
to do it and there's a Seidel level so
like they're these are two very
difficult decisions one is like like
what what what ought we to do in society
with certain types of people and what is
practical to do and these two
conversations are entirely separate
things right yes I completely agree yeah
that's how I end up with my politics is
practical versus what philosophically
makes sense they don't often end up in
the same place
of course yeah yeah yeah my main concern
there is just that as a society we've
made these rules that don't necessarily
fit the people and they really are based
on something arbitrary that doesn't
reflect reality in every circumstance
you mentioned development if you worked
at the science there were people in
their 20s they also have reached kid
when I was young was 12 I a mcdowell but
a lot of people in the city don't
believe the twelve-year-old strive out
in the country on farms and around the
countryside there's lots of people that
are very young that people from the city
would never imagined could drive that do
and so these rights are being denied to
people but
they're doing the thing anyway it just
makes it illegal and that kind of
bothers me when there's no rule there's
no rational reason for it yeah I don't
know I can't help it I've been a youth
rights activist since I was since I was
a youth which was 30 years ago or so um
so I was just curious about your
position on that because it didn't seem
to fit with the rule utilitarian yeah I
mean it just comes down to what's
reasonable for society like in a perfect
world when we have infinite resources
available it would be nice to be able to
individually test every single child in
the country that's like not realistic
right if you're going to you know go
with the same sort of thing and for
building you would say probably sure you
should test every single adult sure yeah
yeah and so I much prefer a system like
that that's at least fair to every human
we have but again sure but again it I
don't I just don't think it's reasonable
right like I don't think we've got the
resources to do every single digital
systems I mean I took my driver's test
down in the country I'm living in and it
was all digital I had a driver's license
before obviously from another country
but um but as far as the test and
everything no resources involved other
than you know whatever 20 minutes on a
computer so a lot of things wouldn't
require that much for resources - uh
okay I mean if anybody's better outcomes
for society than yeah I'd probably be in
favor of it sure okay yeah that's cool
um let's see one thing I wanted to ask
you about which now are you a higher
determinist meaning that you believe
that everything was the term is
determined let me be very very very
clear this okay so so I'm probably a
hard determinist unless unless you're
going to do weird random
relevant quantum [ __ ] in which case and
physicist but that aside II I'm a hard
determinist but I guess in terms of like
philosophical or ethical systems I would
probably be considered compatible list
like I mean you can probably hold people
responsible for the things that they do
even if we assume from a factual basis
that everything is predetermined
so yeah you use determinism to promote
like social policies and things yeah I
think that you understand like factual
basis of the world or how people act or
function that I think you can design
better social policy around it correct
in a deterministic universe sure well
it's just it's not actually a matter so
much of the philosophy that's more of a
psychological thing is that I've heard
you get angry at people who have no
choice about the way that you know Trump
supporters or whoever have literally no
choice and how they act what they say to
you and it just makes sense to me from a
deterministic perspective to be angry
right because well yeah but just because
we live in a predetermined system
doesn't mean we don't function as though
we live in a predetermined system right
like our bodies our consciousness our
psychological aspects don't really allow
us to function that way right like I say
they do I always thought it was
relatively common sense that everything
was predetermined okay I mean I that was
that's a very very very small minority
of people I'd say less than 1% of people
probably actually believe that right if
you say so I I don't know I haven't I
supposedly could do a study or something
I always assumed it was common sense I
mean unless you were religious and you
believe God intervened or whatever but I
I assume most people believed in cause
and effect I don't think so no when it
comes to people definitely not
conservatives at least
[Music]
that strikes me as so bizarre I can be I
would love somebody who actually to
actually explain what they mean by free
will
well people want to feel like we're it
capable of making decisions independent
of and assume causes right like that's
but I mean like that's a fairly natural
thing to understand you don't want to
feel like every single thing you do is
predetermined right well no I would I
would think it would be much better to
believe that everything is predetermined
do you think most people feel that way
though I don't know I know that people I
like I had a discussion with my daughter
where she didn't realize that and she
was having a depressive crisis where I
hoped her to realize that what your life
is exactly as it had to be you it
couldn't be anything else
so if you're unhappy don't be unhappy
with your life it it had to be exactly
as it is I don't know I I just thought
that was common sense for most people
that were sure I would say that most
people rational I would say that this is
a wholly unsatisfying answer to life
that it takes a great deal of like
personal or mental development in order
to accept an answer like that that
answer is wholly unsatisfying and quite
dark the idea that your life is
predetermined the idea that there's no
greater purpose or meaning in life like
I would say that these are generally
like pretty negative things that people
have as white people spend so much time
in alive searching for religion or other
types of systems to give meaning or
whatever their lives now people didn't
realize that everything was
predetermined alright that was where the
psychological problem came in I guess
okay yeah I mean I think that most
people definitely don't like that idea
well why would you want to feel like
your whole life is predetermined that
you can't take it that you get no credit
for any of your accomplishments or
achievements and that everything bad
that happens doesn't have a reason or a
purpose I think it's totally natural to
want to feel like I don't know I mean in
the world yeah but people want to feel
like Nader does he won't have a choice
in the matter to be the best
oh yeah I can't imagine okay I mean I
just I can't put myself in that mindset
I don't know how that works yeah I think
most people are probably pretty
unsatisfied with that I would say Wow
okay well I will I'll take your word on
that one because I yeah that strikes me
as really weird
um well let's see oh you were having a
discussion the other day or I don't know
if it was the other day because I
watched it on YouTube so god knows how
how how long in between when you
streamed it actually I thought it was
common sense being born believing if you
want to achieve this result and you
didn't think that really counted as a
morality that what didn't count as a
morality the you must do so many
repetitions you know oh yeah those
aren't really moral questions yet
correct yeah can you explain why you
don't think that's immoral because the
moral question is why all you do
something in the first place so for
instance if I need to do say let's say I
need to do 15 reps in order to get
stronger the moral question isn't well
how many reps ought you to do in order
to gain strength it's why should you do
something to gain strength right the
moral question presupposes the cause and
effect of that thing that's not really
the moral question the real question the
real question isn't how to get to heaven
the real question is should we value
getting to heaven okay I would posit
something at least as a starting point
for because I knew here you have been
labeled let's put it that way as an
ethical egoist whether you accept that
or whatever
and I would I would promote or not an
ethical a rational egoist
I would promote an ethical egoistic
triplet approach that if you start with
the proposition that you want to be
alive as a human then you end up you can
get to those shoulds
now obviously you start with something
that you value you have to take that a
priori assumption but I can't think of
anything better than that
okay yeah I mean I'm that's probably
where I'm at yeah okay well so if you if
you take that a priori assumption that
you should live as you wish to live as
the as the initial value I guess or the
initial ah then you can get to anything
else from there as a moral system it's
possible sure yeah I I don't know I I
can't I can't see anything wrong with
that as far as I can't think of anyone
who's alive that doesn't wish to live as
they wish to live that seems like a
universal a universal morality well that
I don't know if that in and of itself is
enough to constitute morality like well
it gives you a it is an a priori
assumption it's something that you have
to believe to start with correct yeah
sort of like you have to believe that
heaven is that some place you want to go
before you can figure out how to get
there right yeah okay so what
differentiates it as far as moral
systems go well I mean typically I mean
just having your own preferences for a
lot of people doesn't necessarily get
you to moral lot dues like or more lots
I guess like just because somebody has a
preference doesn't mean that they should
necessarily fulfill every satisfy it
that's where the morality question comes
in everybody has the exact same
desire how can you have it I I don't
know how you could ever have a good
whose value what you choose instead I
mean I don't necessarily I can't devil's
advocate this I mean I agree with you
this is why I'm and I think most people
function as it but I mean people would
give other arguments that some people
would argue that the claim that an
egoist claim is vacuous for instance
you're trying to fulfill your desire as
well of course that's that's total
logical I mean by definition whatever
you're doing yeah but people would say
that well people would say that
everybody should fulfill their desires
cuz your desire is all the only thing
you ever can do is fulfill your desires
so some people would say that claim is
vacuous it's pointless to even say that
because it's circular I guess you could
say it's circular but in the society you
you have to fit I don't know you have to
figure out how to live together and in
that sense it's not vacuous in that you
have to figure out how best if so
everyone's desire well yeah but if some
people to say things like religion or a
traditional conservative values or LGBT
rights or pro or anti immigration right
well you need to start making other
value statements besides I prefer my I
prefer to fulfill my desires or whatever
right can each person sure but now you
already you already snuck in a moral
statement no now you're saying we should
do something that best fulfills
everybody's desires well why what if
there's a person whose only desires to
run around murdering as many people as
possible why should that person care
about any other person's desires between
the practical because I think that
everybody should theoretically be able
to fulfill their desires and I recognize
that practically speaking that doesn't
work or I can't picture it working so
there's knowing the boot movespeed in
league matter oh yeah that was dumb yeah
destiny actually oh no I don't wanna be
this again no that was a good
counterpoint
I was trying to decide what items to buy
in league and I have bronze and destiny
was explaining to me that I should know
the thresholds of movement speed never
said no I never said that actually yes
you did no I absolutely did not say wait
the way to actually buy pick to buy
items is I I you that you would know
exactly how much movement speed you need
as as your champion to catch this other
champion to get away from this other
champion okay there's it well quick
there's a difference between saying you
should do something versus I expect you
to do something there's those are two
different things I wouldn't expect you
to know any of these things okay no the
arc I want I actually wanna get into
this the argument was can we get into it
for just two minutes and we'll stop two
minutes it's 19 its 748 right now we'll
stop at 750 okay okay just present your
argument I'll get my counter-argument or
I can go first and you can have the last
word you're gonna do it I want to go
back and forth on this okay you go first
okay
here is my argument typically when
you're buying items in League of Legends
there are certain standard items that
you're expected to have by certain times
of the game because of the benefits that
they convey you when it comes to
something like boots nobody in the
history of League of Legends makes a
decision in terms of buying boots so
it's like well if I buy this boot here I
can gain either a 34% increase in speed
or if I buy this item I can get like a
22% increase in damage it's not the
decisions are never made on that type of
like on that type of like marginal
utility basis nobody just nobody usually
makes decisions like that it's just how
any of these items work not to mention
the fact that using that type of
marginal utility doesn't even make sense
because for instance moving ten percent
or twenty or thirty percent faster with
a boot isn't really how the speed works
in League of Legends there are gap
closers it really just matters if you
can catch him or not like just nobody
makes decisions like that and that that
was essentially my point is that I would
never like look at an item and and no
point here League interview the best way
in the world nobody looks and I was like
I could buy this now in gain of 15
percent increase in speed no it's not
how people look at items okay I was all
the Eve I had stealth I walk up to the
people and I try to one shot them meet
the gap closers and [ __ ] don't matter so
much like you're saying and it was
grouped by end of game people died ones
like level 18 full gear and the decision
was do I sell the boots to buy a damaged
item and I don't know thresholds of
movement speed and I was like
thing about it as oh if I saw these
boots I lose X percent movement speed
10% or whatever and if I buy this item I
gained 30 percent damage
I'm definitely selling the boots it when
I have six items and buying a [ __ ]
item that gives me 30 percent more
[ __ ] damage I'm gonna blow these
[ __ ] up cuz I don't need gap closers
I'm gonna [ __ ] come out of stuff much
like them and then you were saying that
I need to think about it a different way
and in my position of being a bronze
[ __ ] player it's the best way I could
possibly think about because I don't
know every champion and the threshold of
movie speed I need the best way okay
I'll do one counter I want you do my
kinda write it the best way to think
about it is to just buy boots and don't
think about it
that's it no when I have six items no it
was I think I think a league coach would
have actually said that it was correct
to sell the boots when I think that in
that game to buy the possible but the
arguments they're gonna be maybe we
actually go to a league coach after I
don't it was great I don't know but the
thought process they would be you I
don't care about the conclusion I kept
at the thought process the thought
process would be you already have a gap
closer don't you have a gap closer on
Eve and that the fights would be
happening is such a way they're not
gonna be running people down so you can
go ahead and toss the boots and grab a
damaged item it's not gonna be well we
would calculate it out that if you sell
the boots you're gonna lose 14 percent
of your speed so and then gaining 32
like nobody would ever make a decision
wait no no it is a good way to think
about it because the boots also have
like some damage on them too or like
magic pen or something I don't [ __ ]
know okay where you going hard into it
okay listen this is why it's not a good
way to think about it okay you are
valuing some number you're valuing a
percentage okay if I were to say to you
if you sell these boots you're gonna
lose 25% speed versus 35% speed does
that help you make a decision the answer
is always no no it doesn't what the only
way you did over 25 percent or thirty
five percent make a difference meters if
you know the speed of the other enemies
in the game you cannot possibly know of
25 percent to 35 percent is worthwhile
you can't know that I'm coming out of
stealth and one-shotting them in the
street is it okay then let's make a
real-life example you have 400 moves fee
right now if you sell boots you're gonna
lose 25% movespeed for another damage
item or you can sell boots and lose 35%
move speed which one of these is worth
it in why okay I didn't hear I didn't
you said let's sit you know 400 moves
speeding you have the option to sell
your boots to lose 25% moves me to
acquire damaged item to attack the
enemies or let's say in another world
you can sell your boots you could
acquire another damage weapon but you
lose 35% even lose speed and which one
of these worlds is it a good decision
and a bad decision based on losing 25%
or 35% your move speed okay so if the
movie speed difference was insane if it
was actually like 50 percent versus 10
percent okay if
if I was gonna lose so much moving speed
that I couldn't even get to them in
stealth then suddenly ah you said the
magic word if you were going to lose so
much movement speed that you weren't
gonna be able to get to them so it is a
threshold it's not a percentage but if
it's unknown you're not gonna be able to
measure it in percentages the
percentages don't give you any
information because we're centage
measures one ability it gives another it
gives me a rough estimate does it
because you don't know what the enemy
moves speed is whether you not only lose
25% or 30% it doesn't matter because you
don't know the enemy moves because you
can't compare the numbers to each other
it said I was gonna move seven if I was
50% slower I could be like okay let me
imagine my character running okay I'm
not gonna [ __ ] catch him if it's a
sum of 10% so I'm like let me imagine my
character running okay they're fighting
in these stuff but it's between 25% and
35% move speed you really think it was
it was like oh it's just 10% movement
speed [ __ ] yeah you know but you don't
know if 10% movement speed is the
difference we catching them or not
because if I'm moving 10% slower than
them I was just thinking that is how
uh-oh this is from my information what I
know I was thinking okay I know how fast
I'm running compared to them right now
it's about the same now they stopped a
fight once in a while when they're in a
5v5 fight it's not always running away
so when they're stopping and I'm overly
moving 10% slower and I'm constantly
moving at them I'll reach them and I'll
get the truck and press all my buttons
and try to blow them up out of self you
laugh because you're not right you don't
know any of the numbers so the idea that
you would lose a percentage that reduced
one number when you comparing it to
unknown numbers is absolutely ridiculous
listen I you can let me conceive of the
world I'm playing a game you're playing
actually you're playing a game you're
playing a game you're running the same
speed as other people okay do you know
that you're do you know that even movies
have the same speed as other people you
you can feel that you're approximately
moving the sky after being in a game for
30 minutes with a paintball okay you can
feel how fast you're running okay okay
if you're moving approximately the same
speed as the other
[ __ ] and you know that they
stop occasionally when they're fighting
okay because it's a group fight you're
coming in stealth then you'll know that
if you move a few percent [ __ ] slower
you can reach them okay but you'll know
that if you move many many percent
slower like 50 you [ __ ] won't
okay so percents matter to some extent
and that's not super accurate but as a
bronze player the best [ __ ] thing I
could do is estimate because I don't
know the perfect exact number and you
were saying that that for me was
incorrect and for me it was correct I
mean I guess of selling boots means
you're gonna move 50 percent slower sure
but are we comparing like moving like 20
percent slower versus like getting
another at like a that would happen
that's not what happened I had no idea
no first of all nothing happened that we
know the information about me I had no
idea what boots did how much faster they
made you I just don't have to buy them
every game right and I never had a
situation I had to sell the boots so I'm
[ __ ] bronze okay so I'm looking at
the [ __ ] boots right and I'm like how
much faster they actually make me oh
it's only ten percent okay I can sell
but I had no idea if it would be ten or
fifty when I have a [ __ ] mask over
the item I just looked at the number I
was like oh it's ten percent of my
movies mean whatever you know okay I
what I'm not lying I'm lying I don't
know boots every game I always buy boots
I didn't have any reason to look at how
much faster there was making me because
I'm always supposed to buy them so then
the one game where I was thinking about
selling them I looked at it I was like
oh it's this percent and I sold it okay
and it doesn't make sense and you think
what how can you be right I don't even
understand how he hit a world where you
could be right on I guess like okay I
can fight we can come together okay are
you ready yeah mmm-hmm if it's if you're
literally thinking that by selling your
boots you're going to lose literally
half your movement speed then in that
case looking at that might be thirty
percent I had no idea I thought it might
if it was thirty percent I would've been
like maybe I can't catch these people
and it was if it was five percent or 10
percent I don't even know what it is I
don't member what the percent was in the
end if it was [ __ ] small I was be
like okay I can you know if it was 30
percent movie speed I would've been like
probably questionable okay
I'm losing you now because I have a hard
time feeling it you're gonna be making
an intelligent like okay at 25% I can
absolutely sell my boots and it'll be
fine but it 30% man I'm really pushing
saying I don't have exact but if the
number was 30 let's use 30 and 5 if it
was 5 percent movement speed I'm like ok
I can I can pretty much estimate that
I'm gonna catch them still if they're
stopping in a group if it was 30 I
wouldn't know and then I'd be like kind
of stuck on the decision it probably
would just leave the base without
selling the boots ok ok I if it comes to
like 50% like movement speed loss then I
then looking I guess looking at the
percent is good ya know if it's dirty
it's also good what do you think you're
exaggerating the numbers at first at 50
whatever but if it was 30 versus 5 it's
all so [ __ ] good you can still tell
you don't have to know the exact numbers
to tell you're running up against after
somebody for a whole game and you can
think in percentages I I can see your
logic I just don't think I would ever
make a decision like this and as you
gain no no it's not about thinking
differently it's just it like you're not
like stacking percentages all game like
analyzing it like this it's more just
like if I don't have boots I'm going to
be slower than everybody but I've got a
movement speed gap closer that can get
me in there if I keep the boots I'm
still relatively quick but I lose the
damaged item like that's all you're
thinking you don't have to think in
terms of like percentages I guess but
unless you think yes you do because if
the percent of damage you're getting
would be true percent more damage you'd
be like no [ __ ] way I bother doing
that ok but again these numbers are so
absurd you don't buy an item in League
of Legends again 2 percent damage
there's no item that's the point
I look at it likes weekly milestones so
make looking at this percent making my
point that you don't buy an item in
league that gives 2 percent damage so
like mouse over the item and I find out
how much percent damage gives me there's
a reason to do that I can see a world
where you're correct ok
I can see I am current I just but just I
can see correct I have like ten thousand
games of League and never in my life
have I ever heard somebody I never heard
somebody I've never heard somebody say
like okay well let's analyze what we
gain here well if we buy another item
winner POV already what is winner oh
well if they're saying winner POV okay
damn I like that you can admit when
you're wrong unless using your meaning
okay if you go into a game no I love you
right I'm jumping ship I'm in the boat
on the ladder I know I know you don't
like losing argument so you go into a
game you've never played let me say you
playing World of Warcraft okay ready
mm-hmm you're playing World of Warcraft
and you you have two trinkets okay
you're in a starter's not I've been
arena during time let's say one trinket
would give you 10% movement speed and
the other one would give you 30% more
damage now you don't you bow so over the
trinkets and see the percentages do the
percentages help you make a decision no
or it does it matter that you know
because what if in World of Warcraft PvP
what if people have likes unlocks and
gap closers and [ __ ] or craft pvp and
you can think like damn last game I
played these guys I got the guy down to
15% health did I have any trouble
catching him no actually I didn't okay
I'll choose the damage percent over the
movement percent I know I don't know
because in WoW PvP movement speed might
mean [ __ ] all or it might be incredibly
[ __ ] we're know from playing a few
games even if you're [ __ ] equivalent
of bronze if you need to catch a
[ __ ] or do more damage I don't
know if that's how you catch people in
WoW though I don't know I have no later
games if you were this if you have
played a few games you would know if I
what I would do is I would [ __ ] I
wouldn't net deck the belt I would just
see what all the top EVPs you savages
copy that because you're a [ __ ] noob
yeah I know [ __ ] nobody okay when people
who don't suck at games play games they
don't just net deck everything I net
deck
everything until I'm the top person
your players you better [ __ ] believe
it I nicked the [ __ ] out of that [ __ ]
but I was like a high percentage league
player and I'm a very high percentage
star guard player but when I dude you
should've played [ __ ] hearthstone I
got legend at three months you know what
I did I went to [ __ ] tempo storm calm
my copy paste or whatever paladin secret
[ __ ] then go I copied every [ __ ]
card okay well I [ __ ] copied every
[ __ ] card I got my legend and I piece
the [ __ ] out of that [ __ ] mysterious
challenger Debbie's already talking
about whatever one had the Christmas
tree of Secrets one stream whatever had
the Christmas tree of Secrets that's the
one that I use I didn't know what have
to get cards of that [ __ ] game did I
get legend two seasons in a row right
but that [ __ ] that's what I do when I'm
in Doom I just copy that [ __ ] because
why would I ever think that I could
think of a better strategy than people
that spend full time like [ __ ] theory
crafting the [ __ ] game and Wow for
example resilience versus resilience
gems watch this every single person in
the entire game used PvP power gems okay
verse and there is there's an offensive
gem and a defensive gem now I analyzed
it with percentages okay and I realized
that two people hitting each other if
one person had full damage in one person
had the defensive gems the person with
the full defensive gems would do more
debt would do more damage and take less
damage okay just based on looking at the
percentages here okay I analyzed it all
the way through and then in the end I
knew that it was better to use the full
resilience gems and I had better Gemma
advantages residentsleeper a really good
just numbers you just look at the
numbers and you're like oh it's better
this way because anyone could have done
anyone you don't have to be good at all
you just look at the gym and you see
that you would do more damage
okay I don't know anything about what
but in this case if it's literally just
one stat versus the other then maybe it
is good here maybe that's important
there maybe you can just do it simply
but another thing then in that case
that's fine but those that's literally
like a linear relationship between two
stats movespeed presses attack damage
Indian like leek is way more [ __ ]
complicated and he's comparing two
numbers complicated I get it this more
complicated it can help me make an
educated guess to use the percentages I
still won't get up a perfect answer I'm
not saying I'm gonna be the perfect
answer but it's gonna lead me toward the
correct decision more often to know the
percentages than to not know them okay
you let you put I did okay why don't you
play your piano more let's hear that
okay
[Music]
however my fingers [ __ ]
I'm talking to a guy and I don't know
why oh god please don't let this be
cancerous please don't let this be
cancerous okay what's up so yeah thanks
for having me on here and I don't know
you saw my email which star truck
doesn't have talked about I'm still
gonna mention exactly what it is because
I want to I want to establish some
things first just because I want to like
have a thing where leading you to answer
in a certain way I guess or anyway
doesn't matter okay but I've seen you
oppose you know a good many people on
the alt-right on YouTube and people who
would support say racist or sexist
position so that equate to a general
blanket opposition to racism and or
sexism and the desire to have like
affirmative action policies stuff to
promote like that this in general your
might cut off a little bit example stuff
to promote a what in general or to
decrease prejudice I freeze it badly
first sorry oh that's not like a goal
but yeah I think that's probably
something I'd like to do I think yeah um
so exciting how I should order this but
so case that's I guess the reason why we
say that position is interesting to me
given what you said about your own moral
systems is that um you should be or not
you're not likely to be in a situation
in which you will be subject to systemic
racism or sexism correct so in a certain
sense you could say that oh and this is
gonna reveal the connection I think to
you but [ __ ] it mmm but some in a
certain sense that would mean that
people who are subject to these things
cannot risk
supercade that sort of protection or
assistance to you because you're not
subject to that problem at all
sure hey so that's that's right
wait what you're okay wait are you using
push-to-talk or voice activation I'm
using voice activation like it's just
that
yeah maybe push-to-talk alright cuz your
mic cuts out sometimes I me you're just
like a couple of your words will get cut
off into sounds sure yeah I'll try that
um hold on voice and video sitting lets
do push the talk and my button will be a
alright does that work yeah okay good so
I you got what I was saying like well
enough right y'all like you just yeah I
think so that I basically people that I
could be racist to will never be racist
back to me no nope not exactly because
again we're talking about it's systemic
racism rather than like individual races
so I mean sure you could have a
situation which like will never be
meaningfully I'm not trying to like get
you on some dumb but like meaningful
erases back to me right right yeah yeah
I probably agree that yeah so I think
that watch actually I'll start with a
second point maybe the third actually no
I'm gonna let me the second point
entirely so I think it's not immediately
relevant um but and then also when it
comes to global warming and things like
that you would support trying to
mitigate the effects of global warming
despite the fact that most of those
effects will be seen far into the future
I don't know if that's true at this
point but I don't feel like that's
innately true I could be wrong on that
but it feels to me like we're definitely
seeing very real effects of that like
already today or even like in the past
season
well sure I'm yes but they're possible
to avoid for many people I would say
probably share yeah okay yeah I agree
Janet but um so those two things
combined I I think when you contrast and
this is where I'm gonna bring up the
veganism part positions of promoting the
rights of and care for groups that
cannot reciprocate that effort okay
and therefore the position that you
espoused in the debate would ask
yourself that wasn't really debate but
you know um would therefore also be a
little a little off from I think your I
guess gut values here so here's the
difference okay is that supporting all
of these other groups of people in a
roundabout way we'll ultimately I would
imagine some like benefit me to some
extent being nice to animals will never
ever in any conceivable way benefit me
that's the difference okay yeah I can
sort of see where that's going yeah I
would agree with that I mean see no I
don't want this to end in like two
seconds because then I don't like I'll
say that assistance to people that can
this is necessarily directly reciprocate
um well I mean generally it improves the
status in the entire country I mean from
a personal level people that are racist
are often times very boring to me I
generally don't like these types of
people for a variety of personal reasons
so I don't like to be in their presence
or even to have them around or to be
associated with them even like a
national level like I would prefer it if
racist would [ __ ] off of my even my
country I go so like I said don't really
cared necessarily my country but at
least like my community and whatnot so
on a personal level I don't want to
associate with them on an intellectual
level most of these
people are very [ __ ] stupid so that's
a reason why I don't really want to be
associate with him so getting rid of
that type of thought it benefits I think
me there as well
and then from a social level generally
having a society where people are
committing less crime and having to
spend less of my money being locked up
in jail and contributing more in terms
of tax dollars in our status amongst the
world in terms of like edge right um so
I guess my first response to that is
well that's true I think there are some
initiatives that like exist in society
currently that don't necessarily benefit
you that would still be part of like
that larger umbrella barrassed oh wait
save it again so for example it might
benefit you to have like Burrell yeah I
guess rising tide lifts all boats
perspective yeah for sure um maybe like
more accessible College for everyone
for example yeah for sure but that
doesn't apply equally across all college
majors do great I don't know if I agree
with that I mean I value all sorts of
knowledge I think that there's just as
much value in the arts as there is in
like stem or whatever sure I guess um
but I would say in response to that that
you can pursue art space knowledge
somewhat on your own time I realize I
may be opening a Pandora's box there but
yeah I don't know if this is I mean like
technically you can do anything on your
own time right yeah that's a fair point
and you could do computer programming or
literally every how do I use my um how
do I use my big bullets guys I forgot
the hotkey oh my god sorry it's okay
so did kill me Oh oh my god it's cute
okay Saigon yeah I mean I value all
types of education I'm not just like oh
it has to be stammered bus all right um
I guess do you think that there's the
same sort of social I guess learning met
you could say when it comes to like arts
knowledge versus like scientific
achievement though what do you mean by
learning net seeing for example if a
person makes like if there's a signs of
research facility it's developing the
cure for the the next cure for cancer
then if they discover that that benefits
you very very clearly I guess sure and
but versus people like other people
discovering I guess you could say okay
wait let's go here let's make a because
we're gonna get into really weird
arguments that are gonna be impossible
for you to defend cuz it sounds like
what you're going here is let's say that
I can allocate money to do different
types of educational institutions one is
involved in research in cancer the
others involved in research and art
history you're gonna say that well I
should only put money towards one
because it has a more likely effect of
benefiting me than the other right I
mean if you're doing for personal
benefit yeah so like this is so this is
like a focus and they're in the wrong
area we need to go to higher order
truths in order to figure out what I
would be in support of I'm not
necessarily in support of giving out
money to very specific causes and that's
the only way that I think that that
should be done that's like a really
specific thing that I I that argument is
impossible to defend because then we
have to get into well I should only
donate to certain types of research
while there are only certain majors that
I should like that could sense it like
really weird areas that are like
impossible to really defend so I'm
backing up so are you familiar kind of
like roughly with the idea of liberalism
basically freedom of speech freedom to
choose your life and job and all that
[ __ ] freedom of the press all that oh
yeah okay so I'm generally I'm pretty
sure I mean I would be consider
I'm pretty in favor of liberal
principles and I think that society
probably operates the best and people
can probably maximize their happiness at
least in the West under kind of like
liberal ideas so that's what I advocate
for in general
so from liberalism I think you generally
get things like education or your choice
and choosing what you want to do as a
job I don't believe that society should
like prescribe a certain type of work to
you and that we should only value
certain types of college education that
that sounds like a really bad idea I
think that there's a value in all types
of education whether it's art history or
engineering or you know nuclear research
or gender studies or whatever I think
that all types of education people
generally in people in general will be
more educated a good thing and I think
that all of these things contribute to
building a better society I don't like
the idea of only funding certain things
that are like immediately hyper relevant
and then not funding things that might
benefit us in other ways I'd rather let
people make those decisions on their own
right okay so that's kind of like my so
I don't think I would ever get into like
specific things I'm like I would only
ever fund this type of education that
seems kind of like a weird way to go
about picking and choosing Lake who I
would want to be fund for education
educator okay good I mean sure but I
would also say that I mean we have
sciences that are dedicated to
understanding for instance how one
should best allocate money in a society
for benefit and we can apply that to
these sorts of things right sure but I
don't think that getting rid of all
money away from like art degrees for
instance did that benefits society I
wouldn't think so
I mean society as a whole I would agree
with you it wouldn't but depending on
where you are personally might benefit
you depending well but then I feel like
we're crafting bad rules for society I
think in general I'd want to craft the
best rules for society gets everybody
invested in whatever program or whatever
I'd be interested in and I think it
keeps everybody contributing I like what
do do you think that like all the people
that want to do like art as a major will
just disappear and go become engineers
or whatever if we just get rid of the
art degrees like no they won't
well I mean some of them I think
actually because I mean a lot of people
will go into college I don't necessarily
know
they want to do and sort of take the
path of least resistance right so I
think some of those people you know
maybe maybe they like art and they do
art yeah I guess and then that's also
kind of sad then that we're basically
are crafting a society where we say it's
ok to force people to do things or
pressure people to do things in some way
that benefits society even if they don't
innately want to because then I feel
like somebody could compel me to do
something but like I really enjoy
streaming but how much in terms of like
science research output how much value
do I offer to society with my job like
little to none so should I be kind of
like pressured away from doing what I do
in order to be a researcher I don't know
I'm not comfortable crafting that role
over Society
I would agree with you actually on this
sort of wise but this debate is getting
to a weird territory I agree but no yeah
I think it would affect the perception
situation where it would be there is
still value like in society for for
instance good art because people need to
like have things to do after they've
amassed all the material economic units
to you know use for their benefit but I
think especially nowadays there's a lot
more artists then like massively viewed
art so you could have a system in which
even though I don't necessarily support
this you have I guess only like the very
top tier based on whatever academic
lecture you are gonna use yeah ok so the
so I try to look at society is like
holistically as possible if I want to
have like a realistic way in which
society societal rules kind of work so
if I create a society where I'm saying
we're gonna value certain types of
education more than other types and then
[ __ ] you otherwise I feel like that's
the society that's gonna be really hard
to get everybody invested in so I think
in general I would avoid those types of
things and like picking and choosing the
types of Education I support sounds like
a very bad way to have everybody feel
invested in my system because anybody
that's not like at the top tier of
something they want to do that I guess
isn't deemed worthy by society all of a
sudden doesn't get to pursue that area
of study I mean if they've got the money
to do it I mean it should be up to them
know or if they've got the qualification
to do it or if they've got the desire to
do it even I mean it
we can provide the funds for it sure
yeah I would say that um so the other
point I was gonna make which may be more
relevant here is again like you're
explaining very well I think how it
would benefit society at large but I
still haven't necessarily seen the
exhalation for why this would benefit
you personally so I mean like I want to
live in a society where everybody is
happy healthy and well educated I mean
being part of the United States means
something more than being well [ __ ] I
don't know get it a dick wag
but like rather than being part of say
like Estonia or something which is a
really quickly growing country I should
bring them up or some other you know
like country that's got like a [ __ ] ton
of issues or problems with education or
something right like I would rather be
part of a country where all of its
people are well educated where it's
people are healthy words people don't
commit crimes like I think in a in
indirect ways but in pretty observable
ways all of these things benefit me
greatly
right like but I don't know that just
seems really don't alright yeah but now
I I you made a very good point and it's
it's a little awkward because I don't
necessarily I don't necessarily disagree
with 99% of what you said here sure
except for the one thing um what was the
one thing the veganism thing but oh wait
so what are you discrete me about the
veganism thing no I I was trying to I
try to do the part of the ask yourself
to be that I I thought should have gone
differently because she had said
initially that there were like that sure
the universe box situation is a total
hypothetical well what is the universe
box situation again remember um which
way in the non-diverse or some [ __ ] if
you could push a button or yeah like
that and then these people could not
reciprocate or could not interact with
you in any way so you could reciprocate
yeah and I think I'd be indifferent I
mean I like emotionally I'd probably
wouldn't end that universe cuz I just
kind of like a dick mode to do for no
reason but I mean I'd be indifferent to
it ultimately I don't know right yeah
but so the reason why I sort of brought
the other stuff I brought up up is
because I sort of realized as that
debate was going on that it wasn't
actually that much
pathetic oh and there are situations in
which there are people who can't
reciprocate your well in a very direct
way but I mean indirectly we're all
pretty much connected to one another in
this day and age I mean where this is
where we live in a very [ __ ]
globalized society right like I'm sure
if I were to go to check my subscriber
counts most of my subs probably aren't
even from the United States if I combine
all the other regions right so I mean
we're all pretty connected these days
I'd say right if we got to areas in 20
and 10 or 20 years we're like India or
countries in Africa are becoming super
connected to global markets access to
Internet what not I mean that can be
more viewers from my stream since [ __ ]
right or for minority issues right if
women are more invested in gaming and
whatnot maybe I'll have more than a four
percent of female audience you know
maybe I could get you know twice as many
viewers or something if more women are
invested in games I mean like there are
ways that all of these things kind of
roundabout benefit us I would say
push just remind already entertainment
things like like Black Panther was
arguably some people could say a large
drive to that was because we wanted to
see you know more black people meeting
and I thought that movie was pretty cool
and I contributed to the Avengers the
Marvel Universe like I don't know and it
all seems like we're all pretty
connected these days you're not wrong
yeah but and this is also a part of the
global warming example even though it's
not a perfect example but because there
are also issues that will affect people
in the future the ones that will affect
people way out of my lifetime yeah I
don't know how you would ever deal with
that that gets hard I don't know if you
could ever justify it from an egoist
point of view I'm not sure yeah but I
mean since we're analyzing I guess
whether you are an egoist or not would
you personally try to invest in like
far-flung future issues I mean if it has
very minimal to no impact on my current
life maybe but if it would have any
detrimental impact to me and that would
be a really hard so I don't know how you
would ever get me invested in something
like that so like let's say for instance
you could contribute 5% of your tax
dollars in order to do like a manned
flight to [ __ ] Neptune
I know Neptune is a gas dryer but say
something like that but the flight
wouldn't happen until 2150 I don't know
if I'm ever investing any funds
whatsoever on that I don't think I could
ever you could ever get somebody like me
invest
yeah okay and in that case I suppose
it's I suppose a consistent position um
but the yeah the global warming thing is
hard because like you know we want to
think it's really far from the future
but who I don't know man I mean like
there's seasons around the world are
getting [ __ ] hot as [ __ ] like it's
hard to feel like that's only something
that um is like far off in the future
I'm pretty sure we're seeing the effects
of that now
ya know you're not wrong
I remember reading somewhere that like
wow it's like happening now it's going
to happen more like as things continue
I asked you a few questions about Sam
Harris by the way sure thing buddy I
love talking about Sam Harris what do
you want to talk about went on discord
sure thing but he sent me a message oh
hey what's up okay
so there's probably won't take long but
I just heard previously that you said
that Sam Harris never defined like
well-being at all and I just as far as I
understand it at least he has the way I
understand it is like he defines it as
pretty much the same way that you define
the set of preferences that each of us
have right and so it's sort of the
fulfillment of those preferences so he
comes from a place where you say
materialist and a determinist right so
there is only in the natural world and
all the implications of that and so
everything that relates to your well
being sort of a product of of your brain
state right and even if we can do it
right now but in the future basically we
will be able to sort of measure all
there is to know about your well-being
from the state of your brain pretty much
right and so if you have an input like
pain and one of your preferences is that
you don't enjoy pain at all well then
you'd be able to measure that in in the
brain and so it is with everything so
even if you turn that around and say
that you enjoy pain well then the
function would would be different right
and so I see that okay let's say let's
say that I grant this okay because this
is a common thing residentsleeper
resident of okay i have preferences and
i fulfil said preferences sam harris
seems to make much stronger claims that
he can say that we ought pursue like
maximizing preferences for all of
humanity it seems like he tries to make
a much stronger claim there and my
evidence for this
that let's say that what you're saying
is true that sam harris just says well
we should all seek to maximize our
preferences why did you need to write a
book on that
why not just say like oh look like this
is literally just egoism that's all it
is like it seems like he's trying to
create or things he's created something
far more unique there he needs to write
a book because you need to address like
a lot of standard problems in ethics
like the trolley problem and so on how
to actually solve all these these data
cases using the method that he is using
and because like most people don't
really think that you can get from an
eStore note which you can't but you can
get from two years to an old can next
yeah explain it okay so this is sort of
the argument not really that Harris
makes but that's Lawrence Krauss I think
it's called it's usually making and if
you had a have set goal and you know the
state of the world then science can tell
you how to get there right because we
can if you if you have to pass a and B
an a will lead to one out comment and B
will lead to the other then you can
start to determine which outcome will be
the best sure I feel like and I don't
want to misinterpret somebody especially
if it's like a better philosopher but um
like I feel like it's a centrist okay
that those types of bought statements
that seems like a linguistic equivalency
to me that doesn't necessarily mean the
same thing so let me give you a
difference so if you want to if you want
to lift a weight above your head okay
you need to be able to lift a certain
amount of weight I don't believe that
that type of ought like or that type of
should like you should do something to
accomplish something else is the same as
a moral should because in one we're
speaking of virtues and then in the
other we're speaking of accomplishing a
goal so like I think these are two very
different statements or like rather like
say just ate to throw a ball if you want
to throw a ball across the yard you
should throw you you should you know
real backhand and wind up and throw the
ball that type of should is a different
should because it's not speaking of an
action that's a virtuous it's just a
speaking of accomplishing a goal and to
take it one step back to where it is a
moral question how about the question of
like
should you even value that goal that
would be the moral question so I don't I
don't believe that this is taking
multiple is--is and getting to an art I
think that it just it presupposes the
art by stating a goal but but the real
art question is why should we value that
goal in and of itself right yeah yeah
that's definitely true and the way that
Harry sort of solved this question is
just by saying what else could you value
outside of well-being and you can sort
of answer that question if you actually
have it on hand like it's sort of an
axiom that everyone actually wants to
fulfil their desires whatever they may
be right and that seems reasonable to
most people I mean you can't really okay
I I'm not gonna disagree we probably
agree on 99.9 and I never said I think
you're gonna say okay like well you know
like is there anything else you value
besides well-being the answer to that is
probably no right I don't know if
there's a better answer than that but
the difference is the strength of the
claim that Sam Harris is making okay it
comes to it's the same thing as my
arguments with REM about like about like
knowing if we can know about the nature
of our existence right my quite my
answer when it comes to moral questions
right I generally say we can't know
about these types of things however we
can make some assumptions and work from
there that's the that's the difference
but Sam Harris seems to be unsatisfied
with that where he says we'll hold on
like I'm not just gonna assume that my
position is true I know that my position
is 100 not true and I can chase some
sort of objective morality because I can
use science to discover what is
objectively morally true that's the
that's the whole issue with Sam so all
of this nothing wrong he does make the
action he does say that it is a claim
that your value will be but many people
have actually asked and that question
about how do we know we should well you
that and you say it and his answer is
there's nothing else to value so that's
not true though there is plenty of else
to value we could valued no well-being
we could value a state of murdering or
killing everybody
well no because that would go against
you well yeah if your preferences are to
kill people no no no no no the saying
that we ought satisfy our preferences
that's a moral statement saying that we
ought to satisfy and that is unjustified
this is the whole thing Harris has
contributed nothing unique to the realm
of philosophy because as soon as you
start to back up and ask a question like
well why are we value well being we
either go to some weird egoist thing or
maybe we can get to like Kahn she and
imperatives like categorical norms or
something like nothing that Harris's
contribute news is new
he just presupposes the question or or
presupposes the answer and then pretends
that he solved it by constantly begging
the question right like well how do we
know that well-being is the best because
that's the best state of being of every
creature like well-being is the best
state of every conscious Kriya what what
is best mean how do we value what is
best well we because it's the best thing
like that's the problem like yeah maybe
you're right maybe I need to think about
it more but whatever the last time we
watch with Harrison another guy it like
summarized it perfectly where the other
guy was basically just telling her I was
like listen dude you can't justify it
like let's just assume this and move on
but Harris like does not understand this
point that his whole philosophy is
constantly circular like I'm sending us
I don't know if you watched me watch
that video if someone in chairs like
that but it was a really good finally
somebody like tries to nail Harris down
for like five minutes unlike listen
you're trying to say that we should
value well-being but you don't realize
it that's a moral statement than that
you're claiming you have justification
where but you don't so I good Oh with
Sean Carroll yeah I think you're
reasonable but but if it just feels like
a lot of philosophers philosophers that
there is sort of arguing against take
this notion of I think Sam Harris comes
out of a place where he's frustrated
that he can make moral claims like where
people in the Middle East and let's say
all the atrocities committed by Islam
and so on but you can't really speak up
against that morally no no but you
absolutely can that's the problem and
this is why I can't imagine anybody that
like studies or does philosophy
academically must kill themselves when
they listen to some hair cities you can
absolutely make moral statements without
having to resort to sam Harris's weird
[ __ ] scientism or whatever you can
absolutely be you can even be a moral
anti-realist and still construct moral
systems that will allow you to condemn
other people like you can totally do
that you don't you don't absolutely need
like proper justification from an
axiomatic or or to destroy
all opry or ease or whatever to create a
moral system in order to criticize other
people you can absolutely do it but for
some reason sam harris doesn't see
either acknowledge to this or understand
this but but don't you still need to
like make the item of building both
being otherwise sure but the thing is
that Harris doesn't axiomatically do
that he feels like he's justified it
using science that's the thing I feel
you're wrong on this thing of okay yeah
if you feel that I'm wrong on this then
my question is tell me like what Sam
Harris defines as well-being and then
tell me why we ought value well-being
Sam Harris does never answers these
questions and like if you feel like he
I'm wrong then you would say like oh
well well-being is defined as such and
this is why we we absolutely should
value it you but you can never give me
those answers okay I'll try okay so I
think you're correct that he never says
Koepke yeah I can speak he can't give
any justification for why we ought very
well being because it cannot be done but
he has defined well-being as far as as
well-being can sort of be defined in in
the sense that he always makes an
analogy to health right so help me I
know he makes these analogies to health
because it's the only type of analogy
that he can make because all he can do
is beg the question so Sam Harris a Sam
Harris the front of this would be
well-being destiny put your hand on a
stove and tell me what happens that's a
well being okay well how about this I
create two worlds one in which the woman
is subservient to the man and serves the
man but both people feel fulfilled and
another world where men and men men and
women are treated equally Tommy which
one it is a greater state of well-being
Sam can never answer a difficult
question like that or any actual moral
question aside from very obvious things
that are literally like reflex neurons
right like we'll kick yourself in the
balls and tell me if that's well-being
not to mention the fact that you can
even use some of these more basic
examples to see if they're correct
how about stabbing somebody in the arm
is that is that a thing of well-being
well I don't know in the terms of
vaccinations we seem to say yes what
about in terms of getting tattoos well I
mean it's vanity but we make the trip
right like these are all very difficult
questions that are totally valid that
Harris's system can't answer this we
would appeal to like he's basically
saying we need to be healthy and
like and even that is a value statement
they're not necessarily everybody would
agree with what about people that eat a
lot of sugar that damage their body
sorry
sorry I'm not trying to get you all of
you high guard that's fine okay so I
think you can actually figure out in
many of the cases like what would
benefit you the most if you are
determinist and and okay so let's do
this let's do a very simple example of
eating sugar then tell me how sam harris
would argue that i'm somebody that wants
to consume enough sugar to give me
diabetes what is the moral thing here
what ought I value okay well if if you
sort of concede that that you're
interested in in the well in your own
well-being right you can sort of and
everything is deterministic then you can
figure out what state would grant you
the most happiness right sure so tell me
which happiness I should value more
living more healthy until seventeen
eighty and not enjoying sugary foods or
enjoying sugary sweet foods my entire
life and maybe dying ten years earlier
of diabetes okay
well the one that maximizes your
well-being or all I think we have it how
do you define well-being here is it the
happiness and pleasure you gain through
the recreational activity of eating food
with friends and families and enjoying
food your whole life or is it or is it
living longer the problem is that what
I'm asking you science can never give us
the answer to these questions and Harris
won't acknowledge this there's no way I
can run a scientific test to determine
which thing we should weigh more than
the other because these are moral
questions as they're philosophical
questions there's no way you could ever
use science to measure a brain state and
give me an answer here and this is why I
never hear Harris appeal to an actual
difficult problem to solve what about
something like exercise right using
Harris is definitely not in as much as
well as good as shape as he can be right
now why is that does he not value his
well-being or is it because he likes to
do other things rather than exercise or
workout or is this a vice and he's
actually acting in a non virtuous way
according to his own moral system like
what would his answer be very okay you
have actually convinced me I was just
wrong there's no way to actually figure
that out so I eventually would disagree
with Harry's but I would disagree in a
slightly different way so I'll just tell
you what what
think the problem was and and then I'll
go again
so the if let's assume that you could
actually do that do the thing that I
suggested early on where you can sort of
figure out what path you should choose
to maximize your own well-being then you
still have to match but then everything
becomes a a function a maximization
problem across all human beings that
live on earth right but one one person's
happiness can be another person's
misfortune right and so there's no way
to actually figure out how you actually
maximize it across all human beings
without introducing some sort of
value-based system of course but then
what you're talking about is basic
consequentialism or or or utilitarianism
right how do we maximize the utility
across all of humanity and then we wait
peoples we create axioms to let us value
some things over other things and then
we measure you know how we do that so
for instance in the case of like
gang-rape right or in the case of let's
say rape right one person is being made
happy but another person is being made
sad obviously right well we would argue
that because of how we axiomatically
value things that we value a person's
autonomy and lifelong happiness or for
the temporary happiness of somebody
that's raping somebody so we would say
this act is morally wrong right yeah
yeah sort of right but but it's saying
that the question is still up in the air
whether or not utilitarianism like
modulus all the other things that you
could value such as fairness right so
you could sacrifice one human being for
the benefit of all the others but it's
not clear whether or not you're tolet
Arianism actually modulates that at all
it could be right because most people
don't want actually to live in a society
where they could be sacrificed for the
greater good so to speak sure but even
even like real utilitarian aswhat agree
with this where so for instance
entertain an act utilitarian in a rolly
children and act utilitarian might say
something like sacrificing one to save
four is always good because it's
obviously you know you just do the math
one four four is good but a rule
utilitarian might say well if we craft
that rule for society nobody's gonna go
to the [ __ ] hospital because they're
worried they're gonna get murdered for
their organs right so we actually
wouldn't say we could sacrifice one to
say for that would be even though maybe
like a very strict like actor
utilitarian would say yes a rule utility
room say this is a bad rule for society
so consequentialism can even take into
account those types of things right
yeah I agree and I thought this is where
the main problem was and and I thought
you could actually maximize it for the
individual human being but yeah it
changed my mind so sure there's a really
good yeah there's a really good debate
with Sean Carroll and and Sam Harris
where they pretty much talked about this
and it's like all Sean Carroll is trying
to say is it like dude all you need to
do is all you need to do is just put a
[ __ ] axiom here and then we can talk
about interesting things but Harris is
obsessed with trying to logically prove
like his moral system is objectively
correct which is absurd it's kind of
like getting into a debate about the
nature of existence right can you know
that the reality that you live in is
real the answer to that is absolutely no
you can never know that we can't know
anything about physical objects only
what our senses convey to us however it
is totally reasonable for us to assume
that it's true and then work from there
but that's different right
I'll make the assumption that the
reality that my sense is conveyed to me
is probably real and then I'll work from
there but I'm not gonna go I'm not gonna
make a claim as strong as I can know the
nature of physical objects I would never
say that because I can't do that I can
only operate with what my senses convey
to me but then there'll be somebody with
like Harris in the room where
everybody's trying to have a
conversation like okay well how should
we act in the physical world and Harris
is like no no no no no guys listen up I
can know about the physical universe I
can know about physical just like no you
can't dude like just say no and then
we'll move on from that's fine like you
don't have to 100% prove this to have a
good conversation about it I think
that's the problem we can actually watch
the I'll watch the Sean Carroll thing
after this if you want to listen with us
mention yeah sure okay
actually yeah I agree with the mall
thing but but with regards to like what
we can know to be true actually think
that Harris concede that point many
times he often says that the only thing
that we can know is that we had that I
myself have experienced isness yeah yeah
and then you have to like assume that
everything sort of unfold from there so
he says that many times but but given
that what you observe is reliable then
we can make assumptions about yeah yeah
so so I don't think he's [ __ ] in
that regard
sure just in the moral sense but yeah no
I agree he hopefully would agree with
what's up buddy um I guess before we
start I was wondering if you can um I
don't know just talk about the whole
overall JP versus Harris debate and your
key takeaways I mean I only watch like I
think an hour and a half of the first
episode because it doesn't seem like
watching any more was truthful my main
problem with Sam Harris is it Sam Harris
seems to think that he can make claims
that are with way more authority than
what he actually can I think that once
you're an atheist you kind of lose the
ability well in my opinion but there are
people much smarter than me that
disagree with us Sam Harris is not one
of them though but like I I think that
it's really hard for you to appeal to
some sort of universal set of ethics or
some sort of objectively factually
correct way of understanding like moral
truth in the universe you you can do it
while being an atheist but there are
routes that you go to do that and sam
Harris just kind of assumes it as is he
doesn't actually um he never actually
justifies any of his moral positions he
always just he kind of he kind of begs
the question he sneaks into conclusion
with his wit with his premise where
he'll say something like you know
humanity would be better if we increase
well-being for everybody therefore we
ought increase well-being for everybody
well okay how do you define well-being
and then he was just very circular well
things that are better or well-being is
my problem you see that has to do with
you know the hole is a gap we talk about
a lot yeah of course
okay you I guess talk a little bit about
that in context of that concept sure so
the problem with the is art gap so you
have two types of claims that you can
make you can make descriptive claims and
you can make normative claims so
descriptive claims are basically
statements of fact about the universe
your hair is brown your the rubber band
is on the desk cars travel at 50 miles
per hour right these are like
descriptive claims normative claims are
statements of what we do so something
like
so something like you know we ought
treat people kind in society we ought
not murder people we ought tell the
truth right those are normative claims
sam harris claims that he can take a
descriptive claim like measuring some
neurobiological property and then
generate odd claims off of that using
well being somehow but he never
establishes or defines well-being is
which is like the big problem mm-hmm
okay well at least my concern with that
is that i feel like at least from my
understanding of what harris is arguing
is that he tries to sit like sort of
skip over that whole debate mm-hmm i
like trying to define bad into something
that i think we would all agree with
like you know i think he like JP would
call it like hell and some arrows would
say like the worst conceivable
experience you know forever or something
like that right yeah so like i'm just
curious like why do you think of that is
not a good way to like I guess skip over
that issue
sure well there's two big problems one
is bad for Sam and the other is really
bad for Sam so the first thing is that
when you make claims like this all
you're really doing is preaching to the
choir if I were to speak to an audience
think of a world with the worst possible
experience for everybody and that world
is bad now think of a world where
experiences are better the best possible
experiences that's good and then there
are all the worlds in between this is
called the moral landscape now he can
make that but the problem is that every
single person the problem is that like
every single person is going to be
envisioning totally different worlds
like one person might envision a world
with the most possible good is a world
where women aren't sexually promiscuous
and where men you know rule over
everything and women stay-at-home thing
and another person might envision a
world where where women actually
dominate the men right but so when you
just when you make these kinds of
vacuous statements which is what they
are they're vacuous because they don't
really convey any real meaning up like
the worst possible world in the best
possible world Sam Harris doesn't really
get you there so he doesn't really give
you a way to think about it
and then the second thing is that if sam
harris actually admits that and and
tries to appeal to something else like
internal desires or something he
essentially moves into territory that's
already had extensive conversation or
literature about it and then he has
really no real contribution to make like
things like egoism or whatever where
people have talked about these things
like to death or way in way more depth
than sam harris ever has well I want to
sort of try to think more about that
first argument that you were saying
mmm-hmm isn't it the like I haven't
really read Harris particularly deeply
or anything like rapid doesn't hear
argue that like the moral landscape has
like multiple peaks that if you were to
imagine morality to be sort of like the
topography of like a mountain range
you know elevation low elevation would
be like the badness and highest
elevation would be you know what
whatever is good it is possible for
there to be like multiple heights or
like multiple optimal stages from where
I am it again anything thing that just
makes this thing more weaselly and
within less authority so like what does
that mean what is a world where like
here's the question I would ask Harris
or any Harris fan how do you define a
world with maximal well-being what is
well-being mean Sam Harris never has
defined that ever as far as I'm aware of
even in its literature he hasn't defined
it well the way that it's logical right
cuz like sure but again if it's if it's
if it's vacuous than and right you're
just saying like well what is well-being
well well-being is when everybody B's
well well okay well what do you do if
somebody disagrees with your definition
of well-being well they're wrong I guess
right like that's all you can say well I
mean I think that that's a fair point
but the way that I imagined it and I was
thinking about this analogy that it
seems to be like your argument seems to
be like well Sam Harris to probably say
things like oh yeah I getting Bernard
stove that's probably bad we can all
probably agree with that but he but his
morality can't address those other
questions that you were asking like uh
you know as a society better if it was a
if woman works returning to man or vice
versa uh-huh and to an extent I do agree
with that I don't think that he tries to
tackle those things but at the same time
I don't think that he needs to solve
those issues for his argument to be
valuable in my eyes the reason why I
believe that is because I sort of
imagined it like this like let's say
that we neither of us had any idea of
what math was and let's say that someone
comes up and says well I think one plus
one equals two and then imagine another
person coming up and saying all actually
what's one times infinity and the first
person says gee I don't know the second
person would say well you can't you
can't you can't really tell us this more
complex issue therefore the first
statement one plus one is two we should
throw it away too
does that make sense no because these
are descriptive claims that we can like
use other processes to kind of appeal to
to figure out what the answer is but
like descriptive claims are much
different than normative claims sam
harris claims that he can give us
normative answers from from descriptive
claims which is the problem we have with
sam harris ok well then like what do you
define i was like like moral statements
what we do mm-hmm like how's that
distinct from like like for example like
if you want to increase your your like
muscle size or whatever you have to like
bench XYZ huh like how is that distinct
from something like you should not kill
someone um well we can make a moral
clock we can make a normative claim
there and we can make a descriptive
claim there right here's a descriptive
claim resistance training tends to
increase the strength of people that do
it right they practice it now what we
engage in resistance training those are
two totally different types of questions
right we can make a descriptive claim
about what resistance training is and
its impact on the human body but whether
or not it's something we should pursue
is a question that science can never
answer right ok
think understand what you're saying so
you're saying that um I'm just gonna
repeat it back to see if we're on the
same page so you're saying that science
sort of just like gives us a road to
like discovering what is actually
happening whereas it can't really touch
like how do we evaluate values yeah
exactly
okay um the way that I at least think
about that right at least in the context
of Harris's original claim that like you
know everything like if every every
experience being bad is how careful slow
again again be careful with the
definition cuz you're already snuck in
your conclusion like every experience
being bad what do you mean by bad
well like every like if pain was a dial
and being turned up to like max or time
sure buddy even that how you value pain
that's a value statement so for instance
going by your same example resistance
training often involves pain right when
you're trying to you know push your max
and cause muscle whatever it's in order
to grow you know more fibers that that's
a painful process so why should one
pursue that if it causes pain well yeah
that's a good point but I think that on
Harris wouldn't like look at pain so one
dimensionally he would argue something
like there are good types of pain and
bad types yeah but again how do you
value that well how do you decide what's
good and what's bad that's the problem
that's the whole problem right era if
you have an answer I've been curious to
hear it because say it doesn't well I
don't think that I have necessarily an
answer is just this is perhaps just like
an intuition on my part you know that it
isn't really justified which is well
which is the problem then but then that
means that all of Sam's work is
pointless because it is all at the end
of the day just an intuition which he
admitted as much to Peterson but then
the problem is if that's your intuition
and that's gonna be your ultimate
justification then how do you tell the
religious man that he's wrong for his
intuition that God is real because you
essentially the strength of your claim
is the same at that point yeah but at
that point you know what I would sort of
bring up is is probably something
similar to
I don't know if you remember like it's
been while ago where you were sort of
looking into properly basic beliefs
uh-huh
so I think like perhaps a similar idea
happens there to like work that's are
you yeah like I think the similar thing
happens there too because like I think a
certain point if a person were to
seriously consider you know me suffering
for like you know no no personal
gratification is bad like a for person
to like actually consider that premise
would mean for them not to be able to
like function as a human being as we
understand it does that make sense no
way can you say that again so like maybe
let me try to bring up that whole
properly basic belief thing just to make
sure that we're on the same page so the
idea of the process properly basic
belief is that there are certain ideas
that are so basic so intertwining into
our biology that seriously cast them
into doubt is not worthwhile so like an
example that could be something like
causation yes like if yeah so to the
same extent I think that can be said
about things like suffering or pain sure
but like if you want to do that then
then again like then Harris's work is
all meaningless because he could have
just wrote instead of a book he could
have wrote like he could have wrote he
gonna wrote one page and it just says
like hey listen morality is self-evident
because it's just the things we feel and
that's it like he doesn't need to UM I
don't know why do you what do you feel
that cuz I cuz like I personally think
that like if we can if we can all agree
like on a personal level that like to
cast it's about whether or not you know
the worst pain for no reason is bad like
I feel like if we don't have a first
grant that one premise I feel like
morality it becomes like
yeah but the problem is like how do you
define pain what's bad pain and what's
good pain because there's some pain that
we suffer that's good well like I think
it would be like that qualifying freaks
that I use like pain for no good reason
or like we use again so like this is
really hard and I understand that this
is um this is a hard thing but like you
keep your you're presupposing your your
your moral statements by you keep saying
like pain for no good reason or pain for
no bad reason how do we decide what's a
good reason for pain or a bad reason for
pain thank you well I don't mean to drop
you but like I think that problem that
you're witnessing maybe it's just
because you know I'm not good enough in
arguing what what I'm trying to say but
I see a similarity and what you were
seeing and what a Christian would say
about them about like hey how do you
really know that causality is a thing no
I don't agree that morality can be a
properly basic belief in the same way
that like causality can be and if you
want to argue that you can but that's
not some harris's argument this is a
different argument now and also again
like sam harris wouldn't need to waste
so much time writing so many like books
and everything he could just say like oh
well I just assumed that all my moral
[ __ ] is true and [ __ ] off because it's
my a priori assumption you can't touch
that like that would be like his well
even his book would be one page long
right
well yeah but like I think that the main
point isn't saying that morality is a
properly basic belief but only a smaller
point about like what is bad but that is
like when once you've figured that out
that's like a whole like moral system
like to define what is bad or what is
good or what is virtuous is like the
whole point of like conceiving of a
moral system is to define what is
virtuous right like I'm pretty sure Khan
has written like [ __ ] thousands of
pages like what is good like categorical
imperatives when I that's not an easy it
seems I'm sorry I'm not laughing to like
Peter sir I'm sorry like it's it's one
of those things where it seems like kind
of an easy question but like I guess
maybe before like philosophy it's like
these things seem like easy questions
but when you actually think about them
they're actually the hardest questions
right like a question is dumb is like is
anything real or can we know if anything
is real or like what is truth how do we
find that or like what is a virtuous are
good these are questions that seem very
easy but you can literally spend
multiple lifetimes you know writing and
pontificating on these things you know
yeah maybe it's just like I bitterly I
haven't really read into too much
philosophy but it feels to me like a lot
of those endeavors
and this is probably I don't know not
not totally justified or whatever but I
feel like a lot of those questions are
ultimately meaningless in my opinion
like if we don't get back to like the
material conditions you know the lived
life and I think that like we get lost
in and you know what is bad what is good
and such in really abstract ideas I
don't think we'll ever be applied for
real life well you say that but we have
to work from it that's kind of the
problem though is that we have to work
from you say abstract ideas but I'd say
we have to work from fundamental ideas
to get to more abstract ideas I'm using
abstracting kind of the opposite way
that you did here but like so for
instance like you know should like so
here's a question right should we do
more things in society to empower women
to have jobs as engineers right that's a
question that's gonna go all the way
back to like very fundamental or basic
beliefs about how society and people
should function and operate otherwise
you're just kind of like talking about
positions that you can't really trace
back to some origin I mean I agree but
like at least I think that like I think
that if we agree on the first premise of
house I think that everything else could
be worked out well yeah but his premise
of Harris is the most important part of
his work wait but that's the problem you
asked me to just take it for granted but
I mean if I take that for granted that's
literally like everything he talks about
the whole point of the moral landscape
was to establish that he can get a
nought from it is using neurobiology
okay well and then also if we just
assume the first parts that you and I
agree on what's good and bad
well then getting there is just a matter
of intellectual rigor right well
the things that produce the most good
that we agree on and what are the things
that produce the most bad that we agree
on there's not like an exercise of
morality that we just we've already
agreed on everything and now we're just
having an intellectual discussion on
ways to get to our agreed areas if you
don't mind me asking are you like what
would be considered like in moral
anti-realist correct so can you explain
a little bit about like what that would
entail or bet no I don't believe that we
can truly make moral statements I don't
think so I don't believe in anything
supernatural or like anything that
exists outside of the physical realm
right so I'd be a physicalist and then I
don't believe that moral fact are
something that can things that can be
discovered in the natural world so I
don't think we can truly like the
statement like murder is wrong I mean we
can conceive a moral system and then
kind of make statements within that
moral system but I don't think that
moral system actually exists in the
natural world I think it's just kind of
like a human imposed thing on society ok
so then would you use because then what
do you say something like if you were to
say something like more like what do you
say murder is wrong or like no octonaut
murder No so then what what do you say
in respect to murder nothing I don't
make statements it's kind of saying what
would you say like and respect like
trees falling over I mean like it's the
thing that happens I can give you
descriptive facts about it but I can't I
don't believe in normative claims I
guess ok well I mean like because at
least this was my perception of what you
meant for like when you talked about
like your preferences and like yeah I
have desires and I try to fulfill them I
think my position is like egoism or
something mm-hmm so what do you say like
in context of that Equus and that you
know when you say things like I'm an
egoist but I ultimately think that like
I should pay taxes because paying taxes
means that like people get benefits and
when everybody else's is is a you know
hey what's up I'm here finally hey yeah
it only took what six days thought it
would never happen but six days that
they're gonna get pretty good for some
time for me actually so but I talked in
your online chats like three or four
times and everyone said it was never
gonna happen so you know you are you
beat the odds
so hmm yeah so uh thank you for having
me on
um I am a college student and I am
interviewing you for a UH and I say in
my English class okay so you did look at
this like um no I I'm actually a
computer science major but I take
writing like very very seriously it's
something I would absolutely love to
pursue as like a sort of you know like
side thing okay um I'm sitting at 105
percent in class right now it's how try
hard I'm being so Wow
yeah so that's why I was shooting for
the stars with this is because like I
feel like everyone in my class is gonna
be like interviewing like oh this is my
dad this is what he does you know and
stuff like that you have world famous
alright yes a YouTube influencer yeah
alright well here do you know how close
I came to writing about mr. mood and
instead cool okay I keep a hundred five
percent that's not the way to do it so
uh as I said in my like little write-up
that I sent you
I know most of the answers to like let's
sway with the ages of questions six
pages
okay it was five oh yeah so I I know a
lot of the questions too like some of
the simple stuff but this is mostly me
like being thorough and you know I want
to give you a fresh take on it so like
for example uh can you tell us how you
got the name destiny I saw a video the
other day that I don't think you could
even play on switch it was a pretty bad
wait why did I yeah I know my answer
this is pretty tame I was just like a
random word that I picked and I was like
a kid I thought it sounded cool you
talked to how you used to be a neo
Winstar well the first name that I ever
had on line was winged neo star 15 so
winged because I liked Gundam Wing neo
because it sounded like a cool word and
then star because I really liked
astronomy and then 15 because that was
the age of all the Gundam pilots and
Gundam Wing that was my first online
name and then when I started to go
online and like battled Aneta [ __ ] I
needed a smaller name and I think I
don't even know how I just chose destiny
or neo destiny and destiny wasn't
available
yeah okay cuz I just sounded like a cool
word hmm
so uh can you give us a sort of like
condensed you know where you were born
you know who you are what you wanted to
be when you grew up as a child that sort
of thing um well I mean I was born in
Omaha the great state of Nebraska the
great City of Omaha I think and I think
yeah well maybe I was born in like a
suburb it's I know but like yeah but
anyway basically yeah I was born round
here I do that [ __ ] what like I went to
school around here in Catholic school
for 12 years in terms of what I wanted
to be when I grew up I wanted to be all
sorts of stuff I had huge interests and
pretty much everything scientific I was
very interested in so I had like a huge
interest in like biology from video
games I had a huge interest at astronomy
from video games a computer related
stuff with stuff that I was very
interested in well obviously cuz I did a
lot of that growing up so yeah I'm gonna
hit a ton of different interest I don't
know exactly what I wanted to be I'm
sure if you would have asked me every
six months my answer would have changed
but oh yeah I was the same way I totally
get that
so uh we all know that you wound up
going to college for music when did that
sort of an interest first blossom when I
went to high school for some random
reason oh no wasn't for random reason I
watched Cowboy Bebop growing up and
there were songs that I really liked in
cowboy bebop and I was like oh it'd be
cool to like play music I guess and I
started really late I guess for to the
other kids but once I had my freshmen
your high scores like hey like I should
talk to the band teacher like pickin
history and I could play his friend and
then we went through and I played some
B's like oh yeah you can play a tax like
oh cool the cowboy be able to have
saxophone it's like yeah yeah okay
I'm sorry yes I started yeah oh wait no
that's just how I got in music I guess
so I started playing music in high
school and then music evolved as a way
that I can kind of like emotional
express myself which is something I have
a hard time doing otherwise so I just
started once I got out of high school I
wanted to pursue in college because it
was like one of my big big big passions
right okay um so you are Steven Bunnell
ii correct and is that yeah besa means
that you're not a junior so have you
ever spoken about who you're named after
my dad
mmm really right why are you a second
Lana not a junior um he didn't want to
be referred to as Steven but I'll senior
I got it okay I said that simple yep
I think he thought it made him sound old
or something but yeah mmm yeah okay that
makes sense so you've also spoken about
working at a casino and things like that
did you have any jobs other than that or
was that your first job and right after
that it was industry my first job was
working Hedda McDonald's and then I
started to move up in positions at
McDonald's - a [ __ ] what do they call
them does anybody work in I think it'll
help team leads so I was like trying to
get to a position where I could be a
like eventually like a shift leader and
then a supervisor I think was the next
step I think maybe when team lead to
supervisors I think but um well I was
Ricky McDonald's I had a really bad
experience with the customer but I'm
like a super chill dude and I handled it
in a super chill way because I'm like
it's very very hard to get me upset
I guess I'm lesson playing League of
Legends or debating people right like
every and the real world in real life
it's very hard to get me upset I'm an
incredibly patient person I'm so [ __ ]
patient you have no idea if you see me
talk to certain people like people
should have this understand I'm a pretty
brazen prison but anyway after dentists
customer the next person in line
happened to be a supervisor at that
casino and she was like hey like you
were really chill like you should you
know come work and I'll give you a good
recommendation that's like oh well
that's pretty sick so sure and then I
applied for the casino and then she gave
me a recommendation and then I started
working there for the next I think three
or four years and then after I was done
at that job I got a job cleaning carpets
and because I was always next for me I
guess yeah and then I did that for about
a year and then I got into streaming
mm-hmm so uh as you spoke to a little
bit you tend to portray yourself as like
you know pretty combative and abrasive
on stream is there a reason why you
chose that sort of persona or did it
just kind of come naturally to you I've
always been like a very I don't know if
these are like real things in psychology
but like is it type-a personality mm-hmm
thank ya that mean anything to you and I
say that or no oh yeah yeah oh yeah I've
always had like a pretty aggressive
personality I think it's I don't know
why it's just kind of always the way
from an early
that I've been mmm yeah so okay I get
any bit of research not SuperDuper deep
but uh I'll go into some of those
questions
so you actually spoke about this
recently and this was something I
remembered and wanted to ask you about
you sit at a pretty interesting point as
a streamer where others saw you know
sort of like explosive and instinct
growth your growth has been pretty
steady over time more interesting than
that though to me is despite having you
know like 1/4 the audience in some cases
of some of the more popular streamers
you tend to make as much if not more
than some of them why do you think that
is I mean there's a lot of reasons for
that my I would say that my fan base is
like very loyal to me um you know like
they watch me pretty much no matter what
I do I think a lot of people kind of
personally identify with me for a lot of
different reasons so I mean obviously if
assuming all of what I've just said is
true your conversion is gonna be high
around different types of like
monetizable products right whether it's
obscure merchandise and stuff like that
right so uh you went to a private
religious school how deep have you
talked about that on stream I'm gonna
have to mention it a few times I'm yeah
I'm not sure if there's other parts of
the experience that are like haven't
talked about anything else talking about
most things but what about is it is
something that when I like looked up
like I couldn't find very much
information about it so you know you
consider yourself an atheist correct
very much yeah yeah I've seen like kind
of throw around being a agnostic but
yeah and you definitely alright I mean I
guess yeah I would say gonna be an
agnostic yeah yes if somebody were to
provide me like evidence of the
existence of God obviously I would be
competing to listen to it so I'm sure
it's right I can be an agnostic shame um
so was this a discovery that happened
like while you were at that school or
was it just something that's happened
over time I wouldn't say so much is a
discovery so much is just kind of like
personal growth like anybody I think
that's kind of honest with themselves
well mm oh hold on I'll set it up yeah
but I feel like anybody that uh-huh
that's kind of mean to say but anybody
that does enough like personal growth
will eventually abandon at the very
least organized religion but right yeah
it's kind of malice a bit yeah I mean I
think I'd probably agree with you so I
get where you're coming from okay so uh
Kyle he's one of your longtime friends
did you meet him at this school or was
it before that no we met at a well we
met in grade school oh yeah hmm and he
introduced you to Starcraft correct Kyle
and Frank did yeah yeah so how was your
relationship with them like growing up
where they like your best buddies or
were they just kind of like around and
got you into things
um at school Kyle was probably my
closest friend I think
and then um yeah and then and then
outside of school Chris was my closest
friend you lived behind me for a few
years so in terms of getting into things
I mean Kyle and Frank with once it
really got me to Starcraft and then I
kind of like took over my interests from
there I don't think other people
introduced me into stuff as much I kind
of like just I kind of like did my own
thing on the internet right right so uh
you've mentioned doing debate back at
when you're in school is that correct
no no so well let me yeah I like I dated
people but I never did like formal
debate but okay yeah yeah that was
unclear to me yeah I saw you mentioning
that you did it but I wasn't sure if
like your own like the debate team or
whatever you know no and in recent times
you've brought up wanting to be more
persuasive
do you think that because your time at
private school or at like rather your
because of your time debating people at
school that's what led to you focusing
on logic rather than emotion or was it
sort of like oh is this more of a
response to like modern debates I'm not
sure um hold on I'm sorry uh one second
one second oh okay yeah okay go for it
I'm here 100% no okay okay um what was
the last question you just asked me yeah
so I asked you about doing debate back
at school and you said you did but not
like as part of like a debate team or
anything
and then I asked do you think it's
because of your time like expressing
like your interest in debate at private
school that caused you to develop your
focus on logic rather than emotion
maybe so this is kind of like the path
that had that happened to me in high
school I don't have like an interest per
se in like debate it's not like like
like I want to be like a tomato or
whatever or like oh I really like the
art style that is the debate like the
blah blah blah right it's more just like
in school I started to become an atheist
as I kind of became a religious right
eyes as I lost my Christianity I kind of
became religious and one way that I kind
of because I had kind of like um I hate
using type-a I feel like I'm like you
know memes psyche or whatever here but
like because I had like such an
aggressive kind of personality um I kind
of had this feeling that um in order for
me to like really know which ideas are
the best I just want to like [ __ ]
debate them like I want it I want to my
goal is like I should be able to go to a
person and I should be able to like talk
to that person and if we're somewhat
reasonable we should come to an
agreement on things and that I want to
talk to as many people as possible and
then if I can if nobody can like put up
a good argument against what I'm saying
then I must be right so it's kind of
like I just have this idea that like I'm
gonna make sure that my ideas are
correct by constantly disagreeing with
everybody around me and then if nobody's
capable of like mounting what I consider
to be an effective kind of like attack
or defense against a certain idea I have
then that idea must be true and so
that's kind of where like my my debating
or whatever that kind of mentality is
what produced this idea that like I want
to have arguments with people all the
time yeah basically is a way of
verifying my own internal thoughts yeah
so do you find yourself then opting to
challenge your like positions more as
opposed to like just playing devil's
advocate with yourself I like
challenging my positions with other
people like yeah my um basically the way
that I view it is like if I go to like a
Kiwi farms thread or a 4chan thread and
everybody and there was just calling me
like a pedophile or some [ __ ] my
arguments are all very very very public
like if they had something good to say
they would be saying it in those threads
they'd be laughing on my misuse of data
they but instead they don't so I feel
good about that so yeah I like my idea
my way of like seeing if my ideas are
good basically
be able to insert myself into a
community of people that hate me and
once all of the arguments have devolved
into ad Homs or something then I can be
reasonably complimented that you know
I'm obviously yeah my [ __ ] is good
because nobody or anything of substance
to say to me yeah that's fair yeah so
you kind of got to the point where you
think that people resort to those sorts
of attacks because they just can't
attack you your actual argument itself
right correct yeah okay um let's see uh
so yeah okay that's interesting to me
because I thought for sure I liked
debate with something you explored like
all throughout your schooling so it's
interesting to find out that it was just
kind of like yeah it was like let's
argue a lot and because I feel like I
should be right and we'll see if you
change my mind
yeah yeah okay so uh so yeah moving on
to a college you went to school for
music but wound up dropping out so uh
why did you wind up dropping out I was
working away too much I was working like
60 hours a week at a casino and I was
working graveyard shift so between that
school and being married I didn't have
time for anything okay and then uh did
you have any because I always thought
that you had a major for like why I
don't know how music degree majors work
but um I assumed it was for like a very
specific instrument or something yeah
well I think my major was called
woodwind performance so my major would
have been in playing saxophone and then
I would have wanted to be a with a minor
in composition whatever my goal okay and
then uh so yeah so what you would have
wound up just like what joining um
what's the word an orchestra or
something with your degree I wanted to
do music on my own it's like a side
thing I didn't want to be like part like
an orchestra or some [ __ ] okay so a real
quick case there's a stickler -
saxophone sound an orchestra also I
would be like as part of a woman's
always something in case oh yeah yeah I
don't much for boat yeah that's my music
so yeah just in case some stickler calls
me okay
sorry good yeah so uh are your parents
still visiting or yeah no they're gone
yeah so you've spoken about you know
debating with your mom like all the time
and very very rarely you mentioned that
you have siblings but um I feel like
I've never heard you talk about them in
depth why is that um I don't know I'm
very well
they all look pretty far away hmm so
then you would say like your
relationship with a siblings is pretty
weak or very very weak yeah for sure
okay so this is something you you've
cleared the air out pretty well on but I
I felt like you know this was worth
bringing up again you know it might make
its way into that say you've spoken out
about one of your friends committing
suicide in the past he's someone who
came to you and the advice you gave him
was something that people find pretty
controversial do you ever regret what
you saw do you think the advice I gave
him was um well you said that like you
didn't outright say like you know good
don't do it you know like you kind of
gave them an on defense like look it's
your life it's your decision that sort
of let me be very clear about this
because this should think it's memed
into [ __ ] eternity so let me give you
like very clear on this so initially
when he contacted me and he said that he
felt like he wanted to kill himself I
said it was the dumbest thing in the
world and they absolutely shouldn't all
of the conversations that we had
revolved around me giving him reasons
why he shouldn't kill himself that I
thought he was a really intelligent dude
that even though he was kind of like
[ __ ] his life up well he wasn't
[ __ ] psycho but his big problem was
that um he had basically been hit for
dealing weed he's sold to an auto cover
and he had nothing in his life he didn't
like go to school he stole of his mom he
couldn't drive a car whatever but I told
him that like despite that like he could
figure [ __ ] out I would help him with
the fine or whatever and that you know
like he's not like he shouldn't kill
himself like this times he should the
when now I phrased this in different
ways and videos spending on how deep I
want to get into it but like because I
know like I think in one video I might
have said something along the lines like
well I mean if you want to do it like go
for it but that wasn't my conversation
with him you know right I could have a
log of the text but it's not like a mess
where he's like you know dude like I
feel like I wanna come so I'm like lol
[ __ ] do it dude like that wasn't that
caught that wasn't the conversation but
the the internal struggle and something
what are you doing in my discord
polluting my population in my community
i'm so sorry destiny it will it won't
happen again
please just just let me go my capo my
overlord
all right what's up what do you want
i i have absolutely no idea uh one of
your dudurinos uh talked to me about a
certain report that was released about
two days ago
oh the one yeah what about it uh yeah
and it seems like you wanted to talk
about it
[ __ ] who can you tell me who this was so
i can permanently ban him for my discord
[ __ ] dude give me the name give me the
name
i thought you were in here because i
thought you wanted to talk about me
people do this dumb [ __ ] with like they
go to someone else and go like oh jesse
really wants to talk to you and then
they can be like oh that dude really
wants to talk to you
and i'm like oh okay well and then we
get here like oh what do you want to
talk about then neither person has any
idea like what
i'm i'm sorry um i mind like
come on don't put me in the spot like
this i can't like [ __ ] over someone you
know
come on was it derry d-a-r-y it was that
guy wasn't it
i i can neither confirmed it was
definitely that guy i know it was
okay what about it what do you think
about it did you read it i didn't read
it yet
yeah i actually finished reading it let
me just uh switch the volume down a
little bit give me one second
yeah so i finished reading it uh about
20 hours ago give or take um i was
incredibly disappointed
uh it's a fairly boring uh piece of
media
it's not even like a proper study it's a
research report essentially financed by
a
think tank uh done by a single
researcher
and the quality of it is like
exceptionally low and i was saying that
as
one of those evil political commentators
um i actually mean that um
the level of citations is incredibly low
she are the researcher
miss lewis doesn't really have a
theoretical framework in which she's
operating and she's just sort of
spitballing as she goes saying that hey
there's this network of people uh they
stream together i'm gonna make this
super arbitrary
definition of what constitutes this
network or not and
something something this radicalizes
people um
yeah it's it's boring it's uh
disappointing
and people shouldn't actually pay any
attention to it in my opinion
hmm interesting
like i saw a lot of the usual suspects
already kicking up like a big fuss about
it oh i saw i think it was paul joseph
watson
um already starting at twitter friends
about how this
is a centralized attempt at destroying
free speech on youtube something like
that
um if it if it is it's an exceptionally
poor one
like this really reeks of a sort of just
as i'm an amateur as a quick aside
before we dig into this nothing makes me
want to kill myself
more than conservative shits complaining
about freedom of speech
when it comes to like social media
platforms you realize how insanely
hypocritical that is right
um or i don't really deal with this
issue
enlighten me so in the united states um
freedom of speech is extended to
corporations as well right and if you're
a corporation you're not compelled to
host any sort of
like speech on your platform because the
government isn't going to make you do it
so the idea that you would be the idea
you would talk about freedom of speech
insofar as like twitter or facebook goes
it's just very strange to me because if
you want to compel them at least by the
government to not ban people off of your
platform
um i mean that's kind of a violation of
freedom of speech in and of itself
and then if you're gonna make some
argument that like it just seems weird
because anytime people have ever
complained in the past about
corporations say
polluting the environment or [ __ ]
over workers or engaging in horrible
business practices
conservatives will always say oh well
the free market will you know dictate
that somebody else will come up oh the
free market will provide a solution oh
what's wrong health care is [ __ ] well
a free market doctor will come along and
do this circuit half the cost even
though these things don't really happen
as easily as people would like them to
so it's kind of funny now that they're
getting [ __ ] over by the free market
by corporations that are too big to fail
or whatever
now all of a sudden they're crying and
screeching and ringing that some
businesses might be a little bit too
large
for the overall health of the uh i don't
know the economy or society in general
actually something really bothers me
one of the sort of common arguments you
will then hear is that
our google or twitter youtube is so big
that they stop being a private entity
and become a sort of
a network provider and sort of are a
semi-public
thingy because there is only youtube to
watch videos there's only twitter to
tweet
and therefore they have a duty to uphold
freedom of speech something like that
yeah this isn't an argument that an
intelligent person could make but if
you're a conservative you've completely
forfeit that argument because you
totally have rejected that every single
time that in the united states i'll say
not not
maybe maybe in other western countries
or not but in the u.s
conservatives constantly balk at that
idea of something is too big or
something is too monopolized or blah
blah blah blah blah
and they'll always counter with this
absurd notion this very naive
notion of like well you know a free
business will come up and will take over
if that's actually true you know if
these people are bad and they've got a
monopoly you know
um what's the thing a kid a kid in a
garage can put microsoft out of business
if he's got a good idea
right that's what conservatives always
say so so to pull the
to pull the idea out now that like well
maybe some things are actually so huge
and so like embedded in society
and even in government to some extent
that maybe we do need to bring in a
little bit of regulation here
as a conservative you've already
rejected that argument so many times in
the past i think it looks really bad to
don that hat now
you you genuinely do hate conservatives
don't you
very much so like i'm like i've moved
full on to like the political violence
level or the real violence level
when it comes to conservative people
yeah i think they need to be like excise
for my [ __ ] country
i think they are demonstrably [ __ ]
evil people by any moral system that
most people would use and then i just
hate them because they tend to destroy
the outcomes related to this country
which is what i'm concerned with yeah
absolutely uh yeah there's a topic i'm
not
yet sort of ready to touch uh you know
i'm not prepared for this topic
um but but suffice to say i'm not
opposed to uh
quote violence to be quite honest not in
not
only in this context but like generally
speaking um uh
some people are just very sort of
detrimental oh yeah but
yeah so uh we want to talk about the
report yeah sorry i kind of [ __ ]
um no problem can i start um
i'm just going to kind of like uh where
do i start do i need the introduction
here
uh from you for the report from the
report [ __ ] okay let me just start
let me just start going through this
okay are you ready okay let's see um
okay
for a short time on january 4th 2018 the
most popular livestream video on youtube
was a broadcast dominated by white
nationalists
more specifically it was a stream by
youtubers andy warski and jean velvet
facilitating a debate between a white
nationalist and a libertarian the debate
topic was scientific racism which they
refer to as a race realism a
contemporary incarnation of the
long-standing claims that there are
measurable scientific differences
between race of humans
argue in favor of scientific race and
was infamous white nationalist ritual
spencer known for having popularized the
term alt-right
ostensibly on the other side was carl
benjamin a youtuber who goes by the
student of sargon of akkad
during the broadcast the debate became
the number one trending live video
worldwide on youtube with over 10 000
active viewers the archive version of
the record has been viewed on additional
475 thousand times
four participants carried out their
debate via google hangouts the video
lasted more than four and a half hours
they would join it various times for
other youtubers
during the broadcast participants made
it arranged positions popular in white
supremacy communities using academic
terminology and treating the topics as
theoretical discourse
they discussed for example whether the
monogamy was a development of western
culture and whether their biological
qualities that constitute whiteness
spencer has had
years of experience arguing as racial
theories and spoke with more confidence
than benjamin in the live comments and
through subsequent reactions on social
media many audience members responded
positively to spencer's performance i've
never really listened as much to speak
before i said one user with the
pseudonym
nashville but it is immediately apparent
that he's on a whole different level
more broadly commenters praised the
debate and expressed excitement about
its popularity half a million views in
only three weeks i honestly think this
is a sign that people are hungry for
what's good for humanity
one commenter wrote they followed it up
by stating ethnic nationalism is freedom
for everybody
this date is part of a larger phenomenon
in which youtubers attempt to reach
young audiences by broadcasting far
right ideas in the form of news and
entertainment
an assortment of scholars media pundits
and internet celebrities are using
youtube to promote a range of political
positions for mainstream versions of
libertarianism and conservatism all the
way over to white nationalism
all the way all the way to overweight
nationalism while many of they've used
very significantly they all share a
fundamental contempt for progressive
politics
specifically for contemporary social
justice movements for this reason i
consider their collective position
reactionary as it is defined by its
opposition to visions
of social progress uh united in the
standpoint of these youtubers frequently
collaborate with and appear with others
across ideological lines
together they have created a fully
functioning media system that i call the
alternative influence network
um okay i'll stop kind of like page to
page is there anything in here that you
like disagree with so far or
well there's actually uh two things um
that are i think
sort of interesting to talk about sure
um the first one is
the entire framing of this uh research
paper of this report
um uh the researcher is very specific
about uh
already trying to paint this picture um
it's bad
that sargon of akkad someone that's not
sort of educated in the question of race
realism
had a race realist or a racist on his
googling thingy
because this gives the alt-right
platform this lets the
alt-right win um the problem here is
that
sure you can't expect hardcore citations
directly in the introduction
but it would be nice if she was already
giving us a sort of framework
uh um i'm following a agenda sitting at
a framing narrative unfolding a priming
narrative some sort of theoretical
framework because
uh all she did so far in the interaction
is say hey there was this one stream
i did not like that stream um and i have
a few comments
few just free i think it's three or two
comments something like that
to sort of bolster my narrative that is
a somewhat
weak start off to a report because it
doesn't actually
uh suggest any sort of empirical
findings okay sure
um i would agree that the empirical
findings thus far are pretty weak the
only real numbers we've been given are
the amount of views on a youtube video
and a couple of comments which aren't
necessarily representative
um but i will take issue with a couple
things you said here
so um i think that her claim that it's
bad that sargon mccod had a race real
estate on his google hangout
stems more from the fact that he seemed
ill-equipped to debate that point
and i think that her supporting
arguments here were the ideas
[Music]
spencer has had years of debating
spencer's had years of experience
arguing his racial theories and spoke
with more confidence than benjamin in
the live comments and through subsequent
reactions to social media
many audience members responded
positively to spencer's performance um
this word
many is a little weasely maybe if there
would have been some sort of polling or
something it would have been better
maybe it would actually be better to
refer to the um
let's see spencer versus sargon youtube
video maybe it would actually be better
although it's still kind of uh to refer
to the likes the thumbs up and the
thumbs down on the video
because i see that the video is thumbs
down one point six thousand times and
thumbs up seventeen thousand times
so maybe um appealing to something like
this and the top rated comments might be
a little bit more data driven
so like this top comment here uh past
sticks and hammer who's an e celebrity
right this top comment here oh my god i
rewatched this sargon it's just
embarrassing himself and making himself
look like a coward
a shill or just a [ __ ] not sure which
um styx and richard are like two phds
having a debate in a college bar and
sargon is a local drunk chick who didn't
finish high school
i think that reading these comments and
going by the fact that they have the
most thumbs up on a video that's
overwhelmingly like
i think would strengthen her argument
here do you agree or disagree
okay i fully agree uh i i do think that
it would be better
but uh arguably the best way to do this
would be to actually do a content
analysis of the comments that are done
under the video uh because
uh even looking at the top video top
comments right is definitely better than
looking at just
some comments it's not the ideal that
you should strive for if you're making
a sort of if you're trying at least to
form this seminal work that's
breaching the the hidden layer of the
intellectual dark web
if you catch my drift sure um
i think that digging into more data is
good i'm not sure if going by analyzing
every comment is
the best i think that thumbs up is
probably better um for a variety of
reasons i would have to get really heavy
into the data to really understand this
and i could be wrong but like here's
like a possible hypothesis that could
throw this off right
perhaps people that disagreed with
spencer are more motivated to leave a
comment but people that agreed with
spencer are more motivated to thumbs up
a comment right
things like that could throw off our
analysis maybe we analyze 20 000
comments 18 000 of them are [ __ ] on
spencer
but the 2000 they get upvoted or all of
the other people that agree with him
that come on right
so but i do agree that the data could be
a little bit heavier here um i'm willing
to be a little bit charitable just
because we're kind of like establishing
our framework and we're not really
digging into the meat of the article yet
so she's just kind of like setting up
her
you know i guess her thesis or whatever
in the beginning so i'm willing to go a
little bit light but i can understand
kind of the irritation of this being
pretty light on the data or the
empiricism or whatever
sure um okay um
cool all right i'm gonna read the
studying for the next page
um the content creators and the ain
claim to provide an alternative media
source for viewers to obtain news and
political commentary outside of legacy
news outlets such as cable channels and
print media
with this positioning they're
capitalizing on a changing news and
information environment youtube has
become a crucial site for broadcasting
political news related content
the 2018 pew research center report
found that 73 of us adults visit youtube
but the percentage rising to 94
for the 18 to 24 year old demographic as
of 2017 youtube fell behind only
facebook as the social network most
popular for viewing news stories
simultaneously trust in mainstream media
outlets is continually in decline with
only 32 percent of americans claiming to
trust the media in a 2016 gallup poll
the ain also relies on youtube's ability
to support a type of micro celebrity
that is niche celebrities who are well
known within specific communities the
platform's motto broadcast herself
encourages individuals build audiences
and promote themselves outside of the
yeah I'm gonna meet you yeah thank you
hear me yeah what's up buddy yeah not
much all right
that's going with you pretty good do you
want to start things off with the main
thing I want to talk about cuz you seem
like yeah knock yourself out dude okay
so basically the main the main thing I
wanted to talk about was abortion
followed by I have a few other things
just I kinda want to discuss kind of
like I'm not like super seriously what
do you uh what do you wanna start with
um [ __ ] we can do abortion real quick
cuz this one is like really I've done
this a million times
okay but so I want to argue it on two
fronts so you got the scientific front
and you got the philosophical front what
do you wanna start with there whichever
with a scientific one okay so first I
know we have to go through this what do
you how do we define us as human so from
a scientific point of view we can look
at consciousness being alive the the
human form the ability to think and feel
right I mean I that my definition of
human is your genetics that's what I
define it as but like the question this
question of what do we define as human
this is like a this is a moral integer
not a scientific one or philosophical
question is right but we can use science
sure science can inform our answer okay
so okay so consciousness so first of all
research shows that conscious
consciousness doesn't occur in fetuses
for about 24 to - until about 24 to 28
weeks through right okay and then the
ability to feel pain is also something
that isn't right off the bat okay and
the ability to interact with one's
environment is you can also like argue
that fetuses don't interact with their
environment until they exit the womb
right okay so there's a few things that
define us as human what else from a self
philosophical point of view is a name
right
usually we as humans have names yeah I
reject this but go ahead okay no why
because I don't think I'm having a name
has any bearing on whether or not you
should get more consideration in society
no but as a human we usually like
interact with humans with the names
right okay okay so there's some things
that that we build like ourselves to be
as human like what what I don't
understand because what you're trying to
say is we can't abort fetuses because
they're humans and they have the rights
like everyone else right well from an
ethical point of view yeah but
pragmatically I would never be in favor
of banning abortion but go ahead no I
know I really respect that okay but from
from a different like so your only
reason is that you think fetuses are
human yeah it's the best definition I
can come up with yeah so would you say
that stems from your like past is there
like someone who's been in religion no
it's just I'm searching for the most
consistent definition of what is human
and like formation but there's no
definition of human that's thing well of
course
so my destination is the moment of
conception that's what I choose because
it's kind of arbitrary but it seems to
be the best the one that makes me feel
the best I guess
so you'd argue like the embryo is I go
yeah the literal second the ovum that
semen come together or whatever you see
that's that's the problem where like you
can't really argue against that but I do
want to try to argue against some kind
of Moore's like strong definition of
human why I feel like my definition is
strongest that's why I like it if you've
got a better definition then all you
like it because that's the I mean yeah
sure you can like that but I mean most
people wouldn't classify that as most
people wouldn't classify that as like
the strong because as a strong
definition of a human it's just as just
an embryo okay yeah what's your
definition then so my definition is
generally some who's alive or someone
who has someone whose consciousness oh
yeah okay one thing at a time so someone
who's alive what do mean by that No
okay what I mean is like your cells are
active and moving okay well that I mean
as I go counts as that so you've got a
definition right yeah no no I'm going
through piece by piece okay yeah okay so
so consciousness or then consciousness
okay so consciousness is something that
you think and then makes us human is
there a reason why um because we can't
really function as humans without
consciousness well I was hope that's
what difference she's differentiates us
from just sure okay
just curious if somebody is say like
knocked into a coma or whatever do you
would you consider that person still
human even though they've kind of like
temporarily been like rendered
temporarily but if it's a permanent
thing that could be that could be
debated
so if somebody is um if somebody is in a
coma for like two or three years right
and then wakes up was that person
inhuman during the time they were in a
coma no no not really because they have
to blanch ill to wake up and become
human again or they right exactly so how
is that different from the fetus in
terms of experience in consciousness
when a fetus will eventually grow to be
conscious because they never they never
like there's a starting point for
someone in a coma right uh-huh
they were defined as a human they go
into carne there you go into a coma and
they come out and they didn't lose the
ability the existence of human being a
human during that point but but a fetus
never has that from the start this is
something like this is not like this is
a philosophical sure yeah I understand I
guess I'm just I'm not really
comfortable that but okay okay that's
fine
what are you worried about like a human
form like I'm talking very generally a
human form what does human form in not
not like an animal I it's it's just very
hands are a type of animal what does
that mean right but not like you were
not like a dog like just you know we
have were bipedal for the most part and
two arms ahead like two gorillas count
as like human form or um someone they're
very close to us but they're not human
because they don't possess some of the
other things that right okay you don't
have you don't have to completely agree
that's for sure the ability to think or
the ability to feel like pain or emotion
something like that these just seem like
dumb ways to define like I feel like I
don't feel like I'm a human because I I
don't know because I like to feel pain
that like makes me human but what about
the ability to think as well um I mean I
don't feel like you can think much
before you're like 2 years old what
anybody think I guess I mean think means
you can process like more complex like
people before 2 years old can process
like visual stimuli and like physical
stimuli all these kinds of things yeah
but I mean fetuses can as well they hear
things in the womb right goodbye sir
yeah but there's no evidence that they
really process that well of course there
is there is evidence I think um I'm
sorry yeah hold on sorry so like I'm
pretty sure that like you can listen to
different things in the womb that will
elicit certain responses isn't there um
I feel like I might be making this up I
would have to look it up
I can't forget who says identify voices
in the womb I feel like there's like
empirical data that shows that as well
but I know that they responded which is
because okay so if if I make take a
break from the definition of human for a
moment uh-huh I do want to kind of take
this from the point of so you took a
stance when you're debating incest that
is a morally neutral action right um
generally uh like you mean like in
certain scenario and certain cases for
example yeah well then incest yourself
is morally neutral right males who
didn't have a power dynamic like that as
long as you're not committing any other
thing that would be morally bad like for
instance like petty or something yeah I
agree so I want to take the the debate
of abortion from a morally neutral point
of view rather than going straight to a
morally negative or the offensive view
okay and so yeah and the the reason is
and the reason and like what I can go
into is I can find specifics where I
would argue strongly that it's a morally
a neutral like action to [ __ ] a fetus
for example if you board a fetus within
the first twelve to fourteen weeks I
think most of the data points do them
like not not really processing much
which means I can say that that's a
morally neutral point like morally
morally neutral action okay well yeah of
course I mean that's based on your
definition of who you can abort right
yeah what should we consider a human
rather right um sure well like for
example in the first 12 to 14 weeks they
don't feel pain for the most part like
studies show I don't disagree that yeah
but I don't necessarily value that is
like a human trait or something but they
don't even kick they don't interact with
their environment sure they they're very
they're not really in the human form yet
okay here listen okay so let's skip all
this okay so I am in I think I'm an
egoist of some form or whatever in terms
of like how I derive my moral systems or
a lack of moral systems whatever
basically my worry is okay I exist as a
person and I wouldn't want something to
happen that would make me not exist as a
person like I basically want to ensure
that I have created a society and some
in some way that kind of like ensures
that I am as safe as possible so the
idea that somebody could have ended my
life prematurely is something that I'm
not necessarily okay with so in order to
bring me on board with the abortion is
okay ma'am I feel like that's the
argument and I might I don't I'm not
even super strongly attached to
current abortion argument I got a
problem I might change that in the
future as well but like that's just
that's basically where I come from so
when you talk to me about these things
like what can you feel pain bla bla bla
bla bla I don't generally care about
that what I'm more concerned is the fact
that like okay [ __ ] I could have been
killed at like 15 weeks and [ __ ] nothing
would have like protected me like that's
pretty shitty like and I and I don't
want to expose myself to a situation
like that in the future due to like some
sort of rational inconsistency so for a
seizure so let's say for instance I come
to the conclusion that um okay well some
people some people are okay to kill or
murder right so murdering as in killing
somebody without provocation but some
people are okay to murder in certain
scenarios that's something that I'm
generally very uncomfortable with
because if I've made that concession
logically then maybe I hit a point in
the future let's say by the time you hit
65 years old somebody says well all the
empirical data points it at this point
you're a net drain on society it would
actually be better to kill you and we
could just transfer your wealth to your
children slippery slope argument yeah do
some accenture and i would say well hold
on wait wait whoa just because you can
kill me no a benefit to society I don't
to be [ __ ] killed like [ __ ] that and
then it's like well okay but you kind of
made the same argument for abortion how
can you defend yourself now and you
might still be able to but that's kind
of the thing I worried about here but no
I see what you're coming from but like I
guess from where our from where I'm
coming from is that I think that that
doesn't really apply if you don't start
off as being you because when you're
talking about people they're they're
human for their to our lives until maybe
some some rules to note that they don't
become human Eboni anymore after 65 was
your example sure but I don't really see
fetus isn't the same like I don't think
that's really equivalent because they
don't start off as human yeah that's not
the problem is that like the detection
of human is somewhat arbitrary and to
try to figure out what a concrete
definition is very [ __ ] hard and I
have a really good one that I like more
than well your genetics right which is
what I don't like taking a like a
certain standard like exact stance on
anything because there's obviously
exceptions anywhere right mm-hmm so I
probably am I probably be on board too
not like not from a legal point because
I think you should be able to get an
abortion whenever but from a morally
point of view I think it makes sense to
say that it's murder after say the
second trimester because a lot of things
are developed
yeah sure and then the way that I kind
of challenged your point and maybe this
isn't rational maybe I'm doing this one
an emotional level but like if you give
me some
definition by which you've become human
at this point that means that like five
seconds prior to that you weren't human
and I'm I guess that's a very hard thing
for me to like cognitively embrace being
like what like what point like in a like
from one so like let's say you're like
well it's let's say it's like being
conscious in the womb or whatever like
that's when you become human it's like
okay five seconds prior to that I was
not human and then I just became human
because I became conscious like yeah I'm
not called that
that's kind of like at what point does
like a like like collection of things
become a pile I can say you have a grain
of rice you keep adding greens and what
number what count does it become like a
pile over a pile of rice right well not
necessarily because I think that because
earlier you referenced a kind of
something when you were talking about
like shape or form of a human I would
argue that we become a distinct thing
you know you're not a collection or a
pile that the moment of conception is
the creation of you is a distinct
separate physical entity that that is a
separate defining like concise moment
right I guess I I see we're coming from
otherwise everything is like this very
weird like Loki's wagered kind of thing
where I don't know where one thing
starts and one thing ends and it's like
very rock and hard to find yeah III
think like you said you'd like to make
dad different arguments and I think that
you can't really can't we can't make a
data we can't make a data-driven
argument here when cuz this is a 100
percent philosophical argument is when
do you become a human there's a
philosophical but it can be influenced
by science well it's kind of the other
way around that our philosophy would
influence how we would use the science
to influence how we would write so like
for instance let's say for instance we
were to say okay I think that when we
experience pain that's what makes us
human well okay you can think that so
now you've used philosophy to get a
value for some scientific thing and now
we can use science to investigate that
thing but the only reason we're using a
scientific tool to investigate that
thing is because we decided to value it
initially right so it's essentially a
philosophical claim even if we're using
science to investigate it does that make
sense okay so um I know I can't really
argue if you're like hard stuck on the
conception because like you said it's a
philosophical debate yeah I agree
and it's super subjective which I guess
I always come out here expecting maybe
you'd not like [ __ ] like I don't
you have your you have your opinion
because as long as you agree that should
be legally available I don't care to try
to change yeah for sure and I think
mainly I just I wanted to come on
because I've never debated before and I
wanted to try it out and I thought that
was something I disagreed with so maybe
I maybe I tried but if you're stuck on
it
I've got like obviously you know the
science and whatnot but if your heart
stuck there's no real like beyond
philosophical disagreement that we can
get further on this sure well hey I love
you I appreciate the conversation buddy
you can do one more thing pick one more
important thing on your list go for it
do you agree with probably yeah I think
so yeah okay what about generally okay I
just wanted to ask you like what do you
think about political discourse on
YouTube it's [ __ ] cancerous as [ __ ] so
like why do you think the the left has
so like why do you think the left has
such less like I'd say that the left has
a lot less viewership than the right a
lot of aspects yeah my the general
argument it goeth and I'm sure it's
probably it's probably a variety of
issues but I think the hardest thing is
that for left-leaning arguments you
typically have to be more educated to
understand them and right-leaning
arguments feel very good they're very
intuitive they're very emotionally
driven and left-leaning ones involved
like there's just so much fact and [ __ ]
there's so much homework that you've got
to do in order to embrace a position
like that
oh yeah totally like I mean because a
lot of the right seems to be like like
[ __ ] sjw's or whatnot right
and yeah that well that unlike their
positions are generally like very
emotional ones for instance like how do
you become successful like work [ __ ]
hard okay well that's a feel-good
argument and I see people do that and I
can like intuitively believe that so
that sounds better than well let's talk
about you know the structure of society
and the unearned advantages and
disadvantage to the groups of people
like that's a much more complicated
argument you know yeah there's a lot of
youtubers that like on the right are
surround the left like for example H
bomber guy counterpoints yeah potholer
isn't political youtuber but he's like
he likes to like debate like anty anty
climate change kind of guys and
generally sorry way yeah
like he tried to debate Crowder but
Crowder backed out because he's a
[ __ ] idiot yeah but yeah I'd say that
it seems like you need to have a little
more patience which seems like people in
society you don't really have patience
for like thought and yeah at least for
the intent for the United States a lot
of it just comes down to intelligence
and a lot of like surveys and
Republicans are like yeah and pretty
sure like I've got like people email me
studies and [ __ ] that like social social
conservatives it's like you can predict
it or predict like lower IQs and one
other than general people as well so I
mean it kind of makes sense it's like if
you're an idiot you're more willing to
embrace like certain positions that have
no empirical basis whatsoever I don't
know how many other people have done but
I've actually kind of like fallen into
the trap like when I was like a few
years ago I got to listening to like
Peterson all these other guys just
because it was the anti hgw thing and
you know from a from a surface point it
makes like it's logical right these
things are these people are saying stuff
that is not is either just ridiculous
or it's stuff that's not nuanced at all
yeah and then they're responding with
something that you feels logical and you
feel good about being sighted with yeah
but then if you look at them from any
more point of view than just like the
how is Trump cheating on his wife
relevant to anything who the [ __ ] cares
about it who cares about it I personally
liked how you reduced interpreters to
email leaks into a straw man about pizza
gate when there was so much more dirt in
them
Trump won because when everyone saw what
those emails what was in those emails
they wanted Hillary less than they
wanted Trump it's that simple
Trump won because people like you are
uneducated and [ __ ] [ __ ] and dumb
[ __ ] like you oh dude I'm so glad you
[ __ ] voted for Trump because you and
your [ __ ] [ __ ] dumb [ __ ] family are
gonna get [ __ ]
cuz I'm fine dude cuz you bought it for
Trump I don't have to pay for health
care next year I'm [ __ ] healthy I
don't have to pay a tax burden on it I
can continue to hide money to my
business you're making me richer dawg I
am getting wealthy off of your [ __ ]
ignorance while your dumb [ __ ]
unachieved [ __ ] ass probably making
40 or 50 a year with your shitty [ __ ]
four-year it's [ __ ] voting for tax
cuts for me cuz guess what my job is
gonna be fine
your job is the one gettin automated
buddy okay it's gonna be a lot harder
for a robot to do what I do than it is
for whatever dumb [ __ ] [ __ ] you do
and I know that whatever you do is
[ __ ] dumb cuz you're dumb enough to
[ __ ] vote for Trump so there's
already like a high level of probability
that you either sub 90 IQ or doing some
jobs get replaced real [ __ ] soon so if
you want to sit here with your [ __ ]
well actually destiny if you would have
seen how many times the letter P
appeared in that email you would realize
that Podesta was a secret child rapist
and you know even though the Benghazi
and the Hillary grillings that lasted
hundreds of hours you know resulted in
zero indictments and the Russian
investigation that's totally [ __ ] fake
by the way that's already produced over
20 credible indictments plus [ __ ]
people that have already been convicted
the man of forts the Flynn's the [ __ ]
Gates the all the [ __ ] people have
already been convicted federally
convicted of crimes around Trump right
all of that is [ __ ] fake though I love
it dude I love every [ __ ] day of it
when the revolution happens I'm gonna be
[ __ ] fine
I got [ __ ] money I got my [ __ ] gun
this you're gonna be the [ __ ] people
crawl around in the street too [ __ ]
stupid to tell your [ __ ] ass from
your [ __ ] sister
aka your [ __ ] wife cuz it's the only
[ __ ] girl you ever probably [ __ ]
convinced to actually touch your [ __ ]
dick okay
I'm gonna be fine that's all I'm saying
all right I love all of you guys you're
all very great people get me the [ __ ]
here oh my god I need to [ __ ] I need
to leave I can't even believe my face
when the multi-billionaire Trump is the
common man like there is so much [ __ ]
that happens today that is like it would
be considered bad writing in a movie
right like so much of what Trump does if
you were to write it as satire people
would be like this isn't really the best
writing it's too on-the-nose like if you
really want Trump to be this type of
like you know kind of like evil
character that satirizes you know like
an extreme fascist like idiot like you
got to be a little bit more subtle you
know like these tweets like you know
it's saying there are good people on
both sides of a [ __ ] Nazi rally like
it's just too dumb you know you know
saying that the Republicans vote in
Trump is there every man when he's a
multi-billionaire guy they'd [ __ ] it
is so [ __ ] hideous he's got a ship a
wife in from Eastern Europe or whatever
to actually [ __ ] marry him happy
[ __ ] still cheats on her [ __ ]
cheese on that white it's like it's how
many [ __ ] wives he gone through right
and he still cheats on that one any
[ __ ] as his [ __ ] personal lawyer
[ __ ] pay him off so they don't tell
people that he's [ __ ] these porn
stars and [ __ ] well he's married to his
goddamn wife and his [ __ ] lawyer he's
already been federally [ __ ] it died
for it and now he is Giuliani of all
people defending him with the public
ring because he probably saw what
[ __ ] TV you know that's true right
the only reason that Trump privately
picked Giuliani's cuz Giuliani is on
[ __ ] television like holy [ __ ] oh
[ __ ] me all right I love you guys I got
it I gotta get the [ __ ] out of here this
country is [ __ ] I wish I didn't have
a kid sometimes so I just pack my [ __ ]
and get the [ __ ] out of here cuz goddamn
our Americans some of the dumbest
[ __ ] in the [ __ ] world holy
can give yourselves everybody gave
yourself a pat on the back right now
you're amazing amazing the same country
that produced the Silent Generation and
the technological Boone's and and all of
the the the the investment in in
technology and all the innovation have
produced such a great environment today
for knowledge just amazing all right
on the back europe might be just as
[ __ ] by the way i mean [ __ ] the
UK voted for brexit [ __ ] lepen had
like twenty or thirty percent of vote
and if i could frame i don't know Sweden
you've got a lot of crazy [ __ ] going on
with your [ __ ] white nationalist date
so I mean your might be as [ __ ] I
live here so who the [ __ ] knows I don't
even know where the [ __ ] I would go mod
the xkr-s xqc here I don't know what his
twitch name is it's like oh it's this
one how is Trump cheating on his wife
relevant to anything who the [ __ ] cares
about it oh who cares
you mean Republicans the people who talk
about [ __ ] god every [ __ ] two
SEC's give me Trump that holds up the
[ __ ] Bible that holds up the Bible
and says is the most important book ever
written when not cheating your [ __ ]
wife is one of the ten commandments what
do you mean who cares about that one
[ __ ] 95 percent the evangelicals part
of the largest book and religious voter
base the United States votes Republican
every [ __ ] election you're gonna tell
me who cares about cheating on your wife
are you [ __ ] [ __ ]
please sterilize yourself immediately
chop your [ __ ] balls off how could
you say something so [ __ ] stupid
okay the Republican Party care about
treating your [ __ ] wife the same
[ __ ] party they do a [ __ ] tab
wherever when Sean Hannity did a report
about [ __ ] Obama asking for Dijon
mustard
how are you [ __ ] serious how you
gonna say that [ __ ] maybe the average
Trump supporter today doesn't care about
people cheating on their [ __ ] wives
whatever cuz I don't know most you would
seem like your [ __ ] is sixteen whoa but
they can be because you all [ __ ]
voted so I guess they gotta be older
than that here's your guide to
Republican morality okay here's our
Republican morality works in the US if a
Democrat does it it's bad if a
Republican does it who the [ __ ] cares
alright where is that guy the [ __ ] um
representative
Jordan what Jordan guy the guy that they
apparently like knew a lot about like
some kitty did living [ __ ] going on
who's still in [ __ ] office who's had
multiple people come forward that make
similar accusations against him being
aware of the [ __ ] sexual abuse that
was going on in like the gym of the
[ __ ] Jim Jordan yeah what the [ __ ]
what's going on with that dude where is
he our Republican still defending this
guy the only I hope I make it far enough
to see [ __ ] people hang that's all I
want to see we need to break back public
[ __ ] execution and United say so the
first one the first one marching up to
the guillotine is gonna be [ __ ] Nunez
all right that's where we're going I
all right in a video game in gta5 all
right that's where I just want to
roleplay that Jesus [ __ ] it's real life
hands me a tail [ __ ] how about the
repugnant Center from Oklahoma said
transgenders shouldn't be allowed in the
bathroom of their choice it's
transgender people be careful okay
shouldn't be allowed in the path
insurance cuz they were a threat to
children then he got caught with an
underage male prostitute nice
why isn't Trump impeached yet then we
can't get you can't impeach somebody
don't like them there has to be some
type of there has to be some type of
charge you start against them and that's
not gonna happen ever Trumbull probably
finishes term depending on the mole
investigation because even after the
upcoming midterms the Senate's
definitely not flipping I think people
are saying the house is gonna flip but
um I'm sorry let me back up you know cuz
no intent you're wrong Disney took you
to me Frank's like a reason why he okay
the Senate is not gonna [ __ ] a peach
okay yeah the Senate's not gonna peach I
think you need to send it for
impeachment proceedings to go through
and that's not gonna switch so [ __ ]
whatever
yeah impeachment is a political thing
yeah sure but technically you have to
have some formal charge to bring against
somebody for impeaching them right like
you only it has to begin impeachment
yeah but that you have to go through the
Senate to make it right did you see this
destiny GOP officials in Pennsylvania
call NFL players who kneel baboons why
do they I want to believe that like
Republicans this is just like accidental
[ __ ] did you guys did we watch this
video on stream oh my [ __ ] god like
at the BART border yeah I just love them
let the people watched it this is the
president's deputy campaign manager this
is the type of hateful screed that you
saw in 26 is and honestly this is what
this is why by the way Democrats are
gonna win this try this in 2016
two years with two years of trumpism
looks like and it looks like Charlotte's
Ville it looks like calling judges of
Mexican descent not being able to make
make judicial decisions because they're
of a certain descent
it's called attack on the Khan family
people have seen what this president's
about but Joe see what his agenda
if the president said all these things
he said and you don't like his tweets do
you think two wrongs make a right so
then you're gonna double down about it's
not about two wrongs making a right you
know you started this segment saying
that progressives and Democrats in the
left are attacking the president calling
him a racist no you're just calling him
out listen you don't have to be a golden
retriever to hear all the dog whistles
coming out of the White House these days
are from my friend David over here final
one you said that about David David
Michael Michael Hayden posted a picture
of Auschwitz liberal Michael Hayden yeah
that they're screaming like okay you're
out of your cotton-picking mind it's
gotta be intentional right there's no
[ __ ] way he can't help himself I feel
like I would get more of these he is
probably the best [ __ ] speaking of oh my
god did you know that being married is
healthy for you in their life by
interviewing people in the seven 1970s
and the 1980s
50 and they see that they keep it
together
I find this
I find this someone lit it to the Finns
and Swedes to come up with something
because that's a we are we're wearing we
keep marrying other species and other
ethics and pure genes every other Swedes
because that's the rule
Finland Finns are American of the Finns
so they have a pure society in America
we marry everybody oh yeah the Florida
guy that was talking about because of
that black guy running for governor in
Florida well look I mean this is the
Florida which those Democrat debates
none of that it was my cup of tea but I
mean he performed better than the other
people there so so we've got to work
hard to make sure that we continue
Florida going in a good direction let's
build off the success we've had on
governor Scott the last thing we need to
do is to monkey this up by trying to
embrace a socialist Ajay
I don't know if it's dog whistling or
not I can't tell this was like a few
weeks ago this was like one week ago
like okay don't post this dumb [ __ ] in
my chat the two sides meme we're not
doing that [ __ ] okay we're not doing
this [ __ ] okay the two sides are just as
bad get the [ __ ] out of here with that
[ __ ] there are not two Saints sides on
things like [ __ ] global warming there
are not two same sides on things like
[ __ ] health care there are not two
same sides on things like [ __ ]
supply-side economics there are not two
same sides on things like Trump's
fascist [ __ ] tendencies to attack the
median [ __ ] okay these are not positions
that have equally valid sides we can
pretend like both people can't I do
[ __ ] bad things like that [ __ ] off of
that [ __ ] [ __ ] okay
that's absolute [ __ ] [ __ ] if you
are a Republican
today you are [ __ ] insane I am
[ __ ] sorry I
not met somebody yet that identifies as
a Republican that I [ __ ] respect in
any size shape or form you can't have a
modicum [ __ ] of intelligence if you
honestly on ironically are proud to call
yourself a Republican okay you can never
recognize that both sides absolutely do
the same thing
hello I am a classical liberal and I'm
here to tell you that both political
parties are the bads you've never
debated someone like me before [ __ ] off
dude you're not [ __ ] edgy you know
[ __ ] intelligent you're not saying
anything like you're not saying anything
[ __ ] insightful all right you're just
a [ __ ] root you're [ __ ] so dumb
you're so [ __ ] dumb bro okay where's
my where's my goddamn fedora so that
sounded like you just don't like Trump
I'm sure you could debate why Trump
would be a better president than Clinton
nope why you want to come on and do it I
got time for one more buddy I would love
to go through I would love to go through
Trump successful policies with you my
dude I got I got all the time in the
world [ __ ] it man my kid doesn't get off
school for 12 [ __ ] hours okay I don't
need to sleep for more than eight um
well um so Trump made the economy real
good he's the nuclear deal with a North
Korea that I haven't read anything about
the past month so I think that it's
still on let's see oh isn't it a holiday
oh [ __ ] oh maybe I don't have anything
today then or you could be like the
[ __ ] who's that dumb [ __ ] the the
amazing atheist all the all the liberals
online that somehow on ironically
support oh well actually if we vote for
Trump then it'll cause the weaker parts
of the left to the more radical parts to
be weeded out by the by the more sane
parts and by strengthening the power of
the right and causing them to
ubiquitously control every single level
of government it'll cause the left
become so strong that I'll be able to
rejoin them as their newly fortified
left is you know [ __ ] utopia and
it'll be so good after I you know write
that kind of [ __ ] destiny you would not
support the media in the way that you'd
do a few new history and how often the
media is lie to the public start Foreign
Wars look up the gulf of tonkin look at
RMS Lusitania look up yeah now your
testimony it's amazing that the left
used to be the ones who criticize
the media the media probably does a lot
of [ __ ] line but you better [ __ ]
believe that I would trust independent
media outlets instead of a [ __ ] state
media dog
what are you American or are you like a
[ __ ] European or something I'm not
here to tell you that the media is
always [ __ ] perfect and the media
probably pushes a ton of shitty [ __ ]
narratives on to us I don't deny that
but I would rather be able to dissect
the shitty meat narratives that the
media pushes on us rather than state
controlled media [ __ ] that [ __ ] don't
project on a TJ he doesn't support Trump
nope TJ's a [ __ ] [ __ ] I've seen
enough I listen to him
I don't think the TJ supports Trump so
cool for him but he's a [ __ ] idiot
he's like one of those woke centrists
that think that everything is [ __ ]
both sides memes the both sides mean
that's a third that's the trifecta if
you want to come on and you just want me
to [ __ ] die okay you're watching my
extreme you like you know what I'm done
with destiny I'm gonna make him [ __ ]
kill himself in a video game here's what
I'm gonna do I'm gonna come on and I'm
going to one be stupid to be smug and
then three lay both sides are the same
that's your that's your like that is
your trifecta of mental retardation
right there you just can't get any more
perfect than that all right hey destiny
viewer from Serbia here the only reason
I like Trump is because Hillary husband
bombed Serbia back in 1999 with uranium
rich bombs hitting hospitals
kindergartens and other civilian
structures among the targeted military
structures that aimed bombs ah oh cool
dude well glad we got Trump in there
that we fully [ __ ] support miss
Farrell and then bombing the [ __ ] out of
the palestine's
remember the remember the 40 little kids
that just got [ __ ] killed a week ago
with bombs that we send to Saudi Arabia
by the way the Yemen Civil War
that shit's still happening by the way
the Yemen Civil War that kicked out that
other guy they [ __ ] was a multi
[ __ ] billionaire where all of his
[ __ ] people were starving it was
backed by the [ __ ] Gulf states of
Saudi Arabia that we support oh by the
way we don't like Iran because they
support terrorists here you go Saudi
Arabia go nuke some more [ __ ] kids oh
come on dude [ __ ] off you're so [ __ ]
stupid where are you go back to [ __ ]
Serbia dude get out of here you're
[ __ ] so dumb [ __ ] kill me holy
[ __ ] uh okay I will if you want to say
to if you wanted to sides me on any
argument it could be American foreign
policy and I'd probably agree with you
but for a domestic apartment for demand
no it wouldn't even be for foreign
policy because Obama might have been a
[ __ ] crazy ass but
Warhawk but at least we had the Iran
deal like [ __ ] that's like good
effort my [ __ ] he [ __ ] tried oh my
god
serious of a war Iran deal I mean you
know some good some bad isn't bringing
up Saudi Arabia bombing its
justification for Clinton bombing Syria
two sides oh no it is I'm just saying
that the idea that you're voting for a
Republican because you don't like
Clinton because Clinton bomb some [ __ ]
is hilariously [ __ ] stupid you need a
different reason than that because
Republicans are gonna [ __ ] stop
bombing the middle leaves like the [ __ ]
is that [ __ ] what a dumb [ __ ] that's
like saying like I was gonna vote for
Hillary over Obama but then I decided
that I don't like people that have
eyeballs like the [ __ ] what a dumb
[ __ ] thing and then I'm like you know
that they both have eyeballs right you
like destiny aren't you kind of doing
the two sides thing here aren't you kind
of doing the two side well no I'm just
saying that if you're voting for one
over the other it sure as [ __ ] isn't
hold on hold on hold on I just need a
second hold on let me one second give me
one second please help me okay we're not
gonna lose it okay guys we're holding on
okay we're gonna keep our cool
okay okay okay guys listen okay I am a
new destiny okay I am new and I am gonna
try my hardest okay I'm gonna try my
hardest to actively engage in persuasive
rhetoric okay that's my goal actively
boy my quality of life has gone down
considerably since being a daily viewer
of your stream stop being so addicting

persuasive rhetoric that is my goal okay

I'm doing great so hey uh you know since
we had you for that MA actually you know
become sort of a pseudo fan you know I
actually agree let me just start off you
know nicely because that's you know it's
always better like I I agree with quite
a few things you said despite any you
know personal now contentions or
whatever people may have about you
there's some things you say that are
totally valid and I actually noted that
right before you offered to have the
debate oh yeah I said I was in an
airport earlier I was real grumpy okay
sorry no issue you know like people have
you know I mean like it's all good dude
you're a human
okay no problem um so basically I really
like your video about race wheels I
think it's a great debate I think you're
probably one of the more sound if you
will I don't know if you really identify
with the left it would that be a
mischaracterization
um I don't care I try not to use labels
at this point kind of kind of all over
the place but sure socially it probably
a mainly left-leaning am we might
actually relate there a little bit um
maybe maybe the various extents um give
us to say I saw that and I really liked
the the raised realism debate so I was
like there's got to be something about
that I don't agree and I saw angular I'm
not actually a big fan of his I'll be a
hundred percent honest the only time I
ever became like when I became aware at
angular was when like everyone did
because he got some dog that made a
video and then they wanted to find him
and find him whatever right there's a
lot of noise made over like a fine
obviously it comes in to free speech
territory that's what we're here to talk
about so I mean I'll open it up with the
fact that I didn't agree with the idea
that interpolate of Lee or interpolated
data whether it's video whether its
stats whether it's literature whether
it's whatever format it may be I just
didn't agree with your sentiment that
that wasn't evidence um there's some
more contentions I have under that but
I'd like to underneath all of it but I'd
like to better understand I guess I
guess where do you think I'll go with
this where do you think free speech the
extensive freeze
each extent where where where would you
say is a good time to stop speech and
where's a good time to allow speech and
like where's that for you personally
based on what you see in the world
that's a really hard question I probably
fall more to the right than most people
in that but then I have like a weird
kind of like cop out or not cop out but
I have like a weird thing I guess so for
me I am okay with with more or less
every idea being I guess legal in terms
of like a legal sense and then in terms
of private senses I like what should
Twitter or Facebook whatever do I think
that most forms of speech should be
platformed if not all forms of speech
the only thing that outside of like
direct calls for violence or
coordinating violent actions the thing
that probably or the thing that I don't
like that I am in favor of aggressively
D platforming are people that engage in
either deliberate misinformation or
gross misuse of information so for
instance Alex Jones types or people that
spread essentially just fake information
those are the people that that I would
be okay seeing like gone and never
coming back
okay just mentioned Alex Jones do you're
aware that like a court as you know
acknowledged his character as a
hyperbolic character yeah I don't care
but I'm aware of that yo okay III don't
buy that cop out because I'm talk radio
hosts use the same thing Sean Hannity or
Rush Limbaugh will say things like well
I'm not technically news I'm just it
said entertainment and it's like yeah
but it's not really your place in
society and that's not really how people
consume your media and you're doing like
a massive damage to public discourse
regardless of how you characterize
yourself is what I would say here's
here's like and this will get to the
root right I kind of went in Reverse
here's the route yeah I believe that
your views on censorship actually impede
what we me and you don't sure a lot of
the people have as a common goal I
believe that violence bad views toxic
cancerous hateful [ __ ]
misinformation rich views should be
allowed so we can debate them discuss
them and never forget them so so we may
actually align on on
on the ID fundamentals and not on the
Praxis and that's totally okay and I'm
prepared vehemently to substantiate why
I feel this way can can I ask you why
you don't think maybe I'm correct on
that yeah so I think that people in
general are stupid and I've actually
lost my appreciation for democracy at
this point such that I don't even know
if we should have publicly elected
leaders because people are so absolutely
incapable of evaluating information that
I think other organizations need to be
responsible for doing that and I would
point to things like the elections or
Trump who I don't know you would have
some policies in place or whatever from
from companies that would decide which
media they want a platform or D platform
based on how they think that the
information is being spread or if they
think that the information is truthful
or not it would be very you would say
you would delegate to the free market
for something like this the free market
is very vague but I I mean I would say
like the companies that are like
Facebook or Twitter or whatever
platforms are in charge of of
platforming people I guess free market
is kind of vague there but like whatever
social media platforms they are using I
guess hate to ask questions right so
there was a study I'm not gonna ask yeah
sorry the NCAC published a study a while
back there was a summary of it and I'd
like to post it but I would like to cite
it first basically in this study they
surmise that crime statistics do not
support the theory that media causes Via
Media causes violence are you aware of
the key findings by the NCAC on this and
that actually censorship is is
prohibited by the First Amendment well
so the censorship that I'm talking about
isn't right private organizations have a
right to do whatever they want yeah
which I know you understand that um the
in terms of like platforming certain
speeches leading to violent acts and
you're saying that wouldn't happen
I would probably believe that if
platforming certain speech led to
violence I think we would see probably a
whole lot more of it my issues aren't
necessarily to avoid violence though
it's to avoid like gross stupidity is my
problem right now
I guess moreover let me let me bring
let me bring a little citation here
because you had mentioned do you
remember during that during the
discussions with Thank You Lee you had
mentioned that left the left right-wing
violence outweighs left-wing violence
now I can actually agree with you
cumulatively
with multiple stipulations and they are
as such based on the Cato Institute's
findings and I can cite all of this and
I pretend I'm going to because I I hate
when yeah I don't like when people make
you know empirical claims and they don't
back enough - like if I disagree the
other climate every conductive insider
whatever put my 77% of white extremist a
violent crime was committed by one
attacker during one incident okay where
that right I I'm not but okay okay all
right I will post the citation but
moreover um the the cumulative average
for violent crime the name of either
black supremacy and arc ism communism or
white supremacy are almost even per the
ADL 2016 I'm going to post both of these
citations in should I do it in debate
discussion yeah I'll do it
I'll do it in debate discussion well I
don't want to flood pass citations the
first one table one five most of the
years for domestic extremist killings
from 70 to 2016 there was a hundred and
eighty four deaths in one white
extremist bombing the the next four
listed there were actually motivated
either empirically or circumstantially
by by another form of extremism I would
say Islamic but I'm pretty sure there's
one other in there however the main
point is only one of those from 1995 was
a white extremist attack moreover what's
really interesting about these stats is
that left wing and right wing extremists
all smash each other in totals to date
from about 65 to what is that 2016 when
you had said that actually that you know
frightening
it's totally um you know it's I'm not
coming here to do a gotcha actually
honestly I just hate I have a particular
dislike I won't say hey cuz I don't
really hate much I have a particular
dislike for the fact that people want to
present it like there's there's only
violent lunatics on one side of this
coin sure
wait okay before before we get too deep
into this so I'm not super married to
the idea that left-leaning people are
right letting people commit more violent
acts just based on because I'm
susceptible to media influence just
based on what I had heard I I assumed it
was left-leaning and then somebody
presented me with a study saying that it
was right leaning and then I read that
and it seemed like everything in there
was okay so then I just kind of like ran
with that for my conversation would
thank you low but I mean I could very
easily if you have empirical data set it
stating otherwise I mean I would switch
my opinion Emilia I'm not like super
attached to that idea yeah I'm not sure
if you're like if you think that I like
very strongly believe in that or not and
but I mean if you've got empirical data
that says otherwise and yeah I believe
yes I guess my ultimate claim issue here
is that you and you'd positive towards
the end of that to be that in fact the
president because of his auspices should
be now I'm going to tie this all
together because of his auspices as an
officeholder giving getting our tax
funding money and all the rest of it
right as a president he has a different
set of standards to adhere to now I'm
sure you seem like an educated person
I'm sure you're aware that citizens in
the United States have an actual set of
duties to the country such as voting
diligence reporting discussion of issues
all of these are actually laid out by
the NCIS they are a fact it is it's not
it's if they're literally I think it's
ten or seven I forget and then the
president has a subset now in this
hierarchy citizen actually this is
stipulated per current law citizen does
supersede that the only time it doesn't
is during candidacy particularly and
there's a few other incidents where it
doesn't for instance like when
impeachment etc it said sometimes they
can't exercise certain personal rights
however basically they're allowed to and
here's I'm gonna bring it full circle
because I actually asked someone in this
discord earlier today you're hosted in
am ask the same person of the same
question I said how is it right that he
receives federal this is a public
candidate right and he's not allowed to
talk on Twitter right he should he he's
not allowed to block people entrepreneur
however should I say talk is the same
thing no because speech would be
blocking or at least to a private
citizen now if he's an elected official
and he's not allowed to block people
then Twitter a public forum for legal
definitions and the issue I have is that
this is this
literacy to law is leading people to
actually erect the precedent legally for
Twitter to become the very thing that
myself and I believe yourself don't want
it to be I'm like super lost wait so
what are we talking about right now
there's like a lot of very well is it
firstly just just to make sure we're on
the same page so sure in terms of like
what Trump should be allowed legally to
do I would caution you to make sure you
don't mix up like moral or ethical
arguments that I've made with legal
arguments so insofar as like Trump being
able to say like [ __ ] the media I hate
the [ __ ] media but like legally I'm
pretty sure he's allowed to do that I
don't think there's anything wrong with
it my arguments have always been more
what ought he do like should a president
behave in this way I don't and I don't
think so for what I would consider a
strong set of reasons but in terms of
like making legal claims I if I have
made them then I horrendously misspoke
but I don't think I've generally made
legal claims insofar as what Trump
should be allowed to say regarding the
media I have made them insofar as um
like I think it's technically illegal
for like a sitting president or senator
to like recommend the firing of an
employee to other companies and shedder
I think I've read that like in law but
in terms of like how Trump should should
conduct himself versus what he's legally
allowed to do those are two very very
different things right um how he should
conduct himself and what he's allowed to
do a print mm-hmm
yes yes they are - yes okay yeah okay
just making sure cuz I don't think I've
ever said that like Trump should go to
jail for saying [ __ ] the media I just
think it's a very [ __ ] scary thing
for a president to say but I don't think
it's like illegal yeah so would you say
your contention is more with actually
like his character use that my
contention is I think that Trump acts as
a blatant fascist and it bothers me that
so many people that claim to be liberals
or classical liberals or whatever
support somebody that comes off as a
massive fascist to me the attacking or
operates as comes off as I don't think
the president technically has the
ability to operate as a fascist within
their current legal framework but but
put like spreads like fascist rhetoric
an okay okay so his rhetoric seems fast
you sure like attacking the media as a
precedent is something that I'm very
uncomfortable with and I think that
anybody that values any sort of freedom
of speech should be very uncomfortable
the president attacking media
okay um let me let me let me thought
full circle even further was a judge who
ruled in this ama's this person's AMA
case and this isn't I don't expect you
to know all the particulars person who
he had that came from sorry excuse me I
was weren't selling person who came for
the AMA there was a judge in her case
she established precedent in the
Southern District of New York that Trump
was not allowed to block people because
of course his his page is deemed a
public forum uh-huh now that now the the
the interesting thing I heard you say
bring the dank you love and you did you
did I'm not mischaracterizing you I can
go back to the time he did say that I'm
not for Trump D platforming I think you
were alluding to him blocking folks I'm
not sure because I'm not really sure how
else he could be easily legally that
actually would under current Southern
District law under their current looing
that that Judge what was her name shoot
I had an earlier Murdoch her I think I'm
tonigh the way you're saying that it was
real the Trump because he's the
President and it could be conceived as
like a public communications that Trump
isn't allowed to block people on Twitter
something wasn't it right right and and
what I'm wondering is it seems like
right it seems like we're establishing
this fact that this well okay it's a
public forum when Trump wants to say
something but it's not a public forum
when it when it's not convenient that's
what it seems like from the outset
legally and I actually was very just
your credit I was actually shocked to
see you you you understand the law as it
related to defamation I was like wow
someone actually well actually I had to
deal with it a lot because I'm a quasi
public figure so and right I was gonna
say you do actually meet I think in some
districts the legal press mean at least
in half the country they'd see you as a
public they might as well yeah because
yeah because I've done this stupid [ __ ]
in the past right you've definitely try
and hit you with it but if they could
yeah yeah my point is I worried about
the double standards here that's
obviously what I'm worried about
wait what real real quick okay just cuz
I notice we're jumping around like a lot
of different points yes yes let's focus
on you're gonna wrap it all right go for
it what you could do for yeah yeah I'm
worried about double standards here
because because if Twitter is indeed
right if Trump's Twitter page is a
public forum right
one if a judge can circumvent other
court rulings which this judge did and
stipulate such - and if she has a
history of having her decisions reversed
three by Superior Court's the second
District Court in New York which is much
superior and has way better judges and
Dershowitz actually is linked I mean
it's a whole that it's a way hot way
higher quality court has actually
reversed this judges decisions on not
this matter but another pertinent matter
I'm curious isn't this sort of like in
the realm of allowing the law to say
what should and should not be heard
or am i off-base here I mean assuming
everything you've said is true up to
this point that could be one way of
reading it yes sure okay okay okay um
would you did you see the table I posted
because I do I do see someone I don't
mind referencing the chai tea or someone
mentioned that I'm misrepresenting data
that 44 to 67 extent what do you think
about my table there the orange table
did you see it in debate discussion I
didn't click it because I'm not married
to like any argument of Mather okay very
easily be persuaded from one side and
you would say you're you're pretty fair
in that first extremism on both sides
I'm not I know I'm saying that I could
be persuaded I don't think I would make
that statement but I could be persuaded
from one side to the other does that
make sense does that make sense sure how
would you be persuaded without looking
at my citations if you're not married to
any idea oh well cuz I mean I wasn't
because I didn't know we were gonna I'm
not ready to have that in-depth
discussion I can't just look at like one
day - real quick and then this is my new
I'm do you want to talk like real quick
with the Muslim dude about whether or
not verses of the Quran like can can be
100% condemn a person to committing
violent acts or okay I will admit I'm
not particularly well informed with this
subject so I might defer a lot too yeah
sure that's cool
hold on I'm gonna drag him in and I'll
be right back one second okay all the
religious crazies coming out today mojo
all right okay oh you guys can start
right you're leaving what the [ __ ]
you're missing all that junk yes I
preferred your [ __ ] Muslim apologia
before our game I'll be back one second
go for it okay okay so first of all
let's preface this with what's your name
by the way my name is boring but you can
call me mojo alone so let's let's give
you the same treatment destiny gives me
always and in debates so at any point if
you want to interrupt me if I
misinterpret your point or if you want
to add something else anything like that
you can do it okay um so yeah I'm yeah I
I hope I opened an editor and put some
points and you talked about I don't know
what you want to start with okay that I
was making a destiny is that Muslims in
general support Sharia law and the
Sharia law does have some parts of it
that are inherently violent would you
agree with that point Muslims I would
say all Muslims support a law that's
correct
what parts exactly would you consider
inherently violent stoning people for
doing things addition they've done
awesome how do you how how much do you
know about these these types of things
that most people know about in the West
these punishments about stoning about
whatever these are called in in Sharia
are called ho dudes
sure they are like
[Music]
less than 1% of the whole concept of
Sharia of the Sharia right sure yeah let
me let me let me finish my point please
how you arrived at stoning a person for
adultery of or whatever is this late
late laid out like it's so extreme to
reach that point that it's nearly
impossible to achieve in the first one
in the first 1,000 years of Islam and in
my opinion if you if you if you would if
you would ask any religious person a
Christian a Jew or someone when was the
time that your religion was performed as
optimally as possible everyone would say
and the time of their Prophet correct
like you would say in the time of Jesus
the best Christians lived in and that
you would say in the time of Moses and
and a Muslim would say in the time of
Muhammad correct no not exactly
okay if you don't agree Christianity
actually started booming after no I'm
not I'm not saying the amount of
followers I'm saying the followers that
followed that religion followed it as
perfectly as I could okay like my point
is my point is in the time of the
Prophet that's the time where as LA was
practiced as perfectly as possible and
as time goes on people change stuff or
like they they do some wrong things or
don't follow it as closely as they did
at that time so let's go back to a
stoning point to get to the point there
there are like so many criteria to reach
that point that it's nearly impossible
in the first 1,000 years of Islam there
was not a single like after the the time
of the Prophet there was one incident in
the time of the Prophet where person
came voluntarily three times and he sent
her back there was a woman the
prostitute I think and she wanted to be
stone herself she came three times she
sent her by three times and after that
they did it but after that the point
there in thousand years there was not a
single incident of of stoning so
so the fact that you you say it's it's
like you put it in a way that it's
practiced super easily that as soon as
you you see someone doing it or whatever
that that the punishment is like
following immediately or something
that's incorrect so the part of the
punishments are more as a deterrent if
that's the correct English word for
people and they are also in the Bible so
I mean yeah yeah I heard that I heard
that you said that New Testament is the
Old Testament like Christians don't
follow the Old Testament because Jesus
came to to abolish but I'm pretty sure
I'm pretty sure Jesus said he didn't he
didn't come to abolish it he came to
affirm the Old Testament the fulfilled
but sure yeah but then I also went into
several examples I only read like a few
that specifically referred to the law
and how we're not to practice the law
and how we're not under the law it's the
the New Testament is replete
it's full of scriptures everywhere that
have that clearly indicate all right if
you if you want to keep out the Old
Testament completely then what's the the
punishment for homosexuality according
to the New Testament is it even a sin
according to you I feel like
homosexuality is only referenced I want
to say it's in Deuteronomy isn't it is
it well I thought it it was either
Deuteronomy Leviticus romo the first
chapter as they did not like to retain
God in their knowledge he gave them over
to a reprobate mind know this remember
let me see if I can find it real quickly
it's it's it's Romans the first chapter
where they reference is in the nude says
and the women also burned in their lust
to one another committing acts receiving
their due punishment which
was in there in reference it was
basically that it was inconvenient and
that like there's no we as human beings
are not allowed that are never
instructed to issued out any punish like
it's just there it's not there is no
punishment that human beings would be
giving in that way the song only sin
would be that and their homosexuals in
that regard then it would be that
they're left to their own devices and
that at the end and the afterlife did
receive their punishment there is no
actual codified punishment for for
homosexual homosexuals in the New
Testament
supposedly enacted by any human beings
here that's not a okay so if two
homosexuals would have sex in front of
Evangelic Church and in America the
pesos they I wouldn't have any problem
with it I think they would have but they
have a problem with any human beings
having sex in front of a judge for any
reason that's a private act but you know
that there would never not be any
codified punishment because of the fact
that their homosexual know if that's
what you're implying no okay that's the
first time okay that's just not a thing
yeah okay there's a similar concept in
Islam by the way that what you but you
said that the act of homosexuality
itself is dealt with in the afterlife
but as soon as it's publicly practiced
it becomes like in Islam you different
you differentiate between you could say
sins against the society and since
against and against God or something
right
and since against the society are
punished in the society for example
murder or stealing or whatever you have
judges and whatever I have like a
judicial system and and a tea with that
and since against and against God like
ascribing partners to him or something
believing in multiple gods or whatever
that that Sufis dealt with in the
afterlife the way this is the way that
we talked about this at least in school
or I think maybe the whole Catholic
Church might say this is it like you
hate the sin not the sinner so but as
soon as the act is practiced in public
it doesn't become a sin between the
purse
and God it becomes a sin in the society
as well right
and yeah you would be yeah I mean I
talked to a destiny before like how how
you would reach a punishment for
homosexuality and I researched it even
more so to actually punish someone for
homosexuality and public is even more
ridiculous so that's the point I'm
bringing observe the whole hood who
dudes are just deterred deterrence not
really stuff that actually is acted upon
right so you have to I said it before
and the whole church was miming and
liked it a lot but to for a homosexual
to be punished then need to be for
witnesses that actually witness the
penetration in public and the persons
that witness it are described in Arabic
as mean own it's not just Muslims it's
it's pious Muslims so imagine like I
don't know like old man with like super
long grown beards walking in in public
and four of them at the same time like
keeping their eyes on the egg it's like
it's so ridiculous and now other
criteria as well I can look it up if
you're interested but that's like that's
so extreme right for it to happen and
they have to testify in court and stuff
it's it's just like it's it's setup so
extremely that it possibly can never
happen right it's just a deterrent for
the people to not do it you know say the
best appear is form but I don't think
that's the way things work I think most
of the time you need to have political
influence in order for these kind of
laws always gonna be living in a society
right so you had Judaism and the reason
why Judaism was successfully implemented
and the reason why was practiced the
letter of the law by the Jewish people
is because they were a segregated and
isolated individual group of people they
they weren't necessarily assimilating in
society but when you started taking them
to different places when they started
integrating with the Roman society and
whatnot and when you during that
integration and no they didn't practice
a lot exactly the way it should be
because you couldn't
because now you have codified law
preventing you from practicing it that
way so yes at the beginning at the onset
of the Muslim religion of the Muslim
faith then yes when there are small
numbers and obviously you're not gonna
have the ability to even commit these
kind of you know stole names and whatnot
you you just can't do it it would
require you to have a significant amount
of people because if you were to do it
yeah but I have bronchitis people would
consider that as murder and then you
have to deal with the political for that
yeah I get report but it but as I said
earlier like the punishment was never
acted upon at the first 1,000 years of
Islam and so I mean it's pretty clear I
can I can't like I don't like I never
talk truly to a Christian before so I
don't have all my my sauce is ready but
I mean that's pretty a clear indicator
that it's actually added a deterrent not
not an actual punishment willy-nilly
right yeah if you want to move on to the
next point or if you want to add some
the punishment is there and these these
extra these extra requirements right
these specifically that you're saying
you're required they're not codified
they're not written that way if you're
choosing to interpret it that way that's
fine I don't know it's not a choice
nobody choice what was you saying
nothing it's not written that that part
about you having to have four witnesses
that's not right you know that Muslims
at least Sunni Muslims which may make up
like over 90% of all Muslims in the
world
don't take just the Quran right you know
that I'm pretty sure right they take the
hadith there are six big books biggest
two of them are from Bihari and Muslim
and like they they they take that into
account to interpret the Quran correctly
right so not a single person like reach
just the Quran and interpret it like
just for themselves they are scholars
that do that the whole life like
studying Islam and stuff and writing
books about like singer singer verses
and stuff I mean it's not not an easy
thing for a layman to do that's why you
need to go to an authoritative figure
and and read up on that stuff so I mean
it's most Muslims are educated know
about this thing and like I said earlier
these roots which people in the West
love like talking about these
punishments are like it's such a small
part of the search area which is
ridiculous to give it so much time
compared to the other things like Sharia
is like synonymous and in the West my
opinion for like I don't know barbarism
or punishment or
I mean if you want to if you want to in
fact yada bro here's a deal look III
know the Old Testament right I know
Leviticus and I know those scriptures
and I do know that not all of it is
about punishment some of us just simply
like being clean like hey guess what if
you if you sleep with this woman while
she's on the rag you're unclean for X
amount of days right like the stuff is
there washing your hands before you
eating all those kind of traditions if
you committed this sin and you don't
sacrifice for you got to wait outside
the village for X amount of time so and
so forth a lot of it had to do with
these are the food you can't eat and it
wasn't like we're gonna stone you if we
eat these foods we're just telling you
right now that those things you can't
eat them and so on and so forth so I get
they're not all of it as soups as
specifically about the violence however
the only thing that I did say which i
think is factually grounded is the fact
that some of those there is an
injunction for violence with in Sharia
law that the injunction is there and may
be like okay the extreme of
automatically killing somebody is not
there but the 80 lashes is there like
it's you know yeah but I mean the
requirements for them to happen you have
to take them into account as well we saw
them we're waiting to see what I'm
saying so the injunction is there for
violence like whether or not you want to
start trying to and this is why I like I
was kind of worried about having this
conversation is because there's
obviously gonna be things that I'm not
particularly well informed about and I
don't want to put myself on a limb and
make like an egregious error and say
something stupid like oh yeah you know
this is whatever when I'm not 100%
inform of the subject you already did
earlier when you talked about jizya but
we can go on to that later but let's
finish this point I mean if you if you
had if you want to play that game where
you just look at the Quran and take it
literally I can't play that game with
the New Testament as well buddy oh let
me read you a version and you can
explain that okay jesus said jesus said
and these enemies of mine who are
unwilling for me to rule over them bring
them here and slay them in front of me
Jesus it isn't oh you don't know your
Bible it's in Luke it's in Luke 19 verse
27 so if you don't know your Bible I
mean me as a Muslim apparently no I know
you
better than you so but what I did there
is I did the same thing you did
I picked like a verse out of context and
it it looks at it cooks violent and it
looks Jesus said what bring people in
front of me and kill them oh no doesn't
work like that right
but that's the thing like Christians
think they know they're the Bible in an
out no nothing nothing in the New
Testament about violence or whatever but
yeah apparently some sometimes say if
they should take it out of context and
that's why I hate it when people do that
to the Quran as well like I'm pretty
sure the verses you're going to bring up
about the Quran if you read the verses
in front of them and after them they
make sense and they are like okay if I
address it in terms of self-defense when
when States the TEC States or whatever
because Islam is not a pacifist a
pacifist religion not like you want to
spin the New Testament to be Islam
allows States and people to defend
themselves when they are attacked right
oh yeah yeah you see how it you see how
ridiculous that is if I just read that
verse alone so you would agree 100% that
there are literally zero injunctions in
context to do violence in the Bible
right like you agree with that point and
if you agree with that point anything
you can you then say to me honestly but
there are zero injunctions to do
violence in the Quran if that's the case
and what I'm gonna say that we're
obviously the answer is no right
what's going on we're best buddies we
are conspiring to go against ACS
atheists and destroyers so you have
firstly have to define
if you if you define violence as
unprovoked X against people that
innocent people then you know I don't
agree with that
there's nothing in the Koran about
calling violence against like civilians
or against anything right here right
because I didn't I didn't define it that
way and I don't subscribe to proprietary
definitions go ahead to find violence is
to do physical harm is physical harm or
threat of physical harm against another
individual
that's what violence is but I can look
it up let's define it let's go well you
don't need to look out the actually is
just what definition do you want to use
or whatever because I when there is
violence in the Bible as well as I so
here we go behavior involving physical
force intended to hurt damage or kill
something or someone someone or
something that's the definition that I
would like to use and their behavior
involving physical force intended to
hurt damage or kill someone or something
I don't subscribe to proprietary
definition so the way we I'm so I'm
sorry I said that there are zero
injunctions to do violence to do what we
just defined in the New Testament in any
contact there's one about and what about
Luke 19 verse 27
no that wasn't an injunction to do
violence but start does injunction me
I'm sorry I'm calling calling and
calling people apart injunction means an
encouragement or a an excuse to do
something like like something causing
something to happen so in this case what
you did was you took a story said hey
there was a dude one time and this is
what he said and this is what happened
and he said bring my enemy before me
that I could say that right so that's
what happened there he's telling a story
but he there's never a ninja there's
never a time where he's saying here is a
case where you can commit violence or
encouraging an encouragement there we go
huh okay would you Jessica Sorenson a
New Testament ever in in context not a
single one would you agree with that
statement I'm I'm just saying now I
agree with that because I don't know the
Bible as well as you know a robbery what
was the chapter verse
19:27 look so would you would you would
you what was my question [ __ ] 12 he said
a certain nobleman went into a far
country to receive for himself a kingdom
into return
and he goes on to tell the story about
this nobleman and all it's all in one
connected pack passage he never stops
talking and they said unto Him Lord he
had 10 pounds it's the 25th blah blah
blah and then the 27th is where he says
but those not not those my enemies which
would not that I should reign over them
bring hither and whatever so like that
it's clearly a story that he's talking
about about what happened it's clear and
I'm when I told you don't don't do that
I told you when I read it like if people
take fruits out of context they look
[ __ ] right and that's that's my that's
my claim that you do with the Quran as
wait are you the person I'm fanatic me
yeah perfect okay to make sure oh all
right wait before we do this introduce
yourself to the chat okay um my name is
fnatic my real name is Lauren Riley I am
a professional musician by trade now
that's right before living but before
that I played video games oh [ __ ] wait
what do you play what instrument or
instruments I play the piano once I'm on
your stream you played I did a Skype
remix someone called me on skype and I
just started playing the piano ok I know
who you are gotcha I remember yep yeah
so I play the piano but I also play for
other instruments I kind of just have a
natural affinity for it so I've played
I've never had lessons but I played by
ear I probably have I just have a really
really extremely sharp ear that's there
like I can hear songs and play it quite
that's awesome yeah I'm really good with
that being said I particularly like your
stream I very much enjoy your your style
of debate I think the video you just or
what you just did right now like picking
apart the router video I've done that
exact same thing pause and get it almost
identically every single part cause do
that ok um
I think we share similar ideologies on
most things the difference is I have a
particularly Christian background oh
[ __ ] um yeah here we go
I was raised in a I say cult-like
environment but it was particularly
hyper conservative and environment both
of my parents are very stalwart
Christians I was born at the pastor's
house none of us none of me nor none of
my siblings ever received like
immunizations or shots or any of those
kind of things weren't allowed to listen
to secular music whatsoever I've never
seen my mother and make up my parents
didn't wear wedding rings because it was
jewelry and etc I was raised from the
Bible we would go to church five five
times a week my parents currently old
church at their house where my mother is
the pastor where people come though I've
been pretty deeply entrenched in the
Christian faith I don't practice it the
way I was raised
I've grown past that a lot but I've read
the Bible like countless times I've
still
actively read the Bible particularly
well-informed on that okay I think that
where we run into a bit of an issue is
when you compare radical Islam to
radical Christianity and I think you you
have and I hope that doesn't come off as
an insult but I think that you have a I
don't think you're very well informed
when Protestant Christianity as a poll
and the ideology that that is
encapsulated new testing Bible in one of
your videos from one of your debates you
were I watch her to base most of the
time like if I'm driving somewhere I
have I swear might as well be narcolepsy
I will fall asleep anytime I have fall
asleep when stream all the time if I'm
not actively doing something I fall
asleep one of the things that actively
waits me up is debates because it just
gets me to speaking very very heavily so
I can be you know particularly exhausted
I think I'm always I always am I never
get sleep and debates will do that so I
was watching your debate on them radical
which woman was affecting the country
more radical Christianity versus radical
Islam yeah and I agree with your point
that radical Christianity I mean I don't
think I think it's objectively true
radical Christianity
I'm affects the United States more than
radical Islam I mean but I I think the
way that you get to the point is a
little bit incorrect for one if you
start looking at just the difference in
the disparity in the population whereas
over sixty five percent of people in
this country identify as Christians
whereas only one percent of this country
identified as Muslim and at that point
you start running into an obvious like
you know the sixty five percent of the
population is obviously going to affect
things a lot more but the main point
that I wanted to make when you make the
comparison between radical Islam and
radical Christianity I think you're only
able to make that comparison because of
a lack of information about what
Christianity is and when you start
talking about the fact that there is
literally not a single injunction to
violence in any of the New Testament
Scriptures that I think at that point
that is what Christianity is it would be
radical peace radical peace now you
could obviously want to talk about okay
well the Catholic Church and what they
have done I don't particularly believe
that the path that I'm Catholic Church
is a Christian H Christian
if the Christian organization I would
say that the Catholic Church is is much
more rooted in political ideology and I
think we can look at that through
history and what they reformed through
if you really remember you know
historically right like not not not
looking at the Bible just look at any
historian and it's like factually true
that the Catholic Church originally
prosecuted or persecuted the Christian
Church if we look at like the catacombs
and what happened in Rome and the
Colosseum's that they were particularly
persecuting the Christian Church they
might use the name Christian now but
their ideology and their practice is
completely um disagree or diverge from
what is talked about in the Bible itself
they don't even use the exact same Bible
obviously but yeah so when you when you
start talking about radical Islam versus
radical Christianity and and the reason
why there is a reef Reformation of the
Christian faith is specifically of what
which used to be Judaism is because of
the New Testament the New Testament it's
pretty up he's like very much a lot of
what was found in the Old Testament
Bible oh I don't know if this is like a
Catholic I don't know if this is a
Catholic different differentiation on
interpretation of Scripture or maybe you
just maybe you might know just more than
me and I'm just totally wrong here
but I very specifically remember being
told several times by our religious
instructors that the New Testament did
not usurp the Old Testament Jesus
himself says I did not come here to to
rule against the old prom the old
prophecies but to fulfill them right I'm
uncomfortable like the Catholic part of
me would be uncomfortable saying the New
Testament like overrides the Old
Testament right I understand that did
you say to change the law
Yeah right yeah and and the way that
plays out you can see in I mean God you
just see it all throughout the Bible
like all of the various times in which
he does exactly that
where he specifically goes through and
says hey before we used to say this but
now I'm saying this right well but
didn't did Jesus really
I don't so oh my god dude okay hold on I
might if I'm ever wrong on something
feel free to [ __ ] call me out cuz
this is a really old [ __ ] so I always
saw Jesus's appearance in modern day in
zero BC or 4380 whenever [ __ ]
whatever right when Jesus came and and
he made that statement I'm not here to
overturn the old law but to fulfill it
the examples that Jesus gave wasn't like
wasn't like the old law said this wrong
thing and this is how you should really
do it it was usually like more extreme
versions of some older laws like for
instance wet win-win [ __ ] is it I want
to say it's the Sermon on the Mount is
that the one where like Moses or some
old prophet told us that if somebody
slaps their cheek to turn at seven times
or whatever and Jesus says I say to you
don't forgive your brother seven times
but seventy-seven times right is it was
this a Sermon on the Mount yeah so like
it but like um it didn't seem like Jesus
ever came into like whatever you learned
in the old law is not true but more like
I'm going to take the law and expand
upon it right right well there's it was
always at a more extreme version for
instance there was one point where it
said you know an eye for an eye for a
tooth for tooth for tooth and he's like
now I'm telling you turn the other cheek
right and there was one where he'd be
like hey you know that they said give
10% I'm saying give out of the abundance
of your heart then there was you know
like and so on and so forth there's like
countless examples where he did that
sharing so Jesus though but then Jesus
in practice 100% contradicted so many of
the traditions and laws that were in the
Bible sure especially in regards to like
forgiveness I would argue that Jesus it
seems to me that the Jesus who is God I
guess if you believe in the Trinity I
don't know I think it's just a Catholic
thing but like that Jesus himself was
far more forgiving than thing God was
God was pretty [ __ ] spiteful in the
Old Testament but Jesus seems pretty
forgiving of sins in the new yeah yeah
as far as like radition is about like
you know there was a point where they
went they were really upset at him
because they didn't wash their hands
before he before they ate he was like
wait a minute you guys you guys are
following tradition for no reason like
you don't even understand the concept
all that so yeah he did do that now
here's the thing so Jesus
obviously all of his disciples and if
you really pay attention to what his
disciples did it and what pau himself
did littered throughout the entire Bible
there are unbelievable amounts of
Scripture that specifically mentioned
that the Old Testament which is the law
of Moses which is where you would get a
lot of the practices that talked about
things like Deuteronomy right all of
that is completely done away with and I
mean it's literally everywhere if I can
read to you a few examples if you don't
mind yeah and I guess um all right bro
so romans 6 and 14 it says you're not
under the law but under grace the law is
obviously the law of Moses right and if
you can read it for context you get it
um Galatians 5:19 once you were born
again you are not under the law and of
course obviously if you're talking about
being born again the very first time
being born again was ever introduced
into the Bible in any way shape or form
it was through Jesus yeah Jesus there
was a speech where he said to someone
unless you're born again you cannot
inherit the kingdom of heaven and they
asked him wait how can you be be born
eight how can you be born again are you
gonna enter the womb and be born a
second time and of course obviously you
know the later on it was expounded upon
through the cross and whatever and the
very first time that was ever introduced
it was a completely foreign concept sure
that obviously was a New Testament yeah
yeah yeah I think my understanding of
that idea again as a Catholic because I
don't know what the non Catholic
interpretation of this or Protestant
interpretation of this wait which one he
was in on Katherine its Protestant right
that's [ __ ] savages the the my
understanding of this was that nobody
like was able to go to heaven or any
[ __ ] like that until Jesus came and
that the sacrament of baptism I think is
what allows you to wash off your
original sin receive the grace of God
and that after Jesus died he went into
the underworld and he brought up with
him all the people that didn't have the
chance to ascend to heaven save for a
view a few people that um there's a name
for that like ascended immediately to
heaven but otherwise yeah that was the
point of Jesus dying on the cross and
everything okay sure okay so when you
basically when you come down to that
right when you start reading through
them right that was only a few but it
goes over like but one last example yes
this is alright for as much as we have
heard that certain which went out from
us have troubled you with words
subverting your souls saying he must be
circumcised and keep the law to whom we
gave no such commandment right that's
just like it's very obvious right
because the law circumcision that
started with that what that was in
Leviticus after eight days and so forth
right um it's very very obvious if you
look at pretty much every scripture in
the New Testament that all of the law
was completely done away with okay like
all of it so then with that with that
being said if you take away all those
scriptures it's not cherry-picking if
you eliminate literally all of those
scriptures then you wind up with this
New Testament where there are and I'm
not exaggerating here literally zero
injunctions to do violence not a single
one okay if you don't have any
injunctions to do violence and then by
the way I'm not one of these retards
running around here assuming that you
know Oh radical Islam is such a huge
threat it doesn't constantly I mean
goodness handguns do so much more you
know whatever so so I'm not one of those
people but radical it Islam if you were
to practice the the the Quran in the way
in context as it is preached as it is as
the words are there there is no
Reformation there is no New Testament in
when it I mean this is where a Muslim
would argue that there are different
hadiths that you could follow that do
prescribe a pretty much non-violence
that it is very possible to have a loyal
interpretation and to follow a very
strict set of Hadees that do not allow
for violence against like civilians or
anything and and not like everybody
that's non-muslim is isn't as a
combatant or whatever I'm I'm a hundred
percent positive that like a well-versed
Muslim would make this argument insofar
as their interpretation of the Quran and
in which who dates they choose to follow
sure okay I guess someone could probably
choose to misinterpret the Old Testament
in Leviticus and then say hey you know
trust me we can avoid all of this
violence because the injunctions are
there the injunctions are there like in
the Quran itself now obviously there's
more text right like if you look at the
Jewish faith you'll have new texts that
come out not that are not considered
Bible but they are like text that are
you know
that are observed by the parishioners of
specific seconds of Judaism that would
allow people to then stop doing things
like sacrifices and so on and so forth
which is why they don't follow like to
the letter of the law anymore because
certain things have come to usurped that
but overall if you take the text for
what it is like it without adding on
additional text right this is where you
get the word fundamentalist if you're a
fundamentalist practice or of Islam the
text in there does give you several
injunctions to do violence and we watch
it happen time and time and time again
historically um I mean this is kind of
where I would step in to like so moving
past like the theological argument um I
guess like but I would look for is like
demonstrations of stuff that's happened
throughout history for how I choose to
view a religion and I mean like sure
Christians are the are the people that
new people I mean the United States is I
would argue largely or at least has been
largely like a Christian nation our
leaders pray to God our leaders
reference God and then we go to war on
foreign soil and we'd kill a [ __ ] ton of
people and whatnot I mean I have a hard
time buying that like just because
Christianity has a pure text that that
makes it like intrinsically good or
something well I think this argument
that I think you would agree like I
don't believe this is a Christian if
this was a Christian nation and I think
things like abortion and whatnot it
would be completely sensible obviously
like saying okay no we're just gonna
make well but they try really hard to
it's only very recently we've overcome
that and if you want to go with the
argument this isn't a Christian nation I
could buy that sure but then I'm sure as
[ __ ] I'm not gonna say that like the
people in Iraq that form like Isis and
[ __ ] that these guys are that these guys
are 100 percent religiously motivated
because a lot of this [ __ ] comes down to
geopolitics
so so I mean like the thing is that like
if you would have any Muslim majority
country go to war with another country
and their leader would have come out and
say something like I prayed to Allah and
he guided me in this way and now we're
going to war we would be 100% on board
saying like that's the holy war this is
some crazy Muslim [ __ ] we need to do
something but when George Bush says [ __ ]
like I prayed to God and this is what he
told me to do or when Trump holds up the
Bible and says this is the most
important book ever written we don't say
well those aren't Christian acts those
are just you know
those individuals will [ __ ] is an
atheist that's some scary [ __ ] to me
when a guy is saying like I'm holding up
the Bible and this is the most important
book like I don't know what the [ __ ]
interpretation you're taking from that
or how that's gonna play out
sure okay well here's where we went into
the issue okay so when Muslims do it
right when Muslims do that and they say
oh this is what you're doing so on and
so forth right
it's literally well-founded the women I
don't think that matters whether it's
well-founded any huh guys
well it does particularly because you
cannot find that same injunction in a
Christian faith and and what you have in
is is where you have individual
politicians who subscribe to the
Christian faith um who happened to be
leaders and intimate ever try to try to
divorce 100% anything that they're
practicing from their faith would not be
that wouldn't be a genuine I mean that
would be disingenuous but it doesn't
change the fact that as a whole this is
not a Christian nation like the
Christianity is not 100 percent route
like theirs we have easi have separation
of church and state it's like I mean you
say that but we have in God you trust on
our money we swear in holy books in
order to swear in you know when we when
we go under oath you know our president
reference our head of state references
god on it on it every day he gives a
speech like I mean like you can say that
we're not like we're not like a
theocracy sure but I think that religion
is still a really important part of who
we are as Americans sure I I didn't I
didn't say that religion didn't have a
huge influence over over individual
practices and because of the fact that
the vast majority of the country is
Christian then obviously is going to
have its influence as it hope but it is
there's an obvious codified divorce
between Christianity and the United
States and as you said you chose to use
the word holy books right we swear in a
holy book we've had people swearing on
the Quran like it happened that in and
of itself because obviously these things
are diametrically opposed is indicative
of the fact that this is not a Christian
nation do you agree with that the fact
that we do wait with the fact we do what
was a lot of the fact that the fact that
when we have a codified separation
between Christianity and and and the
politics and because of the fact that we
have
um people are able to square in on the
Quran as has happen I think those two
things together are indicative of the
fact that this is not Christian nation I
guess it maybe has to acknowledge that
Christian that religion has an influence
on individual practices which make up
oh my god dude Crowder versus the um he
got so triggered I come oh my god he got
so triggered by this kid the only reason
Crowder does these debates is because he
wants to show people how to debate the
left and he always does it
he always does it at the end where he's
like see guys this is what they try to
do oh my I need to find this guy did
this guy message me or did we find his
Twitter I don't remember um why do I
feel like I had Konica this guy this guy
annihilated alright this guy annihilated
Crowder and Crowder just ended up
resorting to like crying like oh well
you called me am you said I was owed to
stick he got like real mad socialism is
fundamentally evil and how this here we
little represents but sources in case
one wants look at them afterward but I
don't think use it's not fair from using
so I believe socialism is evil we
disagree are loving here you take this
you're cheating them on I make sure okay
yeah you know what my last minute
because we're necessarily friendly here
uh it you supporting us we conceal
immigration there's something we often
see from both the right in the left so
we start with the premise reminisce
statement socialism is evil right he
moved on to different uestion of
different topics so I'd like to first
before move on okay let's define
socialism in what what do you think I
mean by evil what do we both agree we
morally reprehensible immoral okay so so
as we both agreed socialism is basically
a collective a governmental control
while the distribution or the means of
distribution of production
when I say people that is immoral okay
so what part of my position do you
disagree with again going to change my
mind not score points well I try to give
in to you that your own objectives if
you're conservative not be achieve under
capitalism okay an example yeah you have
a lot of Republicans like Paul Ryan who
are struggling you can't deny that he is
a big capitalist and he has lots of
capital of donors they would like
nothing more than to increase their
profits I think you can do that and
people like that have been opposing
immigration reform for decades because
they believe that mass immigration will
lower the wages of the working class you
can create their profits now I would say
a lot of Peterson is correct and that
many conservatives Republicans believe
that mass immigration from countries
like say Mexico from third world
countries could lower the wages to pay
$15 an hour we wouldn't have a mass
emigration like robbing right now yeah
so let me kind of go because first off
before I can take that hold it
what example we point you before we go
on I don't know if it's great successful
socialist country I love the pivot here
I love this pivot it is so [ __ ] slimy
he's such a slimeball so the kid makes a
very compelling argument by the way you
ever want to [ __ ] on a libertarian
because libertarians are the dumbest
[ __ ] on the internet this is a fun
way when somebody says their libertarian
hears that they're actually telling you
I want to smoke weed but I also don't
want to pay taxes [ __ ] poor people [ __ ]
brown people
I just want my [ __ ] weed and I'm
probably cool with like hookers dude
[ __ ] but also don't [ __ ] tax me okay
cuz [ __ ] social programs that's
essentially what a libertarian is now
when you approach a libertarian and you
actually talk to them about what it
means to be a libertarian for instance
if you're a libertarian and you're not
for open borders probably not a
libertarian okay because an important
part of libertarian it's the free
movement of labor in order for the
market to perform as efficiently as
possible so you'll get a lot of Crowder
types that will pretend like oh yeah I'm
huge open market free market free market
free American it's like okay free market
so why do you want to restrict the flow
of Labor from one country to another
hmm right this is the trap that he just
got caught in so with the kid is trying
to demonstrate us hey you say that
you're big on on capitalism you say that
you're big on on these kind of like
libertarian esque
ideals well how do you explain the fact
that by supporting Republicans
Republicans huge capitalists are
advocating for the movement of cheap
labor from Mexico into our country which
theoretically could cause you know wages
to fall between below amongst native
workers right what do you think
qualifies someone is intelligent having
a reasonable thought process but and I
think Crowder realized that he was
walking into that trap so now we pivot
to this incredibly vacuous position of
where they're successful where they're
successful socially country Venezuela is
dying right now we pivot to this stupid
[ __ ] topic there's a really great
example of playing a god shoe with the
fact as well when he talks about some
Scandinavian countries having no minimum
wage for a few for few or maybe even all
of these countries he's right but their
union markets are much different there
are very powerful unions in at least
some Scandinavian countries I want to
say it's in Norway is the one that I
look this up because I was in I was
interested in this no minimum wage thing
to so while they don't have minimum wage
the reason why they don't have minimum
wage isn't because they want to be able
to pay workers very little it's actually
because the unions don't want minimum
wage because they think it would hurt
their ability to bargain with the with
the with the capital owners right this
is an incredibly disingenuous point but
again when you're when you're [ __ ]
Crowder all you're looking for is
gotchas is it Sweden it might be Sweden
instead yes I need to find a friend
first off away from the premise does the
moral argument I believe socialism is
immoral the redistribution of something
that you have not earned
I believe it's fundamentally immoral
then we'll go in so now we've done from
that to the pragmatic and no I'm not an
anarchist and then you brought up some
successful samples in Denmark Norway
Sweden I believe first of these aren't
social countries no the reason we pointy
countries like Cuba this
Bernie Sanders did for decades it's
because they're true examples of
socialism the Danish Prime Minister said
Bernie stop referring to us the
socialist economy we're a free-market
economy they don't have a living wage as
we know it they only allow collective
bargaining between unions higher-skilled
unions and those are their employers so
these are countries by the way flowing
in their immigration laws I'm the only
way to make it work if you're for those
countries and sounds almost like making
are you uh are you a nationalist see
part ways with a lotta probably or if
you're more left-leaning brother okay so
you're conservative socialist directly
hard to come on so don't even waste it
but it doesn't change the idea yeah
before we move on I'd be happy to but I
believe it's socialism the ISM that we
both agree upon the collective means
seizing of distribution production is
immoral I mean the argument absurd
because if you say there's immoral and
you also have to say the government
funding of police of the moral
government funding the military is
immoral anything the government does is
any more on that ridiculous but you have
to have some state that's going to
socialize certain things and so the
questions not do we have socialization
is how much sure
um I because the route that would you
know where I disagree with that guess
what I would say I assume you're gonna
try to argue the government funding of
the military police is not socialism why
would I say that I think you're right if
I if I have to concede that police force
are you saying police force military
roads is socialism the same as health
care education I'm summing up I your
friend to Denmark and Sweden not so much
economies they have more social safety
net that's kind of you're talking about
right well they're their market
economies with higher emphasis on social
safety no that's okay we've really turn
let's go so for the Marseillaise let me
confuse I'm gonna crack so let's change
of anything but um we just talked about
this
conceding the ground I don't believe it
the military and the police force would
be the same as socialized health care
school why not sorry I'm the only one
microphone we had someone wants to
debate destiny Holly give me a second to
finish this shitshow and then I'll do it
why not because it's a difference
creating public good and a commodity and
you explain to me the everything
publicly in a commodity so that would
include things like the police the
military you'd be hard for us to define
hardcore libertarians that we don't need
those so there's a big difference
there's a fun little thing that and
something like health care or school
it's or it goes to free internet as you
know cenk if you're talking about
Germany now high-speed air that is right
there suddenly declare any commodity to
be a right or to be formal role of
government that means the government
cannot remove that right depending on
who's in power and that's the problem
that's why I think it's fundamentally
immoral for someone to take something
they haven't earned
regardless me the power I think
I wish I could challenge right well the
reason why we don't want the government
to declare is something right it's
because then the government could take
it from you okay cool
well let's contrast that with the idea
that if a corporation provides it to you
a corporation can take it from you now
one of these is held accountable by the
public one of them isn't held
accountable by the public which one is
better in this circumstance [ __ ] that
would be I would love to hear I'm trying
to squirm around that question oh well
uh uh free-market uh
can always provide okay cool why is it
that in like 50 percent of markets
there's only one viable ISP in any given
market right if you don't start
comparing like mobile providers which is
what they did for the big thing that
said that everybody's got at least three
ISPs to choose from which was [ __ ]
or shitty DSL lines right you probably
will be first public good versus
commodity now there's important sinks
for everyone here to make because of the
comment we hear from left view support
any role of government at all that means
this is socialism but it's not according
to definition that we'd refund something
else I think it also matters of
constitutional parameters of government
right what the Constitution defines what
no it's not you talk about
redistributing the redistribution the
common means of production or
distribution so if you want to frame
that in I certainly wouldn't say that
that's the police the military police
would be socialists but um don't move on
so what the kid said is literally true
if you pay for a police force you're
probably paying more if you're more
wealthy if it's taxed on property
because a more expensive property at the
same percentage is gonna be more money
if you're taxed on income right we have
a progressive even if you're playing a
flat tax which we don't we have a
progressive taxation system do you even
playing a flat tax
you're more you're paying more if you're
more wealthy right so no even even the
even the public goods that you talk
about here are being taken
disproportionately from wealthy people
to distribute it to poor people Denmark
Norway Sweden successful examples of
socialism because I would become your
definition of socialism and I think the
idea there taking something you haven't
earned to give it someone else is
morally reprehensible
regardless of the reason because social
and can only be enacted to the threat of
violence that's really what taxes are at
the end of the day we all agree on that
okay well I don't believe any part of
life or someone with guns to come in if
I don't pay for timeat healthcare
justice bream is that okay the gut I
mean violence is a part of life for
[ __ ] everything who enforces anything
from from a private business right well
likely if you violate something for the
private business of rivaling
he's private property how are you gonna
how you're gonna secure that property
what a dumb [ __ ] point to bring up I
hate this guy he's so dumb this IDs
Crowder has lost the argument and he
knows it so now because the kid called
him autistic which he shared up cuz
crowd no you shouldn't I'm sorry cuz
that's a mean word you should never say
that okay but because the kid used this
insult Crowder is going to focus on this
for the rest of the conversation cuz he
is totally out of his [ __ ] depth
because he's talking to somebody they
can actually question him past like one
or two levels of like what he's capable
of talking about look at how smug the
studios cuz he knows that he knows that
Crowder is totally [ __ ]
[Music]
thanks myself it's like you have a
non-aggression principle until you
brought that up
- final toothpick here well it tends to
be characterized by an over over
emphasis on logic and philosophy the
poster reality you know it's very easy
to argue from syllogisms and axioms and
all that because paragraphs we didn't I
don't think he said anything there that
was confusing when he used the term
autistic as an insult he's saying it's
somebody that theorizes government from
from concepts and theories and axioms
instead of like the pragmatic
implementation of said government right
I don't think that was too confusing to
follow if you're a youtuber then I was
[ __ ] two million [ __ ] subs nothing
that he said there should be too
confusing for you to understand right
what is crowder 2.3 million subs or some
[ __ ]
2.4 million that you shouldn't have gone
over you but okay buddy autism if i'm
not mistaken and i would love for you
bring this up is really more in
philosophy and theology than theology
that's what you believe so I want to go
back hopefully keeping it civil you know
I wouldn't call you [ __ ] you know I
wouldn't say that you do this let's keep
this very simple so looking back to
Sweden Denmark Norway as examples you
pointed to them a successful example of
social he said I know you wanna point to
the USSR Venezuela or these places but
really we should be Scandinavian
countries why between the working class
in the upper class there is a commitment
of the state okay so first off I agree
with you first off the overall
well-being systems in tremendous thing I
think we don't want anyone here wants a
better society wants a better America I
don't think that you want any worse
America I hope you don't believe I want
worse America despite the fact you
implant I might be autistic I think I
don't know what's best for America
[Music]
to office campus but URIs your reasoning
there and correct me when you said there
isn't the same kind of job the
inequality gap that was your I want to
speak and lawn repair does see the fun
meant frames there was Denmark Norway
Sweden they're examples because our
success with a higher quality of living
in the main purpose you in desperation
use where there's less inequality gap am
I correct I when I was urban again okay
so your problem is gonna call oh shoot
holding any one second hold on what's
immoral about inequality and everybody
has social obligations but if you have a
situation where people are being prosper
people are going down so what he's
actually saying is actually like
empirically true [ __ ] we should well
someday we'll go over this on unstrained
maybe tonight but like income inequality
is actually like a good predictor of
like crime and whatnot it's actually a
bad thing in and of itself I didn't used
to believe this but but then I got
linked to it like a meta-analysis showed
this income inequality in and of itself
is actually a bad thing I wasn't aware
of that before but Crowder makes a lot
of good points and when he does Steven
you should say Sian Crowder hasn't made
a single good point for anything what
tell me a good point that you think that
Crowder made here and I'll address it
yeah
Crowder has no idea what the [ __ ] he's
talking about he's literally giving you
babbies first introduction to autism Oh
libertarianism that's that's essential
he's doing government bad social bad and
all probable ISM good and everything
that's that's the only thing Crider said
this entire time if you think he's made
a good point I would love to hear it he
was explaining but we've cut him off you
[ __ ] inbred Tommy no but I would
argue that they're two very different
things because I would say and I think
probably agree that the free enterprise
westernized capital system is but more
people operating system existence and if
you look at countries he said don't
point to cut you like as well or true
socialist economies
there's romanís equality but everyone is
equally poor um so the problem you have
is with poverty it sounds like I think
we both have a problem that we want
solve ways to eliminate as much poverty
as possible it's not just poverty and
quality matters too because if you have
inequality of wealth you're gonna have
an upper class that control the
political system and security it's only
interest aside the interest of the
people
okay well a lot of the time you are
trying to align yourself with this point
of view you choose not to see what he's
trying to say tell me what I'm not
seeing please tell me what I'm please
please tell me what I'm not seeing
please tell me let's say people are you
know I think because beginner leftist
view anything you're not really liberal
but I can tell you by your role in
economics that you Dooley more left me
the zero-sum game
wealthy people can't get wealthy off of
the back to four people if they make
them more poor that's kind of we're
talking about motives wait okay then why
is it that median real wages have
[ __ ] stagnated in the United States
for so [ __ ] long if that's true give
me a bigger give me a bigger time gap
like Christ median wages in the US have
been oh my god and this in this axis
city has anything about a huge have
stagnant for like [ __ ] 30 years what
the [ __ ] what what you're saying this is
the big problem that I haven't a lot of
conservatives is they don't actually not
only I they're wrong and everything not
only are they theoretically incorrect
because their philosophy and their
political theory is so shallow and I
don't know any political theory and I
know that but they're also empirically
incorrect they're demonstrably wrong
like look at the [ __ ] data right we
have massive studies that show how
immigration impacts native wages we have
the data on the median real wages of
American workers its stagnated for a
long [ __ ] time we can see the gap
between productivity in real wages
rising and not wages adjusted for
oh yeah I can hear you what's up buddy
I'm the chumps - put it on your sub
really yeah I gathered that much well
with that I I gathered that much what's
up hey talk a little bit about you know
the Iran deal cuz I feel like you're a
little bit uneducated about the Iran
deal yeah sure what about what do you
think I'm uneducated about it well first
I want to say that of Obama or the or
John Kerry's save the Iranian regime but
the regime was on the words of collapse
economic clap okay and that deal another
point I want to make wait wait what is
that points supposed to mean where what
what are you bringing it up for what do
you mean are you implying that it would
be good if Iran were to collapse well
well I'm not a big fan of the Iranian
regime I'll tell you does and are you
under the impression that if it
collapses something better or more
preferential to America will replace it
or outcome yeah but do you think a
regime change is always going to be
beneficial to America in that recent
region of the world I mean I mean not
all countries but definitely Iran I mean
they're gone during a lot of terrorists
the Middle East so Saudi Arabia how is
regime change working right now for
Syria is that is that benefiting the
rest of the world do you think or I mean
no it's not and it's apples and apples
Syria is a state that is not Allegiant
to the United States we're supporting
regime change in Syria Iran is a state
that's not Allegiant to the United
States and now you want to support
regime change in Iran a regime that we
help kind of bill by the way but support
of regime change I want the people of
Iran
what they want for their government if
they want origination age we should
support them okay a lot of people in
Iran legitimately hate the US for good
reason though so I don't think you would
necessarily want them because we [ __ ]
with it because the whole Iranian
Revolution was furred on by it by us
support what do you mean there's it
because people literally chant death to
America in parts of Iran there are
people in Iran that really don't like
the US but good reason wait you think
that the only way you can hate the
United States is if you're a puppet you
don't think anybody in the Middle East
has a legitimate reason to hate the US
the majority of Iranians they might have
some kind of they might not trust the
American government but that's
irrelevant because they want a secular
government and Iran is a theocracy okay
where are the words that regime was on
the words of Kalev then Obama threw them
a like that deal yeah let's move on I
would consider this to be positive
generally States collapsing is not
usually in the interest of anybody in
the absence of any type of like central
power usually vacuums form and then a
lot of bad [ __ ] happens like terrorist
groups or more extremist regimes can
come in or mass migration if countries
get destroyed like in Syria like but but
but I mean I mean it was a good
possibility it's pretty rare that like a
state completely collapses and then
there's a very peaceful transition to a
more democratic government that just
also happens to be more allegiance to
the u.s. afterwards I mean like that's a
pretty exceptional like scenario that
you're fantasizing about there no oh I
ran right now what about Iran right now
I mean a little bit regards to what
specifically and the people are
demanding a new government why do you
think that is that's beneath what do you
think this is happening like right after
Trump
out of the Iran deal I don't know I
would have to go and look up
specifically what you're talking about
okay cuz I don't know what sources
you're using for this like Wow well
let's let's move let's move past this
and tell me tell me what else do you
hate about the Arend deal I guess I
thought that the deals could have some
well first of all I didn't like the part
where we unfroze the assets that was
owed to I mean not owed to them but it
would be it would be the previous
government money to be unfroze you know
about that right that's me yeah we
unfroze their assets is where a lot of
Republicans claim that we shipped them
millions of dollars or whatever 100
Mendell even though it was their money
yeah it was it's not the corn bridging
money oh sure but it was how do you know
into the state of Iran but but like what
the Iranian people the money is going
through again yeah it's gonna be really
hard to get me on board with criticizing
Iran for supporting terrorist
organizations when we're friendly with
all of the Gulf states like you're not
gonna get me on board with that um if
you want to be super critical about
about terrorism that's fine but then we
need to talk about why we support
countries like Saudi Arabia which is the
biggest like supporter of terrorism in
the Middle East when it comes to Sunni
[ __ ] right Isis or the civil war in
Yemen like I mean so you're it's really
hard to bring me on board with that I
don't want to do this because of
terrorism means it's gonna be really
hard to get me over there so like else
do you think was a bad deal well okay so
like let's focus on like the principal
part of the deal okay because I'll make
one quick point right yeah go for yeah
go for it I'm probably repeating myself
but Iran if you go I want you to look up
a interview with the Prince of Iran who
was exiled and when the regime fell he
said Iran even hit him he's an educated
man he's from Iran and he knows the
situation better than me and you was on
words of collapse and there were people
there were all
unawarded of a regime change okay but
you're making this the reason why this
is good for you is because you're making
the assumption that that receipt regime
change would turn out positively for the
United States you have no idea if that's
how it would actually happen yeah but
these assumptions have been made in the
past and they haven't worked out as well
as they but look at what happened in the
with the Arab Spring right that started
in Tunisia where regime change happen
incredibly positively but then when that
was repeated in other parts of the
Middle East
it didn't happen anywhere near as nicely
as it did in Tunisia I I just don't like
this assumption I feel like we're
playing because if you want to play up
your fantasy hypothetical then your
argument is totally right like we should
have let Iran collapse and then a really
super good democracy would have come in
that loves America and doesn't support
at least the bad terrorists in the
Middle East and I mean like if we're
playing in that fantasy world then sure
I can agree with you but you can't give
me any assurance that any regime change
in Iran would be positive for the region
or for the United States interests like
hello testing one two three okay I think
he's having connection troubles it feels
like um I can't really know for sure it
without talking to him more but it
sounds like he has like this oh he just
just kind of good [ __ ] I'm sure he'll
come back it feels like he has this idea
that like and I noticed a lot of
conservators have this idea that America
is like the global good guy that America
is very much like the good guy around
the world and that the more you let
people fight amongst themselves and the
good guys win people around the world
will all love America like I think
that's like a big conservative idea that
give people the ability to rebel against
the government and the next government
that comes will always be somebody that
loves America that's why I think I get
that feeling or I get that feeling
talking to this guy that might not be
what he feels like though
what active a gets under and I don't
like molten straight do you agree with
those that would label Trump and his
supporters as fascists I I think there
is I think you can fairly call Trump
fascists and the people that support a
lot of what he moves and a lot of the
directs that he moves I think you could
I think you can make good arguments for
him being a fascist kind of person this
kind of like goal decentralized power
this goal to attack the media and
silence critics this kind of like
ultra-nationalism that he pushes which
he very much does I think that if we
were to go and read if we were to like
read the definition of fascism I think
Trump has like moved in a direction that
matches a lot of that kind of rhetoric
pretty well how come no gameplay I can't
show gameplay on YouTube it's part of my
torch contract Trump's far right but
he's not fascist I don't even know if I
would agree that Trump is far-right
actually but I think you can make strong
arguments for fascism
fascism is the marriage of corporatism
in the state what I've never heard of
that before that might be true but I've
never heard of that though I'll just go
with a wiki definition fascism is a form
of radical authoritarian
ultra-nationalism characterized by
dictator dictatorial forests forcible
suppression of opposition and control of
Industry and Commerce which came to
prominence in early 20th century Europe
I guess control of Industry and Commerce
could be the marriage of corporatism in
the state is that fascists believe that
liberal democracies obsolete and they
regard the complete mobilisation of
society under its at allit aryan
one-party state is necessary to prepare
a nation for armed conflict to respond
effectively to economic difficulties
such as status led by a strong leader
such as a dictator and a martial
government composed to the members of
the governing fascist party to forge
national unity and maintain a stable and
orderly society fascism rejects
assertions that violence is
automatically negative in nature and
views political violence war and
imperialism as means that can achieve
natural rejuvenation fascists advocate a
mixed economy with the principal goal of
achieving autarky through protectionist
and interventionalist
economic policies I mean aiding Trump
matches up with most of us like pretty
well but
fascism is a socialist ideology isn't
from a governmental point of view isn't
socialism pretty decentralized like
differ because you have like different
different like worker owned not coops
but like different worker owned
coalition's like across the country and
[ __ ]
I don't think socialism is unified under
government is it I could be wrong on
that I need to take a good political
theory class social is another range of
economic social systems characterized by
social ownership a democratic control of
the means of production as well as the
political theories movements associated
with them socialism ownerships may refer
to public collective or cooperative
ownership or to citizens ownership of
equity there are many varieties of
socialism and there's no single
definition and capsulate in all of them
okay so maybe some form communism is
stateless uh yeah I know that communism
is stateless but socialism doesn't
necessarily have to be stateless sure
the debate guy is back okay all right
hey what up buddy wait can you hear me
hello I'm talking to you crypto you're
dragged and shot
whenever you talk about socialism it
seems like you almost talk about
communism yeah they're very close in my
mind the only socialism and communism is
that I think communism is the complete
absence of a state other than that I
wouldn't be able to give you concrete
differences between socialism and
communism oh also I don't think
socialism implies a government whereas
communism implies the absence of
government like I think technically
socialism can exist under democracy or
totalitarian dickship could it maybe I
don't know like socialism could exist
under a variety of government types I
think but communism implies no no
government like socialism I don't think
is a commentary on the government at all
but I could be wrong I'm not sure from a
political standpoint they are very
different yeah it's possible I just
don't know the difference between the
two would you classify Scandinavian
countries of socialist most of those are
still free-market mixed economies are
whatever aren't there mix markets Marx
never made a distinction between
socialism communism oh yeah well I'm not
reading Das Kapital [ __ ] that [ __ ]
communism implies central ownership
right while socialism is local citizen
ownership that sounds I didn't know
communism implied central ownership I
could be wrong on that but I would have
to I knew we one day we'll spend a we'll
spend a whole day reading that wiki okay
guys socialism I'm an economic policy
whereas communism with a political
philosophy yeah that's what I kind of
thought but
stop listening to these people they
don't know [ __ ] damn communism is quote
unquote enforced through revolution it's
an interesting that seems like a kind of
a biased way of looking at it I mean
capitalism isn't forced through state
violence so I'm you know I don't know it
seems kind of like you is kind of loaded
but crypto why am i muted I don't think
you're muted you're just your microphone
is not working buddy right click server
mute server no you're not muted at all I
got in contact with Marty Jo's manager
he said he'd check out your [ __ ] Wow
buddy
what do you mean is that communism
fascism revolutionary movements have
built heavily on this idea okay sure
everyone just talking about past
countries that like socialism can only
happen after a revolution maybe for
communism people need to seize the means
of production so at the end of the day
either peaceful or violent revolution is
required for to happen oh sure sure sure
to get from capitalism to communism with
socialism you don't think you could vote
your way there does it have to be by
force I don't know what capitalists ever
willingly give up their capital seems
like they probably wouldn't
[ __ ] I'm dude
there is no unified fascist plan you
sure about that
Jordon Peterson's talks about that
unified Marxist [ __ ] or whatever
Krypto your mics not working buddy maybe
try restarting discord
when you Diana Ness semester did miss
Herman Diana's SSF character as a young
donor myself I've been having a hard
time justifying owning gun due to the
current political climate I enjoy going
to the range and hunting but no matter
my reason for owning a gun I'm still
looked at as some crazy person who needs
guns to defend myself I also do not have
my CCL concealed carry license CCL we
call them CC W's in Nebraska uh yeah I
don't know dude it's really hard I mean
people might look at me as crazy because
I like guns their own guns whatever but
um yeah I mean it's a fair I don't know
I to be honest I so I assume people are
crazy when they say they own guns so so
I don't know dude maybe maybe I'm a big
hypocrite yeah I don't know most gun
owners are [ __ ] crazy I like I really
like guns a lot but like damn dude gun
owners are [ __ ] so stupid and they're
irresponsible schmuck in the US as well
like if there was like a thing if there
was some meme to get rid of all the guns
in the US not just ban them but actually
get rid of them so people couldn't still
use them illegally I would probably vote
YES on it as much as it would be kind of
sad or whatever to lose some thing
that's kind of recreational me I'd
probably vote YES on it like [ __ ]
people in the US are [ __ ] stupid and
they probably don't deserve guns there
was there's a good is it Jim Jefferies I
always say I always [ __ ] his name of tzm
Jefferies or Jeff Jefferies the
Australian dude has a pretty good skit
unlike gun ownership in the US
where do you draw the line
well guns like something that exists
only for recreation but what about Emma
hunter ninety-nine percent of the time
okay guns are generally for recreation
okay well even hunting is usually for
recreation well what about in the one
city where it's sometimes have you
killed the deer it keeps the
overpopulation
ninety-nine percent of the time guns and
gun related [ __ ] are for recreation
maybe we can make an exception for
people that actually hunt for
conservation reasons or some shed but
generally just for recreation so
something that exists it's only for
recreation that has a massive negative
detriment in the country in terms of
like killing people and [ __ ] is probably
not good although arguably does it even
have like a massive like detriment and
how many people have to die for this to
be like outlawed I'm not even actually
sure what the answer to that is
what about fans cards that's let's just
say fancy cars
how else I Second Amendment advocates
supposed to justify a hobby that gets
people killed they have to claim that
it's for self-defense or have it to have
a defensible position at all oh maybe I
think it got fixed I'm really hungry
okay so we got to wrap this [ __ ] up
what's up buddy can you talk now
hey I can hear you what's up okay so
yeah I was I was gonna make a point
about the Iranian people who they want
to move tower the more secular
government they no longer wants to be
governed by religious nut dough that run
the current government in Iran and I
think that they should have the right to
protest and do it have the right to a
regime thing okay I mean they already
have the right to protest and whatnot
don't they yeah they don't have the
right because Iran Iranian government
they like all right I'm sorry I'm sorry
I misspoke when I say right to protest
me like if they want to protest the
government or do like a revolution
whatever that's on them they can do that
right that's like up to them the US
doesn't necessarily have to back that
when the US signs with diesel that Rick
put more money into the wallet of the
the mullahs in Iran it's gonna be a lot
harder for the people to change the
government sure but our responsibility
right now isn't to the people in Iran
that's not who we're looking out for
with the Iran deal our responsibility is
trying to prevent Iran from that's a day
we have in the Middle East America has a
lot of you know a lot of aspects that is
being disrupted by the Iranian
government so it's not putting money in
their wallet it's bad for the Iranian
people that want fed to the government
and for America okay I don't want Iran
to have nuclear weapons that's my
number-one concern
Iran [ __ ] with us while we [ __ ] in
the Middle East is not something that I
care about
that I let's I mean I feel like we
should kind of move on to the meat of
this which is the nuclear weapon thing
it's gonna be again it's gonna be really
hard to get me on board with some type
of like terrorism interest in the Middle
East because I like all that [ __ ] is so
[ __ ] right now anyway and I don't
think we're very honest but we will want
to do there anyway so yeah I don't know
like what I'm just I just I'm not a big
fan and of the can hear me yeah I'm not
all right so so the point of this
holmium right was was to give us like
some interaction with you because like
you never come into discord anymore
except for like yesterday apparently
good so this is gonna be an ama with the
discord meemers if you're subbed and
your [ __ ] is connected on discord and
you can p.m. a question to me or bonkers
and we'll go down the list we got a list
of questions that people already posed
and if you're in the gens sub little
channel or whatever we'll bring you in
when the time is right okay make sure
they are following an Instagram as well
okay yeah be sure that their Instagram
accounts okay hey dude I'm like this is
a great [ __ ] revenue stream because
all these people are gonna sub so they
can me my good I need where I not know
okay how do you even monetize so so
let's start to say in May with why
Instagram white how can you even
monetize that cuz as soon as I get the
rest of my outfit put together I'm gonna
be taking selfies all the time I'm gonna
be so cute people even like oh [ __ ] if
we pay that guy to wear clothes you can
send them travel around the world
[ __ ] a hot rich everything thing
yes that's realistic yeah it's happening
it's gonna happen Stan Lidge okay all
right so you wanna you want to get some
like meme questions out of the way do
you want to talk about the toys you ask
me anything about Elms I'm instantly
leaving
I hope we're not gonna maim in here okay
preventing me Murray okay okay all right
I'm gonna pull you want to talk about
any other meme so you want you want to
just pull somebody in and just [ __ ]
do it dude just do it up let me get a
new path of x0 awesome get in here you
want to ask your question dude you are
alive my duder I I wanted someone else
to ask it but okay I'm sending you know
you can do it wait make him do it make
him do it listen okay axe your question
kid he's shy dude I'm not shy I'm just
in the middle of a very hard dough to
match okay have someone else ask it and
don't [ __ ] him up
all right the first question is from
Austin the question reads do you truly
think you were yourself as a zygote your
brain is not formed and you yourself
parenthesis personality comes from the
neural pathways which are formed over
time in the brain it sounds like a
abortion question I mean no you're
probably not truly yourself I don't know
if you're ever truly yourself because
you I mean like because you're
constantly changing are you truly
yourself when you're six months old I
mean okay okay all right the next
questions from Xena phone good if there
was an alt if there was an alternative
to meet which was lab-grown
it's more or less assignment of the same
nutritional values organic meat would
destiny change his stance on killing
animals parentheses social contracts
and/or go vegan meat I mean if that meat
was equal to or cheaper than current me
environmental impact would probably be
way better are you familiar with the
argument that like that even even the
lab-grown meat isn't like isn't kosher
because they had to get it from an
animal and that breaks the social
contract with the animal at some point
no sounds really done though yeah
alright so you would switch that you
would switch to lab-grown meat good for
you then vegan people we're gonna love
you thanks alright the next question is
from eSports why haven't you gone back
to college and finished a degree clearly
you make enough money and with your
credits you could do one class a
semester and graduate and be graduated
by now are you thinking about going back
to college my do turn on your music it's
a lot of no I go back and I probably got
a philosophy degree if I went back but I
don't know I just have the [ __ ] time
dude to him interesting because the next
question is if you went back to college
of the fresh fresh slate what would you
major in or why I would get a philosophy
degree cuz I think philosophy is [ __ ]
awesome
and I think all the [ __ ] that a little
bit of [ __ ] that I've learned from
philosophy is probably helped me more
than any
else yeah on that note like D are you
because people seem to ask a lot like
his destiny reading like like please
tell destiny to read like this yeah I
read Wikipedia pages every [ __ ] day
dude but I think like like literature
wise you're not reading I ain't got time
for that [ __ ] Plato's the Republic
or anything like that right maybe
someday though alright this is kind of a
meme so much shut sure okay you can he
asked cutie pie to teach him a DC and
League so he can learn what it's doing
some iam dude fence a good one all right
through blit has Destiny's gun stance
change as the anti-gun or pro-gun no I
don't [ __ ] know I like guns and I
like my right to own guns what people
had pretty [ __ ] stupid and every
single day I think people lose their
bless and less freedom because the more
freedom they have the more dumb [ __ ]
decisions they'll make so are you I want
to talk about guns way way way back but
I think that time has passed right you
can seem to I do it now is the
appropriate okay it seems like the
problem with the whole gun meme is that
everyone wants to do like a philosophy
argument about whether or not banning
guns is good or bad and like they
sidestep the entire legal battle in the
United States in which I mean nothing is
32 different arguments you can talk
about the philosophy argument then you
can talk about the legal argument right
yeah but I get I get frustrated that
people are frustrated they're just like
why don't we have change in gun
legislation in the United States like
there's all these philosophical
arguments for it and they have no
inkling of like the actual federal laws
state laws the Court precedent and all
that and that's what you have to fight
right actually oh yeah and you want to
actually change it'd be really [ __ ]
hard because of how much is baked into
the Second Amendment right like I said
got a you got a repeal the Second
Amendment my dude possibly yeah we're
keep my own gun legislate around it what
you got to do yep alright Ben's question
follow-up all right the next question is
from Danny Boy Wow how would you exert
entry to everybody okay
from Danny Boy go for it Danny Boy how
would you explain why you are a
non-believer of religion because there's
no evidence of any higher powers so I'm
gonna believe any of that [ __ ]
so just a blanket statement of non of no
I don't see any evidence in the universe
for any kind of spooky mystical [ __ ]
so I'm not a believer in a new type of
higher power right yeah yeah all right
Attila the weeb would you ever do a talk
show and I've got a follow-up question
to that if I found someone else to
manage every aspect of it for me only to
show up than sharing oh man it almost
sounds like that's a great job for me
you know that setting this up is like
herding cats dude is great that our team
does the hard end herding cats are you
not familiar with that no I don't know
that it's it's very hard to herd cats
they don't like to follow instruction Oh
herd cats yeah I think work to cats I
was getting really confused yeah maybe
I'm gonna get banned for saying this but
like memeing on cake and stuff oh my god
dude
like you you if you've intentionally set
up this discord to put like barriers in
front of your like person I haven't I
can't have it in my mod team gets like
super [ __ ] insane over everything you
gotta take the good with the bad okay
and then like mr. moon wouldn't even
like wouldn't even do a reddit post and
[ __ ] like you didn't want to do anything
yeah because the the stuff with harked
and what Devin seems really really fun I
mean if if like if anybody could already
I could organize it I don't know do you
have a manager no it seems like bringing
like just kind of people like that
interesting people together would be
would be a really neat thing to do like
on a on a Sunday afternoon yeah maybe
it's just the thing is that like my view
for how that it would all work is always
way different than other people's like I
like talking you know harken and Devin
but I don't think I would want to do
that like every single week you think
you'd run out of stuff to talk about no
it's just not the most interesting stuff
I'd like to talk about like
like it to be more unlike more serious
issues so on that note so the is is a
final verdict I guess that the doing
politics on YouTube and other stuff on
Twitch that's not gonna work right I
think I can I got a more serious email
from my youtube I might switch guy I
need to talk to him cuz he [ __ ] clip
everything that ends up on subreddit and
I think he got a little bit worried it
sounded like he was more okay with it
I think his response back to me
yesterday was a little quick and he I
think he took a little bit more time
email me a better response today maybe
see those long as I'm not like targeting
twitch partners or using twitch and then
going off platform and harassing people
I'm probably okay I couldn't have more
serious political discussions okay so
and like I think the big meme with like
a twitch ban is that you can no longer
interact with anybody that wants to be
on that platform like role robot U or L
robot alright so the next question is
from the bread pill is gonna be a
comment yeah two questions now how can
you have strong opinions against forms
of socialism when you don't engage with
any socialist a specialist but I don't
have strong opinions about it I have no
opinions about it that's a litter than
my whole thing I don't are you or you
know unity of literal lefties in my
[ __ ] dis car that is super [ __ ]
ass pain that I don't like constantly
debate the [ __ ] literature whatever
on they've totally hijacked your
attitude so follow-up question oh ho ho
bro the pilot I did wait [ __ ] let me
start over what do you call a gay pilot
see destinies last twitch stream okay
hilarious ma'am alright sorry I go again
I restart that if if the bread pill
males either personal copy of the red
book will you please read it no
okay all right boys you heard him all
right the next question is from Xin Ian
I'd like to ask him about which of the
three qualities the successful streamer
needs to have do you think there's I get
this question like a million [ __ ]
times and it's like people looking for
like what is the secret ingredient the
most important thing is to have
something that makes you stand out from
everybody else that's the most important
thing the second most important thing is
probably to stream like a lot in on a
schedule like people need to be able to
to incorporate you into their daily
schedule at some point and then the
third thing is probably to make sure you
have like all of your bare minimum base
is covered you can't be streaming at
720p 10fps you can't be like you have to
have a decent microphone you can't be
using a headset mic or some [ __ ] link
yeah I pulls it in here cuz he's got a
follow-up as well as an anthem if that
Maximilian guy wants to talk when I'm
done with us we can I don't know what
we'll be talking about but sure I've got
nothing to do with that my Mimar yeah
but no no I'm sorry is not gonna try you
yeah so I'm just kind of curious I got
kind of two questions for you guess you
can pick one of the two oh boy my first
one was um if I mean like you've spoken
before about not suggesting people start
streaming for a job but if one were to
like the if they were to start doing so
do you think that it's actual gameplay
like social conversation or like a
gimmick that's like most important for
the success of their stream I mean it
could be any of those if you're like the
literal best game where like the literal
best player in like a game I mean you
can get viewers that way if you're like
literally the best like or like a super
duper funny dude I mean you can give
yours that way out it's just like it's
just answering that question like why
should I watch you over somebody else
that's like if you have a good answer to
that then you're good to go
that's like the most important thing I
guess and then was our second question I
was just wondering if you thought that
you're at which brand or
if your platforms that were under attack
might have had something to do with sort
of taking a antagonistic stance to like
the right-wing memes on the internet
recently you mean today or did to taking
an antagonistic stance towards
right-wing means lead people to report
my [ __ ] or whatever yeah yeah we're just
wondering if you think that's still
going on oh um it's possible I don't
know tell you hard for me to quantify
that I mean I would say probably but
it's hard for me to actually know for
sure right
yeah and that's that's all my
compressions they're pretty shitty but
thanks dude yeah no problem dude all
right the next question is from Lou PDK
when I say if he's in djenne subs no
he's not all right Lou PDK what's your
view on death aid and how do you tackle
the issues with people at death's door
dealing with these choices aid what is
death aid I wish this person had
messaged me because I would have asked
is a blonde or this one
I'm guessing it's talk about like
end-of-life care death aid why aid is
not working at how there is a better way
for Africa Oh dead aid [ __ ] Oh
assisted suicide who's is that a do some
people say death aid in some places I've
never heard that in my life okay
I mean assisted suicide should be it
should be a right I mean [ __ ] like seems
like people in shutters saying assisted
suicide or euthanasia yeah I mean like
it's your life you should have a right
to end it if you want
Plus pragmatically speaking the general
older population tends to be Republican
so the more of them that go for it the
probably the better so yeah I'm for it
on the philosophical and the pragmatic
side yeah
hola time I'm organizing questions sure
thing all right Jin door asks can you
ask him about D&D campaign and if you
would be allowed to play that during his
ban probably not I'm not gonna [ __ ]
push the boundaries like I I can't show
any gaming stuff on I'm not gonna try to
find anything technically it's not again
one way I'm not gonna try to push
anything like a chess would qualify with
a ban you for playing the oldest game in
the world I don't know actually that's a
good question I would like showing chess
go or a game of kings but you'd have to
play with mr. moon so that'd be a really
short ass dream all right
Gordo if Starcraft 2 were to come back
into the spotlight would we see you play
again um yeah I mean if it would
actually like to be like a resurgence
yeah I would probably play again yeah
for sure yeah I thought about just going
back and like casually playing louder
but [ __ ] is so hard to get motivated for
a game that it seems like that the
community is so small for it I don't
know why it shouldn't be but well but if
the community small ferb League and
people still watch it playing that even
though like they don't like it's like
isn't a live game man if you go to a
[ __ ] if you go to like a college and
they've got like I went to the U you you
wash is it you wash or you never I don't
know what they call it with the
abbreviation is I don't think it's you
wash but the University of Washington
they've got like a league club right a
league club if you go to their league
club it's like [ __ ] 500 people there
dude it's insane
you watch sounds like a washer maybe is
it you dub oh maybe you dub but um yeah
that [ __ ] is crazy man
I don't know maybe I'll incorporate more
starcraft ladder it's also really hard
for me I don't like to play I don't like
to play anything in moderation too which
is something a lot of my fans have a
huge truck or have a lot of trouble
understanding like I don't like to pick
up a game like a competitive game and
play for like thirty minutes a day
that's not fun for me I can't do that
that is absolutely not what I enjoy
doing not a casual game I do
yeah no it's real I can do like
single-player games and share but if I
get into something I'm
going hard and like I can't hello would
you would you consider like a Dark Souls
playthrough Dark Souls pretty Mimi yeah
I've already played through most of that
I think I've done up to three
I played did I beat too much dream I
think I did too three in blood-borne
already the next question is from s park
let me see if he's on the means no he's
not alright s Park asked question for
destiny how do you think living in
Nebraska affects your political views
compared to if you Liddy how do you
think living in Nebraska affects your
political views your political views do
they live in what the long would you
have different political views if you
lived in like a big mainstream city oh
maybe I don't know yeah I guess kind of
comparatively speaking sure but I mean I
don't know I don't know it would
obviously impact me it's impossible for
me to say how it would impact me maybe I
would have grown up liberal and become
conservative maybe I would grow up as a
[ __ ] idiot or maybe I grow a smarter
it's impossible for you to say I have an
idea I can't predict what my life would
be like if I grew up in a totally
different place I'd have no idea I can't
even speculate all right I'm gonna pull
through blood and he's gonna ask a
follow-up oh boy hey Ferb let your live
dude you ready you got a question about
PACs yeah question about PACs yeah oh my
god meet you on stream I saw you I met
you
two years ago at PAX and I got your
signature I'm just wondering are you
going to PACs this year um Peg's we're
tax prime or cattle or whatever yes
what's the date think it's I think
September first to like or August 31st
to September 3rd
August um maybe I don't have any plans
to do it right now whether that might
change in the future are you guys going
to Japan around that time um I don't
[ __ ] know do
maybe maybe okay
can I give a shout-out to chat okay [ __ ]
no [ __ ] off get him out of here
everybody nope I got you I love you Gigi
chat oh dude no matter the twitch people
that like twitch that doesn't even exist
right now
Oh riperino voice alright so zero zero
what does destiny think of this
California Supreme Court ruling
unanimous unanimously that just because
of law is impossible to comply with
doesn't give you a basis for challenging
/ overturning it that's like a legal
ma'am I don't know I talked to be more
familiar with the ruling and what it
concerns itself with zero zero if you
want to be him about that jump into Jen
sobs if you're subscribed we'll do that
later
all right Danny Boy you go to unmute
yourself my duder your life oh you had a
question about tournaments yeah
so I remember I used to watch you
destiny uh around 2011/12 in stock up to
you I was kind of wondering when you
obtained somewhat semi competitive
that's competitive did you ever like
this is the last last personal
conversation about my personal
viewpoints that I will ever have okay oh
I get moved
you got moved I'm moving you around what
up dude hi hi how you doing I'm doing
great what the [ __ ] time is it over
there some crazy [ __ ] right now isn't it
I am I mean that that is crazy [ __ ]
sometimes for me when I'm waking up
later in the afternoon when I'm
streaming bit luckily for me at least at
this point I have a normal sleeping
pattern Oh something that is unusual for
me Paul alright well what's up buddy I
made a video that you really didn't like
I watched your response to it you you
were really not happy but I as I said in
the email to you people informed me that
you are really sick of talking about
this like and perhaps that was why you
seemed to dislike me so much um why
don't just like you I mean why I mean am
I just like I don't know you well enough
just like you but basically one issue
that they're like the content sure one
issue that I basically ran into a lot
and I've actually further furthers the
first topic that I've ever come to this
decision I'm probably not I'm probably
going to obscure the my I guess my the
deeper parts of my moral system from now
on because it's actually incredibly
frustrating for me to talk about is that
what I run into is when I have
conversations of sometimes political
conversations will reduce to philosophy
I I would argue that this should always
happen because we want to figure out you
know like well what we do in terms of
any you know policy decision but the
problem that I run into when things
reduce down to philosophy is there are
certain arguments that I've gotten into
where when I lay out my rational
justification for whatever it is I
believe the counter arguments are
literally you're lying about what you
think and there's no possible way for me
to get it to have a conversation with
somebody that thinks I'm literally just
lying about everything I say so it ends
up feeling like really really really
[ __ ] stupid to me I mean I mean the
the only time I think the underlying
philosophy behind your views really
matters is when you both don't agree on
role you don't have a mutual goal if you
both have a mutual goal then it then
just becomes like a factual
one of the facts look like how do we
achieve this goal right it would only
matter where your underlying philosophy
is if you're trying to convince a person
to adopt a goal that you have based on
yeah sure like say so there are
extremists that I'll talk to where say
it'll be somebody like a white
nationalist if somebody is preaching for
ethno or race race policies race based
policies this is probably going to come
down to a discussion of philosophy at
some point at almost but necessarily
have to because we're after very
different like normative goals right
would you agree with that oh I like the
the the point I would try to raise in my
video which perhaps I didn't do it well
is that you should almost never be able
to convince another person just based on
your words that's you that you have an
underlying philosophy that they've has
never run into before or that is just so
out so left field that it effectively
seems impossible and you saying multiple
times oh this is what I believe this is
how I assess myself this is how I view
it it doesn't matter how many times you
say it
they shouldn't believe you because it
doesn't matter how you know confident
you yeah I guess but like what is the
what is the point of that
like like let's say I get up to an
argument somebody let's say I get into
an argument about somebody about
redistribution of wealth okay in the
United States now I would argue I'm okay
with with a decently higher rate of
Taxation on myself I'm fine with that
you can bump it up you know double
digits like we can talk about a much
greater you know bump here and if
somebody say me well you know I would
never met anybody that would give up
their own money you're not it's not like
you're volunteering to donate your taxes
to the IRS you don't do it every year so
I'm not gonna believe that position like
okay well how do we how do we discuss
things from this point when you
literally think I'm lying about what it
is I believe well at that point you can
kind of try to get them to think about
other circumstances in their lives like
oh you know have you ever met someone
who has given up money to someone else
or have you met people on the street who
are advocating for these policies like
it should you should argue with them and
say this shouldn't be that unbelievable
for you people are posting Bernie
Sanders in your track right now look at
Bernie Sanders there should be something
you should be except usually I'd accept
about me because you have similar
experiences in your life that make a
plausible um it's just the point I was
raising in
guys too like you know when you say I'm
only self-interested that should be up
very unusual for most people because in
our lives we we run into people who
either are willing to make those
statements or or at least you know
proclaim the opposite oh I really care
about people and people seem to act all
the time in a way that where they care
about other people just simply because
there are the people right I once you
get to that point where you can't argue
from their experiences to to make what
you're what you're saying seem more
plausible you're stuck and and there's
nothing you can really do about that I
think unless you can somehow in your
chair demonstrate look I really don't
give a [ __ ] about people stab a person
in the face for completely no reason
like you you can't do that of course and
that's why I was trying to say in the
video like a lot of your viewers would
be unjustified accepting many of the
things you say about yourself or your
self assessments because there are more
evidenced explanations for your self
assessments namely self delusion or like
oh saying like I I don't I don't know
how you would disagree with this sorry
so I need to go out and like find a way
to secretly murder someone and then that
like if you really convinced if you
really wanted segments a person of
another viewpoint but at the end of the
day it might just be impossible for you
to convince that person right like if
you you shouldn't do this unless you
really really care about convincing this
other person that you're telling the
truth or what-have-you which you
shouldn't really care all that much
right there's some conversation while I
don't generally I agree with you that I
don't really care the the the big
primary issue this ran into though was
the veganism debate which exposed that
my underlying motivations I think for a
lot of my arguments are far different
than a lot of other people's or rather
I've I guess I've deluded myself into
thinking that some of my underlying
arguments are different than other
people's but of course it's it's not
necessarily the case that you are
deluded but we we each have the capacity
for self-delusion I would argue maybe
that we're all somewhat self deluded
right it's it'd be very given they were
using weasel words now because the the
gist of the video was that I'm probably
more diluted than most if I'm claiming
something that's far outside the norm
right that was the general thesis of the
video or at least like Mike's I was
well my point was at least fuel least
for your viewers if they don't have
experience that suggests that what
you're saying about yourself is capable
for other humans or that that that is
capable for people to have positions
that you hold explanation such as self
delusion and lying are more justified
than believing what you're saying to be
true simply on the base simply given the
justification you've currently given
which is I'm saying is true
which is all you presented thus far but
that's as I said you that's all you can
present because it's not like you can
start stabbing people in the face in
your room to demonstrate that you don't
really care about people right sure the
point of video was pretty mundane it was
effectively arguing that for non mundane
claims there's a certain burden of proof
that you perhaps in your room are unable
to meet for a lot of your viewership and
they would in that case be more
justified evidenced explanations then
the non evidence explanations which
would be what you're saying being true
oh yeah I guess I mean it just makes it
sound like then that I can never discuss
like certain moral positions that I have
because I haven't actually murdered
someone to prove that I don't care about
another person even though murdering
someone myself in a significant amount
of like physical uncomfort discomfort
because I'm probably gonna get a [ __ ]
charge for [ __ ] murder or that I need
to go hissing or something and like
never knowed like shoot a deer like in
the leg and then go skinned it alive or
some [ __ ] and then I'm like okay look
now will you guys take me seriously I
don't know these just I guess no I feel
like a lot of people like won't like
engage with the point for politeness or
for simply just the enjoyment of your
content you may as well just accept what
destiny says about himself is true well
talk about you in the third person a
little bit because whether or not you're
speaking true about yourself doesn't
really matter for your viewers right if
you're telling the truth all that you're
deluded it doesn't really change how
correct your arguments are well impact
the lives of your I mean movie I would
agree with you in a vacuum but socially
that's absolutely not true the way that
most people engage with my position is
especial
as of recently is to just say that I'm
lying about everything I think that's
the main reason why I guess it like so
if I back up so if I back up and I try
to ascertain them the main message of
your video I meant well if I think about
it I would probably agree that if
somebody claims to be holding an
incredibly abnormal position that you're
more likely to believe that that
position is untrue rather than to
believe the person given no evidence of
an extremely abnormal claim is that more
or less the position
yes and yeah as I instead I made in the
video we're just to establish that we
have good reason to believe that
everyone has the capacity for
self-delusion sure which is true but I
guess the problem we're running into is
that as of recently like that thought
that I'm just lying to everybody is used
to hand-wave all of the arguments that
I've made that concerning anything
related to like ethics or whatever which
is kind of irritating because I can't
counter that if you just say that I'm
lying about any thoughts yeah I don't
know how you could solve that problem
like for me for example I've explained
most things using self-interest like
most people's actions and motivations
stuff using self-interest for quite a
long time nothing you say about yourself
appears difficult for me to accept the
one thing that I mentioned in you've
made statements like chin
mahalo you're my kind of face I've made
the same as like what oh yeah I think
it's something like your mental
foundation that all of your motivations
come from is your desire to continue to
exist this I had trouble with with you
saying misremembering or no I think
that's probably true like I but but I
genuinely like when I try to build these
arguments for myself like this is
generally what I see is my being is real
a position as I guess it can ever be I
don't know you know I don't you might
just I think I cut off a lot I don't
know if we're talking to your son I'm
just oh yeah that's fine if you're
mumbling that's fine but if you're
trying to say stuff it's not thinking of
you oh [ __ ] I I know why I'm so I'm
using the
voice activation uh the the browser
discord instead of the lis actually I
can I just change for saying I'm sure go
for it
hello oh hey what's up hi yeah sorry I I
don't do many voice conversations on
discord and I had push-to-talk on
because I was talking to a someone from
Razer a few days ago I don't know why
anyway okay yeah so all I was saying is
so how bad was the audio previously dude
it was actually really good I was just
like cutting off what oh yeah I don't
know why that the browser discord does
that to me but anyway um so what I was
saying is you you've made statements
about like the the fundamental
motivation that you have and I find
those hard to believe because well for
similar reasons that we're talking about
before I've never run into a person who
couldn't be given a hypothetical about
some form of existence that they
wouldn't rather death over over that
existence right so would you be willing
to exist experiencing nothing but pain
and suffering for an eternity yeah I
mean I mean I've made that concession
multiple times that like in general I
would say that like I would I would
endure a large amount of suffering to
continue to exist because I find
existing almost universally purple not
existing but like if you would have cut
off like my ears and cut out my eyes and
cut off all my limbs and I was just like
rolling around on the ground it's like a
deaf and blind blob and yeah I mean yeah
at that point I would probably rather
just die sure like I agree with that
because I don't see existence as the the
main thing like it doesn't it's not the
end it's the means to the end like
there's a lot of things that I value
about existence and for that reason I
want to continue to exist but if you
remove to those things from existence I
wouldn't see existence as valuable
anymore because it would lose you know
the ability to achieve those things
gotcha
maybe because the default state that I
experience is generally happiness maybe
that's what ties my value into existence
sure like I could I hear that sometimes
would you be willing to like I assume
you don't like pain suffering terror
things like that um be you enjoy
happiness satisfaction yeah I mean those
are mustard tautological right paying by
definition is something not enjoyed
sorry yeah
I mean some people do enjoy pain well
but then it's not pain in the sense
we're talking right oh I guess I mean
you beating pleasure yeah yeah like it
like so many medias I wouldn't say they
enjoy suffering when they say suffering
they don't mean like suffering like it's
bad suffering like a pain that feels
good as different yeah would you I offer
you 20,000 years of life let's say but
for the first 10,000 years you will
experience the highest levels of Terror
pain and suffering imaginable but after
that 10,000 years you would experience
10,000 more years of happiness joy
satisfaction the things that you value
would you take this deal without getting
was really stupid about it I would say
yes yes unbelievable to me sure the only
the only caveat I would say just in case
is it like obviously if the earth blows
up in 1,000 years and I'm floating
through space for the last ten thousand
years with nobody to interact with I
mean I would obviously say no but but
yeah in general yeah I would definitely
say yes to that ten thousand years of
life yeah at the expense of ten thousand
years of suffering for sure yeah yeah in
that order of course that's the yeah for
sure
all the people a lot of that's what this
isn't surprising to me I this is
something that can totally accept about
you but it's a position that I myself
would not hold but he said that's how I
envisioned myself like I don't really
know of course I was getting back there
self-assessments extrapolation blah blah
blah for sure my most likely judgment is
that I wouldn't accept such a deal yeah
I agree with that and I even agree that
most people probably wouldn't although I
feel like most people view and I may I
know I could be self-deluded but I feel
like most people do have a radically
different view of existence than I do in
terms of whether or not you value it or
run out like there's a ton of memes
where people joke about like oh like I
wish I was dead or like this is
suffering my life whatever where I
absolutely unequivocally totally reject
and disagree with these statements I
absolutely enjoy every single day of my
existence and I look forward to every
single day of my existence and I exist
in a state of perpetual contentedness
with life such that I would want to
continue with you know infinitely like
when people you wrestle with a question
like would you want to be immortal or
not well I'd have to watch all my family
die but I wouldn't think for a second I
would instantly say yes to that without
a second thought for sure you think
immortal as in like you have eternal
life or immortal as and you can't die I
some some balance of those two where I'm
not again where I'm not like floating
into eternity like in a void
where nothing is happening but like we
said that I could live to the final days
of humanity I would say absolutely yes
like and not be like old and decrepit
and dying in a bed the whole time or
something
the the ideal eternal after me is
perfect health living forever [ __ ] you
can kill yourself that's the oh sure
that you can die yeah seems like the
best move you have perfect control of
your fate which I think most people want
ok sham control and so most of what you
said here you know ass wages my you know
qualms with what you're saying okay so
in my mind then you're the exact root of
all your motivation can't be existence
if you're willing to give up existence
so into like you you likely have because
proving knows you likely have many
different things that motivate you
equally in some balance at the core of
your being and existence poly and major
part of that right because I mean if
you're willing to give up existence
under some conditions it cannot be the
pure thing that you're trying to to
maintain all the things that in that all
the motivations come from oh sure so
what you're essentially saying is that
my claim is that I value existence in
and of itself but what you're arguing is
well that's not true you value existence
but that's contingent upon some some
type of existence right some quality of
the quality is what I'm using existence
is a proxy for right yeah yeah i i'm i
think i agree with that i would have to
think about that a lot but but that's
probably true because of my existence
was constant misery then i'm then i
might not agree with that that existence
in and of itself is a good quality or
whatever possibly yeah yeah and and the
way that i would argue that in the past
is i would say that it is good but
that's because in mentally I'm thinking
that at some point I would escape the
misery but that's not necessarily true
right I understand what you're saying
yeah because it many people when they're
in bad situations they say well you know
this is a bad situation now but in the
future I'm gonna feel happy or it might
get better but if that wasn't the case
it would be I think national for people
all right here we go are you going to
explain your morals one last time as
well probably not if you don't
understand it right now you never will
it's not worth me [ __ ] tearing my
hair out doing this [ __ ] about how some
of his audience has trouble accepting
some of the things that he says like you
know his morality is some of the things
relate to his well view what people
leaves motivate his behavior our actions
that he says that he would be willing to
undertake um I want to show you a clip
from this video and afterwards explain
why I think that is probably the case
this is actually one of the most
difficult things I disarmed ice cream is
that I make a lot of argument in favor
of progressive social policies when I
like probably the most regressive like
twitch stream into my politics there are
a lot I always say things like no I'm
very supportive Asian comes from and
just recently I have pretty big scuse me
my fan base where people were like some
people we know kamsani came up and
people found out like holy [ __ ] this is
like a really really [ __ ] well now I
realize there are a lot of people like
there are pot of me wants to go back in
find my sack textbooks to justify some
of what I'm going to say but I mean Isis
the [ __ ] you to be the maybe watch along
with I just cos it is my news
[Music]
thanks hitman goes on the topic of then
it is true that we don't know what we're
capable of like when people say oh I'd
never eat a person if I was starting on
a on a island somewhere we don't
actually know that to be the case it is
shown in psychology that we are not
innately one way there's only an aspect
of personal context context we act a
large part because of the context of our
senses rather this first whole part is
such a [ __ ] waste of time I can't
even believe somebody would think it was
smart to record such a stupid [ __ ]
waste of time well for the Charlie
problem if there was one person on one
track five people on the other and the
trolley was headed towards five would
you pull the lever to redirect you to
the one hmm
yeah I think I would do that well you
can't truly know you would do that if
you've never been in the situation yeah
no [ __ ] [ __ ] Sherlock the point of a
hypothetical is to test your
philosophical tenacity not to actually
evaluate in a real-world situation how
you would act any single individual
should understand this you really don't
why the [ __ ] would you even talk about
it if you're that far gone if you're so
[ __ ] stupid that you can't understand
that a thought experiment is there to
test like philosophical claims and not
like how do you think you will act at a
100 percent real-world circumstance like
if somebody were to say let's say
somebody breaks into your house okay
they're brandishing a weapon do you
think you would kill this person I would
probably answer yeah probably yeah sure
well you don't know if you really would
in that circumstance destiny well yeah
of course I don't actually know maybe I
would be too scared to find my gun maybe
I'd miss all of my shots maybe I'd
forget to load the gun because I'd be
too anxious maybe I would just cower in
a baby I don't know I'm not I can't 100%
know how I would certainly act in that
situation typically when you're asking
hypotheticals centered around
philosophical ideas you're not saying
like in the real world if this would
occur how would you act 100% well I
can't truly know that everybody knows
that oh then you know something need
apply ourselves as if you find you a
travel person and you think they may be
very vicious though steel comes from a
small child so we don't know ourselves
completely and when Jesse says oh this
is one cable up this is what I do blah
but like when he says oh you know you
put a button in front of me that will
prolong my life for 15 minutes at the
expense of all of you magically I will
kill all humanity I get a little few
minutes longer I would press that button
you don't know that and for a lot of
people no [ __ ] [ __ ] Sherlock Holmes
you're telling me that if I was
presented with such an extreme
hypothetical in a real-life scenario
that I don't actually know how would I
really Wow what would a profound insight
I'm not actually sure if I would push
the button to kill all of humanity but
after watching this video I feel a
little bit more certain that I would it
is so far removed from what you would
normally think people capable of that
it's better to believe that you don't
know yourself well enough that you would
actually do that in their circumstance
all the time I have Evan it's almost
like you would never be able to answer
any hypothetical philosophical question
ever if you had to apply it to a
real-life context and then be nailed
down to a 100% certain answer no [ __ ]
what but like is this contextualism like
when I answer a philosophical
hypothetical it's under the constraints
of my philosophical system it's not
under the constraints of how well I know
I will act in real life how could I ever
know that and in such an extreme
hypothetical of people being self
deluded or not understand themselves
fully I've read studies that talk about
how friends know us in many ways better
than we know ourselves and things like
that
okay I'm gonna I'm not gonna be gentle
today all right this destiny understand
this guy's point he's not arguing
against destiny so anyway people find it
hard to believe that destiny is telling
the truth about his moral system he's
mad for no reason okay your sentence
isn't even wrong so it's hard for me to
even break down this sentence because
about dumb it is so he's not arguing
against destiny no he's not arguing
against me what he's saying is that I
can't make a solid claim about how I
would act given an absurd hypothetical
but I don't disagree with that I'm not
even sure what he's arguing against I
don't know if anybody disagrees with
that he's explaining why people find it
hard to believe that does need some of
the truth the if he is then he's
explaining why every single person
misunderstand what the purpose of a
hypothetical is to test some kind of
reason or logic like it's such a dumb
way to go about it like oh well the
reason why people don't understand is
because well they can't conceive of a
hypothetical okay that what you're not
really answering or discussing or
challenging anything like it's such a
dumb point um but I don't have a great
many evidence in my life of people
caring about nothing but themselves
of course it doesn't surprise us when we
meet people who say they're willing to
do things that we ourselves believe
believe that we're willing to do and say
well of course you want to do that I'm
willing to do that as well
but you will occasionally people who say
I would do X and you you think yourself
I won't do X but that seems less
plausible to me
so usually wait for them to perform
actions that confirm that she was like
but says I'm mean to murder person and
they motor person go don't change they
actually went to motor person I wouldn't
we need to do that in there so at least
you think you wouldn't you learning to
do that in those circumstances but
sometimes you're gonna meet people who
say some things that are so far outside
of your realm of experience in regards
to other people's actions or motivations
um that you're not going to be able to
believe it unless it's really well
demonstrated so this he says I'm gonna
story all of humanity 50 minutes
resistance um have he was evidence of
people being edgy I have he was evidence
of people DeLuna stuffs I've heat so
evidence of people um not know himself I
have no evidence of people and like
people demonstrating in psychopathy the
ability or willingness to destroy
multimatic v minutes resistance I'm so
where am I going to fall yeah in terms
of I must be edgy and self-deluded I
guess what it brought a brilliant
argument Katis god I just want to absorb
he's gonna absorb Hunt intellectual this
argument is I don't think anybody's ever
destroyed all of humanity for 15 minutes
of life but I do know there are some
people who are edgy and self-deluded so
I'm going to totally ignore what the
entire point is of that hypothetical
because I actually don't even know what
a hypothetical is for and I'm just gonna
assume the guy is lying about literally
everything he says because I'm a [ __ ]
[ __ ] explaining this person's word to
me okay straight all humanity 50 minute
resistance and so where am I going to
fall here in terms of this person's
words and their paper um it's it's all
the things I have evidence for it
doesn't know how many times Destiny's
asserted over and over again um it's
it's not gonna become more pause more
just cuz destiny says a lot of times of
course actions speak louder than words
but we only see destiny in front of a
camera doesn't he could walk out that
door and become a completely different
person for all we know as viewers
assuming that destiny knows himself
completely and that he's perfectly
communicating his perfect knowledge of
himself to us is not warranted on any
level right as destiny sometimes notes
many of the positions that he holds um
could be called progressive and these
are usually positions that you associate
with people who are you know care about
other people so when you think about
your expectations for a person who's
entirely selfish you don't get the
positions that destiny espouses of
course this this is just you making a
personal judgement right just because
you think that this is the case doesn't
make it the case we're talking entirely
about what not necessarily what's true
but what if you it is reasonable for
believing I believe I've seen doesn't do
it in a handful of debates where some
will say something like I don't believe
you and he would default to saying like
oh so you're saying that I'm lying or
you you believe I'm lying but that's not
necessarily the kicker bit delusional a
person can believe destiny to be a
hundred cent truthful while still
believing that what he's saying
himself doesn't correspond with reality
I was the biggest miss but a lot of what
destiny says about what motivates his
behavior is to actually test it would be
grossly unethical and the odds of
destiny naturally coming - coming into
contact we have situations where he has
to kill he's in a closed box with with
five other people in the only option for
one person and and so destiny you know
selfishly just kills the other five
people's anyways that's not gonna come
up naturally so is it you we're always
going to be in this kind of limbo where
it's like well we have to accept
somewhat of what destiny says about
himself or we just won't be able to
immerse or gonna be able to you know
engage with his videos or what-have-you
at the same time we can't ever fully
accept his inclusion because they
haven't in headed you know all right
well the video is kind of retired but
I'm sure there's gonna be a plethora of
ingenious insight to be found in the
comment section I agree with this
entirely the promise that destiny seems
to say any place is absolutely zero
value on the well-being or happiness of
others
I think he'd get a lot less blowback if
we just City values that is less than
himself that's not a particularly
controversial statement and probably
applies to a lesser or greater extent to
most people what would even be the
difference what would even be the
difference between these two positions
let's assume that I am that I place
myself here and I place all other people
here let's say that I rate this at 100
and then I rate this at zero okay what
would be the difference between rating
this at zero and rating this at 30 how
does this change anything what does that
even mean
like can somebody can somebody
demonstrate what conclusion or what
problem that would give me a different
answer to if I value myself at higher
than every other person but I view every
other person at 30 percent rather than
zero what the [ __ ] is even the
difference I don't know
because now for other people equals more
than you yeah okay I'm not a winning
aware of any behavior that cannot be
reduced self-interested is what makes
model so appealing hard to disprove it
could be the people do not value the
well-being happiness others but are
genetically a social influence put
another way a person soup kitchen get no
personal satisfaction where they still
do it problem with saying that
everything reduce images is that it
works the same way conspiracy theories
does you but serve something as I make
up story that's kind of sort of make
sense oh nice yeah you're right that's
kind of how I felt a few years ago I
used to think I was clearly selfish
everything for example then I realized
that was way to reduction it's an
altruism is altruism it doesn't really
matter if you think you're doing it out
of self-interest pure self-interest will
always or in most case long as I did
with mine in Destiny's case I'm never
losing standpoint helping those has no
connection to you is about the dumbest
thing you can do and will get you [ __ ]
over much more often than not people
still do it when their position when you
move beyond just feeling good about
helping I mean this is kind of true
right with like kinship drives and
whatnot but he got hardcore downvoted
he's going against the jerk although I
guess you can work with like other
people as well too
but this might be maybe this is stated
too strongly
whenever leaders am i helping those if I
can actually is about the only thing you
know did you even watch the bio lectures
oh [ __ ] I thought I did I think he got a
lot less blowback p-values others was to
himself so any kids unless he'll have to
go vegan will hunt what is valuing other
people have to do the caring about
animals oh wow thanks for attic water
you actually have listened to some of
the things I've said is this what stefan
molyneux feels like when he's the cult
leader he is being too edgy and it's
actually just a normal person destiny
it's like those people on are I am very
badass Wow nice Dustin's behavior done
it change it all after thinking about
philosophy but his descriptions have
whenever his actions are just equal is
amongst a rule based morality which is
idiotic for a true ego as patches four
to five moral systems together it might
makes right egoism contract or me okay a
we just like throwing every time we've
heard over the past month in here or
makes nebulous unverifiable claims
everything everything considered the
only thing so that said the norm is that
he has problems recognizing some of his
emotions and his mind is compensating
with cry oh nice oh good dumpster no I'm
just kidding there you go your
gravestone can stay
what is the point of you having the
conversation if you automatically don't
believe what he says about any
improbable hypothetical it makes any
kind of thought experiment useless for
you to say lol you don't really know
what you would do hmm
destiny lost meaning that past you must
be honest I did appreciate destiny prime
destinies content a lot though yeah same
it seems like he suffers delusions of
grandeur his solipsistic narcissism
doesn't come off as a surprise anymore
but I miss a days when we just debate
right-wing retards with facts I don't
know what value that's recent content
hence for anyone holy [ __ ] AIDS oh my
god please go away forever holy [ __ ]
boop-boop destroyed his mind primarily
by just asking questions all will boob
did was make me reconsider how I state
some of my baser things my mind did not
change on a single [ __ ] thing after
that conversation holy [ __ ] AIDS the
biggest things that I had to change were
positions that I've let other people
push me into like social contract
because it seemed to be more descriptive
than any basic position I had a lot of
studies in psychology shows people
rationalizing behave your ex post in
order to feel more coherent I feel like
that's what Destiny's done after the
veganism debates I liked how because I
didn't accept veganism everything I say
is like completely compromised and
completely like not true it feels so
good oh my god according to destiny
humans have no hardwired altruistic
tendencies that are based in the
interest of the community that's [ __ ]
when did I ever say that what haven't I
said like multiple times that people are
probably biologically predisposed
towards social behavior I feel like I've
said this like a million [ __ ] times I
don't believe I don't believe it's
ridiculous oh so much to engage with
here I don't believe it they're
delusional I can't believe it I can't
believe it
what great posts really well thought out
killed Routh I don't believe it this is
why I have to stop talking social
contract like completely even people
that I thought understood my um
understood my positions more it really
had no [ __ ] idea whatever happened to
I won't press the button because I
wouldn't want someone else to press the
button if the roles were switched did we
abandon that he changed his mind on that
so the whole idea of I don't want to do
something to somebody else so they don't
do it to me people for some reason
people assumed that this was like some
[ __ ] like intrinsically valuable
proposition that I was making but I like
thought that other people like were
worthy of like moral consideration and
that's why I wouldn't it but it's not
like I was pretty up front the whole
time that it's a
pretty self-interested thing the only
difference now is that I realize that
even if I hold that position I can't
really compel another person to act that
way so the position kind of becomes
pointless right well I'm not gonna push
the button so you're not gonna push the
button okay sure
but I can't really compel you to do that
right that's that's the whole point
that's the also the only thing that's
changed has been kind of like the the
underlying way that I approach it this
overlying thing about pushing a button
or not pushing a button was never the
point of the question I have someone
improperly read at your moral system
Kamiya I feel like I've explained it so
many times that if people don't
understand it at this point it's just
like a willful ignorance or like it's
like inconceivable which is I think
actually as much as it pains me to say
it is probably the more likely things
that's whatever I did I don't care we're
not talking about this at all after
today any more discussion um we're all
intended others seek out what is true
because in the first case unitary
psychology was in position or nihilism
in general are counterproductive but you
just said social commentary is
compelling so it's pointless I don't
know you have to elaborate more or not
to say to that what a great this is the
greatest post in the sub I'll download
set up a REM verse Batman oh [ __ ] hey
yeah hold on you could talk to that dude
where's mr. Batman at oh there he is
do I know what everything ultimately
depends on yes um I'll see if I can get
the nature I would say for something to
exist
I guess existence itself no what does
everything ultimately depend on for its
being existence that doesn't answer the
question what is that can something
exist without not existing that's a law
of identity usually that's not it you're
not see what you're doing right now it's
because you're afraid to answer the
question right they said what is the
ultimate nature upon which all
contingencies depend I'm waiting for an
answer what is the ultimate nature of
reality on which all contingent
statements depend I said if I don't know
if I say I don't know what that appease
you I'm looking for an honest answer
okay what is your answer what wouldn't
engines all right I'm just gonna have to
turn this guy down so I don't either
just with mr. Batman what is the
ultimate nature of reality that provides
for the meaningfulness or
intelligibility of
any continuous statement if I answer
your questions will you not you I'm
waiting for an answer okay handsome and
asking questions so fast to give me
everybody here that he says he doesn't
know good well he's an you're going to
have you're going to have to sit there
and you're my friends quiet as a
non-christian because any assertion that
you make is without ultimate context
therefore there is no ultimate meaning
to any statement of contingency that you
may can I ask you one simple question
yes you realize the concept
munches on what you have just conceded
to yes now can I ask you one simple
question yeah mm-hmm
okay do you use your observations to
interpret the Bible okay okay all right
we're gonna I'm gonna move down to the
really conversation the room below
because we have too many drive-bys ha ha
ha hi hi hey Dad can I ask you a
question um are you ready to converse
like a big boy yeah I'm a big boy I just
want to ask a question I said are you
ready to debate like like a grown-up
yeah I'm ready to debate like a grown-up
and you realize that you previously oven
I'm sure dice can I ask you a question
is that it honest answer yes Darth okay
can you tell me how you perceive the
revelations of God how do I perceive it
with my eyes so can you tell me how you
can trust your eyes why because God has
ordained that I don't question the basic
reliability of my sense perception can
you tell me how you can perceive God
ordaining you to trust your eyes by I
don't have to perceive it just circular
he said this yesterday and that's it's
it's not an issue because ultimately you
can circularity comes prior to any sort
of notion don't of course that's true of
all axiomatic believes that I that I
automatically trust my basic sense
perception is ordained of God cool so is
mine so how is opposition let me ask you
that you so is yours you told me you
didn't know what the ultimate serious
please don't refer to conversations that
we had weeks ago and just focus on this
altima see of reality is no it's not a
phrase I've ever heard before
okay okay what provides the ultimate
context for any contingent statement
that you made can you please explain
that statement more dark I think I made
it very clear what is the ultimate
nature of reality I don't know how to
answer it tell me did you tell me don't
you
strawman you're gonna learn real quick
let me tonight tight we're not going
listen if you're not going to if you're
not going to converse like an adult on
me you will you will be server muted
okay
now we've already had at least four
instances where you don't conduct
yourself like like an adult okay if you
want to be cheesy if you want to be
sleazy then the conversation is over
now in our first and our second debate
you didn't conduct yourself this way
because you didn't realize what was
gonna hit you between the eyes but now
you're playing you're a little sleazy
game well I don't play by your rules I
play by my role I'm Darth would you be
willing to have like a private call with
me in it and destiny so we're not
constantly talked over by other people
in this voice right I'm actually popped
over because I will nude anybody and by
the way destiny has been time stopped
himself like all things can't get away
there's NASA their discussion that's
going to go on that issue right now your
conversation okay okay now notice what
they notice when I ask simple questions
people are entirely tonight and we
continue the conversation that we had in
the other room what conversation is that
where I asked you do you use your
observations to interpret the Bible I'm
not seeing who's speaking
you guys are a are art when you invoke
observation do they do they mean
something in your why are you answering
my question
okay yes I'm okay bye-bye you guys are
strong Manning to know that our eyes are
ultimately a reliable sorrow that's
right
Darth would you agree with that
statement
um are you trying to have a conversation
again yeah yeah okay can you tell me
what your world is honestly I'm I don't
know if I totally adhere to uh I try to
explore different positions try to see
the pros and cons of them okay everyone
everyone has a basic worldview even even
if it isn't crystallized okay all right
well I believe okay
listen sir listen you're gonna learn
real fast that I don't put up with
childishness down I have a delay on my
yeah you're going to be serving muted
very quickly go ahead now do you believe
in God no I do not okay do you deny the
existence of God or lack belief in God I
am mighty you want God and most things
metaphysical I believe that we can't
really have any sort of knowledge most
dental reality including the existence
of God infinity you lack belief in God I
guess so I lack belief in God I'd say
that's a grand penis do you lack belief
in God because God is the - crashing
justifiable I lacked belief in God
because I believe that ultimately any
sort of knowledge that transcends our
experience is gonna be dogmatic in some
fashion and is either going to be
totally vacuous because we can't
actually justify the rational the
rationality of metaphysical outside of
the system of which they're contrived so
it all becomes ultimately vacuous
there's no way to argue against it but I
could complete an equally other vacuous
position that says like God doesn't
exist and that there is no categorical
ends and everything's totally
hypothetical and I would say that the
person who believes in God we then have
no way to argue against me because my
position is deeply vacuous yeah so so
you're telling me that all of your
assertions are vacuous no no no no no I
was saying that the reason I I lack of
belief in God is because I believe that
position just being tell you one more
time okay listening to me I ask you a
straightforward question I don't need a
Community College soliloquy okay now it
is hard because they can do it again you
will be you will be sober me that I'm
asking you okay I'm complex questions
okay go ahead ask it again
right now since you since you lack
belief in God how are you able to make
your ultimate me intelligible students I
deny that who can make metaphysically
intelligible statement thank you we're
done okay he denies that he can make
intelligible statements but that
statement that he just made is
metaphysically intelligibility that's
okay
that's self refuting so we're done he
just stepped on his own landline did you
just mute him yeah I did well he simply
said he made that he made the following
statement okay he says he denies that
any metaphysically intelligible
statements can be made now is that
statement intelligible it's not
metaphysically intelligible you know
pretty thick Edo Craddock if he denies
I don't think we should allow statement
can be made then he can't make that
statement so the fact is he's so obtuse
he doesn't realize this is this argument
is like saying someone is like do you
think you can do calculus and I and
somebody goes no I don't think I can do
calculus at all and they go if you can't
do calculus how could you say that you
can't do calculus because that's
calculus checkmate and we'll make it
clear we're gonna we're gonna drop that
read about that to peace if he denied
[Music]
well then why did he say that done
that's self refuting it game over do you
need to believe in God in order to make
any statement make sense
if one is going to claim that they're
predications are metaphysically viable
and intelligible they're going to need
to provide what the ultimate context is
that provides for the intelligibility of
any stipulation even one word wait wait
a second who the hell keeps screaming
penis in the [ __ ] chat and I didn't
see why you've been talking and we're
trying to find out just just everyone
identify who's doing it and what will be
whoa I was kind of notification to unlap
that those accounts ban no I can just
see I could just see you in the hall
panting okay isn't this isn't this
amazing these people come to the table
and they want to make a claim well I
lack belief in God because blah blah
blah blah blah blah blah and then they
say
I deny that we can actually make
basically anything you wanna mess with
yeah but what were those states what was
that statement I mean I mean these
people it's amazing they're just walking
contradiction okay so do we do we have
any other skeptics in here want to say
that apart from the Christian God of a
Christian all views you can make
metaphysically viable statement amazing
we have 61 people and not one
knuckle-dragging
atheist can assert that he can make
metaphysically intelligent estate
everyone's me what do you consider to be
metaphysical metaphysical the word meta
means above and physical of course means
physical it means that which is above
nature or that which ultimately accounts
or is the foundation for that what's the
foundation of nature you're asking me
the the laws of logic are what reflect
the mind and character of God and
including how he constructed this world
okay all right I can't really expand on
that I know I'm an e justification for
laws of logic either are you an atheist
I'm agnostic is a better word okay well
is any justification viable not
completely no oh really and how did you
justify that statement
I can't completely justify that
statement then why did you assert it
well you can't serve much without
presupposing things and you know is that
true
I think it to be true okay okay so
basically you made that those statements
because you imagined them
yes and when you made that statement
you imagine that yeah I gotta get you in
with mr. Batman next I'm I'm like like I
thought he wasn't as stupid as you know
maybe I originally thought but he asks
me like why don't you believe in these
and I gave him an answer that is
probably the most common answer in
philosophy and it has been such for like
300 years so yeah I don't think he's he
doesn't do philosophy right what he does
is he has like a like I'm saying script
not as like an insult but he literally
has I think like a dialogue tree this is
why he asks so many questions his goal
is to get you to answer a certain
questions certain way and then once
you've done that he can ask you
questions that all lead to his
conclusion and that's like his whole
style of rhetoric you know great why
even bother talking to him it's like
going up today done no dude I can't
resist outing off anything I can't help
myself from I don't know why these types
of people no but he can't serve him
usually so I was crazy dude oh my god
I've messaged them both and say hey
friend I just want to talk and you know
neither of responding to me it's just I
like because I understand his argument
God allows us to know that our eyes
because the circularity is clear
yeah but the thing is that he allows
himself to be circular but he won't
allow someone else to be circular that
which makes his position entirely
[ __ ] ridiculous but then any time you
tried to point that out he keeps like a
lot of the times when you ask him so I
think this is like really telling right
when you ask him like well how do you
perceive God's revelation
he'll just state something that God does
he doesn't actually answer the question
be like well God makes his acts directly
known through Baba's like okay well how
how do you perceive it right well and
then ultimately when you get him back to
a sense perception thing then he has to
admit that his position is circular but
for some reason you won't let you do the
same and if you back him into that he'll
meet you like that's what he does yeah
no no he's an idiot
that's just what it is and it's not like
it's not like someone is missing like
some core part of his argument or that
there's some hidden crimes
revealing it now he's just a [ __ ]
idiot
so if anyone knows start Dawkins and he
actually wants to sit down and now I
know what he does not what he does Wow
celebrity many attention because um I
didn't know this until like a month ago
but people take like discord servers
like the sizes and [ __ ] like very
[ __ ] seriously and the owner of that
server is called sass and the dude is a
massive [ __ ] ego and what they do is
they'll let Darth stay in their server
and then they give him God and [ __ ] yeah
because they want to get more people in
the server and you see like Darth like
brings a crowd so like yeah so mods will
always like cut themselves to give him
like admin and [ __ ] on servers so that
he can mute people I can empathize with
that because like I run a server and
user count is important yes but I mean
but when you're cutting I solved that
hard that's [ __ ] sad we send
dumbasses to the gulag constantly like
you that kind of hit just does not fly
and anywhere but that sort of place it's
just really building like casis pent
does he get like what does he have a job
I don't know I think he's retired you
can find YouTube videos of him doing
this [ __ ] like three years ago like he
does this [ __ ] like this is what he does
all day long does he think that this is
how he's gonna get to heaven I don't
know I think honestly I think he might
actually be like mentally disturbed like
that wouldn't surprise me if he if there
was something going on well it's it's
it's I don't know it's really tough to
label like someone the reason really
rated to leave no no but it's not the
beliefs it's the behavior is what I'm
focused on the beliefs or whatever it's
the idea that like I remember the first
time I met him when I came back the
second time and had to debate with him I
walked into a random discord and he was
talking about it six hours later like he
does this [ __ ] all day every day 24/7
like he's always doing this like I feel
like that's me there's got to be like
some really unhealthy like pathology or
some [ __ ] there like there's no way that
like a normal person would elect to do
this right right like like someone first
getting into philosophy it's Steve
what's the effect called where you when
you start out in a certain field you
feel like you you've got it all um I
mean I know what you're talking about
the colloquial phrase I've heard is
Mountain [ __ ]
know when you've learned it's when
you've learned just enough to think you
know everything but you haven't been
quite enough to know how much you don't
know and you feel right way
overconfident oh maybe you can be
talking about dunning-kruger as well
sure yeah
and then Danny Kruger can work both ways
but yeah and like I think he's in a
perpetual state Dunning crew no I don't
agree him I I think at this point it who
knows what he's doing I think he knows
that he's arguing in bad faith it's just
like this is like something he enjoys
doing right right like it's I don't get
it I really don't get it like like like
truly like I'd understand if he was
trying to have like an actual rational
conversation of people but I mean no
it's absolutely nothing like that he's
just an idiot
does he have supporters people actually
support him and I support the means
right they support the mean is so it's
Batman like Batman is his own I think
he's a priest up as analyst also right I
mean this thing is Batman with a the
cross
discord like profile picture science and
apologetics for all ages yo Jesus Saves
from hell mr. Batman calm I like a
YouTube video
Richard police officer should simply
officer lies to abolitionists oh yeah
he's got like a facebooking with [ __ ] in
like a YouTube channel
mr. Batman sermon in the Batcave before
he says to Moses I will have mercy on
whom I have mercy and I will have
compassion on whom I have compassion sad
thing about mr. Batman is apparently he
had like brain damage because his house
had like a mold infestation and he like
readily admits it and [ __ ] but so I kind
of wondered like sixty years old or
something no I don't think he's like in
his 30s or four days can be a theist
even reason Wow Wow it's it's it's
really just Oh what this this whole
Twitter feed is just really disturbing
he only has 25 followers I don't get
people who constantly tweet out when
they have social followers like what's
the point in doing that I guess so but
he's tweeting like 30 times a day yeah I
don't know he's probably [ __ ] crazy
dude
I've always had to teach people crazy
but I mean I don't know what you're
supposed to how you're supposed to say
to something like this yeah so that
start is there anyone else I would
expose the crazy while they've they're
crazy crazy those are the peak crazy
yeah those two probably oh yeah
that I've heard of that's not too bad
actually but that's that's okay I mean
I'm like I've heard worse positions
aren't you are right like at least he's
not advocating for Holocaust
that's one good thing we can say about
him right I don't know it's not even
like a real human being okay no [ __ ]
exposing [ __ ] on the internet work
one video at the time also a style
blogger oh I see he's anti-lgbt heavenly
had a habit of pointing out people's
Jewish mannerisms and being a Jew
almost to the point of obsession
something tells me the left is more
Jewish
with Holocaust revisionism racialism
pick up the artistry anti-lgbt debate
I've done a few it's they're really bad
they'll hurt you that you'll get
physically hurt if you actually I'm not
there's a whole position on the internet
that I've kind of like summarized like
[Music]
Wow my did what's up all right how'd you
wanted to check what do wanna chat about
buddy anything yep okay what's your
favorite movie that's an interesting
question and a big pile of what about
Dinesh's films let's get right down to
business
Indian dude or whatever that makes the
crazy Gaucho okay is there a way you can
turn your mic mic up significantly like
yes I can't
oh okay so can actually yeah I get
closer to my microphone sorry yeah me
now yeah a little bit what you did
before when you were dreaming was
actually really good when you were
really close oh this is this is this is
uncomfortable this one here we go
quietly boss no whatever make your app
sounds really good if you're close to it
just you have to like is it like a web
camera oh it is not a webcam it is a
blue snowball
sure I mean it's not funny yeah I just
get right up in there yeah all right
wait so what do you Europe I just like a
podcast and I think it was OBS cuz on my
size that microphone was working and
then some people said good to hear it so
I'm like okay now you say you can't hear
it sound like oh well I mean I can hear
you is just kind of quiet okay
well okay I think my buddy said you're a
black conservative that's all he said
well I'm not really concerned as I say
identifies classically liberal but I am
the publican okay cool
isn't classically liberal like 95% of
the United States and Western world
right now are classically liberal would
not necessarily be 95 percent of the
restaurant do you think Democrats in the
United States are classically liberal no
some of them can be I don't think the
majority are when you say classically
liberal what do you mean by that
classically liberal in terms of social
and economic beliefs and going back over
several hundred years if we believe in
freedom economically and opportunity
things like that you tend to probably
believe in civic nationalism as opposed
to cult it smells like ethnically or
religious nationally you tend to believe
that people make up their decisions on I
only believe an individual or something
things like that wait Merrill it's about
the role the United States government
context and typically classical liberals
they believe in less government
intervention but you know if you go back
to the 60s could be Kinsey and you don't
think that the majority of Democrats
believe in relatively limited government
intervention or not today today I think
we see their policies and the results
have been that they increased government
intervention that limited I mean I think
it really depends on where we're talking
about when it comes through the
Democratic Party in some regions it
might be like in the Midwest they
definitely gonna be more classic we will
be more like old-school Democrats but if
you go to New York City or if you of the
San Francisco or California or Seattle
they're gonna be mandating much more
things and they might be more far to the
left more progressive points as opposed
to literally
so you think that progressivism and
liberalism are like counter indicative
of one another this um basically yes
progressivism the liberalism I always
the same thing well yeah I know they're
two different things I just didn't think
they were counter where the difference
between professors and them with all
them because the one little was when
you're liberal item things you're
freeing things you're giving more
freedom to progressivism you're
projecting you want to progress using
the government to progress okay okay
let's get rid of okay let's talk about
for all the labels I think I think we're
gonna get Larson in this part of the
debate or in the in the conversation I
guess my understanding of a classically
liberal are generally people who
generally hands-off believe in economic
freedoms believe in basic freedoms like
read above the price basically [ __ ]
that's covered our First Amendment I
guess personally I feel like Democrats
and Republicans are pretty equivalent
they're like people even hate speech and
that that should be regulated in sensor
a classical liberal wouldn't believe in
hey chief I don't
I mean classical liberal is such a broad
term it sounds like you almost want to
just say like libertarian or even like
and Caffrey something I feel like ten
caps aren't necessarily the same thing
either and libertarians are slightly
different because libertarians I feel
like you'd have a really hard time
making the statement all liberal are all
classical liberals would be opposed to
laws regulating HSP hate speech I don't
know if that's a that's its anti its
anti theoretical to what classical
liberals that they mean if you're really
if you're regulating speech you're
fighting against what historically
classical liberals have always fought
against okay remember the Free Speech
Movement even when we thought about the
name class of the liberal for talking
about when Democrats were classically at
livable back in the sixties they had the
Free Speech Movement in Berkeley and
that was about all speech I just
regulating basically about Bailey
we wanted no regulations on free speech
we want to be a believer our lives -
maybe we supposed to complete it that's
guaranteed to us and constitute and I
think today we don't see you left just
believing in that nearly as much still
the majority do but we're seeing more
and more don't okay and I guess you
could say that existed on the right as
well
there are some people on the right that
you know honestly they they don't
believe in freedom of speech sometimes -
some people do start moving into ethical
nationalistic ideas one people seem to
believe and like regulating video so
that they can't say whatever they want
like they shouldn't have a bias
personally I believe the cure for the
five student am advised but you're
starting to see more people calling for
more censorship of what media can see so
it's on both sides but it's more more so
prevalent and work torn no the left
gotcha would you do you think that Trump
is a pretty good advocate for freedom of
speech he's a pretty good advocate for
why you should have these because
honestly what does that man how what do
you mean by that
well first and foremost I mean he's used
language that a lot of people would
consider offensive I don't personally
call it this very offensive some people
do but personally speaking hey the fact
that he uses Twitter to contact people
the fact that he doesn't have together
you pull out people by name on Twitter
they respond to him and say he should
die if everybody was fine he's not
thinking that much he doesn't take it
serious he posed memes of himself he's
really more relaxed he seems like a more
of a commonplace person especially if
you're from the Midwest you know people
like not strong well I don't I don't
know any billionaires I don't know what
you mean by commonplace person or
personally I don't know yeah well like a
common person so a common person like
first temper tantrums on Twitter and
stuff what do you mean by common person
oh you know what yeah common post the
person does both to interpret every
tantrum that's what a raw human you know
some people are going to disagree with
one another and they get in there and
you know people do post rants why do why
we have Twitter people make careers on
that stuff because post bangs all
they on Twitter but how did you get a
hundred thousand tweets you know you get
a hundred thousand tweets by posting
rants about what you don't like and what
you do like and I was something doesn't
Witter that per he's a little more
politically inclined and you know what
the thing is he was doing the same thing
as a regular citizen to do he was
tweeting his mind there I think he
supports most either being able to tweet
their mommies as long as it's not
calling for violence I know he did
recent tweet about you know him and with
the people some people can disagree but
I think what he's talking about any
thoughts about that specifically media
days trying to mislead media that is
trying to divide those you don't think
Trump does had it all Trump
misleading people in dividing I mean
would have to point things that he does
sure how about when he said over three
million illegals voted in the last
election you know what s interesting is
they didn't even give over the voter
rolls for that I think in the Columbus
Ohio where I'm from they had this
election in Franklin County and well as
I think they said like seven or so or
sixteen people or I think a hundred and
sixteen people over the age of like a
hundred and seven at 100 subs 160 voted
in that election and it's like that many
people that aloof in that County I don't
spin so that compare that many oxide
very badly uh-huh over a hundred years
ago that's kind of like remarkable that
that many people in that County happened
to have that they go voting okay
sure okay wait let's focus on this one
topic on the date and then you know
what's interesting that people on both
sides actually didn't like there was for
instance there was that he wanted to
actually check the voter rolls to make
sure that there was no voter fraud on
both sides and we saw a Republican
Attorney General's left is to change
internals Democratic trained generals
they all said no they didn't cooperate
they didn't hand it over and then you
know the same time the media is saying
no cable Russia can intervene in
elections and bla bla bla bla bla and
then we're seeing actually Democrats
giving away motor passes and licenses
and they're also telling the leftists or
y'all stop telling like real immigrants
you can vote they want to pass laws
where you can vote they're doing
amnesties and criminals and felons we
got actually got a show we got a show
cuz you just have so many things that
were totally untrue I like to take them
apart one at a time okay before we get
like am i right well like okay so when
you say registering it was two hundred
thousand people that were given amnesty
right before the election in 2016
there were felons illegal immigrants are
being they're asking people in like I
think was like Massachusetts in
California and several other places that
are very left is they're saying eh if
you're legal citizen you want you to
vote can we do one at a time okay here
just so that I can set the tone for this
so a common conservative debate tactic
is gonna be to steamroll me with 52
stories that are all fake and then kind
of walk away at the end when we get hung
up on one so I really like to go to this
house yeah if you want to
well because I'm familiar with most of
the fake news that you just kind of
repeated so firstly the first thing you
talked about how other states are
registering illegals to vote I'm very
familiar with the case in California
where that claim was made because
illegal people are encouraged to sign up
for driver's licenses online and the
online registration process will also
register you to vote if you're a citizen
but that doesn't give non-citizens the
ability to register to vote and most of
these kinds of like fake news
conservative talking points all revolve
around this kind of doublespeak where
people say well you know they lit it
undocumented people register on some
online service therefore they're going
to start voting illegally all of that is
just completely untrue like I've looked
into all of these stories and if they
were true it would be reported on like
international headlines that like
illegal people are being registered to
vote on more places than just like
Breitbart or the Federalist Tribune or
whatever random conservative website
there is okay since you link that's
Boston Herald is not left-wing they're
thinking about in Boston okay these are
for local Alexis might even just been
for school districts but these are not
for federal like presidential elections
or for federal like senator elections or
whatever I've seen some of these stories
as well I think in Boston I think the
push was for um they were saying that
undocumented people should be able to
vote on like school superintendents and
school policy stuff but this isn't like
on voting for president they said
specifically the Boston City Council
will consider it will consider ways it
can let non-citizens vote in city
elections tomorrow in a hearing so we're
talking about City elections can you
also say all members of the community
should have the right to participate and
be included in the governance of that
community okay aka non-citizens should
have the right to vote at a local level
okay
and it says ways it can it doesn't even
say anywhere about okay Holden sure so
hold on okay so we've got three levels
of like crazy [ __ ] going on here so
firstly okay so firstly in this article
this isn't being pushed it's saying the
City Council will consider so we don't
even know if this is gonna go through
firstly secondly it says it will
consider ways it can let non-citizens
vote so that doesn't mean that they're
going to be voting for like the senator
like for federal elections or anything
it says in city elections and then
thirdly it says all members of community
should have a right to participate me
included in the governance of that
community that doesn't imply like
federal elections or anything it could
be like I said I think it would be nice
to see what's actually being talked
about instead of like a two paragraph
article but I'm pretty sure I've seen
these in regards to like voting on like
school superintendents and school
policies locally and whatnot that it
would give those people the right to
vote now whether or not okay I need a
different source of that because this
these two paragraphs don't demonstrate
that well I just said you should be able
to have a say in your community in votes
okay do you understand that city
election doesn't mean like vote for
governor or vote from could be married
ships it can be things like that people
control it could also be superintendents
it could be everything it's just a start
if these people are allowed to vote at a
local level who is to say that they
don't start interfering
so they actually gets pushed further
then higher and higher and higher okay
sure so we've kind of assumed that it
would I'm not assuming anything so we've
got a little motte-and-bailey going on
here where you will be open to this
discussing illegals voting in a
presidential election and now you're
giving me an article that's saying that
a Boston City Council will consider
letting undocumented people participate
in some city election actually voting no
or well yeah when you go to vote I mean
they ask you to what your addresses and
your name is and then they check your
from the list right yeah or someone else
has this been demonstrated as happening
before the United States and a federal
in a federal election okay so recently
in Georgia there was an election they've
actually had a recount but they've
actually found out that more people
voted than were registered about two
hundred and twenty seven percent of
people turned out to vote in a specific
district can you say over over the
registered voters okay well yeah let's
just cut how about we cut to the better
happen truck so I'm not sure I would
have to if this is a daily call to link
I'd probably have to find a better
source to see what actually happened I
would never trust anything yeah I mean I
don't have to look into it but I guess
going to the heart of the matter Trump
put together a commission to investigate
the illegal voting thing as soon as he
took office and that Commission
disbanded like a month ago and they said
they found nothing why didn't it
wait what weren't doing the roles they
weren't able to check any things they
just disbanded because they couldn't do
anything I mean you have to have
cooperation or if it happened if no one
gives you the voter rolls you can't
check to see if there was fraud so all
of these random no-name websites were
able to dig up all this fraud but the
president wasn't able to authorize
people with enough power to do so how
does that make sense
it's a Federal Republic system work
sorry I didn't realize that Trump was so
ineffective I guess I don't know okay
well sometimes I believe
voting is taking place but trunk can't
find any of it what if he's so infected
then he's not much of a threat to you
and your ideas huh well he's got like
Supreme Court picks unfortunately and is
ineffective do you think that when I say
that Trump is ineffective that means he
has no impact on any way are you oh your
shapiro fan aren't you I'm not I've been
sued girlfriend at all I don't like him
okay yeah that was a fast one so anyway
when I said Trump was ineffective the
entire sentence is it would would read
to a reasonable person like it seems
that Trump is ineffective in
investigating voter fraud control of his
entire Justice Department right now I
mean you have sometimes recused
themselves from absolutely everything to
do with the Attorney General and he's
letting the Rosa Steen rule everything
so as far as I'm concerned it's not
doing much she can't do much and he's
not dictator he glues on the rule of
wall you understand that sessions
sessions and Rosen Stein were both Trump
appointments I know so I mean you can't
really like Trump can't really say like
media did come in and say Rosenstein is
trusted by Republicans and Democrats he
just he's one of the more popular
selections that Donald Trump makes and
he's doing that to appease the
establishment and establishment wanted
Rosenstein so he picks Rosenstein and
it's what happens is it backfires so
badly on Donald Trump and roses team
recommends that he fires James Comey and
he's like okay I'll fire James Comey
because I don't really like the guy
anyway he's fired and then guess what
roses team appoints you know basically
Robert Mueller because Donald Trump is
obstructing justice like okay Donald
Trump's expecting justice on your own
recommendation to fire someone and you
yourself should recuse from things
because you've been found to be tied to
things like if you're tied to own rushed
investigation which you have actually
started yourself and you're over of
you're investigating yourself you should
recuse yourself that's why we had
sessions accused himself
cuz Oh apparently he met with her
Russian therefore he cannot be unbiased
he's going to be partial to bias um he's
gonna try to interfere so he recused
himself from everything to do in rose
esteem he refuses to do the same thing
now House Republicans don't like them
and his same story is Alec all roses
danger
oh yeah but you know what the people
that are trying to impeach him and the
people are defending him what I see here
is two Democrats they're defending
wasn't seeing what he's doing is
definitive then Democrats defending
Mueller and what are you doing not
we're at a restaurant and my waitress is
a fat black lady okay and she makes you
make you feel really cozy okay like
something about you know her demeanor
and like the thing she says makes me
feel feel good and I feel cozy whatever
and the bill comes and I end up
sniffing her well and then somebody says
well service wasn't that good to do
tipper more did you for more because
she's black
wait who's happens
so I say I guess essentially I did
because the way her country is the way
she was grew up in a black household
made her a certain way that made her
feel cozy to me and made me tip remark
and then Becca was saying that that's
racist
and I said yeah it's racist but
everything is inherently racist like
that I think let's say there were a
thousand Japanese waiters and a thousand
there's a pretty much any any other race
in let's say Japanese people actually
got tips to be waiters I on average the
Japanese people would have better
service so if you're tipping even
entirely based on service you would end
up tipping based on race as well because
you'd end up saving Japanese people more
off that's okay
I agree that like you agree with more so
you think that they service is better
because you're rich culturally similarly
right
but that it's not you're not cooking
this is their Asian cooking because of
service and then he's saying let's the
service it's the rate yeah there's like
I think there's like multiple things at
play here that need to be addressed so
like the first thing that I would think
of is like just because you do something
based on a person's race doesn't
necessarily make it racist do you both
agree with that or do you not agree with
that because we can talk about that far
I actually don't even think that that's
relevant I think let's just use but
let's just use we did something based on
the person's race uh-huh
did we do something based on the
person's race is what we're talking
about when we say races I know it
doesn't matter whether that's reason did
we do something based on their rates is
the argument yeah I think I say that we
did I think I don't think you guys
disagree on anything I think it's just
become like a semantics argument so like
for instance here's like here's a thing
if I were to pose that you had a server
or a waitress and she was just as cozy
as the black lady but she was white but
she found a way to be just as cozy
because she's a but she's a white lady
would you have tipped her the same
amount I think that yes I would but my
argument my argument is the black lady
will tend to be on average physically
more a higher percentage of the time
cozy to me than the white lady would but
when I'm trying to reduce it there is
the idea that you're not doing it
because of somebody's race now like
maybe somebody because I don't think
it's important well it is argument well
but if Becca Becca is saying that you're
being racist then the implication there
is that you're doing something directly
related to a person's race not in some
deterministic sense that well because
they're black or Japanese they happen to
have these characteristics and these
characteristics are why I tipped them
but more but like when you call so many
races is typical you're just doing it
because of the race of the person which
is a different claim I think okay but
you can take this another step and you
can say well even if my intention is not
the said based on the race if it ends up
being that I do too based on the race we
can be in tension because if you're
judging everyone based on attention most
people do have their attentions even
like somebody like Pablo Escobar who is
like shooting and killing people and
selling cocaine wants to help his family
or whatever right okay then so it's if
people even if my intention is the same
it doesn't mean that it's not racist if
it's my intention is not to give
Japanese people a better tip but they
end up being having better service every
single time let's date let's date not
ever so bad a higher percentage of the
pie
then I do end up sitting Japanese do
more so if if someone asked me to
YouTube Japanese people or any other
people more I'd say oh I could
definitely do more yeah but I think you
know the key question is like if you say
something like Japanese people by virtue
of being Japanese or whatever tend to be
more kind and courteous and you know
good delivering of service and whatnot
then that's fine but if you would say
something along the lines of like you
know even if white people were just as
courteous as Japanese people I would
still tip Japanese people more well then
it's like okay well this is a race thing
like it feels like you're kind of
rolling black but but do you agree with
the statement that if I'm sitting
completely based on service and let's
assume Japanese people are better at
service okay then a my tipping Japanese
people more yes you asked me the
question do I did Japanese people more
than other people yes yes yeah but it's
not because they're Japanese they just
happen to be Japanese that doesn't
matter but it does I think that doesn't
matter well I mean I would if you're
arguing whether something is racist I
argue that that would be the dis F what
we're arguing about I think that we got
we got to this point I actually think
the intention matters people like their
politeness and their service matches
well with what I think of as good
service that's not the Japanese people
if their culture or how they were raised
but that doesn't mean like race is equal
perfect but but in the end of race well
no no but it's not it's not it's just
the race is the tool used to provide or
the race is a tool by which they acquire
characteristics that you appreciate that
leads you to tip more it's not because
of our race of course but then okay but
reckful what I'm saying is it if you go
this route if I do but it's not great
better if you get this reductionist then
every single thing can be racist or
sexist and then the words become more
pointless right like if I were to say
something like I agree I would thing I
don't think that the word the way most
people think about it is pointless and
you have to define it differently I'm
biggie
well no I don't think it is anybody if I
if I treat if let's say that I find
somebody and let's say I don't like them
just because they're black I just don't
like a black person and let's say the
white person acts the same way but I'm
okay with that that's I'm being racist
and that I'm hating somebody I'm judging
somebody on the characteristics of skin
color rather than on anything related to
character that that's racist and totally
agree
but that's way different then there's a
black person and you know they stole
something from me and I'm being racist
by hating abra stealing because the
reason why he stole is because he's
black and he grew up in the projects
that's not racist the same way that's
being like very strangely reductionist
in a way that makes the word racist like
vacuous and pointless like at that point
the word means nothing I think no I
agree that's why I'm bringing it up good
I think that the word means nothing if
if it was racist for me to sit for more
then I think the word racist means
nothing well but it so I think we agree
that it wasn't racist for you to tip for
more because you said that if a white
person offered the same level of service
you would tip them right yeah so then if
no no I agree no I agree but that's now
we're going to the deficit let's change
the depend ons of definition it is
racist if if doing things to different
if if I do something tip differently to
different races is racist then it is
rich no if I treat different races
differently one more thing if I treat
it's treating different races
differently is racist then it is racist
and if we don't define it as that then
it's not and I that's why I said at the
beginning that's why I said the bean I
think it's irrelevant defined races
let's just define it as you I treat
different races differently and the
answer is yeah sure so this is why I
said in the beginning I thought I felt
like it was kind of like a semantic
argument like it's it's just like I'm
pretty sure that you guys agree on every
concept if you guys can just agree on
like the definition of the word racist
then you'll probably agree on whatever
upper point this is right so you should
be having a conversation what do you
think racism is and then in your
definition I think that the word is so
reductionist that it's pointless so I
would never define it that way
and then in Becca's definition maybe you
would agree like oh okay yeah I guess in
that case this isn't racist or is racist
or whatever in that definition it just
sounds like a semantics can automatic as
well and so I was like okay so me when I
said I complete system 50% unless they
like spill on me or they forget where
you
Amil than that's worth service so I
would sip like 10% feels kind of have to
say it's like a social thing and then if
they do a good job like the success
something that I really like then 20%
and then he said well certain Rick this
is our mo something on you yes
let's say I think there's a certain
culture that was broke I don't know
which rate didn't grow up using plates
or bowls and you getting a something
that's in a plate or a bowl they're
probably more likely to drop the plate
on both all the player Bowl that time
yeah I already know exactly we go in
this and I just I don't agree I think
that at that point you've you've made
the word you've made the word race is so
reductionist that it's pointless you're
not you're not not tipping biggie no I
agree with that I agree Mike the point
of my argument is that the reward is we
don't know we don't agree we don't agree
stop saying we agree because I don't
agree that the word why Isis is defined
that way it makes the word worthless I
think that racist Canyon mean something
but you're trying to say that no I
wanted to be something - no no I I
usually define it the way you're about
to define it okay which is if people are
acting the exact same way but they're
different races and they're getting
pretty differently that's racist that's
the store in agreement there right but
but me being all racist in this
situation is the logical conclusion of
it is that the reductionist definition
of racist
if wait Becca Becca what do you think
the argument is over
hold on I'm curious thinking that my
idea of what like me thinking I did
based on service is me being racist okay
okay but Becca using his insanely
reductionist definition would you agree
I know that the word racist sounds bad
but if you define racist as literally I
treat different races differently
because they grow up with different
behaviors sometimes as a result like
would you agree then with his definition
if he if we use that strange definition
would you agree with his conclusion or
on that I can't do anything because he's
generalizing and his Austin he's not
like using this peer statistics
yeah fine right yeah I don't I don't use
people like that so it's make sense to
me or
in it but I'm just saying that using
that definition you would agree with him
right that concept right yeah yeah
because because like certain cultures
and raises unquote yep okay cool then
that's right yeah you guys don't
disagree on anything it literally just
comes down to the semantic argument on
how you define this word yeah you're
right I think they're more likely to
draw weight it's a it's a numbers game
of course right oh you're like rape in
America or you lived in America for like
15 years
uh-huh no if even if you grew up for ten
years not even played because whatever
that's their country's at the news place
back you would be more likely to drop
weight yeah okay supplicant can I do
this really quick because reckful is
gonna win this argument if you go down
this road okay yeah here is the argument
laid out in a stats point of view even
if you've lived in America for 15 years
there's probably some things that you're
inheriting from an immigrant family that
is gonna be different than the native
population you know and this is gonna be
more noticeable if you're a first
generation as opposed to second as
opposed to third as opposed to fourth so
from like a pure numbers game the
chances that a local would act in a
certain way versus somebody that's
immigrated recently or whose parents did
or whose grandparents did that's
probably going to be traceable through
some statistical thing I mean I'm sure
that the answer to that is yes right
yeah yeah mines right and say examples
not even like the problem right the
problem might people get uncomfortable
with this is that when you make a
statement like this the feeling and I
and I because I know how your brain
works a little bit right cool
I don't think you mean this but the
feeling when you say that when you say
different races are more likely to drop
plates reckful I think what you mean is
you're looking at it as a statistic
slash numbers game where different
racism yeah exactly
but when a normal person here is that
what they hear is you think that some
people's races are more intrinsically
prone towards dropping plates and I
think that's what makes like Becca
uncomfortable right it sound like you're
ascribing
- like like genetically that like
certain cultures of people must be more
prone to dropping plates because
Mexicans or whatever rice panics yeah
what I'm actually saying it's the way
they're raised or the same thing so
obviously culturally we're more than one
certain races okay okay no we are saying
the same thing there was the one to
agreement though that so what's the one
that you're gonna talk that if if that
certain races you will drop place
differently like that yeah a little bit
just okay I'm only thinking about like
when we go to restaurants in America
it's like everyone the same level not
necessarily I don't agree with that I
like when he says it's like an immigrant
from like another countries and yeah
yeah even if they're fifteen years what
reckful is saying is like let's say that
you get somebody that immigrates from a
country where they never use plates I'm
inventing this group of people that this
person even if they were raised in
America is probably going to have
parents that won't teach them how to
carry plates as well as like a white
family who was here all the time we
learn how to use plates so reckful is
saying here that there are learned
behaviors that certain races of people
are more likely to learn that will be
that won't like manifest in different
waitressing behaviors but the reason why
I think Becca is uncomfortable at
statement is because it sounds like
you're saying that like Hispanic people
by virtue of being Hispanic are like
genetically more predisposed towards
dropping plants because that's what that
argument sounds like which is why it's
so uncomfortable to agree with it right
yeah let's say this was a little
uncomfortable that's something else I
don't know I've told a lot of crazy
people so I'm not sure what you would
say oh what I was gonna say is if you
were if people of a certain rate Pixar
mate
based on a certain trait if they pick it
based on strength or dexterity like how
well someone hunts or instead or
intelligence in some situations in some
countries and I picked up based on this
based on that then over thousands of
years
the genetic you become different oh yeah
better here's what I would caution you
for this okay because biology gets a lot
more complicated than just a numbers
game or rather no no I shouldn't said it
all is numbers games but the thing is
that like when you talk about
polygenetic traits
okay so complicated traits that can show
up in a variety of different ways in a
variety of different environments okay
that are comprised of many different
genes it would be very hard to get a
pronounced difference between groups of
people after only like a couple thousand
years that would be very difficult to do
does that make sense for now different
genome is Sophie there be a variable
over here I mean I don't know over a
couple thousands I don't know if that's
true that might not be even even think
about dogs all dog species came from
wolves in such a short period of time
they think oh god dogs and humans are
very very different so dogs were bred
hardcore in some cases in bred for
highly specific day dogs obviously dogs
things wings and and humans did in the
generation shorter and they were bred
but you can see that 100 of the dog
changes could have occurred which be you
know even the 1% would be faithful maybe
but the thing is that maybe no not maybe
yeah maybe well because you're a plant
you're assuming a lot of things here one
you're assuming that a natural selective
process has been applied to a group of
people in a very specific and direct
manner which may not even be possible to
demonstrate right preferring one no it
does no no at different countries this
is similar to the placing different
countries different cultures will breed
based on different more successful
people in a certain country will be a
certain way like let's say more
successful on some country many years
ago different country might have been
intelligence that has to be true okay
it's not possible it's not I don't think
and then I'm like if over if over 2,000
years of breeding they've done let's say
you have a just hunter-gatherers okay no
I are saying what I'm saying is that I
think that genetics is a little bit
there are more levels of abstraction
here that you have to deal with that
that's not a simple numbers game but a
much more complicated numbers game and
even if it's more complicated I said uh
even all the complications really can't
let me give you an example okay let's
say that you you might it might be
possible that I could copy paste the
exact same genetic code to 100 people
however based on where they grow up in a
certain part of a city these people
might turn out to be dramatically
different just based on where they grow
up okay now it's possible that it's
possible that people could select mates
based on certain traits that were more
likely to show up in the northern
population versus the southern
population however that doesn't mean
that you're gonna see a difference in
genetic you know frequency a little
frequency over time just because
somebody preferred a different trait
it's possible that environmental causes
would have caused a difference here from
the same genetic background that means
that you're not actually choosing four
different genes like that's just like
one of like there's a ton of layers of
it doesn't that's fine you know even if
go ahead Devin tag me and when you're
ready people striking this [ __ ]
don't worry hey there's enough to go
around for everybody let's do it boys go
ahead that wasn't that different you're
so dumb I just unmuted your shitty
[ __ ] god dmn name was so bad you
should actually be embarrassed yeah
so wait unmute [ __ ] faster when you
say you're gonna do it
that's just everything we just talked
about secret memes or it is there
anything you I mean I don't really care
knock yourself out I just I don't like
that the thing that irritates me is that
hey talking about all these things
because people are even doing it in chat
like I just saw people doing a chat
what do you watch like a lot of anime or
whatever no like there like a lot of
people like there are a lot of people
that really like my mindset and like a
very edgy like Shonen like superhero
like some cringy [ __ ] animal and I've
talked to a lot of people where I get
the impression very quick that they
really admire that mindset and they want
to be like the super edge Lord but
they're not actually and it's pretty
obvious they're just saying it because
they like want to be like [ __ ] edgy
or some [ __ ] and like there are a lot of
people that make the assumption that I'm
doing that and that this has actually
been one of the most difficult things
I've had to sort through on my stream is
that I make a lot of arguments in favor
of progressive social policies and
whatnot like I've probably the most
progressive like twitch streamer in
terms of like doing like politics and
there are a lot and and I would always
say things like you know I'm very
self-interested this is all where all of
my motivation comes from and just
recently I had a pretty big schism in my
fan base where people were like
something I don't even know what came up
but something came up
and people found out like wait holy [ __ ]
dusty doesn't actually give a [ __ ] about
anybody else he only cares myself and a
lot of people got really [ __ ] upset
about this and like did they really yes
like really like I had like like a bunch
of people you guys for [ __ ] mayor
people's don't believe me when I say it
like and even in China earlier well now
people are finally starting but even as
yet earlier there's a lot of people
saying and I even so no microchip on our
desk here's pretend to be just a really
edgy person but like he's he just says
all this [ __ ] to be edge
and it's like okay like I mean if you
want to think that that's fine but but
like now I have to be more careful in
how I present myself because I realize
that there are a lot of people like
there and there are people that are just
like edgy to be edgy or whatever but I
but yeah wait are you sure this is like
people and not like a person oh there
was a threat oh yeah they're really mad
about my positions on things yeah okay
and so they realized that like you
basically don't care
you really don't like most of my like
philosophy isn't interested like that's
what all of my moral positions come from
are like sup or or even a moral
positions come from like a self-interest
one of you there's a lot of people that
reject that but like on our destined to
be edgy or whatever but then like I'll
have certain conversations with people
like why is he so [ __ ] why is he so
uh you know like he doesn't care about
anyone but himself um and then people
get real mad about this and I had this
huge thing this is another thing that
played into my panic attack recently
where I started to realize like holy
[ __ ] like how much of my fan base thinks
I'm like a totally [ __ ] different
person than what I actually am because
there are a lot of people that think
that I have like this genuine goodwill
in my heart for all of mankind and that
like intrinsically I am like a loving
warm person and like this is not true I
am very [ __ ] cold and I'm not lying
when I said that most of my positions
come from like a position of like
rational self-interest like I don't give
a [ __ ] about black people really in the
unit I don't care about minorities like
I really hold like I really wholesomely
want to see you succeed it's more so the
fact that like the country is a lot of
[ __ ] problems when people don't
succeed and things would be better for
me if you did so that's where my
position comes from but people didn't
like actually believe me when I said
that I guess but I don't know if a lot
of people view is like an altruistic
dude that was like but like I'm glad
because some people say that like like
there are some people that were saying
things like well destiny said this
little time but there were a lot of
people that didn't believe that at all
that we're like destiny is like no I'm
like a huge piece of [ __ ] I can't
believe he said this this is the last
straw for me destiny said that he
doesn't think he's morally opposed to
slavery he's only looking at how society
treats that his outcomes like yeah
pretty much yeah okay so all right I
accept all that so like now you're
saying that you're gonna change the way
that you or you're thinking about
changing the way that you say these
things because you're worried
about the thing that I have to think
about now is like and now this sounds
like classic [ __ ] sociopath behavior
whatever is like I don't know if I
should be as forthcoming about my
internal processes because I think that
most of my conclusions tend to be like
like pretty good like when I say pretty
good like most of my conclusions are
desirable amongst like progressive
liberal people in the u.s. so what do I
gain from revealing my inner thought
processes other than more people like
[ __ ] hating me when I could just lie
about it I'm like oh no yeah look I love
humanity so let's talk about immigration
you know yeah and mine's probably gonna
be a little bit different but you know
there's virtue and transparency yes I'm
your entire meme is basically that I
think like what one of the reasons why
people respect you a great deal and one
reasons why I respect you a great deal
is because you actually take the time to
formulate the background of your of your
argument and you do not just state
something like what difference what
differs you from like the youtubers
you're arguing with is like they'll just
say something right they'll be like I
watched a YouTube video and now I know
that this happens right where you'll be
like okay I want to go look at the
evidence I want to go look at the
theories and then I want to base off of
my own personal experience what is
happening on this and and then go
forward with it right um so that that
mindset is one of the reasons why people
respect you I think what Stubb was about
to say was that if you lose that you're
losing a sort of aspect of your life I'm
very I'm very big on building arguments
from the bottom up this is what I tell
people like don't just look at like this
top like we need to have a good
understanding from is low levels we can
but the thing is is that what I realize
is that people have this assumption
about what my low level thought process
is that I guess I don't go explicitly
into detail enough as and it seems like
when I get more into detail it just
makes everybody else we're really
uncomfortable so I don't really gain
anything from doing this I don't
understand okay so for instance let's
say somebody poses a hard question to me
or well it's not a hard question but
let's say somebody says something to me
like this okay destiny let's say that
there were absolutely no negative
outcomes that could ever possibly happen
in the history of all of mankind if you
were to enslave a race of people
you be okay for it then my answer would
be yes if there is no possible way that
it could ever have a negative harmful
repercussion to me then I would say yes
yeah go for it and like a lot of people
in hearing that kind of an answer are
incredibly upset because they always
assume that when I argue against things
like slavery or immigration well destiny
is doing this because at the most
fundamental level he has a moral code
where he believes that all men are
endowed to certain types of freedoms and
certain types of humane treatment etc
etc etc and this is why I really like
destinies philosophical conversations
because like I know he's got his
arguments thought-out from the very core
and I know that like his moral code is
something that I very much buy into but
if the reality is that my moral code I
mean if anything I think it's like an
amoral hedonist like I just want to
create a world that's as good for me as
possible
I just happen to agree a lot with
progresses and how to do that right that
when immigration it you know happens
from other countries when we help other
countries and more people succeed it
grows if your base for my stream it
grows a larger market for us to sell
products do that in a roundabout way all
of these things end up greatly
benefiting me and that's why I'm
generally in favor of them I'm not
arguing from like a warmer appreciation
for mankind or something but when people
hear about the deeper things they get
like really upset about it so it's like
why should I even go into it maybe I
should just lie and say oh no look I do
actually have a really strict moral code
and I love all people you know well look
at it this way what sort of credibility
does it lend to your views when you know
first you're having this conversation
about lying openly or it doesn't matter
what conversation I have I got always
swinging it to where like you know I
went back and forth and emails like
maybe people point to this but they
could never truly prove it they could
only inductively recently and I would
just deny it and it's whatever okay
you're putting a lot of weight on proof
and I'll go back to the old adage of you
know appearance of a conflict of
interest is as bad as an actual conflict
of interest go ahead alright so that
only matters what people believe right
if what the regardless of the truth
which is you know unfortunate certainly
but wait we've had a question no that
was the end oh okay
all right I don't I think wait Stephen
is literally known for lying
that's why emotions as well I don't
understand this is not a new thing
I think there's a sort of spiritual
component to people sorry that that's
gonna be meantime I think intuition
exists there we go okay so I think that
like people can sort of sense your
platform and if you're lying
- and then basing those lies sorry
creating conclusions based on those lies
there'll be a different sense to you
than there is now does that make sense
yeah but I don't believe that people
would be able to detect it I could be
wrong
yeah I think I think I know that I'm
right because there are people that even
when I've been honest and forthcoming
already thought different things about
my internal processes so I'm like well
this goes back to audience
sophistication right we can't really
yeah but I would assume that my
political audience is more sophisticated
than most on YouTube and twitch and I
think that's a fair assessment I've got
like a decent number of lawyers and
politically sophisticated people to some
extent of my audience compared to say
like [ __ ] sargon of akkad audience or
that Anthony dudes audience like I would
think that my fan base is like decently
sophisticated comparatively speaking I
mean if they're not this is the apex
like whose is better would be my next
question yeah I mean there's definitely
a lot of like [ __ ] dune bugs and
[ __ ] anime lovers out there but
there's a good amount of like
sophisticated people in check yeah like
I'm not saying that my chat is like
literally like a collection of like the
the intellectuals of the future world or
some [ __ ] but like who's got a better
like politically minded audience on
Twitch or YouTube than me like that
[ __ ] reminds me of when we were
really high and he told me to do bugs
doing
oh yeah I've got some crazy people my
guy won't deny that yeah they gotta they
come in for sure I just I don't I don't
know like it also is like a 180 from
your previous position right like if
you're suddenly like just kidding like I
love all humans like I don't know it's
gonna have like a lot of weird
implications I don't think you're gonna
do it first of all because I don't think
that's the conclusion you're gonna read
wait you can have your first modus
operandi being self-preservation and
second genuinely wanting everyone else
to do okay it doesn't have to come first
the philosophical hypotheticals get
really uncomfortable that's sailing
prowess of the hypotheticals get
uncomfortable people because like I said
like in a real world I'm never in favor
of slavery because cuz it'll because I
don't think the outcomes are ever better
than the non slavery so I'm always
against it but people still get really
[ __ ] hot mad to hear me answer
hypotheticals that way look at the
fallout from the vegan gains debate when
when he posed the hypothetical what if
there's a group of like nomadic people
or whatever and these people were
incapable of respecting the social
contract like do you think would be okay
to hunt and kill these people and like
my answer to that is always gonna be
yeah sure I guess but I don't think that
there's any group of people in reality
they're incapable of respecting the
rights of other people but I think the
way that I have to answer those
hypotheticals needs a lot of people to
think of it I'm like [ __ ] and saying
or some [ __ ] and it's like I don't know
if it's worth it to deal with wait the
one thing I guess the only what is
something I've had an issue with you
lately
is that you sometimes will not say the
obvious answer like the other day with
the abortion debate like if you're in a
room and there's a [ __ ] baby and like
some petri dish with one thing like who
would you run out with you're like whoa
I don't know I mean technically like
it's a [ __ ] obvious answer I know
what you would do it's no [ __ ]
question it doesn't matter if there's a
thousand feet of salt would you debate
it would you possibly leave the baby
there no of course you wouldn't but like
you would know I I would I would I would
grab the petri cells if it came if it
was like 50 like petri dish things or
whatever it would leave the [ __ ] baby
yeah sure sorry it has to do with like
like moral consideration for for fetuses
if they were like guaranteed vital
fetuses that could definitely I'm
talking in the real [ __ ] world you're
in an abortion clinic I mean that's like
that's like really hard to answer I mean
I can't I can only give you like the
philosophical answer I can't tell you in
the real [ __ ] world cuz I don't know
maybe I don't grab anything maybe I trip
over my shoelaces and [ __ ] myself and
die and with everybody I don't [ __ ]
know like in the actual like in the real
world you know it is an issue of what
we're talking about here is Stephens
like commitment to have to like moral
and ethical absolute absolutism right
well or or consistency is what everybody
gets mad at me for like why you care
about manga says it so much destiny just
not me
[ __ ] - yeah as like a [ __ ] I I think
like it has like a no [ __ ] it's just not
practical my dear like nobody lives life
this way you can't live life as a
totally morally consistent human and
you're not either sure but I'm over
morons no know why even you're
introverted because no you don't you can
be okay admitting a moral can
inconsistency with something because you
understand you're a morally inconsistent
being you can make certain moral
sacrifices while working to create a
better society at scale that's possible
to do cuz it's not just a and B dude you
can't just be like it like it you can't
just write everything off that somebody
says because they're just they're
slightly more morally and consistent in
one area again just makes it hard
because have because it's not fair that
you get to pick and choose where you
want to be morally inconsistent in like
that just seems like such a cop-out like
what right do you have to tell somebody
they can or cannot do a certain thing
that they consider like morally
justified if you're doing things that
you don't even consider morally
justified but you're excused oh well I'm
inconsistent in some areas like how do
you have the rights it's a attack
anybody's position because of because of
consciousness in one in one instance
you're being conscious that you're
accepting the moral inconsistency in him
yourself yeah but the same I accept it I
accept that I accept a moral
inconsistency and I'm not gonna be
swayed out of it just like I think it
takes away from your argument when you
say this stuff but like it's so hard
like it ones like who you save the paper
that the other one is like if you
wouldn't the image your car would you
run over a cat with no repercussions
you're like yeah sure I wouldn't swerve
or do anything it's just like it takes
away I think your argument over all when
you say this and there may be wait I
agree with you Dan this is why I'm
saying I should just [ __ ] lie about
it no you should you don't believe that
you're like dude I don't give a [ __ ]
about roadkill Dan I don't care like I
don't care dude I thought about killing
all the [ __ ] animals of my parents
house they got like 20 cats dude I get
going with the [ __ ] guerre 15 and
with one magazine take care of all their
problems in like [ __ ] 30 seconds dude
and I wouldn't call it all I can bear
here we [ __ ] cat in the back
yard and their life will be better off
for this wouldn't [ __ ] bother me I
would have nightmares over killing
[ __ ] cats
I eat hamburgers and chicken every
[ __ ] day why the [ __ ] would I give a
[ __ ] about some house pets right that's
different
go watch videos of cuddly [ __ ] cows
you don't have to see that I don't like
these arguments then these are the
personal removal right you're not
killing the cow [ __ ] arguments
Americans get when they support horrible
[ __ ] foreign policy and when it comes
to roost people get real [ __ ] ass
pain about it if you're an American and
you're in favor of an interventionist
foreign policy you kind of have to eat
[ __ ] like 9/11 you don't really get to
[ __ ] and cry about it I don't accept
that I don't agree in a world where
people cannot acknowledge the
consequences of their actions because
they're removed from the direct effect
of it wait I don't accept that if you
eat meat essentially you have to be okay
with killing cats and not feeling
anything for it I think because you take
two logically you don't have to go to
that [ __ ] level there's other stuff
but this leads to really [ __ ] up [ __ ]
if I walk down the street and I saw that
there were kids who worked in a factory
that had net set up and if they jumped
you keep the same calorie intake it's
probably gone down just because I'm not
snacking at night that's my guess
yep yeah what a mind how you doin bud
thanks for having me on my wonderful did
yeah that was a quite a thing last time
yeah hold on wait listen is your mic
turned down er no actually they said
that two on dance chat you might have to
turn me up for some reason gadget 207
it's pretty quiet really oh you know
maybe it is actually turn down hang on
one second yeah let me see okay how
about that
oh yeah that's a little better hold on
all right you know if I called on one
second donation how many pounds do you
lose a week
what kind of meals do you eat I can't
eat big meals in and six to eight hour
window so I just die of unicorn and do a
low calorie diet instead there just do
it works for you man [ __ ] all right what
do you say all right oh no what's up how
you doing buddy yeah we're still I'm
good man I had a I had a bit of trouble
with our last discussion which is to be
expected yeah yeah well when you bring
on an expert to fight at a field I
didn't even want to fight him in the
first place okay firstly you pretty much
repeated most what I said secondly I got
like three be one for the entire earlier
conversation to be fair I yeah but I
don't spend 10 hours on stream every day
debating people professionally so when I
get blown the [ __ ] out in front of 4,000
people it could be a little bit
difficult you know you're right no
you're right you're right I mean I'm
used to it yeah yeah so here's the deal
you ever watched Dragon Ball super no
but I've seen all Dragon Ball Z all
right do you know Frieza yeah yeah you
know about Foreman our yeah Frieza never
trained he was just powerful enough to
go through with it and just deal with it
and so I've trained for the first time
my dude
and now I'm golden Frieza okay so I hope
Aaron packed your lunch because we're
going to school Oh No yeah this shit's
gonna be real today my man okay it's
just a conversation there's not to be
too crazy all right no it's gonna be a
real conversation just chatting okay
holy [ __ ] man I did probably like maybe
like six or eight hours of research on
this of research that's scary yeah it
seemed like it was mostly like internal
questions that needed to be solved no
[Music]
okay yeah I think I think one part of it
is I think there's two parts really I
think there's the issue of the moral
inconsistency that we covered the last
time but I also have a bigger issue with
you personally on your platform on you
know I really had to think through here
we go and I I think okay so where do you
want to start let's go let's get right
to the meet the bigger issue with me and
my platform okay cool
let's do that first all right I need you
to I need to confirm a couple of things
first before like I'm really sure that I
want to go down that route right cuz I'm
not actually sure you might believe
these things are not okay okay so as far
as your moral framework and the the way
that you look at the world do you
incorporate myth belief and emotion into
those things at all it depends on the
argument but not I guess I'll answer no
okay do you acknowledge their importance
in driving any human behavior yeah of
course in what way
I mean people whether or not you make
decisions using emotions you have to
live with and interact with people that
make decisions using emotions
yeah but but in a purely in a framework
outside of deductive reasoning do you
believe that myth belief and emotion can
serve and drive human behavior
positively in a thanks coming and a
framework outside of deductive reasoning
can they drive human behavior positively
so yeah so let me expand so I currently
the way that I see your the ability that
you make the way that you make decisions
and the way that you come to conclusions
is largely through scientific method
hypothesis and deductive reasoning right
like you think it would be called pathos
as opposed to ethos or something yeah
yeah right so so what I'm trying to
figure out is if that's the only vehicle
that you value and making informed
decisions in life
yes yeah okay that's what I thought okay
cool good stuff all right
okay so I am going to try to make a case
why belief emotion and myth are
necessary and drive human behavior in
ways that are equal to deductive
reasoning and scientific method okay
okay and then and then my personal
belief on this is that I'm perfectly
okay with people reaching conclusions
about wife from mythology belief and
emotion and I think there's a lot of
examples of how this serves us okay okay
and the outcome that I would like you to
reach is that you acknowledged the
importance of these things in your
framework because I think that the way
that you approach this personally is
fine if you didn't have a platform of
thousands of people that I think are
listening to you and taking the wrong
thing away from it so so like I think
that the the people that you know I
think that a lot of your audience
doesn't think through the moral
positions that you have like you have
thought through them and they might come
to conclusions such as like I should
unload a clip of ar-15 ammo and some I
into cats because I think there's no
there's no strong moral reason why I
shouldn't or like I should take 10.5
grams of shrooms
that's like obviously the the
objectively highest team experience
right these are really dangerous things
I think we have to be really careful
about but but in thinking about them
I've realized the only way to really
deal with this and talk about this with
you is on the same level the II deal
with things which is like academic
reading with research okay sure
the other I don't want to like [ __ ]
like explosion well every one of those
people that like takes on like 99% of
the conversation so there anything about
that I don't disagree anything you've
said so far huh okay cool all right
to be okay just to preface this okay
with the yeah careful warning okay are
you ready oh yeah I'm totally ready I
spent a lot of time thinking about these
things so be just be ready for that okay
so don't don't be upset or frustrated
and we're gonna be having a super chill
conversation alright I'm counting on it
okay all right yeah the only time I'll
really get frustrated is if there's a
third party and I've already I've
already asked Dan not to be here and
because the logical fallacies [ __ ] up my
argument and and I know you'd like so
this is this is a straight good
old-fashioned conversation between
friends okay all right here we go
so what's alright so we're gonna stick
to we can get to the other memes later
but we're gonna stick to this like this
this idea that emotion belief and myth
have an importance in driving human
behavior okay here is the here's what
I've come up with for this all right I'm
gonna I'm gonna go through a series of
step by step like agreements and we'll
just see if we like disagree on any of
them and then like we'll address them
each in turn is that okay yeah actually
fine okay so would you say number one
that human beings have the power to
explain ideas or sorry to have ideas and
experiences that we can't explain
rationally No okay so what's let's start
let's start there can you explain your
egodeath rationally yes how
psilocybin supposedly emulates serotonin
in the brain and then when you take a
[ __ ] ton of serotonin it is possible for
you to have conscious experiences that
are nothing like what you would normally
experience on a day to day life how you
experienced those things is gonna defer
from person to person it's probably
gonna have to be related to things that
you've experienced personal life and
then just whatever other crazy sense
isn't [ __ ] your brain sends you while
you're like overloaded on these
serotonin emulating chemicals okay
that's how I would explain it I guess
thing okay are you able can you
rationally explain the experience of
like hot or cold to people before
because you've said no I can't
communicate a conscious experience again
now not being able to communicate it is
different than not being able to explain
I would say but yes maybe rationalize
consciousness itself I can explain what
I think it is but to fundamentally
explain the nature of consciousness no
I'm not able to explain that I don't
believe in a we're back to the axiom
that human beings do have the power to
experience things that they cannot
explain rationally as you just said that
you can't explain let me let me let me
be very very clear here so okay so the
exactly there's one word here that's
real important so human beings are
capable of experiencing something that
they cannot rationally explain I would
agree with that statement human beings
are capable of experiencing something
that cannot be rationally explained I
would disagree with that statement do
you see the difference no sorry okay you
Evert so human beings are capable of
experiencing things that they themselves
cannot rationally explain right yep okay
I understand human beings can experience
things that have no rational explanation
I don't agree with that does that make
sense or do I need to elaborate on 16
okay so it is possible I'm sure so it's
possible that humans can can experience
something that they just don't have the
ability to explain due to lack of
knowledge lack of insight like a
scientific progress whatever however I
do not believe that things exist that do
not have a material explanation so for
instance you might you might experience
a certain thing like anxiety or
depression or a crazy shroom trip
however if we had the sufficient
technology to explore these things to
tear open a brain
look at every single neuron there would
be a rational materialistic explanation
for all of these phenomenon okay that's
fine yeah just because I can't explain
something or humans can't explain
something doesn't mean there is no
explanation for that thing that's not
like a rational materials thing would be
my belief okay yep okay that's totally
fine the only thing I'm trying to the
only thing I'm setting up is that that
human beings do have the ability to
experience and have ideas of things we
cannot explain rationally to each other
correct that we cannot that we can't
experience yeah it doesn't mean there is
no explanation okay cool yep then I
agree that yep okay cool so would you
agree that one of these irrational
experiences is imagination
aka we can think of something that is
not immediately present right but what
it's initially conceived it has no
objective existence wait I'm sorry could
you say that again yeah let me just say
it again sorry let me I got a listen
recovery yeah so one of the irrational
experiences that we can have is our
imagination
aka we can think of something that is
not immediately present uh-huh and when
it's initially conceived there's no
objective existence that's what
imagination is right there there's no
objective existence and some if you
imagine something like if I imagine a
design for a new house right okay at the
current moment in time in my imagination
that has no objective existence it
doesn't exist anywhere okay so I just
because I'm to make sure that I'm
carrying a base for where you're going
I would I would agree that the object
that you're imagining doesn't exist but
that that actual existence of that
object in your mind could be traced back
to some neuron firing somewhere in your
brain that's fine but it doesn't have
any objective existence in reality
well that neuron exists in reality but
to think the thing that you are
imagining doesn't exist so the house
doesn't exist anywhere but that there is
a specific neuron in your brain or a
group of series of neurons that are
connected that can explain that thought
maybe it right but but yeah well I
wouldn't say maybe I would say you would
say it would be
yeah okay okay so would you would you
then say that that thing has an
objective existence as soon as it's
conceived the only the only I'm trying
to be over here is when you say thing
that pronoun we just make sure referring
to some things weird yeah so when you
say that thing exists
the thought exists as a neuron or a
series of neurons in your brain yes that
thing that you were envisioning in your
imagination that particular thing
doesn't exist okay so what part of it
does exist so right now if I close my
eyes and I imagine a giant purple boat
that giant purple boat that I'm
imagining doesn't exist however if you
probed my brain you could find the exact
neurons firing that were responsible for
the thought of that giant purple boat
existing yep okay that's fine yeah or
even or even more comparable I don't
like using computers to as an analogies
human brains because they function quite
differently but like on my hard drive I
might have a picture of a massive giant
boat that now the boat itself doesn't
exist but the picture does this would be
a notice to the neurons right yeah okay
okay but so that so to go back there I
agree with you there and but you would
you would agree that one of these sort
of experiences these irrational
experiences and in the first axiom that
I set up was is imagination right an
imagination is something that when it
initially conceived it doesn't have any
kind of objective existence in our
physical reality
okay sure we're on the same page and I'm
just going to say I agree with you and
then if it goes somewhere where I
wouldn't have a greater than all okay
yeah I'm pretty sure I agree with what
you're saying right now right okay yeah
III I'm not I'm not playing nothing by
the way nothing at the end of this isn't
like a jack-in-the-box that comes out
and punches you right like oh yeah I
just wanted to make yeah I just wanna
make sure that we are if we're building
arguments from their foundation we have
to agree exactly what we're talking
exactly otherwise what you're gonna
happen is you're gonna bring up things
where you've like well here Steve and
I've exposed to contradiction and then
it's gonna feel like I'm weaseling out
of everything I'm like oh well no no I
didn't mean that well no I didn't mean
that right I don't want you to feel that
way that's not trying to be rock solid
yeah okay I'm exactly the same for good
okay all right
okay so we're there here is a big one so
I'm gonna make I think I think in this
point I'm gonna make a statement okay I
would say that imagination is the
faculty that creates mythology and
religion would you agree with that I'm a
little uncomfortable but sure well it
makes sense right because like the what
do you mean by imagination
okay so again the ability to create
thoughts ideas and things that are not
immediately present but have no
objective existence right but but can be
conceived on a mental level so the idea
of religion to mythology like you
obviously don't believe that
Christianity is real right you don't
think you always a real dude
that'sthat's hanging out in the sky
somewhere right so that's a surely these
things must have been the product of our
own minds or our imaginations correct
yeah there's probably no problem with
that correct let me say for a moment
here I don't believe in like genuine
like inspiration that comes from nothing
that that all of these things that have
been inspired art probably due to
external stimuli that we kind of mix and
match in our minds or whatever just to
preface that disagree that because
depending where we're going that might
be an important point to discuss so
you're saying that all the product all
conclusions that are reached in the mind
are from like external experience or
from like previous correct like I don't
believe there is any such thing as a
genuinely unique human thought that
everything is a combination of external
stimuli that lead you to thinking
whatever it is you think yeah I think
that's a I know the answer is I don't
know but I think is like a super fair
place like I haven't a problem with it
but I think it's to stand on yeah okay
and okay so so and then just to confirm
like as we discussed before right so the
scientific method deductive reasoning or
or pathos is you call actually don't
know what that definition is but just
going with it like this has a far
stronger means of uh uh helping us reach
conclude or Alize the only means for us
to reach conclusions that are productive
for human society correct and religion
and mythology have no real no real use
there we said that before just like I
mean well so let me be very clear here
you can use religion and mythology and
all that [ __ ] to come to good
conclusions I just think that pathos in
general what will always get you there
in a better way with less baggage would
be what I would say guys that's
different from what you said before
which is that which is that religion and
mythology and belief in emotion have no
objective good well so it would depend
on where you caught me so like let me be
very very clear okay and I have said
this multiple times in the past when I
do things ever now right so like I can
acknowledge that religion can give us
some valuable or good things for
instance you know a lot of churches are
involved in charity and in food banks
and stuff like that but what I would
argue is that we could get these goods
using pathos and we don't need the the
ethos or whatever instead but but
churches can provide some material good
say for instance somebody says that um
the the son is the son is the devil and
anytime you expose yourself to the son
the devil enters your body right that if
you were to tell a society of primitive
people this may be they avoid the Sun
when it's at its like highest point and
they don't get sunburned and they don't
get skin cancer and die or something so
that were like an example of like an
ethos that gives us a good result that I
think pathos could have gotten us there
as well but he throws got us there also
right yeah sorry okay okay so so your
position understood your position
because he didn't say that at the first
point I'm saying so your position now
your position has been sorry and I want
to like make you I don't want to treat
you like you like just change yeah so
your position is that scientific
reasoning is always stronger but but but
that there's some use of religion and
mythology sure and I'll be even and all
even find this to find him is more I
think that science and reasoning should
always be stronger yeah
I'll say that because obviously to some
people they're more likely to listen to
a story than they would to scientific
reasoning so in that case
maybe religion is stronger for them okay
my first my first objective was to get
you to say that and my second objective
is like to get them equal kind of I
guess as a matter of scale to get them
like equal coaster to each other in that
it's not my what is your argument [ __ ]
this : I'm a a Diana dude oh okay yeah I
think he's on my side so this is gonna
be really unfair are you ready to
experience what I just experienced yeah
that's fine like I can I can do the one
thing Oh Molly someone in your chat is
not gonna be comparable to you in debate
I'm ready yeah okay good like hold on
one sec thanks dude I love the hog meme
I don't know this is too bad mistake I
mean ultimately if I get [ __ ]
trounced and I'll just like back up and
try to rethink my wife and it'd be good
he's getting headphones all right good
luck
why do you keep saying that it's a smart
guy is he what up hey how you doing
pretty good how you doing buddy he
sounds not too bad not too bad
all right who's this guy Devin yeah
what's up buddy my dude I'm Alexia okay
I come from a long line of debaters oh
okay so do you think it's wrong to
torture a cat I don't care about this
[ __ ] here's what I care about it's not
you answer the question not the position
I'm gonna take I know I already know
what I've thought that five thousand
years in the future after every timeline
and I see where you're going and it's
already [ __ ] okay so you realize your
moral system is already [ __ ] within
five seconds of this debate because okay
little [ __ ] dude now I know what Steven
met he literally can kill me this is
awesome he's probably hit man
all right Steven your entire problem is
that you changed your position whoa
don't talk to me I'm gonna teach you my
only right or morally wrong or morally
neutral to skin a cat alive
I have never I have never done not on
that platform I'm not trying to make
that case screaming you're not on the
platform - what do you believe I'm
asking a simple question it doesn't
matter what I believe what I'm what up
what I'm dealing with is Stevens issue
with moral inconsistencies in people so
it has nothing yes a good case for that
it seems like you might have a moral
consistency I'm sorry it seems like you
have might have a moral consistency he
might be right in saying that yeah I
wanna see no sorry you are you aware of
the principle of explosion in philosophy
I don't care about any of this the
principle of explosion in philosophy
when you have a moral inconsistency in
your system your your system explodes
because anything is justified you can
just draw a circle around a certain area
I'm gonna be convinced inconsistent in
this place I can't just draw a circle
around you and say I'm gonna be
inconsistent and kill you no you can't
because the moral scale like I'm okay
I'm just inconsistent okay hold on wait
I'm going to verbalize the
counter-argument to this and you can
send me what you think your answer would
be and I think there is a consistent
argument against this so somebody could
argue that there are certain world
crimes that we can commit that are of a
different scale that don't necessarily
explode out to a separate bound so let
me give you an example shut the [ __ ] up
let me give an example somebody believes
that murder is a moral wrong okay this
person also believes that breaking laws
is a moral wrong just because this
person might say change lanes in an
intersection or break some
inconsequential traffic law doesn't
necessarily mean that they have to
accept that murdering people might be
okay or that we can argue that there
might be scales of okay so this is a
conflation so you're conflating between
what a moral system logically says and
what a person actually does in their
acts so yes I can do something like I
couldn't believe certain things and
certain things that just cuz I'm a
fallible human I do these things but
that doesn't mean that doesn't speak to
the moral consistency or inconsistency
of what I actually believe or not
okay so if I could see 42 not not a
completely acting out of equipment and
my moral system with the logical
extensions of my moral system itself
that's why I'm never asking him in this
debate I'm never actually asking him if
he would skin a cat I'm asking him in
his moral system does he consider it
wrong to skin a cat I'm focusing on the
logical extensions of this moral system
and not him as a person
yeah I understand that but it feels like
if we apply the principle of explosion
where would that that principle is only
applying insofar as we are arguing over
like objective truths about moral
systems not necessarily how they play
out in the real world I'm not applying
the principle explosion to him as a
person and saying oh because you did
this one wrong thing you you might as
well not be novel to anymore especially
the claim is that you thank you point
prove it here so then to center back
around so that we're all on the same
page you're essentially saying that as
soon as you accept some inconsistencies
there's an irrationality in a system
that system becomes internally
inconsistent and therefore worthless
right oh yes as this - the system itself
yeah okay and I agree with that yeah all
right okay so go for it good luck Devon
okay so okay so so in your moral system
is it morally right morally wrong or
morally neutral to torture accounts
again I don't care about this so here's
what I give you the way to end I'm gonna
give you the way okay let me know I
already won you don't get this like you
answer the question Malaysia and then
let's go I like that one better okay
is it morally right morally wrong to
torture dogs or cats I don't care about
this because there's nothing actual
problem of why I'm gonna or why I'm
actually talking to Stephen about like
what you're talking about has nothing to
do with what I'm talking like there's a
position what am I here what am I in
here for I don't know Stephen brought
you in to make a quote of himself to
[ __ ] kill me
solutely hired a hitman to assassinate
that's what they say it seems like but
you seem wait let me summarize the
problem here okay so the issue that I
have with most with most quote unquote
moral people a V or a V you said was a V
right it was a V okay many people claim
to have moral systems that they adhere
to however many people acknowledge that
they are hypocritical in these moral
systems so for instance you I'm sure
I've taught because you're in the for
the activism server I'm sure that you've
talked to a number of car nests that
will say something along the lines of I
acknowledge that eating meat is probably
not right but you know I do it anyway
because I'm lazy and my issue is that I
believe that if you claim to have a
moral system if you acknowledge this
sort of inconsistency in this hypocrisy
it makes you impossible to compel others
to act in ways that you consider moral
that's my issue and Devon disagrees with
that position what can I actually put my
position on the table without this guy
[ __ ] telling me that I need to like
believe in killing cats or no I mean if
you're well held on Abbey do you
disagree than anything I just said Devon
yeah wait I thought I did some are you
you think that you should be able to
compel people to act morally even if
you're inconsistent right as a matter of
scale and because and you changed your
argument over that I like halfway
through what an argument to okay so your
original position was that you were
completely absolute that you said that
if you have a slight moral inconsistency
in your argument then you are
disqualified from world ethical
discourse your second position then
change and then you said [ __ ] not
absolutely and you said that now the
moral and the world and consistency is
only relevant to the scale I am going to
appeal to your sense of charity bility
here and I'm going to say that in this
conversation I assume that we were
talking about crimes of a similar moral
gravity that I will acknowledge that if
somebody cheats in a video game it
doesn't necessarily mean they have to be
ok with another person raping their
whole family ok yeah so that's my entire
position so then my position was that if
you acknowledge that killing animals is
probably morally wrong but you still do
it that killing people isn't that far of
a stretch from that I so I don't think
you have used this moral scale argument
here right so you're saying that yeah
yeah
but then we get where we got lost was
because like where we ended up was like
you said that basically that me being me
did making the decision to eat meat
right was of the same scale and caliber
as Bill Cosby date-rape eating dozens of
women I think it's a I don't think I
would say the same but so I think argue
worse and some people would I think I
would argue similar that if you think
that murdering animals is wrong but you
do it that that it's really hard for you
to compel people to act a certain well
with much the same act of me eating meat
is comparable to to date raping a bunch
of women but I just have no recent argue
totally wrong sure but that's Benford
but you can't but you don't you admitted
that you said that murdering animals is
wrong right are you we gonna change that
or we're fine I'll be charitable I take
that matter no I'm not going back like
matter scale Bill Cosby is real Cosby
raped way less women than you eat
animals so what is the scale here I mean
that's true so the way to think about
this really I'm just imagine if it was a
trait equalized to human so if you want
to like take a take a look at the
morally relevant differences between a
human and an animal you can say it's
sentience level its ability to
experience well-being just imagine if
there was a human who was mentally
handicapped or whatnot and if their
traits that you would consider morally
relevant were equalized to that of the
animal then would you look at it the
same way and say okay well you know I'm
just paying for the mentally handicapped
persons flesh it cuz I just like that
you know it's not that morally wrong I
can still say all these morally good
things and can tell these people to do
great things even though I'm purchasing
mentally handicapped humans watch I
think your position is is really
intelligent but I also don't think it's
practical like like I think that society
is more complex than that like we have
we have like different feelings and
positions on people why on human beings
than we do on animals right and in
actual practical society yeah sure but
again I would just ask for consistency
so I'm asking what makes it wrong to do
these things what makes it wrong to do
these things to humans what makes it
wrong to do these things to animals and
I would ask you to apply the scale
collage eclis consistently so I
understand their feelings yeah I know
yeah you could defeat me no matter what
their way this isn't
arguing though we understand that you
can't the argument then is if you compel
other people to act in moral ways with
you acknowledge that you can't
internally validate your own system
that's the argument we're having exactly
which is why I didn't want to get caught
in the torturing capture yes so this is
why so he's already admitted that he is
wickedly inconsistent with his own
application of his moral system but now
the argument is can he compel other
people to act in whorl ways while
acknowledging his own moral
inconsistency I mean it and it's just a
lot harder I mean it's just an I don't
see why you couldn't I mean someone
could say listen I'm being I'm hypocrite
but that doesn't mean that what I'm
saying is logically not true you can be
a complete different I mean look so
here's my here's my challenge to that
okay let's say that we're having an
argument and you're trying to compel me
to some moral activity right let's say
that you are Aguila say that I'm
somebody that walks around and I break
and how's the still should let's say
that you say to me okay well hey um you
know you shouldn't break it house isn't
still [ __ ] it's wrong you're violent you
have Tommy's brother scaling property
etcetera etcetera and then I go to you
okay um yeah you're probably right but I
really enjoy this I'm just being
hypocritical there on what grounds do
you tell that person that their
hypocrisy is wrong when you've already
admitted a hypocrisy of your own how can
you challenge that other than saying
that like yeah I mean you can like so
you like strict morals it's like well
you're actually doing an ad hominem
attack you know my hypocrisy doesn't
invalidate my moral system but from a
pragmatic like argumentation point of
view it seems really hard to compel
somebody like matically are completely
screwed absolutely pragmatically like
it's very very because everyone's gonna
look at this and consider and look at in
the way that oh you're a complete
hypocrite why should i why should i take
anything you say I'm just saying from a
logical point of view from a logical
logical point of view and appeal to
hypocrisy is fallacious because you can
be a hypocrite and still advocate for a
system of ethics that's consistent but
when you're inconsistent yourself I
should clarify that you're right from a
pragmatic point of view it seems very
very difficult or it may be even from a
philosophical point of view to advocate
another person be consistent yet allow
yourself to be inconsistent on what
grounds do you justify your
inconsistency and attack their you from
the philosophical view you just say
simply because I'm I'm a terrible person
doesn't mean what I'm saying right now
in this moment in time is terrible yes
would be immense yeah yes
gotcha I like this guy everything I mean
it but then that means that you have to
acknowledge that you're a tear
person that's the other side of I think
the person I'm talking to is a terrible
person I am but I still have [ __ ] to say
that's worthwhile wait okay I'll accept
it sure if that is here if that is your
position yeah okay sure
yeah I can accept that yeah I'll accept
that too I mean I think yeah you're you
are a terrible person but there is some
good that can come but I can say some
good ass [ __ ] my dude we're good buddy
my dude you got there you did it you
just had to admit that you were a
terrible [ __ ] human being and then
you managed to with me now at the end of
infinity war what did it cost now I can
retire to my home and let me just let me
just try to like persuade you a little
bit let me just wanna beat don't you
want to not be a terrible person yeah of
course I've devoted my life to to
helping other people right so like I
would obviously not want to be a
terrible person
yeah so wouldn't you want to extend that
to like other beings that can experience
first-person perspectives and love and
experience the torture they were and not
slaughter these beings and not
contribute economic demands is
fluttering these beams like wouldn't you
want to do that if there's a way you
could do that like this be honest about
it then um well okay so the reason I can
admit I'm a terrible person is I think
all people were terrible like Mike come
on that's such a cop-out man that was
sort of my whole position in attacking
Stephen in the first place right was
that like even saying that nobody is
valuable because they're because they
have moral and consistencies or because
they're terrible people some way is not
realized you realize that most Americans
go about in cruise control mode
throughout their entire life they never
did aren't educated in philosophy they
don't understand haven't taken the time
to introspect and think about moral
systems yeah they have no idea that
they're actually being inconsistent you
realize it now you realize you're being
you just told me where you were a
terrible most people don't go and say
introspect and really think about these
things philosophically and then come to
the conclusion that hey you know what I
just realized that I'm a terrible person
don't acknowledge themselves as flawed
individuals I would say that's probably
yeah flawed individuals sure I
acknowledge myself as a flawed
individual I don't think I'm a terrible
person I don't throw it away when I when
I was convinced of this I kind of did
realize that I was like hey wait a
minute what I'm doing if I want to be
consistent I really should go vegan did
you and all I'm yes and all I'm asking
is now that you realize this and you've
by your own admission you you've told me
this maybe if you want help in going
vegan I'm willing to help you we have a
whole server there willing to help you
oh [ __ ]
thanks man but I'm good animal that you
don't need oh okay but how about that
but it sounds like you want to be a
terrible personality there's like I just
asked you if you want to be a to want to
not be a terrible person you told me yes
so the logical conclusion of that is
that you realize this is why you're
being a terrible person then we're
willing to help you take a step away
from that wouldn't you accept my hands
I'm offering it to you um I think this
feels like a very come to Jesus type of
thing or the same type of energy so I'm
to not slaughter beings there's a
come-to-jesus type of thing well so
here's the thing how could you
ironically say this I'm I'm completely
fine I'm completely fine with the it
with the positive impact I make on the
earth and contrast with negative impact
I make on the earth and meat but you
would never accept it in any other
context from anybody that said the same
thing yeah human beings better as people
and and I eat meat I would be perfectly
fine with those people myself ok let me
ask you a question ok so if someone were
going around slaughtering trade
equalized humans so if someone were
slaughtering the mentally handicapped in
eating them and then they said the same
exact thing you just said right now they
said you know what I've thought about
this is really terrible I'm a terrible
person but you know I'm ok with it
because I'm contributing a lot of good
you tell them yeah would you tell them
so would you tell them that you know
what that's ok but you couldn't you
should continue doing what you're doing
or would you say hey you know what I
appreciate the video you're doing to
society but maybe you should back off on
slaughtering all those mentally
handicapped people yeah it's always
separate argument I mean like use ok
that's the argument I'm making to you
right now are you mean you're making
right now here's the ring you're making
you're saying are you willing to
sacrifice the lives of animals right in
or m'ling to sacrifice the lives of
animals for your own personal preference
and enjoyment my answer is I my argument
rut to you right now is that you just
told me you're a terrible person you I
by your admission you just said okay
well you know what I've come to the
morally inconsistent person yeah okay
you're a morally inconsistent person and
that involves slaughtering beans
indirectly yes and okay so you're more
like inconsistent person on something
that involves paying for the slaughter
of being yes
okay and you if you're telling me you
are more and you already told me that
what was okay wait it's hard to keep up
with conspiracy theories because
conservatives are so [ __ ] crazy
where did they think the DNC hat came
from they thought it was like an insider
that just leaked everything right yeah
because they were because they realized
how evil the Democrats were everything
got getting a DNA test you always hear
40% Cuban to be interested closer
actually are um you're so quiet I can't
tell my headphones Kim am i actually
quiet or is this like a meme every day
that we're just gonna [ __ ] post and chat
they thought it was seth rich okay
how much hannah bet there's nothing on
the now they've got a post about this
they've gotta be there's got to be a
post there's not nothing just like
[ __ ] Fox News actually I bet even Fox
News as opposed about this today
imagine thinking the entire FBI is
compromised how powerful know if Nunez
oh my god no no no no don't even do this
there's no way this is Nunez I've heard
people talking about this between in or
around June 2016 October 2016 the
conspirators used grease for two bueno
to release documents through wordpress
so they had stolen from the DCCC and the
DNC the conspirators posing as boos 42.0
also shared stolen documents with
certain individuals on or about August
15 2016 the conspirators posing as GU
super 2.0 received a request for stolen
documents from a candidate for the US
Congress when didn't when did Nunez run
no [ __ ] way dude was he was he
running again in you guys have at least
confirmed this right was he running
again in 2016 he ran in 2016 no way dude
oh could you imagine watching Nunez his
eyes pop out of his [ __ ] head when
they [ __ ] hang him on TV nothing
would make me happier oh my god I would
[ __ ] jerk off so I would save that I
would never need to browse porn again if
I had a live video feed of Nunez being
killed for crimes against his [ __ ]
country oh my god would be the most
arousing [ __ ] thing I could ever
imagine seeing my entire life holy [ __ ]
I'm squeezing my hog to this that
worthless subhuman [ __ ] piece of [ __ ]
deserves to die for [ __ ] treason holy
[ __ ]
Congress rehab severy two years don't
yeah but don't um don't Congress I serve
six year terms a my um or is that
senators wait hold on I need to look at
I should know this Oh a senators are
every - every single congressman runs
again every two years holy [ __ ] that's
some crazy [ __ ] that's only the Senate
oh okay I don't understand what this is
can you explain I'd love to so a long
time ago I believe it was the house
Intel committee right Nunez was the head
of the Nunez house Intel committee the
house in Nunez was the ranking chair the
high court leader of the house
intelligence community okay part of what
they were tasked with was investigating
stuff related to this whole Russian
scandal [ __ ] I don't really give a [ __ ]
about what they investigate whatever I'm
more concerned with the FBI molar okay
however what Nunez did was Nunez put
together a memo remember the memo
remember the memo that the Republicans
released that was going to destroy the
molar probe and destroy the whole into
FBI investigation
basically what Nunez claimed was that he
had infallible proof that the probe and
everything was compromised
beyond all [ __ ] [ __ ] that there was
just no way that um that this
investigations that could continue so
what happened was after some [ __ ]
Nunez and against the recommendation of
other people on the house Intel
committee and against the recommendation
of the FBI Nunez released the memo with
the single purpose of undermining the
entire FBI and Moeller investigation
okay
this memo was not vetted by anybody in
intelligence okay
and what this memo basically did was it
took a bunch of really [ __ ] loose
claims it was a four-page [ __ ] memo that
put some really loose [ __ ] together to
try to make it sound like everything the
FBI was doing was [ __ ]
the FBI themselves came out with a
counter statement clarifying and
correcting some of the facts on that
memos record Nunez himself did not
actually look at any of the classified
documents that he was talking about
there was only one person on that
committee that was authorized to look at
those classified documents and that one
person was trey Gowdy and Gowdy himself
afternoon has released the memo tweeted
that he felt like the FBI was doing a
good job and that he didn't think the
memo should take away from anything so
Nunez basically put together a piece of
propaganda released to the American
public with the goal of undermining our
investigatory bodies because he was
protecting daddy Trump he should hang
for [ __ ] treason 100% this guy should
be [ __ ] killed after a military
tribunal 100 million percent this guy is
less than human trash if you care about
your country or nationalism or any of
that [ __ ] which your conservative I'd
say I thought you did but I know you
don't if you're conservative you
actually care about protecting your
party party way above country of course
what this here is claiming or I'm sorry
what the well yeah they're indictments
it's not 100 have proven but what the
molar indictments are claiming is that a
certain individual that was running for
US Congress reached out to guseva 2.0 a
guy that was leaking emails a random guy
that definitely wasn't Russian that was
leaking emails to Assange and WikiLeaks
apparently a US congressman reached out
to Lucifer to obtain some documents now
this is this here now what I'm about to
say is total speculation but what some
people are wondering is of this person
that reached out was Nunez now that's
not 100% it doesn't it could be any
years 400 and 435 I don't know how many
US US congressman are there it doesn't
have to be Nunez but if it was Nunez
holy [ __ ] Ike's
oh [ __ ] dude it's only 29 pages we might
actually just read all of this actually
we will we'll just read all of this so
this is now 29 indictments from the
Moller probe holy [ __ ]
if it stopped here with this me one of
the largest investigations of all time
in so far as like like a foreign entity
trying to influence US politics at least
in a tech sophisticated way do you think
what would even be wedding US history
would even be comparable to this I feel
like this is also unprecedented
Watergate is so weak compared to this
like people keep saying modern-day
Watergate Watergate was so Watergate was
like what it wouldn't want to get like
Nixon paid a couple dudes to break into
the DNC and like steal some files like
that was Watergate it's like so nothing
compared to this it's like so
inconsequential like I mean it was a big
deal obviously that a sitting president
would do that but like compared to
compared to this oh and then taping it
or whatever or like like secret tapes or
whatever like compared to this holy [ __ ]
why do I get one with the cover-up than
the actual crime sure
it's so unprecedented that it's
incomparable what is everything that
Russia has allegedly done
I haven't read these indictments yet but
from the last series of indictments the
last series of indictments should be of
major concern to every American did we
read them all on stream i don't remember
we did it and i tweeted all of them i
read the entire indictment it was not
that much was it even fifty pages I
remember I read the entire indictment
and I tweeted out what I thought were
the highlights although that Twitter
account is no longer available
whoopty [ __ ] do but like the the the
last series of indictments showed that
Russia had a very sophisticated
understanding of the way our political
system worked basically basically it
showed that they understood our
political memes quite a bit and that
they were very capable of infiltrating
and influencing people based on what
they thought so specific examples there
was something called an the internet
research agency was that what they were
called was like a Russian firm that had
like a seven-figure monthly budget right
it was like a seven-figure monthly
budget and the they were so lately they
had multiple Instagram accounts that
were like positioning themselves as
black lives matters people trying to
instigate people on both sides they
reached out to local protesters and
showed to organize like Trump protests
and Trump rallies there was a spot was
this in Texas or New York were they
actually organized both sides of the
same protest they were responsible for
organizing a protest and a counter
protest they have like meme
sophistication like when you look at the
messages and [ __ ] they said it doesn't
read like this is an awkward like
Russian dude trying to like pretend he
can understand us Paulie it was like oh
[ __ ] this is some organic [ __ ] [ __ ]
they ran I don't know if you ever
remember seeing tweets from this account
but I remember saying it the at ten
underscore GOP account the Tennessee GOP
account they ran that that was a Russian
account on Twitter they ran it 100%
I remember seen that account getting
retweeted so many [ __ ] times holy
[ __ ] like their where do you do find
source event this is what I'm talking
about right now everything that I just
said is in the molar indictment if it's
the indictment none of this is here
your conspiracy whatever it's in the
molar indictment but this account was
ran by Russians they had like hundreds
of thousands of followers across the
social media accounts like the the level
of sophistication of this [ __ ] was it
was insane oh my god it was so
impressive
oh they interviewed a woman who got
duped by the Russian dudes what part of
it the missus that cover up what
Republicans don't [ __ ] believe it
they're so [ __ ] stupid I don't care
if they were involved not that's that to
me is the least important they were
involved I don't know this lady's
particular politics but it blows my mind
growing up my parents were so into that
Red Scare should communism Red China the
USSR North Korea are constantly trying
to take over the world constantly trying
to destroy America like I like as a
naive young kid I might say something
like mom like why don't we get rid of
our news a moment if we got rid of our
nukes immediately Russia Red China would
come back in nuke us and take over the
world right they don't care at all about
Russia anymore what happened
I think it's so surreal it's like
unbelievable to me I can't believe it
like it actually blows my [ __ ] mind
that Mike
now Republicans don't care about Russia
at all Bob would you did you guys know
that Lauren involved you know just make
sure that you report it correctly that
you know well you guys were involved
with being patriotic right
very very patriotic but not patriotic
was the group that contacted and helped
to organize some of these activities
that you posted on your own Facebook
account those were legitimate those were
Russians but not Russians I don't go
with the Russians that group was
Russians I have nothing to do with the
Russians well apparently you did
maybe you didn't know it oh yes when
you're talking like this I don't want to
have anything to do with you
well I'm talking what's out well with me
were all Trump supporters very very much
so and all apparently following the
direction of groups there's like some
1984 [ __ ] it's like so unnerving to
watch how brainwashed this person is and
they can't even fathom for one [ __ ]
microsecond that maybe they were duped
by somebody when all the evidence points
to the other wise that were associated
with Russians who were actually
infiltrating yeah please please report
that I don't believe that that's
[ __ ] I know all the people that were
with me okay they were at my meetings
they're all Trump supporters okay mm-hmm
but did you realize that you guys were
in communication electronically with
with Russia you were posting stuff on
the Facebook Hillary Clinton was and so
was all her bandits
some other stuff that you you were in
charge of the Facebook right you were
posting and reposting almost
word-for-word the information that was
coming out of this internet research
agency in st. Petersburg you don't
believe that
huh there you go how could you even but
like how could you even oh my god it's
just like unbelievable to me yeah but
anyway if you ever saw it I'm sorry just
going back to this if you ever saw any
tweets from this at ten underscore GOP
account that Trump retweeted himself
sometimes this account was was ran by
that internet research agency with Lisp
literally Russians that these are the
other mole these are the first set of
molar in diamonds and then the fact that
you've got people like [ __ ] metaphor
and and Flynn people so close to Trump
oh my god it's like unimaginable
metaphor ran his campaign for like
[ __ ] six months wasn't it five or six
months he was the campaign head of
trumps of Trump [ __ ] oh my god
it's like unbelievable even if
everything ended like right now this is
what happens when you let old people on
social media yeah even if you ended
everything right now there has been so
much [ __ ] uncovered that should make you
so uncomfortable
holy [ __ ] why did he think he could get
away with it this time this is not new
for the Russians they've done this for a
long time across Europe but he was much
more engaging this time in our election
why now mr. Watson
I think this answer is very simple and
is what no one is really saying in this
room which is part of the reason active
measures have worked in this US election
is because the commander in chief has
used Russian active measures at time
against his opponents on 14 August 2016
is campaign chairman after a debunked
interview say his who's who's Paul
Manafort cited the fake Incirlik story
as a terrorist attack on CNN and he used
it as a talking point on 11 October
president Trump's stood on a stage
incited a what appears to be a fake news
story from Sputnik news that disappeared
from the internet he denies the Intel
from the United States about Russia
imagine being in charge of the most
powerful [ __ ] intelligence community
that has ever existed in literally the
history of all mankind right Trump has
more power at his fingertips than any
individual human in living history I'm
sorry in all of history and then getting
your news from [ __ ] Russia today and
[ __ ] Fox and Friends
imagine that right now Trump has the
ability to request to request
documentation or request reports or
compilations from the world's most
capable intelligence agencies of all
time that have the most power they've
ever had the most reach they've ever had
the most capability have ever had and
then gets his news from Fox & Friends
and Russia today he claimed that the
election could be rigged that was the
number one theme pushed by RT Sputnik
news white outlets all the way up until
the election he's made claims of voter
fraud that President Obama is not a
citizen that you know congressman Cruz
is not a citizen so part of the reason
active measures works and it does today
in terms of Trump Tower being wiretapped
is because they parrot the same lines so
Putin is correct he he can say that he's
not influencing anything because he's
just putting out his stance but until we
get a firm basis on fact and fiction in
our own in our own country get some
agreement about the facts whether it be
do I support the intelligence community
or a story I read on my Twitter feed
we're gonna have a big problem I can
tell these one-liners are should be
deeply disturbing and I know this guy
knows it but like I support the
intelligence community or a story I read
on my Twitter feed we're gonna have a
big problem I can tell you right now
today gray outlets that are Soviet what
is Russian accounts tweet at President
Trump during high volumes when they know
he's online and they push conspiracy
theories so if he used to click on one
of the
or cite one of those it just proves
Putin correct the Russia today RT I'm
sure you've seen store people link story
sometimes but it's like Russia's like
news media
yeah it's about interest in destiny
doesn't understand politics if he keeps
screaming facts if it means anything
trump cited those stories because it
benefited him not because he necessarily
believed it
[ __ ] you a year off to the gulags as
well I hope I hope there's a civil war
do I want to see [ __ ] Trump
supporters getting [ __ ] [ __ ] shot
in this country because you guys are
[ __ ] crazy like it is so hilarious to
me that you guys will on one hand talk
about how evil all the Democrats are
because of some random [ __ ] [ __ ] that
you'll make up some [ __ ] about
Hillary's selling a fifth of our [ __ ]
uranium all this dumb [ __ ] and then when
Trump is literally spreading Russian
propaganda on American sources as the
president of the United States like well
he's just doing things that are
politically expedient it's actually a
really intelligent thing to do [ __ ] you
dude [ __ ] knife here so unbelievable
like if any Democrat was doing anything
that was even remotely similar to this
you would be having a [ __ ] aneurysm
on [ __ ] 4chan on poultry like the
Democrats tried to cut you blah blah
remember this [ __ ] please look up
yesterday's confirmation of Brian a bang
Kowski his complete lack of experience
Plus working for alpha bank after Trump
campaign is pretty crazy
yeah maybe I don't probably not but
remember how much Republicans freaked
out over this by the way Russia today
remember do you guys remember
Republicans freaking out about this I
remember
[Music]
when Obama here said that after the
election he's got more flexibility
there's 15 different ways to interpret
this statement right like he can or
cannot talk about certain things because
you know obviously prior to the election
they're issues who got to focus on nope
Republicans ran with this as like Obama
is literally a state [ __ ] traitor and
his and is trying to and is trying to
like destroy the [ __ ] Union just
trying to destroy the United States like
holy [ __ ] like Republicans got so
[ __ ] ass pained about this a million
views on this video this was some crazy
[ __ ] but um but like when Trump
literally brings in a guy that has been
working overseas to help Russian
interest people win elections in the
Yugoslavia and [ __ ] and has all these
connections to Russian people and is
currently getting indicted for it there
is like a million different mental
gymnastics that Republicans will go
through to try and justify why it's not
a big deal I I can't even do it I
actually can't even I'm ready for the
[ __ ] Civil War I can't I actually
can't deal with Republicans it's insane
to me you guys are [ __ ] crazy you're
all right here we go boys
yeah boy oh boy oh boy yeah boy what's
up Oh your mics not working hello oh
yeah hey you have a master's in
philosophy in neuroscience yeah - well
one in philosophy okay I have a really
low opinion of people that do
neuroscience so you're gonna turn that
around today okay are you ready what
what what what did I hear a lot of
people that study neuroscience a lot of
really dumb [ __ ] so you're here today to
turn that all around to blow my brains
out okay well that would be bad for your
brains
I'm ready for it I want it to happen
okay why do you think Free Will exists
go wait first what let's define free
well what do you mean by free well okay
I'm a compatibilist have you heard that
term before yeah that's probably what I
am but okay so you do believe in free
will what what what version of free will
don't you believe in um I don't know
this is the official philosophical term
but I think what I've seen it written as
is libertarian free will okay okay yeah
I don't know there's like an official
like philosophical position now but
basically the concept that I've heard it
explained is libertarian free well or
maybe you could say like the layman's
version of free will is that if you
could go back in time like one hour and
like make decisions that those decisions
might somehow be different okay so like
what my position would be that if we
could measure a person from the moment
of birth that if we could accurately
capture every single variable in the
universe that you could with 100%
accuracy predict every single decision
and every single thought in every single
board they'll ever say ever make ever
any of that throughout their entire life
I don't think that's possible because
actually there's something called the
free energy principle okay let me do
this real quick okay before we go into
this so from everything that well from
everything that I've been emailed from
people that study quantum physics they
always try to tell me that or the things
that I've seen have said that
strangeness doesn't manifest at a macro
level such that would impact anything
there [ __ ] there was a role for this
yeah but like so yeah so there's that
and then there's the idea that even if I
grant you that and will say that I drop
determinism or whatever that I would
just say I'm anti free well like even if
there is some weird quantum [ __ ] that
might manifest at a physical level it
doesn't matter because you can't exit
influence anyway but okay go for it
well yeah I suppose yeah it's not I
wasn't gonna say any member jambo about
quantum nonsense because it is nonsense
but and as you say it can't it can't
manifest on the sort of macro level that
would actually really influence
genuinely and give us sort of genuine
common sense you know folk philosophy
free will but I think a free will does
exist which isn't necessarily which
isn't necessarily 100% at odds with
mechanistic determinism that is to say
that I think that we undervalue the the
I suppose the Abbott ability to use a
term that someone like Daniel Dennett
uses a lot do you know that guy I'm
capable the guy evitable 'ti capable of
being avoided or warded off evert able
okay yeah yeah yeah so like what do you
think about his version of compatibilism
I'm not used that his version is but go
ahead
so his version would be something like
you know a mouse you know that learns to
avoid mousetraps but still gets the
cheese you know because they nibble on
the right side of the trap or whatever
it is is exerting some abbut ability in
the sense that they they have sort of
taught themselves through experience or
whatever to avoid negative consequences
for themselves and in that sense they
have exerted a will but it is it's as
much a wheel as I suppose
you know ultimately a boulder kind of
falling down a cliff and just randomly
killing someone if you want to be
strictly mechanistic about it but still
it's a type of evitable 'ti that carries
with it some kind of moral
responsibility which i think is very
important
yeah and this sounds like this sounds
like a pretty standard definition of
compatibilism or is insofar as I'm aware
so I mean like I don't really disagree
with any of this right I would so I
would say I'd probably in a
philosophical sense be a compatible list
because it's important in order to
assign some sort of agency to an actor
that they do exert some type of freewill
otherwise you're gonna do a lot of like
really weird [ __ ] yeah yeah and I
suppose something that I have an issue
with with you justin is that you very
regularly say things I mean I know you
you know it's half your audience is
autistic so you're sort of maybe
claiming things too broadly sometimes
but that's probably more for
entertainment purposes but when you say
something well I'm just thinking like
when you say for example oh well
free will doesn't exist full stop then
perhaps some of your viewers get an idea
in their head are well free will doesn't
exist destiny said so I can just go and
kill my mum you know because it doesn't
matter and I've know because because I
think it's a very easy step from there's
no free will to I have no no moral
responsibility whatsoever
do you agree not really but I see how
you could get there I mean I mean that
people would still know that they're
gonna suffer consequences and [ __ ] right
like yeah show but but just it it
reduces moral agency to effectively
nothing yeah but this is actually
something that I'm a fan of I'm a very
big fan of this but maybe in a [ __ ] up
way or maybe because I haven't thought
about it enough you're a fan of nervous
no moral responsibility yeah so I'm a
fan of responsibility insofar as it
impacts outcomes but I don't like the
idea behind moral responsibility because
I believe that the burden of moral
responsibility is not
distributed in a fair way so for
instance like people would look at
people and say that murder is wrong and
like it's very easy to say that
murderers are bad people but that like
if you have this kind of like twisted
concept of agency or freewill in your
head that you might look at somebody
that has a perfectly fine life and then
wakes up one day and it's like I'm
pissed off and go kill people that you
give that guy the same type of moral
weight I say like a Taliban soldier I
somebody that's been doing it since they
were like [ __ ] 5 years old and like
that concept that in my opinion a
cancerous concept the layman's version
not necessarily compatible is version
but the layman's version of free will
just leads you to ascribe these
impossible in [ __ ] levels of agency
to people when normal people don't have
this right and if yeah and if you're a
neuroscientist right you have you must
understand this that like nobody makes a
choice in a [ __ ] vacuum that
antecedent causes and all of our yeah is
are like so [ __ ] important in terms
of determining
even your current like whether or not
you're tired or under the influence of a
drug whatever right yeah yeah yeah sure
but there's still like degrees right so
the yeah I mean I agree the the Taliban
soldier and the guy who just for
whatever reason has strike or something
in his frontal lobe and all of a sudden
kills randomly someone you know that's
that's kind of not equivalent at all
because one had some sort of contextual
region reasons which are very unusual
and we can I think actually almost said
they're not responsible in in some cases
but that's not because they have no free
will but rather their free will was kind
of distorted people still have free will
and still have some moral responsibility
but have you heard though the
distinction made between blameworthiness
and and moral agency not really unless
this ties in to the idea that like free
will is said to be that when you make a
choice without somebody like directly
and imminently forcing you to make a
decision that's said to be your choice
or it's something like that or yeah
that's I suppose a version of it
let me think one second yeah you could
argue it's a version of it so another so
what I was thinking of was the sort of
the ideas I think some of your founding
fathers and so on was slaver and that's
right I don't know what yeah so would
you blame them for being slave owners
morally speaking probably not no I'm
kind of a relativist I guess in terms of
morality a judging passed people based
on current moral norms is kind of silly
in my opinion but it was wrong for them
to own slaves right um oh god dude I
don't hi we don't we don't have to we
don't have to pick that one we can we if
that's too sensitive
I mean I'm very yeah philosophically I
mean I'm very in flux at the moment I
don't necessarily believe in moral
statements at the moment so like I would
never say something right or wrong yeah
but that's like a different I'm related
I'm still exploring that idea yeah but
no that's that's very interesting so
you're like you believe in like era
theory or no yeah I'm an Aries but I
just had like a PhD philosopher yes to
somebody like with the Masters of
philosophy explaining to me for like an
hour why being an era theorist retarders
huh that's right you can think about
them but you know there's something else
called non-cognitive yeah that's not
kind of ism is really [ __ ] dumb I
don't agree with that at all yeah all
right good well yeah you're at least on
the wrong the right side of the
cognitivist debate okay but all right so
but I don't know like go go back to even
[ __ ] Aristotle's Aristotle you know
defended slavery what do you think about
that do you think that makes him a worse
person or do you think so like I suppose
I'm asking you to judge his character on
the one hand and also the the truth
status of that belief i if you're an
arrow theorist maybe you you have no
sure so I've never like spoken words
exactly about this type of thing before
so I'm kind of spitballing this but like
if Ike if if we could if we could
presuppose some sort of like as much as
I hate to say there's some sort of moral
ideal
right okay so like a perfect moral world
if that existed on an axis all the way
to the right at one hundred and moral
debauchery and the horrendous [ __ ] is at
zero then like I feel like the way that
I would judge a person is relative to
whatever their culture was at the time
so for instance if you ask me you know
do you think that Aristotle was a bad
person because he defended slavery I
would have to look to the norms at the
time let's say that everybody at that
time thought that slavery was great but
they also like raped and tortured their
slaves but Aristotle argued slavery is
fine but we ought treat our slaves
kindly well then I would say like okay
well he was a pretty progressive person
at that point in time I wouldn't judge
him by today's standards is what I would
say
Saigon's yeah yeah but what what about
like how do you how do you sit the 100
and the zero on that scale because
you're saying that you you have well and
that would be like in a hypothetical
like if I could like predict like a
perfect but okay so if you could if you
could name precisely what actually was a
hundred percent good and what was
absolutely bad then you could start
creating that kind of scale relative to
different communities and contexts and
times and put people on the scale and
judge them according to that scale yeah
if you could physics but I but I
wouldn't believe that that scale exists
right because I don't believe that moral
facts are a thing so I okay but all
right so your your your compatibilist
who doesn't believe in moral facts but
moral agency I mean I guess it exists I
just think it's a worthless concept I'm
just not interested in ever considering
it I guess but you're interested in
saying things are right or wrong right
that's constantly what you're doing
intubates
everyday because when I need to go wrong
well I mean let's try it so I'm
interested in saying what's right or
wrong in regards to non moral facts on
so for instance will immigration produce
a economic gain or an economic loss like
I believe that I get what do you care
about that question because we're gonna
get down into some epistemological show
that I
[ __ ] talk about it okay all right
here's my getting it no I because this
is essentially the argument was
yesterday the argument that the other
guy post me yesterday was that mall
anti-realism is absolutely [ __ ]
[ __ ] because for you to begin at any
point for you to make any claim
whatsoever for even claims of like
mathematics or whatever you have to have
some end goal in mind because these are
all tools used to get there and if you
do believe in any end goal you
necessarily must be making a moral
statement so how can you ever be a mole
anti-realist right it was essentially so
but this is like this was literally just
introduced to me like yesterday so I've
never had like extensive time to think
about this so yeah so maybe I'll change
my mind on all of this but yeah all
right yes well okay that's okay but the
way that um the way that I would have
justified this a few days ago what I
would have said where I'm an aim role or
anti moral realist or whatever or or
mole anti-realist whatever is what I
would say that like I'm like everything
that I do is self-interested and this is
the basis of which I build all of my
quote unquote moral statements off of
not believing they're moral statements
but just an expression of preferences
where I would say that like I so I
personally value things like immigration
because I believe it strengthens my
country and a country that stronger
ultimately benefits me would be how I
approach all of these topics is what
produces an end result that's more
beneficial to my biological preferences
or whatever and you don't have empathy
for people say in China and benefiting
their social no not intrinsically no
definitely not okay chat please note and
clip that so destiny can we not do this
right now I already do enough [ __ ]
autistic [ __ ] moral people to do this
[ __ ] to me
[ __ ] a vegan debate oh wait you yeah
actually
oh really
yep cuz you know what I can eat animals
promote entire [ __ ] life and humans
can eat animals or our entire [ __ ]
lives and they will never rise up and do
anything bad against us so [ __ ] them but
you care like you had pets in your life
or animals that you like sure I've got a
car too if I own it and it's my thing
and it brings me personal happiness that
exceeds the happiness I'd get from
eating it then yeah of course I'll keep
it around yeah but don't tell me that
your your dog is just like your Cara
it's not a complex automata
sure I mean if some extent is right it
can be like a stuffed animal
it's my mean they're more complex so you
can interact with them in a larger
variety of ways but like animals are
like more complicated Furbys or whatever
right okay we'll do those more
complicated Furbies those animals do
they experience pain maybe but I'm not
concerned with that I don't care about
that you don't care about that no why
what do you care if I experience pain no
do you care if I don't shop ring it's
not like an experience that I value so
you don't care if you suffer I do if I
suffer yeah I'm sorry suffering like on
its own it's not but if it's something
that harms my preferences or experiences
I would care about that can I flip this
on you and ask you to compel me to care
about the suffering of something else
what what would be the reason for doing
it
well I mean ultimately I would have to
try and convince you that moral facts
exist I think because without it for
someone in your position it sounds like
you're kind of like I mean put aside
that a meta ethics for a moment it
sounds like you're almost kind of like
an ego egoist you know yeah someone who
basically just cares about their own
hell yeah so you're sort of a
utilitarian egoist or something yep who
cares about preferences okay well yeah I
just don't know I mean do you have do
you have a preference to live in a world
that has less suffering you say do you
don't care about suffering in general I
do but because it's usually more
beneficial for me so for instance let's
say I go out to eat and I've got like
there's ten candy bars on a table and
I'm with nine friends right I might like
so what I would consider a [ __ ]
objection to my egoism would somebody
who said well the egoist would grab and
eat all ten candy bars and [ __ ] his
friends but in reality my friends would
be mad at me they probably would have a
less enjoyable experience I like
spending time with people that are more
happy than sad so like I would be
willing to share the candy because it in
a way it benefits me in a net way right
right so everything you do you just
basically said is for your own net gain
yeah
absolutely everything yeah even carrying
your son yeah because I like but seeing
my son happy I've got a strong emotional
attachment zone yeah III think that's
the truth I really don't I
or if it is I can't empathize with that
ever because I know yeah III just can't
empathize with that if that's true the
truth and I kind of doubt it is I think
that but I mean I have a personality
bias and you have a personality bias so
to get to the truth of the matter
between which personality is closer to
the true human nature or the true
essence of things is pretty difficult
one to solve but I mean in general if we
looked at the human population I think
most people do care about others
suffering in and that could have arisen
only due to say evolutionary terms you
know in in an egotistic utilitarian
fashion someone in your tribe is
suffering it could mean that they're ill
that they're distressed that they're
starving and therefore you should
support them or else that could flick to
you by extension mmm-hmm so it's it's
totally possible that that that's the
reason why most humans have some empathy
but for you to have essentially no
objective empathy is kind of unusual and
I'm I can understand yes yeah we can if
you want we can do the 30-minute debate
where you say that I'm lying and then
I'll have to say that well I'm gonna be
lying but if I am lying I'm not going to
admit the truth now for the sake of the
debate I'll keep lying to win and then
we realize that it goes here I guess
here to be like my question dude you can
pull me out okay
you're the guy that can do it okay you
got the qualifications so here's my
question I'm on my [ __ ] deathbed and
I can push a button that ends all of
humanity but then extend my existence
for five or ten minutes not to push the
button why would I never why would I
ever not push the button if do you know
the inquiring ax murderer at your door
scenario [ __ ] I feel like I've heard it
please don't say this was the one about
abortion I don't want to talk about it
[ __ ] please don't be about abortion
hello [ __ ] it's about abortion all right
hit me with it dude let's go
have you heard me argue about this
before oh [ __ ] you don't even know yeah
I can't even like show anything on
screen so you don't have to use the
camera it's okay it might even cost more
like yep can you hear me oh I don't
think your headphones are configured to
hear me
Destinee RIA transgenerational
epigenetic inheritance what about it
I pretty sure I'm already familiar with
the concept the idea that certain
environments can produce biological
effects that could have biological
impacts on the next generation without
necessarily like it wait I don't know
can you hear me well it's never happened
to me before
we're going to change something testing
one two no huh all right what have you
heard my debates before um I heard one
from a few years back and then I started
to listen to the one that you uploaded
recently you know I was at work so uh
kind of turned it off about ten minutes
in so um let me see let me see if I
understand correct me if I'm wrong here
okay um you are for the legality of
abortion because you understand the
practical reasons but you're morally
opposed to it because pretty much just
the idea of terminating a life upsets
you and you would want to minimize the
numbers of abortions performed which I
mean I think everybody agrees with that
nobody wants more abortions sure yeah
that's close enough
yeah I think we can work in definition
yeah okay so um if I recall correctly I
think the guy that you're talking to I
don't know his name but I think he was a
youtuber as well he said something along
the lines are sorry you said something
along the lines what's the difference
between terminating a pregnancy and like
killing a two-year-old that you don't
want to take care of yeah I don't know
if he I don't remember if he had a good
answer for that or not any or or if he
didn't no not really
typically the only answer you can draw
is that one might be reliant on another
person's body for some time but yeah um
well pretty much my response to that is
well with the fetus when you have an
abortion the intent is it
it isn't malicious it's not like people
have abortions because they want to kill
us yes they just want to not be pregnant
anymore and if there is artificial wombs
where you could like safely transport
the fetus to the artificial womb and
then some random pro-life person must
force adopt the baby that's kind of me
being it an [ __ ] I mean I wouldn't be
morally opposed to that but the thing
with well a two-year-old is is that you
can always I mean I know states are
different but there are you can't
surrender your paternal rights you can
give a baby up for it
option people do it all the time and
especially like infants I mean they have
safe-haven laws where you can drop off a
baby you know Etta sorry my cats mailing
a fire station hospital all those places
and nothing legally it will happen to
you and another major difference between
terminating a pregnancy and a
two-year-old is that I understand that
there's a lot of stress involved of
having kids I don't have kids myself I
obviously know people who do there's a
whole lot of [ __ ] that's involved with
that and I don't even I know it's a lot
of [ __ ] but it doesn't physically affect
your body you know there's no heartburn
there's no bloating
there's no extreme I mean I guess if you
don't have a lot of sleep but actual
fatigue caused by the fetus it's not
using your nutrients I mean if you think
about it of the risks with abortion
there's four I mean you know I know we
have a lot of medical advances but still
even to this day
you're 14 times more likely to die from
complications of birth than over
abortion so there's just a lot of risks
that exist with pregnancy that don't
necessarily exist with a newborn baby
you know and even a newborn baby if
you're if you're overwhelmed with all
the stress of a baby I mean assuming you
have a good support network you can
bring the baby to the MA not a mom the
grandma your neighbor whoever and they
can take over that baby for a little
while but you can't just be like man I'm
bloated I'm vomiting no this sucks
hey buddy of mine do you mind
transferring my fetus and watching over
it for a day so I can go have a beer and
just relax like it doesn't really work
that way so I feel that those two can't
really be compared so that's just kind
of my main reasoning there so I get that
a lot because I I'm also a content
creator I am very small I don't have a
following at all have like 400 subs and
my most popular video was a video I did
on abortion and it was like I was rated
by lifers and of course you know YouTube
comments it was all meat [ __ ] and there
was one comment that honestly like I
don't know if you would agree with them
but is probably the probably one of
those stupidest things I've ever read
because I was talking about bodily a Tom
and how the government doesn't have the
you know the government can't force you
to use your organs to sustain someone
else's life but you know the whole organ
donations organ donation and blood
donation a kind of thing like corpses if
you die you're not an organ donor they
can't cut you up and they can't can't
take your kidney to save someone else's
life that kind of extends over to the
pregnancy thing because a fetus is you
know I'm not gonna say it's not life
that is life it's a human being but it's
a human being that's dependent on you
and it requires your constant consent to
use your organs in order to sustain life
so that kind of ties in with that and
then the the pro-life guy's response to
me was this was his example if you put a
baby in a bathtub and you you have to
use your organs to lift the baby out of
the bathtub and I was like yeah but
caretaking is in my opinion not the same
thing as something I don't like to say
parasitic because that sounds really
inhumane but it kind of is in a sense
like it's you're you're the host and
it's living off of you so I felt like
that's a false equivalency and the guy
even says you use your heart to lift the
baby it's like you really use your heart
to lift a baby I mean your hearts
technically pumping blood I mean I don't
know just I just got some interesting
comments there so yeah I can't eat it
can we yeah we can run through some of
these and they kind of talk about him
okay so I'm kind of breaking out the
different point so you're saying so the
first thing that you bring up I would
argue and I believe will come to an
agreement on this that intent doesn't
really matter that much so on the first
one you talked about how like well you
know when you have an abortion it's not
like you're doing it maliciously you're
not like intending to kill the fetus
you're just trying to alleviate yourself
of a pregnancy that you don't really
want right yes I mean I would argue that
if you would use that type of
terminology with anything else I don't
think we would allow that to happen
so for instance let's say I'm driving
down the freeway and I'm just done
dealing with my kid because he's being
obnoxious and I just open the door and
kind of like push him out and I keep
driving like the intent isn't that like
I really want to kill my son it's just
like I'm kind of just done dealing with
him and I don't want to worry about it
anymore so I just kind of like you know
knock him out on the freeway and let him
roll around or whatever
guys I don't think like we would accept
that as like a like an argument right do
you agree or do you think that's dis
analogous er um I mean I I agree to a
certain extent the only thing I can say
is that when you sign your you make it
personal I know you have a son when you
sign his birth certificate
I mean you assume some sort of paternal
rights and you are legally responsible
to make sure that he is safe and once
again he's an independent being at that
point that is it biologically dependent
off of someone else but sex isn't really
a legal contract so you aren't
necessarily legally bound to make sure
that fetus is cared for at all times so
once again like pushing the kid out the
car even if you don't want him to roll
in the road and get hit by a car you
just want him out of the car it's still
to me it's slightly it's slightly
different just based on that alone
because you have that paternal right
yeah yeah so I can understand that but
then we're moving on to like what kind
of like moving on to another topic right
so like we can agree that like the
intent isn't really relevant here
because we weren't really I'm just
trying to move the vagrants one at a
time we would we would never use like
intent like if I wanted to drop off my
one-year-old kid in a dumpster we would
never say like well the intent isn't to
kill somebody we're just doing it right
I'm just trying to move past like the
intent thing right that we're using that
as a proxy for other issues yeah okay
so the first argument was intent the
second thing that you brought up was
that the one problem with the fetus is
that um you can't like transfer it that
you're kind of stuck with it until for
at least nine months or whatever I think
that this kind of ties into your
biological impact argument that there's
a greater biological impact of a child
then than have ever there's a greater
biological impact of having a fetus
implanted in you versus an actual child
it exists separate of yourself right
yeah so I can acknowledge that obviously
I have to acknowledge that both of these
are true
one that a child living inside of you is
going to have a much greater biological
impact and that you have no alternative
to having someone else watch it or care
for it while it's inside of you and then
to that a child inside of you has a
greater impact on your body than a child
outside however so now my question be
in order to make terminating this in
order to make terminating this
acceptable under most moral systems I
would argue that you have to demonstrate
something that is egregious enough that
that killing something is a way to
alleviate I guess whatever unjustice or
whatever or whatever aggression you feel
is presented to you so for instance my
question would be then that if we
consider a fetus a human which you
haven't conceded that yet and we can go
back to that one day but if you do
consider a fetus a human is the
discomfort that you feel for some number
of months while pregnant does it make it
justify that you should be able to kill
a person to alleviate yourself of that
temporary discomfort to me that's kind
of like when you get into morality and
it's kind of subjective and all that
well so my subjective assumptions here
and if you disagree the minute if I ever
see if I'm talking I ever say anything
you disagree just stop me immediately
and we can go over things so my in terms
of like subjective morality here right
what I'm assuming is one murdering is
wrong where murder is defined as the
unjust killing of another person and
then wrong is and it's like morally
unacceptable not legally right ever but
we would consider this to be morally
wrong so and then person is anything
from a zygote up to the termination of
your brain or whatever so if I believe
that we share the values that murdering
people is wrong that if we agree that
murdering people is wrong and we agree
that killing a fetus terminating a
pregnancy is murdering a person then I
feel like in order to make this not
murder where murder is defined as the
unjustified killing of somebody we have
to present something that that thing is
doing or aggressing in a certain way
that makes that killing justified so for
instance somebody breaks into my house I
can murder that person because they're
there right threatening my life or
whatever right however I don't believe
that in most cases a fetus is warranting
being murdered because it's kind of
using your body for up to some number of
months now I will make obvious
concessions here if the mother has a
high likelihood of dying during birth or
there's like an additional complication
or something like that of course then I
would I would immediately say yeah but
in general okay guys pro-lifers actually
agree with that to that I get only like
the extreme fundamentalist Christians
that are like nope that's God's yeah you
know so my question is like
is how do you justify killing something
because it causes a temporary discomfort
well the best way that I can put it is
here we go into the sociopathy I guess
to a certain extent is value a fetus
less than I would a living person and
you're gonna hear the typical stuff the
viability the thus idiots and everything
because fetuses not only do they not
currently they're not able to feel pain
they're not they're not conscious they
have no friends family anything to me I
know it's a biological reality but I
just don't see any true suffering
besides just the I guess by definition
this is life because I mean if you were
to go kill someone down the street I
mean you're they may be a dick or
whatever but you're you're causing them
physical harm I mean they have
relationships with other people they
probably have a job they may have kids
of their own but a fetus is you know and
here's a cliche it is a life I will not
deny that I'm not one of those people
that say penises aren't alive but it is
technically life but literally it's it's
only existence is it's physically there
in a uterus and it's just cell dividing
and like I said I can't feel anything it
can't feel on an emotional level and a
physical level so I don't necessarily
see anything morally wrong with ending
that life if there's no other option
like I said if there are artificial
wombs and there is a whole movement of
people that were totally willing to
adopt I think that that would be the
ideal thing to do because it just seems
more empathetic and nice I guess unless
it was a huge problem and there's just
overpopulation everywhere but I guess
that's my reasoning for not needing a
good reason to terminate a pregnancy so
maybe there's some logical
inconsistencies there and if you can
bring those out to me I'm open to
hearing it sure so let me just um let me
poke around a little bit so okay firstly
you say that a fetus is unequal to a
living person that you would get
you would grant different levels of
consideration to these two things this
is a point that I would 100% agree with
if I could pose a hypothetical let's say
there is a if somebody want to deliver a
baby let's say there's a 50% chance the
fetus dies during delivery and there's
like an 80% chance that the person dies
during delivery or I'm sorry even even
more let's say there's a 50% chance of
fetus dies but there's like a 20% chance
the person dies I would say like abort
every single time because like you you
have a you have a person that's alive
and already like made it through you
know child birthing on that [ __ ] like I
would never sacrifice that person for a
fetus right so when we're talking about
like equal like or like I would probably
prefer the life of like a two-year-old
to like like a fetus like just because
it's already made it through that and
you know less risk and all that [ __ ]
right so like I I would agree that um if
we were talking about enacting the same
action on two things that get different
moral I guess like consideration that I
would prefer one over the other but I
think that one problem we run into here
is that these are not the same act so
for instance if you talked about
aborting a child to save a mother that
is something that I would get on board
with a hundred percent of the time I
would always prefer that but if you talk
about aborting a child to provide a
convenience to the mother then I think
we're talking about very uneven acts and
now we have to justify committing a much
greater moral wrong you would say
against an unborn child in order to
prevent basically a and inconvenience to
the mother and I think this becomes much
harder to justify yeah but doesn't that
convenience stamp on the sliding scale I
mean just for example let's just throw
out so let's have two examples okay so
there's Jane Jane is a trust-fund kid
her dad makes $300,000 a year you know
she's got it she's got the white
privilege she's got everything and she
got knocked up by her boyfriend and
though she's not doing too well you know
that baby will be provided for and but
she just doesn't want to ruin her body
and she doesn't really like the
boyfriend all too much and she just
wanted to have an abortion would you
hold that to the same standard as
opposed to what stay a single mom who
already
has two children who lives paycheck to
paycheck doesn't have sikri better job
or she can take off to go you know take
off to go to the checkups and yeah you
know maybe she lives in section 8
housing because section 8 housing has
limits for amount of kids you can have
if you have a two-bedroom you can't have
three kids I know that some work and the
social services field so I kind of knew
all those all those interesting things
so in in that scenario she's kind of
backed into a shitty corner where not
only to me it's almost more of I feel
like saying an inconvenience is kind of
the wrong word in that scenario because
this person really like this could
potentially [ __ ] up her life and her to
existing children's life if they were to
get kicked off the section 8 because
she's storing another baby or if she
misses work and she doesn't have enough
money to pay the bills or you know like
I said and the situation really just
depends on that person in their scenario
so I feel like just saying oh well this
woman is having an abortion for any
other reason then because it's a threat
in her life like I feel like there's
more of a spectrum on that the
selfishness I mean at that point when
you're worried about your two other
children and keeping food in their
bellies and keeping a roof over their
head like to me that's kind of almost
it's a necessary evil and it's not like
inconveniences is not the right word
would you agree there no but I can
understand why you take issue with the
word I mean like I I would say it's an
extreme inconvenience when I say
convenience what I'm the the reason why
I say convenience and so I understand
what your issue with the word is that in
common parlance when we use convenience
you make it sound like oh you know like
I've got to walk to the store to buy a
candy bar instead of driving like that's
in Denia I acknowledge that the way that
I use inconvenience here is quite a bit
more extreme that being pregnant for
nine months is extremely inconvenient
compared to like having to walk to the
store to buy a candy bar but there's the
reason why I use convenience here is
because it's not generally a matter of
life or death so you've given me a lot
of reasons why a person might be more
likely to have an abortion or how their
outcomes could be greater as a result of
that which obviously I wouldn't disagree
so it turns out that the atheists
actually violate the principle that
they're standing on they require
rational justification for the absolute
known as god but the absolute that
they're reasoning from
they have no rational justification for
it and then they'll say oh it's
axiomatic
hey what's up buddy oh good to see you
here would you like to continue the
conversation
yeah i absolutely would i have a better
vocabulary
you want to start where we left off um
no we can actually start from the very
beginning
okay good so you're an atheist what is
your what is your
principled criterion of atheism um i
don't believe there's any justification
for the belief in god
if there was rational justification for
god would you believe in him yeah of
course
okay is would would god by definition be
an absolute upon which everything
depends
um not necessarily i'm not sure uh god
by definition would be
let's say um in the christian god is an
immaterial mind
um who has the the power to initiate
and bring into existence everything that
exists and sustain it so by that
definition
god would be the absolute right by that
definition yes
okay good so that's the working
definition that i'd like to work with is
that acceptable to you yeah
so you reject um
you reject the belief in an absolute
known as the christian god because it's
not rationally justified right
correct is that a is that an arbitrary
principle or a consistent one
um it is somewhat consistent
well it's it's it's either arbitrary or
not arbitrary which is it
so i understand now what the technique
is so
what we're going to get into is
presuppositionalism right do you want to
start that conversation
is it arbitrary or not arbitrary i can't
answer your yes or no like this because
i understand how the trap works is your
is your principle one that you use
consistently
past presuppositional beliefs yes it is
okay so you're consistent in applying uh
rational justification
for your ultimate beliefs is that right
past presuppositional beliefs yes it is
i don't i don't i don't know what that
means okay that that's more verbal
misdirection do you
require rat do you require rational
justification
um for your most ultimate beliefs are
you going to let me to explain this so
you're going to keep talking over me
well i'd like just like a non-evasive
response sure so the response is past
presuppositional beliefs yes
i don't know what that means can i
explain it yeah sure
so the foundation of which we build our
reason and our logic on is on
presupposed beliefs so presuppose
beliefs such as
i experience things or causality exists
or i can create logical rational
statements these are things that are by
definition unjustified that every single
person that engages in any sort of
argument has to rely on is that true yes
how do you know that because because
that's the the bounds of what we can
prove is as human oh okay so
so our most foundational mental states
don't have a justificatory path
correct good so that necessarily entails
the falsity of the christian god
it does it what it necessarily follows
from that the falsity of the christian
god are you aware of that
um not necessarily well that's your
definition of the question
necessarily it would because in the
christian world view
by definition the christian god has
ordained
and sovereignly given us our most
foundational beliefs
about reality and they're therefore by
definition
not axiomatic or assumptions okay sure
yeah i can i can accept that sure right
so so what you're assertion
that our most foundational mental states
are axiomatic or unjustified assumptions
then from that it necessarily follows
the falsity of the christian god so
agreed
sure okay good uh do you have a defeater
for the christian god
um can you explain to me my defeater
yeah if you don't have a defeater that
falsifies the christian god
then your stipulation that our most
foundational beliefs are axiomatic or
just assumptions
is not necessarily true i don't think
that i need a defeater for a belief
no you no you do you need a defeater for
the existence of god for the existence
of the christian god because in the case
that the christian god exists unless you
rule him out then in the case that he
exists then your stipulation is not
necessarily true that we start from uh
foundational assumptions
if my foundational assumptions lead to
your definition being incorrect
then i guess then foundationally i would
acknowledge that your definition is
impossible
yeah i'm wait i'm waiting for a defeater
for the christian god i've already
applied one if i if my presuppositional
beliefs are the defeater then that would
be the defeater yeah giving me an if is
not a defeater do you have a defeater
i'm going by your definition your
definition was that my presuppositional
beliefs
rule out the existence of your christian
god can i please finish my sentence
please before you cut me off okay so you
asked me to provide a defeater to your
christian god
after you told me that my
presuppositions were defeated for your
christian god
so i don't understand why you're asking
me for a defeat or whatever you already
provided you want are you using certain
can you please
can you please let me finish this
statement before you come up okay i was
almost done but you're really anxious to
get in with your next
fallacy okay so just let me finish this
statement before you go on go ahead
so you're done i'm done now yes okay um
is your defeater for the christian god
circular
if you consider an unjustified
presuppositional belief circular yes
okay so you show that the christian god
uh is
is false because of an unjustified uh
stipulation
if those unjustified stipulations are
presuppositional beliefs yes
okay so the christian god doesn't exist
because you just imagine it
i that this is completely non-sequitur
i'm sorry can you explain
okay so what what fundamental idea that
you hold to
falsifies the christian god the
fundamental ideas that we cannot
epistemologically defend
causal chain of events or or rational
like
forms of argument or our observations as
conscious beings that these are
indefensible that we cannot deal with
not understand i'm not understanding
what you just said how does that falsify
the christian god
it falsifies it because you told me that
my presuppositional beliefs necessarily
falsify it that was your statement you
connected those two things no no no
no i didn't say that i said what
necessarily follows
from that okay i didn't say that your
stipulation
falsified you see you need to listen
more carefully to what i say
i'm listening very carefully to what you
say well well what you just said to me
showed me that you weren't okay can i
summarize
if i say what necessarily follows
entails the falsity of the christian god
that doesn't mean that that stipulation
falsifies the christian god
if if your assertion happens it can be
uh shown to be vertical
then you would have a defeater but you
didn't show that it was whoever does
that i'm gonna end you okay no nose on
this stream
okay now i'm still waiting for a very
cogent
very circumspect falsifier for the
christian god is it
your basal assumption that falsifies the
christian god
it would appear so according to your
definition yes no no not my definition
i'm asking you
what is it in one sentence or two that
necessarily
falsifies the christian god i presuppose
things such as my ability to observe or
a have a conscious experience what what
what are you supposing i'm presupposing
that
that logic or reason exists i presuppose
that causal events happen i presuppose
that i can observe let's go
let's go through these one at a time one
one at a time okay so you
you presuppose that logic exists are you
talking about
reasoning or are you talking about the
laws of logic i'm talking about
the our epistemological understanding of
logic that that a can lead to b can lead
to c truth tables basic things like that
no no we we need to get even more
rudimentary though okay how about this
deductive how about deductive reasoning
let's go no we have to go even more uh
foundationally that we'll talk about a
equals a and a cannot equal not a
uh does the stipulation that a cannot
not equal not a does that falsify the
christian god
according to you it does no it doesn't
i've never said that
i want you do you does does the
assertion a cannot equal not a at all
times in all places falsify the
christian god
i i don't know i'm not sure it depends
on your definition of the christian
wait a minute well i'm still i'm still
waiting i just gave you my definition
okay well then i would say necessarily
no
that that particular thing necessarily
i'm still waiting i'm still waiting
give me a circumspect case that the
christian god doesn't exist because
in the absence of you falsifying the
christian god then your stipulation that
we all start foundationally in terms of
unjustified axioms
is not necessarily true so you have to
falsify the christian god
at least do you realize that you're
talking in a circle
i'm i'm not believe you i'm waiting i'm
waiting for you
to falsify the christian god sir so what
i have said is that i believe
in certain presuppositions that are
necessarily unjustified
you said that those presuppositions
necessarily entail that god doesn't
exist
and now you're asking me why god doesn't
exist do you do you want to talk about
whether or not we can presuppose
sir if you listen if you you see i
debate hundreds if not thousands of
people over the last couple of years
if you think your evasiveness is is
going to smooth me over it's not going
to happen i'm not being evasive
i ask you a question sir can you falsify
the christian god do you understand that
you're talking in a circle
can you falsify the christian god sir
are you are you just a troll
is this all i spent so much time today
like looking at this argument
i think you're just a troll okay good
you can you can say that all you want
now
i'm still waiting for you to falsify the
christian god
i don't have to falsify the the
christian god we have to talk about my
priest
can i please finish my statement
responding to you justify the christian
god
i have i say that i have presuppositions
and you say those presuppositions
necessarily entail that god is not real
you do you have any
object do you have any objective
stipulations that falsify the christian
god
i don't understand the question do you
have any do you have any truth claims
that falsify the christian god
i don't need any truth claims can you
falsify the christian god
i have by assuming my presuppositions
according to you
okay so what you're saying is uh in
virtue of something that you imagine
because it doesn't coherent conform to
the christian god therefore the
christian god doesn't exist
if that's your argument chair no sir
that was a question it wasn't an
argument
it sounds like you're just rephrasing
what we've already stated
listen there's only so much evasiveness
i'll put up not being evasive at all
one more time one more time i'm going to
ask you
what is what is your uh objective
statement that falsifies the christian
god
and again i will answer the same way
that i have presuppositions that are
necessarily unjustified because
epistemologically we cannot justify some
presuppositions and according to your
definition of a christian
god these presuppositions necessarily
entail that he is not true
okay so so you falsify the christian god
from your foundational uh starting
points
and are they the product of your
imagination i'm not sure i can't really
say
so you don't know where they come from
that is exactly what i have just said
okay good so the christian gods does not
exist because of
you have ideas that you don't know that
they're vertical exactly
good so the christian god is falsified
in virtue of i don't know
correct okay do you realize how absurd
that is
can you justify your presupposition did
you
do you see i hope somebody's recording
this okay
why are you acting like why are you
acting like presuppositions need to be
properly justified
do you realize what you just said he's
gone standing right now
you just stated that the christian god
does not exist
because i don't know can i hear your
justification
i will be glad to discuss with you my
point of view but i'm
i'm waiting for a cogent defeater for
the christian god
saying the christian god does not exist
in virtue of you stipulating i don't
know
is not a defeater for the christian god
i don't appreciate
characterizing our epistemological
limits i don't know
no i don't i reject i reject your
characterization of my argument
so can i rephrase my argument can i
rephrase my argument sure
go ahead okay so epistemologically we
cannot evaluate
whether or not presuppositions are true
or false it is not possible for humans
to do
for you to summarize that position for
you to summarize that position
can i finish my statement please for you
to evaluate that statement and claim
that it's the same as just simply saying
i don't know
is an incredibly harsh characterization
of what i'm saying
okay do you know what's possible sir
using what we have agreed
are our reasonable ways to make
deductions i'm interested i'm not
answering what is we i'm asking
you do you know what's possible like
truly i don't know what the question
means like truly
no no the answer is no the answer is
always going to be no to a question like
that no okay so you don't know
anything is possible correct from a very
foundational level correct
right so then why are you here
stipulating anything if you don't know
anything is possible because i'm curious
how you can make those same claims when
you rely on the same presuppositions
that i do
sure okay so so anything that you assert
you don't know that it's possible right
okay i want to hear your justification
for your
position i've already answered yes a
million times sir i don't want to talk
about my system anymore i want to hear
you justify your presuppositions
okay good so just for i will i will
explain to you
justifying the christian worldview
momentarily but i want to go on record
here
it's already been on record sir nobody
is hiding not over talk me if you ever
talk me i'll server meet you okay
yeah oh boy right yeah destiny
i wanted to go on record here and i hope
somebody's recording this

what is your experience with meditation
I don't have an experience with
meditation I don't do it at all I spent
a lot of time thinking like like I like
if I'm out doing something like I'll put
aside some hours to like think about
stuff but I don't like sit down and do
like full-on meditation or whatever I
don't know how comfortable the two
experiences are usually if there's some
idea that I'm not comfortable with I'll
like put aside mentally sometime later
to like go over for a few hours until I
feel like I've reached a good conclusion
and then sometimes I'll write things
down to keep track of my thoughts on
that can you give an example how you go
through something you need to figure out
I'm sure if I'm in conversation with
somebody or if I'm presented with an
idea they don't feel like I can
articulate a good response to I'll just
at some point in the future I'll put
aside some number of hours so if I'm
driving or if I've got an errand to run
or if I'm just like chilling on my own
we're all just kind of like start to
like think through that the thoughts a
little bit more like how would I explain
this to somebody else what were the
counter-arguments be and then I just
kind of run that down in my head until I
feel like I've got either a good
response or if the idea is indefensible
then I abandon it and I search for
something more reasonable
I don't know house to explain that it's
like the vegan [ __ ] when I was at
Devon's a while ago I woke up kind of
early and I spent like six hours jotting
down ideas on a notepad to figure out
like like which direction I needed to go
to have like better answers to the
things that um the questions that were
posed me you feel like you lost the
debate to poop not really I mean I guess
sure I just I felt like I didn't have
the I was basically challenged to a
level that was more fundamental than
what I'd thought of previously but the
problem is that as I drilled down on
that more and now I'm more comfortable
with where all of my fundamental beliefs
come from I think like the big problem
that I've had and I've said this a few
times on stream but I like it sounds
kind of Mimi when I say it but I
realized that like my own internal
thought process is like incredibly odd
ends with most people like it's very
very very different and I feel like I'm
at a point where it makes more sense to
lie about it than it does to be
forthcoming about it because it's
impossible to because other people treat
you very differently
or or entertain your ideas or thoughts
very differently when you're open about
it my dad and I used to have debates as
a kid you do this with Nathan much not
yet but he's only seven so I don't even
know what do you feel you come off as
sociopathic to people akin to the vegan
gains debate no but I thought I did but
that's my problem is that I don't think
I do I don't like to use the term
sociopath because one it's not even an
official [ __ ] thing anymore so I
could literally mean whatever edgy thing
you wanted to mean but I thought that I
think that I present my I think my big
problem I think is that I've presented
my ideas and I've said what my internal
processes are for a long time but I
think there are a lot of people that
share my conclusions and they just kind
of assume that I'm being edgy about my
internal processes and this is something
that has really bothered me that I've
started to figure out over the past
month I guess I kind of started with the
vegan thing and then like every kind of
as I got into more and more of these
kinds of like conflicts I start to
realize that there's a massive
disconnect between the people between
what people think my internal processes
are versus what they actually are and
and this is like the this is the thing
that uhm yeah I guess that I've had the
most trouble reconciling over the past
and that reconciling that I've had the
most trouble like deciding hi I guess I
want to treat it
over the next over the next part of my
life I guess I don't know
my sound needs to be on max to hear you
properly
I I'm pretty sure all of my volumes are
as normal as they've ever been I feel
like I shake some of your internal
processes but our conclusions I wouldn't
want you to lie about that stuff because
I honestly want to learn more yeah but I
don't know if I live like a healthy
person that's like another thing that
I've had to come to terms with that's
been like a two-year process I don't
know if my internal process is something
that's like compatible with most people
or if most people could even like take
on this type of internal process it
might be actually like incredibly
damaging in the long run and for
whatever reason I've avoided it because
of for a variety of weird reasons I
don't know do you mean you come to the
same conclusions as other people but for
different reasons for example you're
empathetic towards people for your own
personal benefit rather than just being
nice to people yeah that would be like a
really simple way to explain it yeah do
you still have your normal level of
happiness as a frame of reference you
want to go back to simply put do you
know how happy you were until your
pending exact well I mean I think that's
all worn off now whatever I felt like
when I after my panic attack is gone now
for the most part I'm not worried about
that anymore
have you considered therapy well the
problem with it's not a matter of like I
feel like um like I think I'm happy I
think I'm content so I don't know if I
would necessarily want to change things
I'm not entirely sure I don't know
I think the constant drive for
consistency / - voicing feels from
rational thought processes and one of
the most admirable traits of destiny
personally this kind of saddens me to
hear but I don't think I don't think
that you should I don't know if you
should live your life this way like five
years ago I would have said that this is
the best way to live your life like 100%
but I'm not so sure anymore I don't know
about that
I'm like insanely I'm like very
antisocial
I don't know how to explain it I don't
know I never know how to put these
things into words I guess there I feel
like there are a lot of like shared
experiences that people have that I
don't take part taken like as an example
if something bad happens to me I don't
want anybody to talk to me I don't want
anybody to comfort me I don't want
anybody not because it's like edgy it
just it just makes me feel irritated
right I think there's a lot of stuff
like that like if I have big decisions I
want to make I never talk to other
people but I'm like what do you think I
should do for this whatever like I
usually just feel comfortable making my
own like that I don't really have any
close relationships with people you know
like [ __ ] like there's a lot that goes
into like the hyper-rational and I don't
necessarily think it's a healthy thing I
don't think that um I don't think that
people should like strive for that I
don't I'm not sure I don't know lots of
people feel like that I don't know if
that's true this is something that this
is like another huge like thing that
I've I don't know it's really hard to
talk about because there's a lot of
people that act like this because it
sounds really cringey to say but because
it's like they think they're being
really edgy or or they're like trying to
be like some Shonen anime dude it's like
cold or whatever so like my like my
everyday experience becomes kind of like
the like the edgy cloak that some people
wear to try to see as cool as cool as
possible to try to seem like really cool
and it's like really I don't know it's
really hard to talk to other people
because like I've had conversations with
people that claim to have like the same
kind of like day-to-day experience that
I do but then like invariably you know
they'll like have a breakdown or
something like oh like I wish I had
someone to love me or blah blah blah I
feel so depressed over this thing and
it's like I don't understand like you
know I'm not sure why would you let
retards ruin your thought process slash
feelings for you so the thing is that I
guess because of what I've reasoned out
I think that if I don't I think that if
I don't talk about my internal mechanism
so much I think that people in general
have a much more positive feeling about
Who I am and that's probably better for
my brand for branding right and better
for appearances in general
that if somebody comes to my channel and
they listen like so people for instance
come to my channel and they will and
they'll they'll listen to me you know
talk about why I'm Pro immigration or
anti racism or something like that and
they come away with this idea that I'm
like I'm a very warm person it has like
a huge love for Humanity in my heart and
that um you know like I want to see all
people do well etc etc for that for the
for the sake of that that is absolutely
not at all what's going on inside of me
like everything I do is incredibly
self-centered but I feel like people
didn't actually believe me when I said
that and that's where like a lot of this
dissonance is coming from especially
recently where were people like wait a
second what you're just being a selfish
piece of [ __ ] and it's like it's how
I've always been nothing has changed but
I but I don't think people actually
believed it before but now I think that
maybe it makes more sense to just sell
that story like if you want to believe
that I'm filled with with warmth and
love for all of mankind maybe I should
just shut the [ __ ] up and let people
think that you know and then keep the
more fundamental arguments away because
I mean it's pretty easy to like assume
moral systems right like like oh well
you know you know I think that all
people should be treated equally or bla
bla bla like these are pretty
fundamental easy axioms to like take on
and kind of like build moral systems
around them because most of my
conclusions end up being the same anyway
right
wouldn't that rub you the wrong way
personally um not really I mean I used
to lie a lot for to advance myself
growing up um and I think I'm pretty
good at lying but I I mean I stopped
doing it when I started to train me
because I figure there's no reason to
because it's my [ __ ] extreme I can do
whatever the [ __ ] I want what the [ __ ]
would I tell a lie to anybody right so I
mean I think it's pretty easy to kind of
like obscure like inner inner thought
processes I mean right there's no reason
to
one of the most ignorant things you
could say know is that you don't believe
others understand what you're going
through not trying to be defensive
there's a lot of people out there who
feel much more comfortable alone than
with others ironically we don't see
others shut in that much because they
always said oh no oh sure it's possible
I'm just gonna bite off talk to you my
dude I'm sure there are a lot of people
that would feel the same way that I do I
mean I'm just saying that like for my
personal experience like I don't know
it's just yeah I'm not sure
well obviously not you but I know it
would feel extremely disingenuous to me
in my personal moral system yeah I don't
decide to think I'm I think I'm actually
a moral I don't think I believe in
morality well most people don't believe
most intelligent people are somewhat
morally nihilistic but I don't know if I
would even go as far as to say that like
I'm now a nihilistic existentialist like
pretty much everything I do in terms of
like personal decision making or
evaluation is usually done from a
self-centered point if you're like what
would I do to make me the most happy
like that's literally my what every
single value is generated from it is
that thing and I would take it a step
farther and farther and argue that
everybody does that whether they want to
admit it or not because ultimately
whatever moral system you choose is a
personal choice that is just as
arbitrary as any other decision I'm just
being honest about it I could be wrong
on that though I have to think more
about that because I'm not ready to go
on and like accuse other people of doing
the same but um yeah I don't know
that's not true that most intelligent
people are moral nihilist don't most
philosophers agree that there is no like
objective morality you had to do a lot
of weird [ __ ] to find like objective
morality right or you got to be like you
have to believe in some crazy [ __ ] I
think that humans or morality has some
kind of intrinsic or objective worth
I can't tell okay well this is I guess
we're being realistic so I'm just gonna
be realistic for this whole hour okay so
if I say something it sounds really
condescending or really a really
arrogant then take it as such okay
because I'm very kind of sending it was
very narcissistic destiny don't you
think that being selfish is extremely
destructive to society
it's an incredibly [ __ ] stupid thing
to say like being incredibly selfish can
be destructive to society or you could
not be a [ __ ] idiot and you could be
selfish and have it work well for
instance if I walk into a place and
there's five sandwiches and there are
five co-workers right like I could eat
all five sandwiches because I'm
self-interested like oh that's how its
self-interested person good act or I
could say like oh well all it want and
you guys can all have one because I
don't watch all the [ __ ] hate me
because that's gonna produce worse
outcomes for me then if I like steal all
your [ __ ] right I feel like I feel like
every time I feel like every time I have
these conversations I see like really
basic like level one objections or it's
like well if you were really selfish
wouldn't you just walk over and rape
your neighbor all the time it's like
well no because chances are that would
produce some really [ __ ] bad outcomes
for me yeah
do you feel us if you have any real
friends have not justice bother you not
really don't really feel that way and I
don't mean to say that is like a slight
against anybody I mean like I enjoy
talking to Dan and Devon but I guess I'm
just trying to think that like if I had
like a really personal problem or some
something that was like really personal
I don't think I would ever talk to
anybody else about it like I don't have
like friends like Oh like I need to like
I'm thinking about dating some girl or
whatever I'm thinking about like you
know like I need to make an important
decision on whether like I don't think I
would ever consult another person
there's not anyone in my life like okay
I'll talk to this person I respect their
forget right if it's like
business-related I might talk to like
Devon or down or something but
[Music]
I believe that on a micro-level
selfishness is a driving force of
humankind is in corrosive but when it
expands to a macro societal level it
becomes negative produces bad outcomes
well this is why you have to not be an
idiot right so this is why I would be
like in favor of progressive tax
policies even though it means less money
for me because I'm obviously it's
probably going to produce better
outcomes for me and my kid right and I
choose to care about my kids so but
you're not incredibly selfish then if
you address yourself interests along
with a self-interest or others taking
the fight no no no taking the five
sandwiches would be a huge benefit to
you if you really didn't care at all
other people could manipulate them into
not hating you which is fairly easy if
you don't care about how destructive
your actions are that sounds fantastical
manipulating people is it takes a lot of
effort and it's oftentimes not even
possible it really depends on the
scenario I like I don't understand that
like I would steal their sandwiches and
then lie to them and say they never had
sandwiches or if you could theoretically
own slaves without any negative
repercussions would you so these are the
kinds of like gotcha questions that
people like will boo poor people like
vegan games or whatever would try to
catch me on it like my honest answer to
every question would be yes if you if
you add with no consequences behind it I
probably wouldn't really care but I
guess like my challenge would be that
everybody more or less functions like
that because moral systems don't really
protect anybody anyway right like no
moral system has ever protected somebody
from something it all comes down to who
has the ability to enact the force to
back up whatever moral system they have
regardless right you could live in a
country with the most moral people ever
that I'll share some moral system but if
a stronger country comes in and bullies
you takes over your [ __ ] it's not like
you can sit there and argue like we'll
hold on like this is actually we adhere
to this moral system you need to stop
this right now it's not right like it
wouldn't really matter right from their
perspective they would you know
selfishly pick whatever moral system
they have and they would just
down that route right have you ever
heard of optimistic nihilism the idea
that helping others in today's society
is actually beneficial to the selfish
yeah sure I probably you can probably
name like 50 tooth they'll fill a
thousand things like people kept doing
this is why I trying to label myself
because then I get called out on
something that these believe that I
don't actually believe like I've heard
like rational self-interest or
enlightened self-interest I've heard
egoism I you just brought up as
optimistic nihilism it seems like
there's like a million different types
of moral systems that might extremely
rich people gain no benefit from helping
the poor and neither do their kids their
selfishness maintains that wealth but
does until the revolution occurs didn't
give a personality disorder I'm not sure
maybe it's maybe some sort of a SPD you
ever been to it there would I possibly
get out of a therapist I don't
understand why an introvert or an
extrovert probably an extrovert I enjoy
social situations and talking to people
and whatnot right it doesn't an
extrovert gain energy from talking if
you want an introvert loses energy I
don't know I don't even know if these
are like real distinctions recognized in
psychology or not popularized by Carl
Jung okay
why is happiness you made well in life
why not try to seek out as many power /
unique experiences as possible well I
mean if those unique experiences made me
happy then that's what I would take out
right
do you experience happiness seeing
others who care about being happy
successful considerate not really know
how much programming do you know and how
did you learn I programmed my whole
website and twitch and YouTube I don't
know any programming I need my first
website using HTML and really basic CSS
hello can you hear me oh i can hear you
now what up
um hi uh so like i'm a small political
youtuber
uh and i want to change your mind on
abortion you think we can do that uh
my i can't really have a conversation
about it right now my opinion is pretty
influx on a couple things but yeah go
for it i guess if you want to sure hit
me up
we'll be approaching it from different
angles um
so the first thing i want to do is get
some things out of the way i want to
make a disclaimer
that we're going to be talking about a
touchy issue some of the arguments that
i provide
clearly reflective of what i actually
believe but are simply provided in the
interest of strengthening the argument
or furthering the debate
okay okay um so i
i support the right of the legal right
of a person to get an abortion because
on a societal level we fare better
economically and criminally if
pregnancies can be planned for
yeah i agree with that i was thinking
you would disagree with that that kind
of just ruins everything now
[ __ ] well i'm [ __ ] i don't know how much
you've heard but i'm pragmatically i'm
very much in favor legally of abortion
if for no other reason than because it
literally can't be regulated like if
somebody really wants to get abortion
you can't stop them from doing it
so it seems even dumb to force it like
that sorry
[ __ ] well we can talk about the
philosophy if you want sure
philosophy is a little bit harder to
break down because people tend to be
it's it's subjective
yeah a little bit yeah of course what
philosophy is because their moral
systems are subjective right
yeah okay so where we both struggle is
the ethics of it when is it okay to have
an abortion and why
um um
i think the question should should never
be whether or not a fetus
is a clump of cells because we are
columbus cells i don't think the debate
should be whether a fetus is a life
it is a life um i think the question
should be whether a fetus is a person
and if it is a person at what point in
development does it become a person
you you you believe in the moments of
conception right yeah because that seems
to be the most consistent time to define
like your existence the the beginning of
your existence yeah
i would now why why would you say that's
your so actually
i've broken down what i think makes a
person a person into a person um
by several points and i want to see if
you agree with this or not okay that to
be a person
in a technical sense a person should be
alive a person should be viable and a
person
of being absorbed into a social contract
um
alive yeah probably yeah for sure
um viable what do you mean by viable
by viable i mean capable of surviving um
outside of a loom with or without the
aid of technology um
capable of surviving outside of the womb
i feel like
we're kind of begging the question if
that's our
if that's included in the premise do you
think because if because i mean you kind
of like win the argument de facto if i
accept
that because obviously a fetus by
definition can't survive outside the
womb right
i mean i would say that a violation of
any of these tenants in terms of
philosophy could revoke personhood
by that criteria it's not considered
dirty human life um here's
um i i feel like um so i feel like when
you say viable
i feel like you're that you're using
that as a proxy for something else so
let me ask a question to find out
um so like if a person has to live on
dialysis you wouldn't revoke that
person's personhood even though
they need technology to survive right
well i mean capable of surviving
with or without the aid of technology
sure um
so it's so is it really just because um
they're a fetus or does it have more to
do with violating the autonomy of the
woman that you're like kind of like a
leech of or whatever or is that more
that the
thing that in terms of the viability
argument
it's a little bit of both um but i think
generally we
already accept that there's a difference
between a fetus and a born person
in terms of what makes them a person
well i would argue that you demonstrate
this sure go ahead god
i only hear your argument or i was gonna
say my argument against that is i would
say that like um
that it has to be something more than
that um because if we take somebody
that is born um and we take them like
five seconds prior to them like
breaching i don't think that most people
would be comfortable saying like this is
absolutely not a person and then at the
moment of birth they become a person um
so i would argue there's got to be
something
more different this is why we usually
draw lines for like third and second
trimester stuff
but uh sure but you can you can actually
extract
a fetus from a womb and it still be
capable of surviving as
as a fetus like it could still develop i
mean at this point it's a person
um and i think c-sections like it not
all pregnancies actually result in live
birth
and you can still have a baby out of it
sure i guess yeah sure and then in that
case like whether or not you're
in that case like this is kind of weird
too these these don't necessarily
invalidate your argument i'm just here
curious to hear your defense with them
so like in that case you can argue that
your personhood and some in some cases
is actually defined by the technology at
the time then as well right
that like if you if we lived in a world
where you could where you were viable at
one month then then a two-month fetus is
very easily a person
but if we lived in like prehistoric
societies or some [ __ ] like you're
literally not even a person until like
almost after you're born because who the
[ __ ] knows when your viable are going to
survive right yeah
once the chord's been cut then you're
like a person yeah okay
um and this was what i talked about like
with the issues with uh moral relativism
and how it
our standards for what makes a person a
person change over time there was a time
uh when black people weren't considered
people in the same sense as white people
so
figuring out that point's important but
i want to propose a thought experiment
if you'll allow me
okay i'll allow you
to demonstrate to you and to most people
who are watching that we don't consider
a fetus a person
um at the moment of conception and we'll
use
this is an example let's say that we
have a petri dish
it's a petri dish with a fetus
developing in vitro
and we also have a living breathing
child that's already born in a crib and
there's a fire that breaks out and you
can only save either the petri dish
or the baby which one do you save and
why
um so um
so i'm uncomfortable with these examples
for a number of reasons but the most
pressing reason is because it's in my
interest to lie to you in order to win
the argument
um because so i've actually heard this
framed a different way
um i mean in answering yours i would
very easily answer that i would save the
baby just because i know 100 that it's
already born whereas um
isn't it like up to 20 percent of women
miscarry in the first trimester it's
it's a very surprisingly high number
most people don't even realize that they
just have like a heavier period they
didn't realize
oh just before like this 25 weeks
survivability is just generally a
question
yeah but i mean i was proposing this
question because if you believe that
life begins on a moment of conception in
fact let's let's even take it a step
further
if you save the the petri dish with the
fetuses in vitro
there's a 100 guaranteed survivability
of them
now which do you save um i mean
guaranteed
a chance of survival you're really just
like
weighing one or the other i don't know
like what you i mean i'd probably maybe
the petri disc
because it's easier to carry out i mean
the way um i understand what you're
getting at the way that i hear this
thought experiment um
done before and and a little bit more i
i think to
strengthen your position is usually if
if there's like a burning building and
you could run out with one living baby
versus 50 petri dishes that have like um
embryos in them which would you choose
that seems to be like a more compelling
version of this because now you really
went yeah
um well we can go with that but it would
never be a contest with me i'd save the
baby every time because i think
exactly yeah and then someone in my
position would have to say
i would save the petri dishes because
it's 50 lives and even if some of them
don't make it like statistically
speaking you're saving more than one
life absolutely right yeah
um and i guess i would argue that the
petri dishes would be more compelling to
say because you've got like 50 unique
people there
as opposed to the baby which is just one
unique person yeah or
one person um it's it's actually
interesting when people like
comment that they're going to save the
baby because it kind of implies that a
person is only a person based on
geographic location
uh which which is it's it's an odd um
self-defeating ideology
wait what do you mean by that get
somebody who's pro-life that says
they'll save the baby instead of the
petri dish then they're basically
seeding that they've made a decision
that
one is a is more of a person
in a technical sense than the other and
it's purely based on geography
what do you mean by geography i mean
that if the petri dish is not
is in a petri dish and not in a a
pregnant woman
then it's it's not a life saving i
understand
sure yeah i can understand that yeah um
so actually i'm curious then um how do
you feel about physician-assisted
suicide
um 100 in favor assuming that like the
under reasonable circumstances i'm
assuming you're not going to ask me any
dumb questions like what if someone
tricked the guy into killing somebody
like if a person wants to end their life
then they should have the option to
do that i think it's like you're one of
your greatest controls i think of
yourself is a decision to end your life
i don't understand why you would ever
take that from somebody
you have a right to death and you have a
right to life but wouldn't the right to
life necessarily
like you wouldn't arrive at a right to
death unless you had a poor quality of
life right
i don't know if that's necessarily true
it would be something that would be left
up to the person not evaluated
externally
i would in general i would agree with
you that the person's perception that
their life isn't worth living
has it outweighs any desire to live yeah
so in general i would agree but i don't
know if i can make that as an absolute
statement
um because everybody's tolerances are
different or something right like yeah
sorry okay good different but i mean do
you find it unique that you can
we could morally justify ending another
human being's life on the basis of their
their life quality but you we couldn't
morally justify ending the life of a
fetus for the same reasons
no so this is why i draw the distinction
um what you're talking about is
physician-assisted homicide
which i think is different so like for
instance like i'm in favor of somebody
making the decision to end their life
if they want to i'm not in favor of
somebody else making that decision for
them
right i think that's that would be a key
difference between like abortion versus
somebody saying okay i want to die now
right suicide is a choice that's
generally undergone by an autonomous
person capable of consenting that
decision and then a fetus is not
where do you fall under the terry
schiavo debate you remember terry shiva
that chick needed to die a long time ago
that was [ __ ]
horrible i felt so bad for that but how
do you reconcile this
because she's [ __ ] she's dead
oh she's brain dead she's physically
alive she's got a family saying
delicious were to be kept alive and
a husband saying her wishes were to die
how do you roll on that
i did i don't think it's comparable to
fetus at all like a fetus is a person
that is in the process of growing and
becoming a person and has potential to
terry shiva was dead 100
um like i considered death at brain
death to be death like you can keep a
body of light
i don't know how i imagine you could
keep a body life indefinitely no um if
you transplant enough organs but like
once the brain is dead you're dead
that's what i would consider death
wouldn't have a problem with abortion if
a fetus were likely to be brain dead at
some sort oh yeah no no
and and i would go farther than that
like if the mother's life is at risk i
would argue that abortion is totally
like even morally if i would if i was a
moral person i'd argue
that like yeah even morally you can be
okay with aborting somebody if there's a
chance of the mother dying even if it's
not 100 there's a chance of the motor
dying just because the mother's life is
guaranteed to be there and
uh fetus is always iffy and then yeah
there's like severe
um i don't know where i stand on things
like severe down syndrome or something
like that
um i don't know i'm a little bit i don't
know i could be swayed either way on
those but if the fetus is like
irreparably brain damaged or something
too
like that child in the was it the united
kingdom like that child
was probably needed to be destroyed as
well because that dude was [ __ ] way
[ __ ] dead
state making the decision over the
parents yeah but
like i don't see that as the state
making the decision it seemed more like
the state was acting as a representative
of the child who had none because
obviously parents
you know own children um and i think in
that case it was important for the for
the state to intervene because the
parents were [ __ ] crazy
gotcha um to be really clear let me just
for like two seconds because i know
people listen and have political
opinions um from my understanding
that child was super [ __ ] dead like
its brain was literally [ __ ] mush and
there was no
indication that it was going to get any
better that it was going to get worse
and worse and worse another i wonder if
there was a mitochondrial disorder or
something
crazy that was like turning that kid's
brain into literal [ __ ] mush
and the idea that even if they had a
magic pill that stopped the disease
progressing at that point
that child was already beyond [ __ ]
brain damaged um
yeah sorry okay yeah so that that's why
i was in favor of the state stepping and
it's
like yo like you need to unplug it like
this is really i guess because we
believe in ethics generally in society
this is really unethical yeah
okay destiny doesn't understand the uk
situation i've been coming at all link
me something that disagrees or [ __ ]
off yourself you stupid [ __ ]
i need i need you to give me a source
that just disagrees with what i said
because i there were two different um
neuroscientists that made like
published like there was a published
statement talking about the state of
that
child's brain and that child was beyond
[ __ ] that child's brain like half of
it was literally [ __ ] mush
and they were trying to like
indefinitely prolong this child's life
waiting for a literal biblical miracle
to bring this child back from the grave
that even if they'd managed to 100 cure
the disease which there was no even
inclination
that they could do that that child was
still beyond brain dead forever like it
was completely [ __ ]
so if you have like something that
disagrees with that that doesn't come
from [ __ ] breitbart i would love to
see the link luke davis because i know a
lot of you centrist dumb [ __ ] like
hijacked that issue and turned it into
some freedom of
whatever [ __ ] but it wasn't that
child was beyond [ __ ] dead from
everything i was aware of
okay i'm sorry single-payer healthcare
fear-mongering
yeah yeah pretty yeah oh yeah yeah
because it was like because because all
the conservatives were pretending that
this was a death panel that they're all
look they're gonna kill your children if
it's not worth it came alive which is
[ __ ]
okay i'm sorry i got way off on that
okay go ahead
um so here since we're talking the
ethics of it would you say it's
unethical to bring a
life into a world that is more than
probably guaranteed to be in a life of
poverty and crime
um i would disagree with that it kind of
sounds like anti-natalism
um is it unethical to have a child
knowing that it might have a hard life
no we're we really have to go on the
antenatalist road here though if
we do this because the way that i would
justify that is that even most people
I see mr. scanner and if you watch this
video I'd love to get your reaction why
I guess I shouldn't they could actually
guess so
I already know what this video is gonna
be about can I make two very clear
statements okay one in action is action
whether or not you agree with that is
doesn't matter okay if you do not act
that is an action okay a lot of people
are uncomfortable with that grow the
[ __ ] up that's life okay if you do
nothing you've done something all right
that's number one number two everything
that you do in some way size shape or
form is political that includes
furthering the status quo okay if things
are a certain way and you try to shake
things up and people call you political
for it find whatever everything is
political but if things are a certain
way and you continue to act that way
that's just as political okay these are
kind of like two sides of the same coin
but I just want everybody to like know
that that those two statements are
absolutely true and I will stake my life
by both of those statements all right
okay here we go
don't worry about my own so I start
being somebody books won't admit or not
these are role models and we sexualized
we objectify we modulized introduce
these new tactics a lot less and they
can be so we're gonna master us I had a
secret agenda this is a small play from
a presentation that was hosted by Neil
druckmann deck in 2013 a few months
after the Last of Us I just come out in
it he openly talked about his thought
processes and the many goals set out for
the game one of the big ones being
related to this agenda is because of
witches who create one of the coolest
non sexualized female game text now this
is a response to what he noticed as a
game developer and many of the female
roles in the payment from movies to
video games are people trade in
stereotypical ways focusing on their
appearance more than any other strengths
I think I speak for myself in the
majority of regular gamers we honestly
don't mind we play games to have fun the
experience great stories and who we play
out has never been an issue I think we
honestly don't mind if all the
characters I hyper sexualized how do you
how can you miss the point that you
should I maybe I should have listened to
a minute before I stopped and cut him
off in case he addressed something gonna
say oh I'll go for it for like a minute
or actually we can treat it like a
debate I guess I'll start writing [ __ ]
down should I set it to normal speed
[ __ ] this is gonna be painful and the
majority of regular gamers that we
honestly don't mind we play games to
have fun to experience great stories and
who we play as has never been an issue
if a character is relatable well-written
I can totally place myself in their
shoes [ __ ] hold on so when I brush my
teeth I am relating to the government or
the public affairs of a country I'm sure
you can read in and that's all I could
possibly ask for
whether it is Nathan Drake or John
Larson who physically may have more in
common with me or Senya and faith from
hell blatant errors edge I love all
these characters because I connected
with them I understood and related to
how they felt in various situations
diversity inclusiveness representation
these are the terms that you now
constantly hear when watching interviews
with noia dog or simply by reading the
Twitter timeline of many of their
employees in itself I have few problems
with these ideals there's nothing wrong
with wanting gamers to respect people of
all kinds but there is another side of
the coin it can get a little ridiculous
how much focus a dev puts on these
topics nowadays like they're forgetting
that the
quality and appeal of the story is still
the most important goal for example I've
yet to see a game feature a Dutch
protagonist with an accent like me but
I've certainly never felt like I needed
to be represented more I understand that
an entire game taking place in my
merciless nude I'm risking my own small
country is not gonna appeal to the mass
market and so you certainly won't hear
me complain that itch to constantly push
a certain narrative is to me a little
concerning because other aspects could
start suffering from it they can
sometimes come off as a little
pretentious okay alright so I don't
think so first of all like no we haven't
given like any real arguments here this
is this is so stupid so every single
women character that's presented across
any form of media always has to be hyper
sexualized arguing well we don't mind if
they're hyper sexualized doesn't address
the issue right the issue I mean I
haven't seen this naughty dog gonna be
but what I'm guessing is what the guy
said was it kind of bothers me that in
order to have a female protagonist that
female protagonist has to fit a very
narrow paradigm of what it means to be a
female you have to be super hot you got
a huge [ __ ] boobs beautiful ass we got
to be super perfectly yeah you have to
be basically Wang Keable right and if
somebody can't jerk off to how [ __ ]
beautiful you are
then you're not you're not worth
anything as a female protagonist now
that before all the [ __ ] autistic
people come out right no women can be
pretty and be a protagonist as well but
the flip side is that like it's very
rare to have like a female protagonist
like Master Chief where you don't even
know what the [ __ ] they look like right
you think how many female pretty well
what about salmon [ __ ] off right for the
most part like you never really get
female protagonists that aren't
conventionally attractive right and it
sounds like that's something that they
wanted to address which is fine which is
a fine point if you want to make a
female protagonist it's not hyper
sexualized chair that's fine so this
doesn't really address that who we play
as has never been an issue [ __ ] I
don't buy this argument from white gamer
bros anymore okay when everybody freaks
the [ __ ] out if there's a black main
character or a female [ __ ] a character I
don't buy this we don't care who we play
as I think it people say they
don't care who they play as because they
always get to play as a white male I
don't buy that argument anywhere I used
to push that argument when I was younger
and more naive when and then I realized
that 95% of my audience was full of [ __ ]
and they were white male gamer bros who
only sit say this statement that they
don't care who they play us because 95%
of the protagonist so they play us look
like them okay so bullet that argument
is [ __ ] I love all these characters
because I connect to them that's fine
it's not related to aiming retainment at
all you'd connect to male/female sure
whatever that does nothing to do with
with increasing the the variety of
protagonist you see and then I'm Dutch
and I've never felt like I needed
representation this like I'm a snowflake
and I've never felt like blah blah blah
there's another argument that I used to
peddle well that's great that maybe you
personally feel that way not everybody
feels that way also like you might be
Dutch but I mean like you have a white
male character that's straight that like
matches a lot of [ __ ] checkboxes
maybe they don't exactly have a Dutch
accent but that's that's pretty close to
what you are right versus like a woman
that has no female protagonist or a
minority character that is nobody that
even looks like them so I don't feel
like this is like a fair comparison you
know that's kind of like saying yo well
you know you know I've got a cockney
accent and you know usually they just
use traditional British accent so I feel
like I'm not being represented okay hey
anyway so we're five and half minutes
and we haven't really talked about
anything yet but all right dad said it's
need developers choice and I'm not gonna
tell them what they should or shouldn't
do all that I'm saying is if it ever
gets to be point where an agenda
intervenes with the quality of a story
or it stops appealing to me then my
response will be simple I'm not buying
the game now are we gonna get examples
of this happening I really hope he gets
into it especially as we're watching a
lot of The Last of Us which is like one
of my favorite console games
I'm so happy to play this game because I
don't play many good games and going
past like five or 10 years this was one
of them I really like this game so I
really hope he gives me some some the
last of us examples of where this
narrative pushing is [ __ ] [ __ ] up I'm
not buying the game now going back to
Noah dog obviously to this day I've
never felt that way the opposite okay I
actually used to defend their decisions
made in previous games years bought one
subtly hinted at bill being gay
but it never became a real part of the
experience because it didn't need to the
left ah where problematic there are so
many unintentional things I've gotten
better at identifying these over the
past years there are so many
unintentional things that people say
that can be harmful in ways that you
don't imagine and this is one of those
things right a real part of the
experience because it didn't need to
like the fact that you need a good
reason to be gay is like a really
important thing so like if I would
here's an example if I walk through when
did they hint at him being gay I believe
in Watchtower know I keep honest and
watched arcs I think in in the last of
us wasn't there a part where he talks
about his old partner and friend and it
makes it sound like they were gay for
each other I feel like that happened I
could be wrong I could be misremembering
but I feel like that was like very
strongly hinted at that him and his four
old friend were like lovers or whatever
I don't like this idea that like here's
here's like the feeling I get that if I
walk through a house and I'm a videogame
I walk through a house and on the on the
wall you see like a picture of like a
husband and a husband hugging and
kissing each other people will look at
it and be like why do they have to shove
like the gay [ __ ] end like is this
important to the story do I need to know
that this person is gay like isn't that
kind of dumb like I don't understand
like did the gayness of this characters
like whereas if it was a picture of like
a traditional strike couple then it's
like no one would say anything they said
okay I guess it was married you know and
it's like but because but as soon as
somebody like differs from the norm a
little bit it needs to be justified and
I think that kind of idea is not the
best kind of idea but the Left Behind
the you'll see built up - Alice gets
with Riley very well it helped flesh out
a character just a little more for that
small additional story content a lot of
people had a problem with Nadine and
uncharted 4 and I found those complaints
understandable though they personally
never bought at me so much sure she's a
lot of strong female character who leads
a whole army and gets to beat up Drake
in a sequence where you pretty much can
fight back you could also argue that had
Rafe let this army and
was out of the picture the story of the
game practically wouldn't have changed
and Sony Dean served little purpose
again I understand these complaints but
I liked playing through the various
encounters and it added an extra element
of tension to the game something that I
don't like that I notice a lot of and
it's really hard to disentangle these is
sometimes you get just shitty writing
and shitty characters but if it's a
woman or a minority character people are
really quick to ascribe it like sjw
tendencies or whatever
all I'm saying
and I and I've talked about this as well
where it's like I think that Star Wars
especially the most recent Star Wars is
like a really shitty movie but like it's
like I wouldn't say that like it's a
shitty movie because sjw's have given
like females and males like sir like
it's just a bad movie like there's just
bad writing black bad plot devices black
bad themes bad there's a lot of bad dumb
[ __ ] and the most reason stories maybe
but um yeah I don't know game
[Music]
these discussions have been going on for
quite some years but I never took issue
that was until recently when a few
problems with noise look arose for me
it's thought of with a relatively small
thing and that was after me release of
ensure that the Lost Legacy
I remember the months leading up to its
release how I would joke around with
some of my viewers and friends of mine
in real life
that the game would end with Chloe and
Nadine in a relationship it was sort of
meant as a joke referring to the left
behind you'll see and not for a second
that I actually think of what happened
the Lost Legacy was meant to be a small
standalone adventure all about the
treasure hunting set pieces exploring
the beautiful occasions in India that
being said we knew the background of
both Chloe and 18 so obviously wouldn't
make sense it's not anyone's looking to
get out of the game
why did I like laid it I forgot Oh
another I enjoyed the game grateful it
was any Rometty relationship between two
obviously never happened that's when a
few months later I came to the
realization that well no you left the
puppet untouched against all my
applications it seemed they actually
wished they didn't have to in December
the company sent out a happy holiday
sweets when a piece of artwork made by
one its own employees it show Chloe any
Dean standing on the mistletoe they
looked down to the floor with
embarrassed faces it obviously implies
they're in love each other it's only
just a one-off thing is what I thought
at first but it didn't actually stop
here ever since and up until today
members of the studio are addressing the
view as clodine a typical Whaley at
night over throwing to a couple these
days but that's not all it constantly
share around specific panel for example
the to Marion I'm sorry I just brought
me the wrong way
let's not I have anything against cake
Gary goes I was fired in left behind
because this is so clearly forest and
don't do indeed fit legenda and satisfy
a specific audience well ok here we go
here's where I break with the SJW [ __ ]
are you ready woo
if you want to include like gay or
straight people in media I do think it's
a little bit kind of dumb to throw it in
after now this isn't something that's
going to like upset me or whatever but
like the people that do like after
you've made something and then you've
left it alone and you haven't like
hinted at anything at all when they say
like oh by the way those guys were gay
that feels a little kind of dumb to me
I remember when um I remember when uh
JK Rowling did this with Dumbledore when
she was like oh by the way Dumbledore
he's gay and it's like oh okay sure I
guess that seems kind of what that feels
kind of weird to me I don't I don't know
I don't really care that much but I'm
guessing it bothers this got a lot more
than
I just had several relationships
established in the past Chloe with
dragon flame lady with ravenous off
surely counts Ottomans attitude could
possibly be bisexual exists but still
irrelevant when you take in mind that
lost legs either just focus only
treasure hunting eventually they
completely different going on what
annoys me so much it's just because no
one wants to push chaos happens
something I very much dads where's Mel
they'll change around characters they
said their narrative some people may
agree with me on this autism might sound
like a small point is in could complain
about what you need to understand I was
I'm very passionate about this series I
felt it actually foreclose make decade
now now he does he change to just what
you're saying reasons but this was
nearly despot what does he mean by that
I was attached to it for decades and now
I hate to see it change did he like want
to [ __ ] the main character and now he's
sad that she's a lesbian or what I I
don't know wait I don't understand that
well I don't understand that means
deeper inspired by the extreme social
justice moving that we see today
you'll probably is a very big battle
Kezia he's praised the work I didn't had
it or no water it when I'm pretty sure
that a long girls will go off for many
of you just hearing her name she's water
someone I would look up that's what he's
a person who loves nothing more than to
accuse gamers and game creators of
sexism racism homophobia
judgmental fur you can find she was
never a gamer in the minute of research
will be clear that she represents the
complete opposite of tolerance and
freedom for games of creators decide
what to make what to play this is simply
worrying to me and the more I hear about
the last Massoud the more I fear the
noid orc is about to go overboard with
this stuff there is already an
overemphasis on female characters it's
becoming more and more visible to me
first me as fans asking for Cogan
fortuyn to fan favorites okay so like I
wish I would have say the comments so
this is something that bothers me
earlier he said we don't care who we
play as we just want to connect to good
characters and now he says there's an
overemphasis on female characters so
like here's like where what I'm
wondering happens in like the gamer
brain okay so it makes you uncomfortable
as a man that you're having to play
games now with an overemphasis on female
characters but whenever women complain
that there aren't females and games you
would say don't worry about it it
shouldn't matter who you play as how do
you hold these two incredibly
contradictory positions at a single
moment in time like
[Music]
aren't people more likely to ascribe SJW
things to these characters because most
of these characters are conspicuous in
how they are written many of them are so
obviously social commentary sure but
like there's a lot of like social
comment let's be real video game writing
is not like the apex of like writing
even today most video game writing is
pretty like I don't even want to say
teenage accessible because it's war it's
bad most video game writing is is bad
can like can we destiny not everyone
cares about representation what is that
how does that what does it have do that
anything I've said
I feel like I have to delve into it I
need his work just because it seems like
every dumb [ __ ] immediately brings her
it was a boogeyman and I can never trust
them to not misrepresent our arguments I
Anita's problematic for a couple things
in my opinion I think I don't even know
if she's a real person or if she's just
like a puppet of that mimic McEntee guy
or whatever like I'm pretty sure he uses
her [ __ ] Twitter account I'm not a
big fan of Anita but yeah people go a
little bit crazy she's kind of become
like the punching bag and the
representation of like all of feminism I
guess and yeah I'm not sure there's a
lot going on there but the latter was
hey guys I'm about to talk about a lot
of really crazy [ __ ] in this video
recounting an adventure that I had on my
way back from Los Angeles I don't
normally do disclaimers at the start of
my videos obviously if this actually
might be the only one I've ever done but
I kind of want to make some like very
very very clear things up here in here
because I'm very big on you know
responsibility or audience
responsibilities for my public messaging
if you have like some sort of mental
problem or if you have some sort of
issue that you're dealing with in life
my number one unequivocal suggestion
always to seek professional help I do
not suggest self-medicating do not
suggest trying crazy homeopathic
whatever [ __ ] I might go to if
you're having serious problems in life
is to always always always seek
professional help first I don't remember
exactly what I say in this video but
we've done a lot of talking about drugs
and and hallucinogenics and different
stuff over the past few weeks on my
stream just because of my experience and
I want to make sure that I'm being
absolutely clear that I do not recommend
you try anything that I've tried or do
anything that I've done because you
think it's going to fix some underlying
problem you have or because you think
that you know something that I don't
know that some crazy drug can be the
solution to your problem
I think it's I think it's about as clear
as I can make it I want to take a second
here actually to introduce I have a I've
got a sponsor that I'm doing for this
video that's it's pretty related and
it's called better help I'm sure you've
heard of it before basically I guess
it's like an online therapy thing I
thought about doing this a long time ago
but I was actually uncomfortable
originally but I did a lot of digging
into them over the past couple months
and they seemed pretty cool but
basically it's like an affordable way
and very convenient to get like therapy
online it allows you to they give that
like constant access to your therapist
the prices are like half or whatever
what you'd normally expect I think like
35 to 70 week is about the average is on
the site and as somebody was paid for
therapy and rely for other people I know
that it gives a lot more expensive in
real life so yeah I mean I have a link
below the video if you're looking to do
something related to that again I mean
I'm
compelling you to do but like if you
have again just to reiterate you know
what I had a beginning this video if you
have some sort of problem trying to get
these problems fixed via therapy or via
like clinically researched medication is
so much more highly recommended than any
of the crazy [ __ ] that I do yeah thanks
a lot
enjoy the video I'll get you guys later
your experience on mushrooms change your
perspective with anything nope why did
you do 1 million mushrooms because I had
in one of a dumb experience I wanted to
go on the journey
you have any regrets we need to thought
you died from the mushrooms well I
didn't want to die what I've reckful
decides to do the psychedelics because
of you aren't psychedelics risky to be
able to clinical depression
responsibility that being said I don't
think it would you didn't wait too much
to have a good experience so you've cost
the ego death but I wasn't after a good
experience that I have no interest in
doing drugs to feel happiness exactly to
the system why I was doing I was looking
for a unique experience that I can't get
anywhere else
the idea of tripping and seeing colors
and [ __ ] is very boring to me I wasn't
there my you were tripping
I don't really want to say because I
don't reveal people it shouldn't be but
I mean like reckful and Becca were there
I guess I could say those two before I
there's way too many questions I can't
even read it right the main thing that
came out of it was in large bubbles and
printed a new soul no it my phone was
like my only tethered to realities I
think that by virtue of picking up my
phone a lot I think I probably did some
session at Lord Smallville with my phone
I guess you get the experience here I'm
looking for I mean I imagine so I don't
it but I mean I can't really know if
there's like anything more than that do
you think that what you experience does
reflect death in any way I mean I have
no way of ever knowing that right have
you actually the footage
yeah reckful was showing me some is
really interesting I hope I can mount
the full I hope I get done with the full
footage online it would be really
interesting any plans to release video
it was I think they only got about two
or three hours of it I don't think they
caught the really bad parts which sucks
because those are probably really
interesting but you feel ripped off that
you didn't do it was so short
where does have like seven hours how
long did it take to wear off it was
actually right at about like six or
seven hours
I would say that like the actual like
extreme trip probably lasted like four
hours and then I was like marijuana hi
like an hour and or two going into it
and like an hour - coming out of it if
that makes sense they were like there
were three major okay [ __ ] I feel like
I'm gonna be working a lot of [ __ ]
things there were three it's in waves oh
dude the waves part was the worst
[ __ ] part because you never know when
you're actually back in reality right
because every time I would come back I
would say like it's just surreal and
then somebody would say yes but then
like [ __ ] would go crazy again and it
wasn't real so I would keep being told
that it's real it's real that's real but
it wasn't real and so why then are you
any closer to getting Twitter unbanned
I hope so but that's my hope pokey and
pokey and Isis manager and those who are
problem pokies and actually did a decent
amount and that Isis manager helped a
lot the rightful is helping a little bit
as well so hopefully one of these three
avenues good sweet - where I need to be
about astray - you know we gotta look
very welcome you seem so good
you said you tried again at a less
ridiculous dose just for fun no I don't
know I have no interest I don't know I
would just never do drugs for fun I
don't I don't know how to explain it I
just I might try LSD next lately but I
really don't know how to explain it
I just don't there are things that I
enjoy doing in life that drugs seem to
inhibit all of that like marijuana it's
not fun for me I feel like I can't do
anything that I would like to do yeah I
don't know so I guess these are the
these are the three these are like the
three phases and I can't really know for
sure if everything I'm saying is applies
correctly because I because I read oast
but uh
basically what happened was I was told
that doing like 1.5 grams psilocybin
would be like a really good would be
like a really good starting point for
sure
stick to try it to like ease my way into
it so I was able to get bags dried and
psilocybin or I mean I think they were
dry when you eat that they're crunchy
they taste like veggie chips or whatever
I'm pretty sure was drying
so because um but because I wanted like
the full heroic experience like I wanted
to go on a they taste like [ __ ] I don't
think they face about at all how they
were fine it was like literally just
like veggie chips or whatever so
after doing I decided I want to do what
when I was gonna do the fall I think
it's three point five it is what they
were in each bag drinking so I did three
point five the first phase of doing it
it felt like a felt like a like I was
high on marijuana that's basically what
it felt like
so I was kind of you know like thanks
for giggly and I was a little
light-headed or whatever I don't think
they had like fully kicked in yet maybe
that's just like the first part but I
got really worried that when that
started happening I got worried that I
was gonna miss like the actual hero at
the journey so I did another bag which
was so that put me up to seven and then
like five minutes later I said [ __ ] I
want to go to fold to go a full [ __ ]
distance and another 3.5 and I'm pretty
sure that should get me to wherever the
[ __ ] it's possibly going shrooms
unless more would help I don't know if
Lamar would do anything but so yeah
eventually we got we did the full 10.5
so this is what I think happened but I
don't totally know I think that right
after I did the next two bags
I think the first bag actually kicked in
because I started to get like the
psychedelic experience that I have seen
I've hard and like cartoons and movies
so often so like a color would appear on
the TV screen and then like that collar
would explode along all the walls and I
would feel lights behind me that were
shining that color and it was like a
very groovy kind of it was a very groovy
like cartoon-esque experience
I know I could be wrong but that seemed
like that seemed like though the first
bag of shrooms like the kind of fun
whatever experience but pretty soon
after that [ __ ] got incredibly [ __ ]
real I think that I think that groovy
thing from what I've read sounds like
the one bag of just getting like the
groovy psychedelic experience but then
after the other two kicked in which was
pretty shortly after I feel I got only
took 15 or 20 minutes bad [ __ ] got
insane so I think the first thing that
happened was I think I I think the
experience that I felt was kind of like
I'd died so a lot of what happened
involved a lot of loops I don't know
this is I'm gonna try to explain this
the best that I can but there were so
many loops that I went through the first
thing was I started to lose my sense of
myself existing and I kind of started to
replace like for nondescript images in
my head of going around and around and
around and the idea that I kept trying
to hang on to so originally I was trying
to remember who I was and what I was
doing there what was going on but
the the upsetting part or the scariest
part of this it sounds like the scary
part is the part where you realize
you're dying but the actual scary part
was that that realization didn't
actually matter that there was no one to
realize that you were dying you were
just some passive entity observing
random [ __ ] that was beyond existence
you no longer and then but there was
like a little part of me that like I
tried to fight that feeling very [ __ ]
hard because I absolutely do not want to
die I repeated a lot of phrases as I
came in and out of lucidity and I think
the let the number one phrase that I
repeat it was a I kept saying the rectal
don't let me die don't let me die
don't let me die and I think I said that
like a million [ __ ] times because I
really did a woman died but I but then
eventually like and again it's not that
I it didn't feel like I experienced
death it felt like I experienced the
stage after death where there's no one
left to experience death that's it
sounds really weird to say I cannot I
can't give you like a good description
of this type of conscious experience
because it was like beyond consciousness
once I once I passed that once I got
through that loop the next look was
picking up my phone and then every time
I would look at things
it wasn't reality I could tell that
none of my senses were giving me real
information but then I couldn't tell if
any of the information or memories that
I never had
wherever real information either so I
would pick up my phone I would look
around the room and everything was not
real but then but but it didn't matter
that it wasn't real because I whatever I
used to be that could perceive things as
real was just as real as the unreal [ __ ]
that I was experiencing then and there
although of all this although I'm going
this there are like parts of the inside
of me that this is an absolutely
horrible experience this is the worse
mental experience that I've ever had in
my entire life this might be because I'm
so attached to living that I absolutely
just don't want to die and the scary
part was losing the part of me that
didn't want to die so as I continued to
loop through these thoughts I was lost
in this tunnel of nothing mattering and
whatever I used to be it's kind of like
the same thing again or I went through
this tunnel again of whoever I used to
be didn't really exist or if it did
exist so that was just as real as all of
the fake senses that I was experiencing
at that point in time and
I kept coming back into consciousness
but the way that I would observe reality
was detached from myself it was like I
was watching the entity that was me live
reality and everything that I did was
just it could have been any number of
realities because I kept coming back
into a reality and it felt like I kept
stepping back into other realities but
any reality could have been as real as
as who I was before what was going on
and then and then it got to the point to
where my entire existence became this
room this was the the previous parts of
the trip were so bad
but this might have been the absolute
worst part of a trip was when I feel
like who is what I felt like I was my my
entire eternity I spent multiple
eternities in this room that the
totality of my existence was living
lifetimes in this room of being on this
couch and experiencing reality after
reality there were all just as
legitimate as any reality that I never
experienced at any point in my life
there were times where I would wake up
on the couch and I would look over at
Becca and reckful and they would say
things to me in my mind they weren't
really saying it but they would say
things to me in my mind and the
perception I had was that I was a crazy
person that had that my entire previous
life had been a delusion that I didn't I
wasn't a streamer or any of that I was
just some crazy [ __ ] dude that was
living through lifetimes on this couch
and that god record is kind of there and
I was like a guy that was maybe just in
their apartment and and I was just
insane and everything about my previous
life I had just totally fantasize and
they were very condescending this is all
in my head
they were very condescending to me like
he's a crazy person oh that's cute he's
he's coming back for a little bit he's
gonna go back to his previous life of
being a streamer pretty soon that kind
of like insane condescension now they
weren't actually saying this and then I
started to and then there was another
part of this where every single person
in the room started to gasp late my
existence so reckful as he was like
trips hitting me or whatever kept asking
me because I would keep coming back into
lucidity from a brief moment and I would
ask him like is it really it oh I
remember when I was going through the
death tunnels when I would briefly slip
back in till acidity I was asking like
are we done I need to pass this I don't
like this I hate this I'm dying
don't let me die how much longer I need
to get though of this the worst things
that I would ask oh god I remember early
on I asked how much longer and somebody
had told me you've only been here for 30
minutes but it had already felt like
eternities that I'd been trapped so so
when I heard that it's only been 30
minutes that I had like five hours to go
that was another like on a feeling of
horrendous dread
watch over my body because I had already
felt like I had like experienced
eternities of anguish on a beat dead oh
my god it was such an insane experience
okay we're waiting but we're hope so I
would come back in Oh for these moments
of lucidity where I would ask wreck fall
if it was real I would he would say yes
but then his eyes would begin flickering
at like a million times per second and I
started to see his face and the people
in the room in this is gonna sound so
ridiculous but I saw them in like three
dimensions the way that their faces and
everything popped out at me was such an
insanely three-dimensional experience I
felt like everything I've seen up to
that point in my life had only been two
dimensions but they were actually in
three dimensions Oh which is kind of
ironic because you technically really
only do see in two dimensions but like
it was just an insane it was the way
that they appeared and stood out like
three-dimensional characters was just so
[ __ ] insane to me
I can't I can't really explain this it's
impossible for me to explain it's like
what if you watch like a 2d movie and
then you put on 3d glasses you know how
it jumps out at you now imagine you're
looking at normal reality and then you
put on like 40 glasses and it jumps out
at you again that's what it felt like I
was looking at it's impossible to
explain but um reckful kept trying to
ask me questions oh here's another
really interesting part reckful kept
trying okay
so I would look at my phone and it would
be like 852 and then I would lose it I'd
go back and then I would experience
lifetime's of death to this room and I
pick up my phone and look at it again
and only a minute past like I really
felt like I was experiencing eternity
and it would only tick by one minute at
a time and then I'd put the phone down
and I would experience like another
eternity of being trapped in this room
and all these people around me that
weren't real that were just parts of my
mind that continued to Gaslight my
existence do you remember asking
questions
yeah actually after I remembered I
remembered most of the things that I
said in real life because I could
because once I became fully lucid once
it started to wear off I was able to
kind of disentangle what was trippy
versus what I was actually saying which
I thought was cool I'm really gonna keep
in my memory a few things for whatever
reason like when I did like edibles I
kept my memory through it when I get
like super [ __ ] blasted drunk I seem
to kid like everything maybe I just
haven't done enough stuff to totally
lose my memory but like I remember very
vividly everything that happened and a
pretty sure I remember now I remember
what was real and what wasn't the god
there are so many [ __ ] up parts
another the scariest part the absolute
code I don't know what the scariest part
was all of it was so horrible oh I think
I already said this I kept coming back
into reality but I felt like a third
party observer to my reality and then
like Becca would look at me and she
would say like you're back this is it
this is your reality now this is what
you wanted the rest of your life is
going to feel this way she wasn't
actually saying this it was just in my
head but uh no no that wasn't Becca
actually it was reckful that was saying
it to me he was saying it like you're
back congratulations this is what you
wanted this is reality now and I'm like
I was watching myself as an entity do
things but I clearly knew that it wasn't
reality before so I thought what had
one thing a lot of people noted was
destiny talking big after ever it's gone
but not while I was on doing the same
thing now when I'm having a conversation
with someone I'll be polite while you're
here but like I can't just like call you
dumb like to you that does that's not
very productive for a conversation I
we're never gonna grant anything my dude
I think it's better for you to just you
could sit in your little bubble and call
me racist or whatever and then we just
kind of move from there like like I
can't do this guys I can't put myself
through this I don't think I can handle
this again I'm gonna have a panic attack
mid-conversation dude for my own like
personal mental health I don't know if I
can I think I'm like yay damn sir I
think I've proven my point let's move on
oh he's saying you only talk big because
you left the stream I I mean if he if
you join if you join a room I'll drag
you in if you really if you really want
to chat again but I mean since we've had
our first conversation if you really
want to dude he said you had no balls
I mean it's I'm just trying to be polite
like oh god let me go get it let me go
so I play it up let me do I'm gonna do
to silence today so I can of all all the
soy flooding through my body I'll be
right back should I be adding even now
yeah hold on one second
I can't do this
Oh No everybody let's help let's all
relax ourselves okay
[Music]
my dude all right we're on we're live
all right so what's what's going on man
how's everything I'm doing great a
little bit scared now but here I am I
know it man it's all good no don't be
scared me no well no it's not a man I'm
actually like I'm ready to go now okay
if if we do this again okay you have to
let me talk cuz you talked like [ __ ]
three times as much as me last time and
I'll let you say a lot of really dumb
[ __ ] and I can't let you do it again
okay what did I say that was dumb why am
i doing so my problem with conservatives
is that you guys have like no factual
basis for anything you always like apply
to like your [ __ ] feelings and
emotions all the time and I don't care
about that when I have these
conversations I don't have fact-based
conversations not like here's a story
about my grandpa and this proves my
point
you know a freshman what did I say that
was close
it's not about whether or not your
statements are true or false it's about
whether or not you're making rational
arguments so for instance doesn't it
matter if I'm saying something that's
true
nope nope so if a statement is true it
doesn't matter it depends on it doesn't
because a statement is true doesn't mean
it supports an argument so for instance
if somebody says that meat is unhealthy
for you and I say well I like me that's
a true statement but it doesn't speak to
the argument of whether or not meat is
healthy or unhealthy for you so if I
argue that so if I say something like
red lining was a policy that existed
that discriminated against black people
not people that could have put black
people and you say well my grandfather
owned a house in West Virginia that says
nothing to my argument well what I told
you was about redlining it was largely
based on credit which is not just a fait
it ended it did not justify blacks
either it also affected White's you know
that there are documents online that
exist right now where we can both go and
look through documents that that are
still actually in use in some place
today that say like no black people not
people with bad clear credit but no
black people like well okay but it was
largely based on credit and it did not
just affect blacks so was redlining only
applied to black people or did it apply
to the people that were white in some
cases
do you really think that redlining was
generally done only very what was
generally done to just people poor
credit and didn't really generally apply
to black people or do you think that was
mainly black people and maybe there were
some cases of white people being
discriminated against well it was people
from all different walks of life but it
was largely based on credit okay
why do you think that no historian would
back that point up why do you think that
everybody in history like disagrees with
you does that make you uncomfortable
everybody in history sure if we were to
go and read any article about redlining
it's gonna talk about how redlining was
targeted towards black people and the
horribly discriminatory effects it had
on black communities so you can you can
speak to all the articles that exist on
redlining it exists all over the
internet you're confident when you say
that fairly well I'm sure you could find
like a Breitbart article that's right so
let's not say that all articles are
gonna support your claim okay most
credible historians or most credible
sociologists that are talking about the
practice of redlining are going to be
saying that red light Lake I'm pretty
sure we went to the Wikipedia page it's
going to talk right in there about how
red line is a great source of
information isn't it a lot better than
whatever you're sourcing that says it
was just for credit I mean we don't we
don't even don't like the Wikipedia
article we go straight to the sources
from the wiki article but yeah I would
consider decent starting point say that
most historians would say - then why
don't all historians say they because
I'm sure you can probably find
exceptions in any academic field about
some things I'm sure that I could
probably find why I don't know because
some people are crazy because some
people have I don't know there's a
million reasons why I could probably
find I guarantee you I bet my life on it
I could probably find a physicist out
there that believes the earth is flat
I'm sure they exist but why would I go
against consensus there unless I'm
pushing an agenda you can prove that the
earth is not flat I mean that's a
different thing I mean I can prove to
you that I mean what's does anybody have
a link to the site where you can go back
and read like all the documents that
still exist today that can show you like
how they specifically call out black
people in the document we can go and
read these now this like this isn't
contested history like the thing that
bothers me when I'm talking about this
isn't like something that's up for
debate it's not even like a thing that
like people like also with art so I'm
going to documents if are wrong and are
wrong
there's somebody Jackie this all right
let me try and find this if anybody has
a post for this there's like a really
sick there's like a website where you
can go online you don't actually read
like a whole bunch of documents have
been uploaded but I mean I'm kind of on
the spot but I'll try to find it give me
a minute
you know this articles also say that
redlining is still alive but how is that
possible when it's illegal to do that
because people can discriminate without
being overt about it for instance
sometimes if people get a job
application they might toss that if the
name is of a black person as opposed to
if it's a white sounding name so you
could argue that there's forms of
discrimination which have been well
studied this isn't controversial either
okay so is that only something that
affects black people or can whites be
discriminated against in the same way
I'm not aware of any studies that show
that widespread white people have been
discriminated against in job performance
I didn't ask you about if it's
widespread or not and I didn't ask you
of a study I just had I just said can
whites be discriminated against when it
comes to jobs I don't get a lot of
blacks because you got a lot of mean why
don't you care because I'm looking for
sir sir sir hold on if you don't care
about that then why do you care about
the converse why do you care about
blacks being discriminated against but
not White's or anybody else being
discriminated against sitting it'd be
wrong to discriminate against anybody if
you're against discrimination sure but
that's not the conversation we're having
right now well what are we talking about
it I'm talking about widespread policies
that impact large groups of people
across the United States not is there is
there a chance that a white person
somewhere might discriminate that's
possible and if it happens yeah I'm
against that it's wrong but I don't care
about one off example the article I'm
talking about says the red line is
losses today so that's net policy nor is
it wise free what are what is this I
don't understand you're proving my
pointer is this supposed to prove your
point now the article the article says
that red lining is so alive and will
although that's illegal you can't do
that so I mean the point is that you can
find an article this is anything they
over at line in Israel
it affects these people you can find
anything to back up whatever you want to
back up can you change
can you I'm not trying to put you on the
spot any yeah because you're kind of ear
right there you're using like the
Russian propaganda line we are trying to
say that like all all articles are of
equal credibility like no I'm just
proving I'm just saying that sometimes
it doesn't really matter what you can
bring up you could bring up anything to
support your claim that's not true for
the most part I think
no no that's absolutely imaginary that
is one of the most anti intellectual
positions I've ever heard in my entire
life
we shouldn't matter because we should be
able to agree on what reality is or
something is well studied we should have
a decent consensus on what is actually
happening this this idea that all
evidence is equal evidence so that all
things can be possible at any point of
time is totally absurd I didn't say all
evidence is equal evidence I'm just
saying that you can bring up anything to
support your claim payments sound the
same to me that sounds like it's on the
same but it's under same to you but
that's not what I'm saying okay when you
say anybody yeah when anybody can bring
up something to support their claim that
makes it sound like all evidence is is
equally nice your opinion in this fine
but it's not what I'm saying
okay that's what's heavily implied but
what you're saying so let me ask you
know that's what you're implying I think
anybody's your opinion I'm so that's not
when I'm applying this your opinion do
you think that all evidence is equal
then no when I didn't say it was then
why would you care if anybody could
bring up a random article to support
something what does that have to do with
anything do you think that I won't point
okay do you think that when I say that
redlining is something that's well
researched and most people gonna do you
think I'm just setting random articles
there do you think that's like oh like a
decent consensus of like sociology that
they would agree that like redlining
existed and it discriminated against
black people well I mean you are able to
deduce that from what you have been able
to research but from when I've been able
to research I know that it was largely
based on credit and it did not just a
Fayette blacks and I can find
information to back up what I say and
you can find information to back up what
you say and do you if you want do you
want it like us we could have a
structured debate on this if you want
well we could actually both research
sources and cut because like there's you
you're speaking against historical
consensus like you're not gonna find
sociologists that are gonna stay here
and legitimately you might be able to
find like a random maybe like a Thomas
Saul or its oral article or whatever
that says like ah well I don't think
Ness left to actual educated intelligent
this is a very educated man he's very
well respected and author I mean like
why he'd not be a good source to go to
if he stands at ends with like every
other person in the field I'm gonna lean
with
more the field than that one guy that
was because a lot of people disagree
thing that makes them wrong that's not
exactly what I'm saying
so what are you saying if I were to get
a roomful of 100 physicists and they
were to give you their interpretation of
quantum mechanics and then a religious
person were to say well I think it's
like this and I would say I'm probably
gonna side with the scientific people
would you literally tell me oh so just
cuz all of them are saying it you think
it's right do you think that academic
consensus exists or do you think that's
just a big meme academic instances I
mean you can have a consensus but that
doesn't necessarily mean that it's right
I mean the consensus at one point was a
the earth would have some revolved
around the earth not the other way
around
that was a consensus at one point that
doesn't mean that you know it's
infallible that it could never be
disproven okay baby making argument
you're making is saying oh because most
people disagree with some and so people
that you have been able to identify on
the internet or whatever doesn't make
Thomas so automatically wrong okay
firstly that the the not heliocentric an
earth centric universe was a religious
idea not a scientific idea firstly
secondly that idea is not as wrong as
thinking the Sun is moving randomly
throughout the sky in some ways from our
perspective it's correct so the idea
that the earth was the center in
universe isn't even necessarily 100%
wrong and some in some ways you could
argue it okay we're more more accurate
today but the process of our scientific
investigation is becoming more and more
and more accurate has happened because
we've listened to scientific consensus
as time has gone on if there's like one
person standing against like an odds so
the course is changed it evolves it
doesn't just like 180 typically it
changed do you think that all changes
where I mean evolution and implies
change doesn't it not you have to if you
evolve you change not going to stay the
same if you evolve no but you're
chilling moving and like you're
typically moving in like a single
direction or you're moving in a certain
direction you don't just like 180 on all
of your previous opinions in there just
to be like whatever like just because
the consensus changed at one point in
time doesn't mean that all things are
all of a sudden equally viable so the
point is that a consensus can't change
it's not set in stone necessarily sure
but I real
wait that brings me to my point about
Thomas auld I don't think it makes any
sense to say oh just because other
people disagree with them that he's
automatically wrong okay but the fact
that every other educated person in this
field disagrees with him and he's the
one person standing at ends as a layman
I'm gonna side with the majority
consensus and until they can point at
weaken it that's one person begin to the
far right now that doesn't mean he's the
only person it's just one person that
you can identify so when you look at
like like any of these documents that
exist that show that like black people
are are not allowed to rent things here
or that we don't like do these things
are they all do you think they're fake
documents or well not necessarily I
think that racism like I said in a
previous discussion we had racism most
certainly does exist and existed much
more back then especially prior to 1960
but I still say that red London was
largely based on credit and one thing
that you may not agree on the credit
part but one thing that we both have to
agree on which is fact is that red line
and did not just impact black people it
impacted a lot of different people
including white recent immigrants
Hispanics Asians etc Jews especially
okay but it disproportionately impacted
black people compared to white people
there might have been like an absolute
number of white people that were
impacted that might be more than blacks
but it disproportionately impacted black
people okay I'm not really sure if
that's one percent true or false let's
just say it's true now did it impact any
other racial group in a way that was
worse than whites prep maybe probably I
think Filipino well sure I think you
should look into that and see what's
going on with it it could have impacted
Jews it could have impacted Hispanics
Asians and then we need to look at how
that affected them and if it did affect
them in a negative way
why are black people still struggling
with what we're struggling with today I
think this whole redlining excuse is
just kind of worn out played out
honestly because during that time closer
to the end of slavery in a time when
there was much more racism segregation
and Jim Crow
oliday you can look at all these metrics
and see that the black community was in
the midst of much better states but it
is yeah
just because more people were employed
doesn't mean they were any muck this
sounds like like like if I were to go to
lay just one metric you can measure but
there's many other metrics you could
measure - like it sounds like I could
make the argument we should go back to
slavery because black people were well
fed were well nourished were kept in
good homes had clothes and the
employment rate was 100 percent why not
that I'm sure that there were a lot of
like slavery you talking about people
that are imprisoning essentially this
not to say anything is being free who
cares if they if they're employed if
they're happy I'm sure there was
something I'm sure they're reduce the
amount of black people who are happy
living under very slave owners no that's
not that's not what we're talking about
people that are free you can't you can't
compare free people to prisoners it's
not the same I mean are you really sorry
in today's society you still have to
work to pay your [ __ ] bills sometimes
you got to work really [ __ ] jobs I mean
more choices in if you are a prisoner if
you're incarcerated if you're
incarcerated you have you're not free
you can't just do whatever you want to
do what do you think somebody would
rather do you think somebody would
rather be like a happy slave living on a
plantation where their owners taking
care of them or would rather be
miserable in today's black society where
everybody is like born out of wedlock
and there's drugs I think any man woman
child will much rather be free
regardless of what the situation is okay
then if you believe that why do you keep
citing me that like in the 50s black
people were better off than they are
today
because the baby was over no but it was
legal discrimination and segregation and
[ __ ] existed it doesn't mean that it was
slavery so anything short of slavery is
okay wait so like if I tell you you're
black you can't live in this part of the
what am i I have a secret daughter I'm a
socialist I am a communist the socialist
communist like I said the same thing to
most people Pro pedophile Pro child porn
Pro I think I have a secret daughter
that I rape also or maybe I don't rape
her anymore and that's why the mom took
her oh I feel like you can tell like all
my old stories again because now I have
like new viewers for my YouTube thing
that aren't my stream viewers when I got
into so a lot of people have a lot of
misconceptions for I got into like
internet debating or whatever so I am
NOT an activist and I don't care to
further causes these are not things well
let me go back okay let me be more clear
when I speak this as part of my online
platform I am NOT an activist and as
part of my debate platform I don't care
to further causes I don't have a
political agenda now there are some
people on the right or there soon that
will never agree with us which is fine I
could give a [ __ ] less about them I
couldn't give a [ __ ] less about them
early on my goal was just that I thought
that there were issues that were very
complicated and it was interesting to
try to find like what is like the what
is like the real truthful arguments in
these issues you know these immigration
good or bad for the country this is a
very complicated and interesting issue
to me because it impacts all of us and
there are a lot of good arguments on
both sides you know as veganism right or
wrong is you know is incest and moral
wrong is is like the health care should
that be a public good or should health
care be privatized completely these are
all like really interesting questions
you can talk at length about and there
are arguments on both sides of them when
I got into debating like two years ago
my goal was just to like explore those
arguments because it's really fun for me
and I saw that online there were a lot
of people that claimed to have good
arguments that were making very bad
arguments most of the people that are
centrist so people like roaming
millennial people like Blair white
people like Lauren southern are are in
in my opinion very dumb in the way that
they approach their arguments their
arguments are very base level Dave Rubin
is a great example of this where it kind
of sounds like if you were a high
schooler and you presented them with a
topic this would be like babbies first
steps into explaining this topic right
so for Dave Rubin you know like oh every
speech should be free because know
everything you should be free and there
was no I was like okay well what about
if you use freeze
speech and you emboldened people that
hate other people and try to kill people
because of that free speech and Dave
reams like oh no the marketplace of
ideas like okay well you need to have a
response to that like that because that
will happen now that doesn't
automatically kill free speech right you
can still say I believe in freedom of
speech even if it does lead to some
people getting harmed that's a trade-off
that you make that's still an argument
you can make but the fact that Dave
Rubin doesn't have anything beyond like
the most surface basic [ __ ] levels of
arguments for any of its beliefs and I
see this happen with person after person
after person after person right so I'm
like okay cool I want to get into the
debating thing so when I originally
thought envision to this like two years
ago I thought that every debate would be
like okay we're gonna debate on
immigration
all right well David Carr did his
landmark Mariel boatlift study and he
says that even if a ton of immigrants
come to an area like Miami it doesn't
really have the impact on price that we
thought it would we see things like
minimum wage which are artificial price
floors that are supposed to have
detrimental impacts on wages not have
that impact what is your argument in
favorite way and I thought that the
arguments would all be going like back
and forth and back and forth like well
you know immigration could do this and
this and this and blah blah blah
etc etc etc but what actually happened
was I realized that every single person
on YouTube that is into politics like
can't read basic data or charts and has
no desire to understand any issue more
complicated past than like the very
surface level thing and so like when
people talk to me in real life and
sometimes I meet people and they find
out what I do and they're like oh cool
like do you have a debate that you would
recommend watching I have nothing like I
can't really say like oh well in this
debate I explored some really cool ideas
with this person because most my debates
are just massive [ __ ] shows where the
other person doesn't know how to read
like you know basic graphs and yeah that
was like really disappointing to me
that's like part of the reason that I
kind of stepped out of the debate fail
because I felt like I and like there's
like so many examples of this like my
favorite is um the last person I talked
to him real life about this was um was I
was even Sargon like people's inability
to understand maybe it's just
conservatives it's probably not I'm sure
that left-leaning people have trouble
with this as well but like when you see
a chart like this for a Sargon right
those are the classic Sargon name and
you see that like married black people
make on average it was like 45,000
annual Rite and single black people on
average make like $25,000 annual rite
that Sargon can see a chart like this
I'm sorry one can say okay well of these
people just get married they'll become
these people and like he was fully
convinced of this but that's not how
that's not how data works does no any of
these charts work you can't there is no
causal link that's implied by just these
two numbers you need so much more data
in order to actually be able to make
that statement and you can think of we
can hypothesize a million other
scenarios in which case in which these
two worlds happen but but you can't like
become this to this
does that make sense and I'd like I
can't think of like a million different
examples for instance people that own
what is it is like is it like there's
some black card like that like if you
own it you're like it's because you're
super rich like owning the black car
only rich people own this particular
credit card but you don't become rich by
owning that credit card right or I could
say that people that max out their Roth
IRA contributions are much more likely
to be wealthy than people that don't max
out the Roth IRA contributions but that
doesn't mean if you make fifteen
thousand a year that if you just start
maximizing your your Roth IRA countries
you're gonna be rich of course not it's
more that maxing out to max out your
Roth IRA contribution it's like a
precondition that you already have to be
pretty wealthy to do it right and you
can actually see this with things like
marriage where we're generally the
people that get married are generally
people that are already wealthy right
like um like marriage costs money you
gotta get the marriage license sometimes
you gotta have a big procession or
whatever if that's your thing like a lot
of people don't want to get married
until they're making more money like and
you know I won't dive in all this now
but like there's a ton of information on
there that that kind of points to the
fact that being wealthy is more like a
like a condition and then getting
married is actually the symptom and
that's just like one of like a million
different [ __ ] things and the problem
that I ran into so many times when I
would start debating these people is
that as soon as I start talking I
realized that I have so much ground that
I would need to cover to to bring them
over to my side that it's like not worth
it for instance like when I'm talking to
count dank EULA and Count Ankiel is like
the left is more violent than the right
and I'm like okay well why do you think
that and he's like uh I think I was I
why do you think that you know I've got
this source here that says that there's
actually more extreme forms of right
terrorism in the US and it left and he's
like oh well that source is bias it's
like okay sure
well let's say that this source is bias
what's your evidence in goes well I've
watched youtube videos and I'm like okay
that it's you can't do that
and he's like no no you don't understand
I've watched hundreds of YouTube videos
and it's like that's that's not how that
works at all like I can't even be like I
can't even believe that you're unyk Lee
saying this to me right now
like I actually want to kill myself like
listening to you on air like not only on
ironically presenting this as an
argument but then like smugly laughing
about it as well it's like dude like
YouTube as a site firstly do you know if
equal amounts of violence are posted
from the left and right on YouTube maybe
there's a higher probability that right
leaning or left leaning violence could
post it on YouTube but firstly secondly
do you know how the algorithm recommends
you videos maybe there's a higher chance
that people are um maybe there's a
higher chance that YouTube is
recommending you certain videos thirdly
are you being biased at all
maybe there's a higher chance that you
click on videos that have right-leaning
or left-leaning violence as opposed
greater violence fourthly maybe people
are more likely to record right there's
like a million different reasons we
could we could probably spend it right
now like listing 15 different ways that
that way of collecting data is wrong and
none of this is like really high level
stuff none of this is like you know I
went to college and I'm a grad student
studying data collection like it's not
really at all like high levels like I
learned all this stuff in high school I
don't think I'm exceptionally smart for
knowing any of this like it's pretty
basic stuff if you're really being
honest with yourself oh yeah the gun
argument when I got into that argument
with the guy oh god with that bald idea
that came on to defend gun to defend gun
[ __ ] in Australia and the guy was like
well look at Port Arthur okay after Port
Arthur they made fully automatic assault
or they made like assault rifles illegal
guess what if you look at the deaths in
Australia to gun violence they remain
the same and I was like okay and I had
never seen this data before so sometimes
people ambush you with data that's
totally fine that that's cool people
give me a new data I can I could reform
my opinion or something and I've gone
back and forth on whether or not that
Port Arthur gun ban was good or bad for
Australia and I still go back and forth
on it right now and in that it was
probably a good thing but I could be
swayed either side so I start looking up
the numbers and I'm like wait a second
you said that the numbers remain
constant and he was like yeah
the number of deaths per year in
Australia have have remained constant
and I'm like okay but the population in
Australia is like doubled over the past
like 20 years and then he on ironically
says to me oh you want to make the per
capita argument what how do I respond to
that
what am I supposed to say when somebody
says it to me an ironic lis you want to
make the per capita like how do what am
I like do we have to go back and spend
like 20 hours like having like very very
basic conversations I'm like how data or
numbers or stats work like you know I
don't know I don't know what I'm
supposed to do there you know like
that's and I run into this and debate
after debate after debate after debate
we're like people will say something and
it's just like dude you're not even like
I can't even believe you're we're having
this conversation right now why are you
here
tell the Lauren southern one the Lauren
southern debate was the debate that I
prepared the hardest for god she said so
many [ __ ] stupid things
she opened our debate off with it with
with a I guess she did some research on
me with the Starcraft 2 story and she's
like ok I'm gonna give you a Starcraft
example on what immigration is bad and
I'm like ok sure let's do it and she's
like well imagine you have a base and
you've got 15 SUVs mining and I'm like
ok sure and she's like well what if we
brought in like 20 SUVs more to mine
like now you don't have enough work for
all of your SUVs and that's really bad
and I'm like ok well this is kind of
like the perfect analogy I'm glad that
you brought this up because if I wanted
to expand my base um Starcraft or expand
my economy in real life I would have to
increase my resource of labor my supply
of labor or build more SUVs to do it so
yeah 20 more SUVs came in I would
probably build another base and in
StarCraft this is exactly what you did
we uh I actually read her whole shitty
[ __ ] book and I think she really
wrote it too I don't think that book was
ghostwritten she really wrote that
because they're like phrases in there
where it's like cuck professors I read
her whole book and I actually read
actual economic literature which was so
insanely [ __ ] dry and boring to me
but I did it to prepare for this debate
and we had like a two-hour debate and
the first like 20 minutes after going
into the economic argument she
robson she's like okay well hold on
economics is really only a really small
part of my book I just want to talk
about culture and I'm like I just spent
like my whole prep time going into the
economics because I cuz I wanted to bake
numbers and now you're just gonna give
me your [ __ ] feels II that you're
scared of [ __ ] brown people like how
holy [ __ ] how bored can I be here like
ah and then her thing I'm like and then
I have to try to tell her like you know
that like sometimes some data can be
worse than no data right like data
collection is very important like it's
really hard to collect good data and
she's like because she's like while I
was on the ground in Malmo and Sweden
where I was like okay you think that all
the sweetness structurally yeah I went
there and I saw betting it's like you
know that like your one experience in
one part of one city in three days can't
be extrapolated to the entire country of
Sweden right and then she on ironically
uttered the phrase well data is just the
plural of anecdote oh [ __ ] I hate these
people dude yeah anyway like I [ __ ] dude
[ __ ] me these debates were miserable
nothing good there were no good debates
that happened at all all of them were
over like just the dumbest [ __ ] [ __ ]
who is that Joe PAGs guy that's like
well I'd rather I'd rather you know I'd
rather come up against somebody with a
gun than at night cuz a knife is more
scary and it's like it's like dude are
you you were [ __ ] military they don't
go to the Middle East with knives you
dumb [ __ ]
they don't arm you with a massive
[ __ ] machete and tell you to go kill
some [ __ ] Taliban why would you even
say this you know [ __ ] standard-issue
military [ __ ] your sidearm is like a
three inch knife switchblade and your
main arm is like a dried machete they
give you [ __ ] assault rifle they give
you em fours and they give um nine
Berettas right like or I think they
replaced the Beretta now but like
they're not giving you [ __ ] knives oh
why are you making it we both know that
you're full of [ __ ] oh why are you doing
this to me why are you making this [ __ ]
up expecting me to believe it when we
both know that you don't even believe
this ah [ __ ] me I hated all these
arguments dude what did this guy say
hold on
[Music]
since we are telling stories that
YouTube has never heard how about
regaling us with the tulips even the
atheist no I'm good on that one you
showed the world how stupid these people
were they were actually important
changing many minds yeah maybe but again
and I know this is hard for some of you
to accept because I think a lot of you
have built up a version of me in your
mind that's actually so much different
than who I really am
my main concern was never political
rhetoric my main concern was never I'm
gonna bring everybody over to my side
because if it was I would my argument to
be far different reppin that my rhetoric
would change so much right we would be
telling narrative based arguments and
and even some fallacious appeals in
order to bring people to my side I just
wanted to go after the arguments
themselves that was interesting if I
could pull people over using you know
like well this is a rational argument
you know abcdefg premises and then
here's our conclusions like that would
be cool like I would enjoy that I don't
enjoy like political rhetoric as much
that's just like um like well let's talk
about minimum wage well let me tell you
a story about my friend Franco who a
minimum wage saved his life right that
would be a far more effective way of
bringing people over to my side that's
just not as entertaining to me I don't
and maybe I'm selfish or an [ __ ] for
thinking that but like that's just not
yeah I don't know
[Music]
white debates would you say were the
better more interesting ones Japanese
katana is the greatest weapon ever
created by man I don't know it really
depends on what you call interesting
if your goal was really high-level
debates all the time I'm kind of
disappointed about these Ali's paper to
give it to you will be the thing was
that like these were the most popular
people on YouTube so for some reason I
assume that like maybe these people and
so like I don't know just the idea that
somebody could be as big as Sargon but
also be a stupidest Sargon it was it
just never settled right in my head or
like dick Masterson he he came away from
that debate it was so funny watching
dick getting blown the [ __ ] out on the
PKA podcast where those guys were like
because he was trying they were like you
went on and you actually do we have a
link of that does anybody have like that
clip I would actually love yours watch
it again and [ __ ] jerk myself off of
right where they're like you went on a
debate of the destiny and he was like
yeah you know I kind of didn't it was
kind of whatever and then I think it was
woody was like you got blown the [ __ ]
out there didn't you like it was pretty
bad wasn't it oh man yeah dick was one
of my fate like a lot of the big problem
with somebody these [ __ ]
conservatives is that they like they
live in like this fantasy land and uh
it's insane to me how how you have a
conversation with somebody that's like
completely non factual it's like like
even about myself it's gotten to the
point to where make people make up so
many things about me where I'm like I'm
pro pedophile what am i I have a secret
daughter I'm a socialist I am a
communist socialist communist I guess
say the same thing to most people Pro
pedophile Pro child porn Pro I think I
have a secret daughter that I rape also
or maybe I don't rape her anymore that's
why the mom took her what else is there
I don't even know there's like there's
so many Pro incest and when you say
can you address this video what
September
also I think that he wanted to go with
like Lily did you hear about that no I
didn't hear about that but that the line
TV house is gonna wants to go to Japan
and I guarantee you that he'll ditch you
and I he's gonna ditch two dudes for the
offline TV house I will bet you know I'm
a [ __ ] prophet watch watch I've
Nostradamus dude I'm telling you right
now they're all brokers amante and Lily
are like hey do you want to go to Japan
instantly he'll be like yeah okay
firstly I don't I have never heard that
offline TV's been on going back to Japan
if that's true that's totally news to me
secondly yeah yeah he's probably right
if they would but I don't think they're
going so not much we were just talking
[ __ ] about you yeah I don't think the
offline TV house isn't going to japan at
all well I'm just responding to what
[ __ ] wait where'd you learn this
heaven yeah from you on your stream I
said they'd gone before pokey and Lily
had gone before but I don't got plans to
go back you said that they were
interested in going to Japan and that
you might want to go with them I heard
on Ustream I'm pretty sure and I really
suppose any remember me saying I feel
like I feel like this is some fake news
could be I tried to tell him with the
clip but he's right though I might ditch
her that would happen so I'm not all the
new dating surrett okay I'm trying to be
connected I gotta get my Twitter back
arc then I'm getting desperate alright
alright you know what I'm just gonna
bring it out I'm gonna [ __ ] say it
right here what was up with that you
know I gotta say it I'm sorry I'm sorry
everyone agrees what was ups with that
[ __ ] interview that perfect
opportunity for you to show and what
happened wait which one
which interview have you done recently
that could have been good for us I mean
I was on riffles podcast I was on Hokies
podcast with Louie which what are you
talking about guys oh wait Whaley he was
he was on pokies podcast that was even
more of an opportunity probably to what
bothers me you have no idea but what do
you think we could be talking about
I mean I'm I have an inkling but I mean
I'm gonna tell you it you should know
exactly why I wouldn't we're on the
attack this morning yeah I made a
picture we want to go down that road
again - what - not talking about our
streaming platform you mean that one day
was supposed to be delivered in January
again listen okay listen to me you and I
are different people you have products
and services to offer people I have my
brand and personality if you say some
[ __ ] and it ends up not coming to
fruition
it doesn't matter you've got tinychat
behind you you've got the the hunt
you've got you've got actual websites
and services you've delivered all I have
is like my brand and my word so if I go
around and I promise a platform over and
over and over and over again that's not
being delivered it is like a serious
damage my credibility this is why I told
you I'm not and I'm glad I did it now
remember seven months ago when you kept
telling me that I needed to like
hardcore get people like on the platform
and [ __ ] and I said that I'm not really
comfortable doing that without an actual
product and hand at least a beta version
because it really makes me look bad to
over promise and under deliver hmm you
gotta take risks no that's not a
business there's a difference
risks are something that like I have
control over like that like a risk is
not a risk is an intelligent thing it's
like a poker bluff right people think
that a risk or a bluff is just like lol
I hope it works out it's a calculated
like you're pushing it way too much to
one direction all I'm saying is
breakfast time so tell me about your
website all you do is say yeah and one
of the things I'm actually you know
we're working on and we hopefully got
out soon is a thing to let streamers
have their own website you don't have to
be the [ __ ] we'll be out here in
negative nine what's the point of just
Blake it's my one handedly barely
mentioning that I don't think that does
anything for us it does yes it's
everything man like that like okay if
you're gonna create hype around this
event right
and apologies we've both been up for a
really long time so let me try to make
sense of myself here but if what this
whole events launch is going to be
dependent on sort of the hype and
expectation that gets fitted around it
and if you mentioned something like that
I think it generates a lot of passive
interest that could follow you to the
actual launch of the website yeah but I
don't want passive interest following me
when I have absolutely no [ __ ] idea
what the release dates what that doesn't
matter like this it absolutely does what
is a specific call to action where it's
like it's gonna be here on June 25th I
will release is just saying like when
someone like that gives you an
opportunity for a call to action that is
so obvious like he literally asked you
about your website and how you monetize
and like hey it's changed your
subscription stuff you could tie it into
like a one-sentence thing that was like
hey by the way like yeah I'm working
like not even that that's like corny but
like oh yeah like it's tying in to this
product that I'm working on right now
that's you can even say it's like it's a
little bit delayed but it's coming out
like it's like it's a thing I'm working
on I guess so it's just I don't see very
much potential positive there and then I
just see me like offering something that
may or may not ever exists I disagree
with like the hype thing I just like
hyping something when you don't know
release date and you don't have any
specifics and it may or may not come out
like I don't I just I'm not some been
doing this for years okay and it works
fine valve doesn't make games though
they have steam that's all that matters
to vote make games yes valve doesn't
make games their business model is steam
what was the last thing they did portal
to or I guess they kind of maintained
dota but valves business if you
understand this right pals business
models on game this is why half life 3
isn't ever coming out and in Portal 3 is
probably never coming out and I'm this
is coming of people like it's a basic
marketing thing what we're doing is
coming out okay like a hundred percent
it's coming out
it was more work than the expected
that's par for the Morris was on he
doesn't believe in the product if I do I
use okay okay oh okay
hey what you never never not argued I
don't know where you're going now well
because because I think you trying to
get my goat how do you say don't believe
in the product I literally use it every
single day like I used my website I make
money my website obviously another
product works but like we went from a
two-month release date to now we're on
month nine or ten or eleven okay I mean
we'd have to watch it again but it just
it seemed like you weren't even that
excited about your own website when he
asked about it like he was like so you
have your own website yeah I do I have
subscriptions which has that now and you
have your own chat yeah you know if you
remembered switches chat used to be
pretty shitty it's much better now in
kind of the end there and like you know
why would anyone give a [ __ ] about your
website like that why not be like yeah
my website is [ __ ] awesome well I
mean like this is a pretty aimless
podcast and we have like a lot of really
interesting things to talk about and I
didn't want to hear do to come out when
you smell opportunity we don't have
opportunity with our product Carson I
don't have anything to show anybody mr.
Boone was our one trial guy and his
websites been sitting dead for like six
months like I it just looks really bad
for me to do that it's like I think it
hurts my credibility allow if I am
sitting or like hyping a product up that
is like not anywhere it's not because
it's not that there's no harbors if
there's like no benefit it's not like
it's not like people gonna have they're
going all [ __ ] destiny made that product
or whatever like when we launched this
and we go to hype it assuming we do this
right it's not gonna be because some
random [ __ ] on live stream fails
there's some random dude and rekkles
podcaster it's because I'm gonna go to
Greek and I'm gonna sell them on the
idea and whether or not I mentioned this
on a podcast has no bearing on the type
of talent or influencer that I would
pull over to the platform I like I'm not
when we do the first lunch assuming we
still do this it's not just gonna be
like oh by the way here's this random
thing that was mentioned on rekkles
podcast it's gonna be like hey here are
three or four really big influencers
that I personally know that I can sell
the product on who are gonna give a [ __ ]
whether or not I mentioned it on a
random podcast or not that's that's the
same part your fear of right now like
you know having
go wrong is that really gonna go away
once it's launched then aren't you gonna
be worried no it's not that I have like
anything going wrong with my name or
anything like that it's just the idea
that I don't like talking about a
product that is like literal vaporware
right now like that I've just not come
to with that once I have like a product
to present then it yeah I'll talk about
it all day I don't care I get that but
that's the wrong thing like that's the
reason that we have things like III or
CES all these products and like have
them become vaporware but they all do it
because this is marketing that works I
know that I guess you know if you're
uncomfortable you're uncomfortable I'm
saying don't say that it's wrong or
anything like I need I would argue aware
that that's not marketing that works oh
there's plenty of companies that have
taken a lot of flack for over-promising
and under-delivering at e3 that that's
happened time and time again I don't
think it's fair to pretend that all of
that advertising is 100% A+ it might not
all be positive absolutely I'd agree
with you on that but I mean most of it
is the majority the vast majority I
think that the public tends to forget
those sort of negatives in this context
and I feel like everybody's gonna
remember watchdogs like the before and
after for the e3 promise there's space
there are a couple games that everybody
will remember like these were horribly
over-promised and yeah but we're talking
about this in context of your project
right like do you think that oh look at
know me your brand's just like over no
I'm just saying that hurts I couldn't
really look at no man's sky that game
was arguably like destroyed by the hype
like that game wasn't you're picking
like 95% of sit there is fine well 95
percent each other nobody cares about
I'm just thinking like the big things
that I remember like
I just I feel like nothing will change
like if we were launched today and it
was working and mr. Newton was happy and
everything was good you'd still be like
listen I don't really want to hype it up
yet until I know there's not gonna be a
catastrophic failure there's no [ __ ]
way that I'm gonna go and approach
someone like Greek god or [ __ ] Tyler
one or any of these guys until I know
that there's not gonna be a [ __ ]
disaster I'm not going to attach my name
to something they could get act to
something - this is the most but this is
like maybe the most [ __ ] thing I've
ever heard you say my entire life you
think that because I don't want to
promote a product that I don't even know
if it's ever going to come to fruition
okay a product that I had a one to two
months release date on that is now
stretched over like ten plus months that
because I'm not comfortable hyping that
up on podcasts that once we have a
physical product that works that I won't
go to individual streamers who sell them
as something that I currently use how do
you think those two things are
comparable well it's not just going to
someone in private and doing it I mean
yeah if they are comfortable like you're
first off we weren't asking you like
pipe it up or just say you're a mention
that you're working on it there is
benefits that you don't see any benefit
no thank you no I don't because when we
when we have our initial launch and we
reach out to the first few streamers
it's gonna 100% come down to me selling
it not whether or not they heard me talk
about an old podcast I don't care about
random people hearing about it in the
beginning the idea should sell itself
once a couple good test case exists for
it okay which is manet which is always
what might is my consistent like
philosophy on this has been let me ask
you this do you think that you hyped up
the benefit of your website by itself
when they asked that though your your
thing right there do you think that you
got people excited about your website
when they asked about it no not really
but again I don't think that's where the
conversation was like really going so we
didn't really spend much on it why
reinforce the idea that having your
website is like it's kind of okay it's
not worth it when you have the
opportunity like yeah my [ __ ] website
is awesome I love that [ __ ] it doubles
my [ __ ] revenue why it's like what's
the problem with even saying that to at
least you know I guess I just don't
really care when in terms of launching
our product not really think of reckful
audience I just don't really care what
like the random pleb like my my
philosophy this and they all repeat the
exact same they I've always said is that
I believe that it's an idea that once
there's a product it sells itself and
then I could sell it to any major
influence they're very very easily
assuming that it's working I don't care
about like random I just I don't know I
just don't think of like reckful x'
podcast or pokies podcast as platforms
where I wanted to get like clubs excited
for it that once I have a couple
you don't care about them you care about
the random other streamers who are
smaller who might be I don't care about
them over there what why would you not
care about because because the main
selling point is gonna be having
somebody else use it successfully and
then once that happens it's over I don't
need I don't need to sell oh that point
II should sell itself
hmm I love you harken
Parkton listen I'm gonna come down to
Miami I'm gonna bring some psilocybin no
you're gonna come to the other dimension
with me okay and then everything like
make sense
all right we actually had a long
conversation me and Evan had a long
conversation but let's get into that now
because we've me I've been apparently
I've been talking with Devon for eight
hours straight on a string okay wait
we've been up so long I don't even know
if I can even I'm ridiculous even when I
get all my slow yeah hold on I need to
send you a picture of something one
second do we have an ETA on mr. moon
calm though I've been paying that [ __ ]
for a few months early twice you've been
paying for a [ __ ] domain it's like
two dollars it's like off it's like 20
bucks dude I hear you paying on an
annual basis yeah that's $40 yeah
invoice me okay Steven a desk you know
Gigi all right all right that image I
just sent you on this bird hold on oh no
it's happening hey your path of Exile
play is looking better and when it began
are you on hardcore yeah of course hey
Ian oh hi
okay what am I looking at this picture
well I want you to blow that up and tell
me if that's how much mushrooms you took
um are these dried yes I think if
they're wet that's even worse for you
know as they're wet its way way less
potent everything that I it was drilled
if these are wet that means that the
amount you would have dried would be
vol oh sure well what's your plan what
about it do you have this much [ __ ]
yes they all the guy that he bought it
for they sold him an India individual
little baggies and whatnot and reckon
even brought his autism a little skill
and everything to weigh it out yeah it's
just insane that amounts but it is but
it but I went to places that I could
have never traveled to otherwise Arkin
iv9 yeah Devin you had thoughts here I
do but I think I want to I want to save
them for like an actual official
conversation on this matter when I'm at
like eight hours of sleep I think I need
all my memes to put you go one-on-one
with destiny here well it's just a
discussion when we go one-on-one are we
gonna debate our trebs we have to have a
serious discussion about this okay all
frickin week people have been coming in
my stream and asking me about this meme
so it has to be settled
wait what has to be settled do we
disagree on something right yeah wait oh
wait what are we disagree on I'm sure um
well if I talk about it now we're gonna
get into no you know I'm just curious we
disagree on you already told the stream
what you disagreed on with me you
already know it - oh there you wouldn't
have let me do in that many in the
beginning no I definitely would not have
but you're absolutely right on that that
for what you were trying to accomplish
dreadful was absolutely happen to be the
perfect person by accident I suppose so
though I have a lot to say about that
but no more that you you still claim
that you had no spiritual experience
whatsoever and that it was it was purely
was it platonic is the right word
well like a lot yeah okay
that that's what we're gonna fight about
what it's worth dude I think I had like
50 pounds on you when I took like a lot
and I think I took like three how many
grams that like 3.5 grams there's an
aether mouse which is like a really good
like big starting dose from what I've
read yeah so
I took like seven grams and it [ __ ]
destroyed me yes seven is supposed to be
like hero and beyond like that's like
yeah I think it like it destroyed me to
the level where like I was [ __ ] for
months like having vision issues and
like it just seems to we think for me is
that you seemed like yeah I'm alright
like the next day like you asked me
after the [ __ ] next day I'm doing
that [ __ ] I wasn't [ __ ] okay I
believe you did it but when I was
actually experienced it was easily the
most traumatic and horrible experience
my entire life like I don't I don't deny
that whoo yeah
I don't know if you had this at all like
when I had my like bad trip with that
ship one of the things that happened to
me is I became aware of I think these
things my mind had suppressed the whole
time like essentially I could feel the
bones and the joints in my body so I
guess you can always feel the bones and
joints in your body but you know your
mind probably blocks it out but for me
it removed that filter so not only did I
have like this ego death [ __ ] time
lasting for everything but I felt every
bone in my body like rubbing against
each other oh my [ __ ] god that was
horrible
oh that's weird when I I didn't really
have like much feeling of my body at all
and in fact I would say was the opposite
streaming is really hard to get into
streaming will take a big toll on if you
don't make it because when you stream I
don't know if a lot of people realize
it's a number when you stream you're
literally like putting your personality
like you on on showcase right and so if
you don't make it if you're not prepared
to deal with that like what is your
thought process like wow I guess I'm
just not a good enough person I guess
I'm just [ __ ]
I guess wow I guess I'm just not the
type of person that people like you know
like yeah people it's I think it's
really hard to not be it's if you don't
make it as a streamer it's really hard
to not take that super personally you
know
no one really thinks that I think they
will always make other excuses for why
they didn't make it
well yeah but you make excuses because
of that reason you can't accept the fact
that you're not special enough to be
like a big movie star or something you
know we ever visit the UK
I can't wanted to do I was close to it
oh actually I guess I almost hit four
Dreamhack and then ice [ __ ] I just said
no because I got banned
but yeah I guess basically the question
is like you have to ask that like do I
do something that like other people want
to see like why would somebody watch me
over anybody else and if you're not able
to come up with an honest answer that
you have to be really honest when you
look at yourself you have to be really
honest and I don't think most people are
honest when they look at themselves it's
really hard to be it's a really scary
thing to like actually thing like are
there some qualities about my
personality that are actually negative
most people are not capable of doing
that this is why people get aggressive
in ways that are very confusing it's
because they're avoiding that for
instance how many times you see like a
fat person who says like instead of like
you know like oh I'm fat and kind of sex
[ __ ] they'll say like oh skinny [ __ ]
I should you know [ __ ] those little
[ __ ] you know you always turn it you
always flip it and like try to make
somebody else tear somebody else down in
order to make yourself feel better you
know I think people are really
uncomfortable accepting a negative about
themselves
you think a lot of people just expect to
make a career as Jimmy by just putting
enough time without considering others
terms actually like yeah probably to
some extent sure I know that guy he's
currently in a downward spiral I
appreciate if you could shoot him a
message
I can't I'm here to fix other people do
I don't even know if you'd listen doing
I kind of behavior helps to keep you
from depression you have it at least you
don't cancerous mindsets and it's not
the healthiest best way for you to live
your life you should be able to look at
yourself acknowledge a negative about
yourself acknowledge that it's real
either work to change it or just accept
it as a trade-off of something else and
then you move on with your life like
this is one thing that I think I do
exceedingly well I guess it goes in to
what I said earlier is that like I can I
can like process something pretty
honestly and then move on with it and I
don't I don't really engage in any type
of self delusion I think a lot of people
are deluded quite a bit when it comes to
evaluating their selves you know I think
right now if you're not hyperactive
you're not making it to the top streams
and my opinion destiny wouldn't have
made it to past 200 viewers if you
started screaming one year ago yeah it's
possible
I think that well no actually it's
highly probable because the type of cut
so the two things that I do exceedingly
well or three things that I did
exceedingly well where I could play
games at a decent level I could interact
with my community I was really good at
reading chat and playing at the same
time and my insults were usually really
clever and really funny those were like
so like if you're watching the the pros
is that you're watching me play a game
like Starcraft that I'm genuinely very
good at and even if I lose games it's
funny because I can like talk shut the
entire time but I can't do that as much
anymore it's really [ __ ] hard
I've lost a huge part of my content
because I absolutely [ __ ] cut
twitches in terms of how they regulate
using their terms of service
it's actually like a really big part
like the first like eighteen years of my
life more than that went into developing
kind of kind of like my repertoire of
like in salt-based humour and twitch
totally [ __ ] new to that insanely new
fad
however Lake and I don't like to talk
[ __ ] to new streamers because these
chambers are as a Spain is [ __ ] like to
any new streamer that would because I
know they get like really cry like oh
well you only made it because you
started streaming away back then you
know like like I'm sorry dude but you
have trouble setting up OBS to work with
your streams you would have never made
it in my era there were no forums for
help there were no sub reddits to get
feedback from like you would have died
okay if you tried to stream in the air
that I did you would have you would have
quit immediately as soon as I showed you
the program as soon as I open up the
flash media live encoder interface you
would say oh [ __ ] this I'm done back to
college so I mean like yeah I don't know
[Music]
so yeah I mean there are trade-offs to
everything it's probably a lot harder
now because it's more saturated but the
amount of work you have to do to get
your foot in the door is a lot less -
but yeah they're always trade-offs
yeah you can just stream right from your
[ __ ] Playstation oh damn
Wow nice jab muna
what's a father you have that you just
accept and move on I mean about what I
think I have a really good image of
myself I mean like I understand I think
I understand most things about myself
and I think I understand generally how
people view me I would like obsessively
read content online about me so I have a
pretty good thought I know the people
that like me I think I know why they
like me and the people that don't like
me I think I know why they don't like me
yeah I think I have a pretty good image
of myself
do you dislike most people like just the
people you meet um dislike is a strange
word I mean I can be friendly with
anybody but I probably wouldn't make
friends I don't make friends with
anybody okay I guess
can you describe in your words what you
imagine the opinions of people who don't
like yo I mean I can just quote them oh
man do I like people in general I don't
like people I think that people are very
flawed in general but I'm obviously
because I have a huge ego it's very hard
for me to pick out because I have a very
strange mix of like on one hand I'm
insanely egotistical and narcissistic
but on another hand I'm like I'm pretty
humble as dumb as that sounds my
personality isn't humble but in terms of
like recognizing how lucky I am to be
where I'm at and then recognizing the
advantages I have growing up I think I'm
pretty humble in those regards but
balancing that out sometimes it's very
difficult
how can people like necessary their
online criticisms and not have the
self-awareness you do when people are
talking with Sperry hard to listen
typically used her she talking somebody
that brain instantly goes into like
defensive mode and you're never going to
get through to them I think I'm just
used to it I think I don't care like the
like the very weird part the very hard
part that I've had to deal with over the
past this is like over like the past two
or three years it's really getting to
the political debate stuff is that I
have a lot of really I have a lot of
qualities that seem really good but
that's only because they stem from very
antisocial positions and I never
explained the antisocial part of them
before but it's something that I have to
I've been trying to keep it in mind more
as I like interact with more people and
see how people who process emotions and
everything I saw like for instance like
I say things like so here's something
that would have said like two or three
years ago like I can read online hate
and it doesn't really bother me you know
I don't really care people are saying
mean things about me that's fine that's
their opinion you know it's whatever
like I say that and that's true but the
reason why it's true is because I don't
respect anybody like I don't have
anybody like when you asked me like who
would I want to meet I don't want to
meet anybody I don't look up to anybody
I don't idolize anybody I don't have
like a hero or people that I look up to
you and I think are super or whatever I
think that doesn't exist for me so when
I see people shit-talking you online all
I see is somebody that's like such a
[ __ ] loser that they have this whole
backstory this fictional war written
about me that they have to rush home
from their shitty like school or
shooting job to like obsess over my life
like why would I ever care was such a
hopeless degenerate would type about me
on the Internet
you know like it's fun to poke and prod
at these people and make them mad but at
times like being genuinely bothered I'm
gonna ever be genuinely bothered by
somebody that's so much worse than me in
so many different ways right that's the
underlying thought process so the
underlying thought process is like
pretty antisocial I think so so yeah
like I have to like I have to be careful
to balance out like I don't know if it's
possible to not care what anybody says
unless you're that unless you have like
a mindset that's like that mean towards
other people so yeah senator I've had to
be like really careful about how I do
people you know you say that as if you
never criticize anyone else does I mean
you read agenda human being only lips we
should have talked people on Twitter
I never so I'm not talking about just
[ __ ] talking people the things that I
generally point out as being really
cancerous or things that I don't take
part in and that is the drama forums and
like the meta subreddits I've always
been consistent on this that these are
cancer things so for instance boards
like Kiwi farms or it's like pretty ugly
little liars these places we like take a
person and you just like you obsess over
them and you find out all the details
about them and you talk about how much
you hate them and all the things they
need to change about those away these
things I would never take part of this
is um this is insane to me like I could
never imagine being so hopeless or so
void of stuff in my own life that I'd
have to take such an interest of
somebody else's life but then again I've
never had like an idol or anybody that I
looked up to before so maybe it would
feel differently if I if I had that
maybe I could draw like more of a
comparable experience the reddit
equivalent to these are places like
subreddit drama [ __ ] reddit says kind of
live stream fails a little bit recent
but like meta subs circlebroke medicines
cancer it's basically any time you have
a sub where people can go and like just
[ __ ] talk other people and then obsess
over that like I don't know what dude
did you ever look up to anyone you're a
child yeah but they were all fake people
like cloud or Hiro Yui and Gundam Wing
or snake and metal gets a little green
the whole world loves to gossip no one
is exempt tonight yeah but there's a
difference between gossiping and what
some people get involved with like I
guess like um yeah people like Paul and
QE farms are filled with horrible people
so here's an example right DSP is like
these peas funds to laugh at because God
dam is he do a lot of [ __ ] [ __ ]
[ __ ] so like if I see like a video like
an excerpt of DSP whatever I'll probably
watch it and laugh but if you see like
with like the sons of Koji and what
people do like the forums where people
obsess about every aspect if these B's
really trying to prove he has a good
girlfriend or like getting into like
though this is the picture now it's like
that [ __ ] gets really [ __ ] sad I
don't know it just seems like really
those like and DSP is a really dedicated
hate group of people and yeah I don't
know
wasn't the JAF past court digging a
borderline cross stepping hearing so
I'll say this again I've said this like
a million times
the thing that bothered me about the the
JAF stuff I would have never gone into
the gist of this what he just brought it
up it probably would have been on car I
was already borderline like not wanting
anything to be posted and there are
people that message me voluntary more
information but um I don't know what you
think separate a trauma is but as I see
here so but even more left-wing December
the drama is super elitist those people
get really [ __ ] crazy I don't know I
don't like the meta drama shut is like
really cancerous um the thing that
bothered me about the jam suck was that
he kept bringing it up there like to a
three different occasions right kept
bringing it up and every time so he
brought it up instead of being like yeah
that was kind of [ __ ] up I shouldn't
have done that or yeah you know whatever
I made a mistake I want to talk about it
it was like constant affirmation and
defensively did and then the proving
that he did nothing wrong
and the fact that like he I don't know
that really bothered me also the fact
that um the fact that um wait [ __ ] what
I'm reading so many chance right now def
not economy thanks at your force
everybody al every do you can watch the
bud I keep reading a question went on
them at all the same and I need to stop
doing that oh yeah J yeah the jam show
yeah just the fact they keep spinning
and the fact that it's probably gonna
happen again
like when you're on the internet for
this long and variably you'll find a
girl that likes you and you'll probably
try to like blur someone else in and man
like the thought of a child being born
into that situation is so [ __ ] up and
is so sad for the child like could you
imagine if Jacob like actually managed
to knock up the chick that he raped like
holy [ __ ] how much of a [ __ ] up life
do you have yeah I don't know I did that
[ __ ] is like really [ __ ] it I don't know
oh my god
yikes
I'm sorry what I mean beyond the
internet I mean like be like a
semi-public or whatever what do you
think about the autism on Twitter from
big profile people [ __ ] talking jumping
stuff really I haven't seen that I guess
it's possible but
don't you look forward to improving
yourself and becoming the person you
want to be and I sense isn't that kind
of same as looking after someone except
you're just looking for the person
you're hoping to be yeah but if he's not
egotistical no
a lot of the people should celebrating
his death seem to be salty about the
gamergate stuff wasn't he like hated by
both sides
didn't he say enough things that anti
gamergaters thought that he was a
gamergate ER and they hated him but he
also like disavowed gamergate and was
pretty progressive on a lot of issues a
lot of gamergaters hated him I think
both sides hated him quite a bit no well
I gotta be really careful on misquote
him especially if he's dev it's like
really shitty if somebody if somebody
miss character has an argument I made
off him that I would probably come back
from the [ __ ] grave holy [ __ ]
[Music]
destiny can you reference a debate topic
before the debate well he made a
reaction video to Joyner Lucas's song
and then I made a reaction to him its
reaction because I heard his reaction in
it it bothered me a little bit not gonna
lie just to by me just a little bit
what's going on everything is good man
hey I was just coming to the chat as he
was going on like what was the issue
with the video that I did the reaction
that did say that video the Joyner Lucas
I'm not racist well [ __ ] I don't know I
did a whole this whole video on it
do you remember specifically I mean you
were just like oh no the general just a
gap was like Uncle Tom or something Reem
you had like extreme criticisms to levy
towards like I guess what would be the
progressive black American viewpoint
presented of the video I don't know if I
could he's better educators there yeah I
mean I'm conservative I think the colour
is a relative thing of a person who took
your services I'm not gonna agree with
progressive stuff just because I'm black
I'm going to agree with conservative
points cuz I'm conservative maybe
wouldn't that make sense
I mean depending on the points yeah sure
so I mean what point should I not agree
with
should I not agree with people maybe no
take a little bit of time before to have
a baby not just having kids willy-nilly
should I not agree with being
responsible for your own actions and not
blame with somebody else
why shouldn't I agree with that I mean I
think it kind of depends on the lens
through which you view it in in terms of
like I guess like this is something that
bothers me if you want we can actually
go through the video I guess
specifically so we know exactly what I
said well you said um but but just kind
of like talking about that point because
this is probably gonna be like the
fundamental root of most of our
disagreement the idea that like you have
responsibility for your own actions that
statement really bothers me depending on
who's saying it I mean like to some
extent I mean we kind of have
responsibility of our actions but we
can't really pretend that everybody has
the same opportunities or
the same even like decision-making
faculty as everybody else in the country
when if somebody grows up in like a
middle-class family goes to a really
nice school you know and is making all
of these good life decisions versus
somebody that literally grows up like in
a single-parent household and isn't a
like really [ __ ] neighborhood does it
bother you if I use like the f-word or
anything would you prefer me not to
write I mean you can do whatever you
want it's all good okay yeah like like
when people live in like these much more
despondent kind of situations it bothers
me a little bit when I hear people for
much better off places saying things
like Oh like you know you just got to
make better choices like that really
bothers me just for the record if I ever
say anything that you disagree with or
if you feel like I'm unfairly
characterizing your argument or if I'm
like talking too much you can interrupt
me at any time all right I don't it
won't bother me oh no doubt okay so my
situation I grew up in a single-parent
household in the hood but I was always
able to make my own decisions it wasn't
like okay because we live in this area
I'm in a single-parent household we
don't have any money that I have to be
some kind of victim and I think that too
many of us just hold on to that we hold
on to the people saying oh because you
grew up in the Bay Area you grew up with
no money that you have carte blanche to
just do whatever you want right Society
I don't buy into that which is why I
speak the way I speak because there is
no excuse if I made it you can too I
know a lot of guys that's in jail a lot
of guys I grew up with they made bad
decisions and lot of them say they look
up to me guys was even older than me say
they they look up to me they wish that
they would have done the things I did
nobody says oh it wasn't my fault on
this day in the third people that I know
who grow just like me who end up in bad
situations regret what they did in which
would have made my choices so that's why
I speak to ass beat does that make any
sense I mean yeah it totally makes sense
I'm I don't know house I mean our
backgrounds are probably very dissimilar
but I share some similarities and that
my living situation was very very very
bad before I got into streaming and
everything but I think the difference is
that like I think it's important to
recognize that sometimes you can be an
exceptional story and that you shouldn't
necessarily think it's realistic to
expect everybody to to to rise above
their circumstances so to speak so like
you know before night why not what can I
expect a I'm not saying everybody's
going to be able to achieve you but
it has mean I can't expect he wine I
expect the best out of people I mean you
can try to expect the best out of people
but at the end of the day we have to be
realistic about what people can do and
like we have so much data in terms of if
you're born into a certain family the
likeliness that you'll attend college
the likeliness that you'll have a child
out of wedlock like all of these things
can be massively predicted like at the
moment of a person's birth and I think
it hurts us as a society to pretend that
we can just expect everybody to overcome
their circumstances and make amazing
things out of their lives because I
don't think that's like ever worked in
the history of all of mankind like it's
just a function go ahead so do you just
give up and say well since I was born in
a situation I'm not going to be able to
make it should you not actually try to
do anything for you so should there be
no expectation of you being able to
break that chain and then when you have
a family of your own you'll be able to
live better than you live growing up no
I mean I totally like if I was talking
to an individual or an absolute or even
talking to people I got act to
absolutely say that like you should
always try to rise above you should try
to don't be a victim try to accomplish
as much as you can
life is gonna hand you lemons sometimes
do what you can with it but
realistically if I'm talking about
there's the difference between like this
is a message that I would send to an
individual versus enacting policy for
the country if we're talking about like
policy for the country what we have to
do is you have to create environments
that allow people to succeed not keep
them in [ __ ] environments and then
expect them to rise above because people
in general don't do that well what kind
of policy would you have that would
allow somebody to make proper choices
for themselves I mean I don't understand
because lot of this stuff just really
boils down to choices what kind of
policy would you implement that way
helping there go um I mean we could go
through a number I mean think things
like access to birth control for poor
people I think that should be like a
given like that should be state-funded
100% free for any birth control now we
say birth control what do you mean
explain because maybe the pill for women
which which carries other medical
benefits or even condoms for men okay I
mean condoms those are free right now
our free clinics the two I'm not really
sure about how much the pill costs but I
think it's is it like 20 bucks for like
a box of condoms they can be cost
prohibitive I mean not really
you know it depends on how many you get
if you get in like a boat pack maybe it
costs that much regardless you can still
get on for free like at the local clinic
it's not something that is cost
prohibitive you can get them for free
many times but is that the only thing
you think is birth control as far as
that pill and condoms or do you include
abortion um I mean you could include
abortion if you want sure as well well I
don't include abortion I was just asking
you because abortion is not birth
control because if you're killing a baby
you're not you're not controlling birth
you're just terminating birth you're
just presenting birth from happening of
a developing baby sure I don't
necessarily disagree with that I'm
actually ethically pro-life I actually
actually very strongly share that point
of view but the fact is that right now
in the United States wealthier people
tend have access to abortion moreso than
poor people so it's not really like an
even playing field whether or not you
think it's right or wrong if you're
wealthy it's much easier for you to get
an abortion that it is if you're not
wealthy right you're more likely to
carry a baby to term and give birth to
somebody in a [ __ ] up environment than
a wealthier person that could just say
I'll [ __ ] it and I go to a clinic and
get an abortion right well I don't think
abortion is something that anybody
should be doing virtual poor so the even
playing field
you know that's not really the thing and
then as far as they being like a poverty
thing I'm not really sure how that makes
any sense because in New York City and
the year 2012 at least that's the year I
have the data on it I'm not really sure
if it's a year-to-year consistent thing
but in 2012 in New York City more black
babies were aborted than were actually
born by margin than 6005 for injury so I
don't think they have a problem with
getting access to abortion well just
because more black babies were aborted
and born doesn't necessarily mean that
it disproves the idea that poor people
have worse access to abortion than
wealthier people do because there might
just be a lot of white babies being born
those numbers don't necessarily prove
that and also no no no no when I say it
more I say it more black babies were so
you have more black babies of border
than we're actually boring I don't mean
there were more you know it's I'm
talking about black versus black so you
talking about 18,500 jury live
prior to me 18,000 abortions a 2500
abortions versus 12 thousand left bursts
okay that are all better black in New
York City and that same pattern can be
seen all around the country that have
been twenty million black babies that
have been aborted since 1973 Brophy way
and we're only about 36 million total in
the United States our population should
be about 25 or 30 percent higher so I
think that abortion is the thing that we
most certainly have easy access to too
much
you know you don't necessarily know that
because you can't tell me how many poor
black people wanted to get an abortion
but couldn't just because there were a
lot doesn't mean that could've been more
and this could also mean proposition
it'd be more I mean there's already more
than that's actually being born so how
many more can you actually do I mean
we're already in a raid so how many more
could he get in the in the United States
I would argue that is if I mean because
right now we have decided or the supreme
court has decided that abortion is
something that you should be able to
pursue if you want to get an abortion
you should be able to get one so how
many more should there be it's however
many more people would have wanted to
get one but couldn't have afforded to
otherwise I mean what if it's to the
point where all the black people day but
what if it's to the point where
everybody poor just give wiped away
there's there's no more black people
because we all abort the babies like
right now the birth rate in the black
community is one point a three which is
below the replacement of two point one
it's even worse of white Americans yeah
why does he yeah white is lower than
black at that point but I mean like what
my goal would be or the idea would be
that I don't think that black people
don't ever want to have babies I think
that what happens is poor people tend to
get babies earlier than non poor people
for a variety of reasons and more black
people tend to be poor as a percentage
than white people so my guess would be
that as you fix problems in black
communities and poor communities and
they become less impoverished and more
joining the middle class and whatnot
they would probably have children at
similar rates than white people which
ironically I guess is less than they are
now but at least they would be in like
fixed homes okay so but now what thing
well we're just on that particular thing
and then if you wanted to say something
else like this could all this also kind
of points to a problem in contraception
as well if that many abortions are
happening it seems like there isn't this
ease of access to contraception as you
kind of made us on earlier right I do I
could be wrong but I don't imagine that
black women enjoy getting abortions I
mean it could be a pretty rough process
on your body so it sounds like there is
some issue here and getting
contraceptives when you're these types
of people no not really because like I
say a lot of times you can get it for
free I mean you go to these free clinics
or whatever they're available for free
condoms it is people just don't like
using them that's the problem a lot of
reckless behavior and a lot of the
reckless behavior is done because people
know that it has backups number one they
can kill the baby number two if they
have the actual baby then they're able
to get money for it okay
you have heard people in media cages and
say they've had a baby for the specific
purpose of being able to get a shake so
without getting into the anecdotal stuff
I would be shocked if there were women
that had this thought process where it's
like oh well you know if I get pregnant
you know whatever I could just get an
abortion
I feel like more women would prefer to
not get pregnant in the first place
that's something like contraceptive
access would be something that women
would prefer over well if I get knocked
up I can just go get an abortion an
abortion is more painful more taxing on
your body more expensive than than birth
control I mean that's the risk they take
I mean like they're taking the risk they
feel like yeah but this is my problem
they take the risk but their risk is
different than white people taking the
risk because if you take the risk in a
middle-class family you can get an
abortion you've got millions of ways to
get contraception you've got other
things to do besides sex I think that
I've proven the point that we don't have
a problem with having access to abortion
in the black community because if you
have more black babies that are aborted
in born obviously there's not a problem
with being able to access abortion no
that's a non-sequitur that's not true at
all what if 10 million more women wanted
to have abortions but couldn't get it
you don't have those numbers just
because there's a lot of abortions
doesn't mean that everybody that wanted
to get an abortion he's got one I think
I proved my point because if you have
more that are aborted than born I mean
come on it doesn't make any sense to say
Dayo there's not enough access to it how
can you say that when there's more
aborted and boring because it's possible
that there's more conceived than wants
to be conceived that's the problem is
that more babies we can conceive than
what they want just because more being
aborted than born doesn't necessarily
mean that and as many people that want
abortions are getting them there could
be more it I think I proved him I think
our proof in my point on that we should
move on to the next thing now I just
want to know like what was the what was
a major issue because the video I felt
like you really wanted watching that you
appeal and let League of Legends you
weren't really watching the video so I'm
just trying to figure out like what was
your core issue Whitty were you just
trying to get some kind saying like
what's going on no [ __ ] I would have to
I don't remember completely cuz this is
a long this is like months ago that it
wasn't this time if you want I can kind
of like speed through and listen to some
of your videos and like point put pick
out the points if you want me to do that
run for it okay all right hold on real
quick our attention in a visual Beauty
time so I gotta give you guys
last metal okay we'll think about this
in BOM term no black box it was each
other right guys it's one o things
manages let's just play this I mean to
be I mean you want a video you're not a
ghost
okay so okay so the first thing I guess
we can talk about is slavery yes you are
I'm okay I don't want this might be
incredibly rude how old are you or if
you don't mind answering or if you don't
want to so you don't have to 33 you're
33 okay so you you probably have like a
grandparent literally maybe even a
parent who was told they couldn't get a
loan from a bank or couldn't buy a
certain type of house because of
official like u.s. sanctioned policies
like prior to the 1964 Civil Rights Act
right do you agree that that they're
like actual policies at banks like
things like redlining where they would
literally say we do not loan to Black's
no that was based on credit my people
didn't have that problem
wait so you're telling me that you don't
believe in the 50s and 60s that people
were specifically discriminated against
because of skin color you think it was
all based on credit it was based on
credit and I'm gonna tell you why you
see see I'm a black person now Bruce ago
I bet back to slavery and I can tell you
where my people went through now I was
born in a place called Rand West
Virginia 95 percent white state my
grandmother was CT KKK in person it
never hurt her anything matter if a they
would bring toys and food down to the
black community in Christmastime and
also I think on the Fourth Way diesel in
general the KKK was not as bad to black
people as people make it out to be
no Alec and suicune is what my
grandmother told me I don't know about
how they were in other places when in
West Virginia well my grandmother was
growing up in the 30s they never hurt
anybody black they actually were pretty
generous that's just what she said now
in other places of course is not the
case but for my people that's what it
was but moving right along from net my
great-grandfather on my mother's side
own land and two houses back in the 40s
and 50s and the two houses still stands
Tuesday in West Virginia now how was he
able to do that if it was this whole big
thing or you can't get money you can't
get a loan all this day and a third how
is he able to own land my father owned
land in West Virginia and West Virginia
oh this is this is the worst place of
black people how's that possible
see you've been told a thing a lot of
times from your liberal teachers it's
not it's not even your fault man because
you just don't understand you've been
told things that are not really true
you've been so certain stories that have
been exaggerated it's like when the
story gets so and passed down from
person to person it becomes an entirely
new story it becomes exaggerated to
prove a point that is not true the black
community was much better off before the
1960s I mean I can prove it I could tell
you some numbers if you want them well
the only numbers you're gonna give me
debate days honey gonna bathe this guy
but he's probably gonna [ __ ] come on
and screamin or something all of you
guys are white and I'll take you guys
are giving me good advice
all right we do you my buddy hey how's
it going destiny way don't what do you
want
I just want to talk to you about himself
since I'm a black and so and I think
there's a lot of people especially some
of the people I was talking to in a
discord that have a lot of they
understand and seldom at all
so just want to talk to you okay we'll
wait I mean what do you want to talk
about what do you want us to understand
I want you guys to understand number one
not all in cells are terrorists not all
in cells are evil some of those are nice
guys that due to unfortunate
circumstances just can't get laid
and within seven people told me that
looking at you you're a short guy Dustin
you can get laid but how much money do
you make a year
I mean in a sentiment boy exactly you
make a decent amount of money I mean I
got laid in high school I was pretty
[ __ ] then no how how how think about
it you have apps like tinder now women
can go did a have tinder around when you
were in high school
uh-huh all right no they didn't exactly
so now woman can go on tinder get at
least a hundred matches a day and she
gets to choose between the best-looking
guys in her City so do you think little
Steve would have gotten a woman when he
was in high school and gender was around
yeah for sure the girls that I [ __ ]
wouldn't be going on tinder I don't
think most women go on tinder you know
take most women go until their job
Abdeen no women you know right how I
mean you're kind of older argument I
mean oh no no let's take of the numbers
how are you 29 I'm 24
most one then I know most women around
where I live hey Sabrina half a million
women using tinder right now that's a
lot [ __ ] women I mean it's over like
165 million women in the US I don't know
how many are too old or too young or you
see them to start how many are saying
how many women you have on there they
are married how many women you have on
their dad fiancees that are obviously
lying that drizzling at the video from
tinder family from tinder there's 3.5
million women that's I don't know some
screening off an article I imagine they
have these numbers but it's not just
like self-reported I'm sure yeah but a
lot of a lot of women have tinder
accounts or tinder profiles to have
husbands that are obviously not gonna
say yeah I have a tender conquer
well no I think they get these numbers
from tended itself oh just the number of
users dirt and [ __ ] yeah
like month active monthly accounts or
not well I think the numbers a lot
higher but let's just say 3.5 million
that's so a lot of that's still a lot
women and you still have to include
sites like okay
OkCupid bumble they're really ghetto
site honey a fish there's a [ __ ] ton of
data in apps out there
I mean tenders just use more primarily
for I guess hookups OkCupid it's more
for I don't know people your age but
yeah there's a lot of women that are
using dating apps and that's going to
skew the playing field a lot heavier
because I can't if I go up to a woman
[ __ ] in five for 180 pounds black I
was discussing this earlier on your
discord I got the [ __ ] cops called on
me just for approaching a woman that
[ __ ] [ __ ] sucks
I I mean sure
what what is your solution what do you
want to do about it
well I think if we look at the Dayton
stats the Dayton preference debts
OkCupid did a study I think we just have
to be aware that white men do have a
unfair playing field when it comes to
online dating if you look at white man
and the percentages of women that are
applying a white man is a lot higher
than an Indian man Hispanic man any
other race and a good stat as well to
think about this is that forty five
percent of Asian women cohabitate we're
European men as opposed to forty three
percent of Asian women that cohabitate
what Asian men so we live in a white
supremacist Society
what are you whether you like it or not
these are just the facts that I'm stated
okay so wait so what am I supposed to do
or what what do we what do we do about
it well I'm reaching out to you that's
why I wanted to reach out to you right I
don't know why did you want to reach out
to me what are we i wanted to state the
facts okay how how dude how do those
facts make you feel doesn't make you
feel more sympathetic towards me as an
individual I don't know what am I
supposed to feel I don't know what I'm
supposed to do I can't make people [ __ ]
you like I'm not sure what like my stay
sane
you can tell woman if you do see a woman
perhaps perhaps if you do see a woman
you can inform her hey no I mean you
don't have to be that blunt with it you
can just be like hey I see that you only
been dating six feet for tall white guys
that look like they're from The Bachelor
or whatever TV show that is have you
ever thought about maybe introduce them
to a black friend be like hey Jerome
here he's a very nice guy do you think
it every single like four out of ten
girl is dating like a nine out of ten
guy no here's the thing
so women not use these apps like tinder
OkCupid uh-huh
the thing is that they get [ __ ] by DC
but they get [ __ ] by men they're like
a tight ends nine tight ends so that
gives them the unreasonable expectation
that they can essentially these are the
guys that are going they're going to
settle with essentially but when these
guys don't come around and these guys
essentially settle with higher class
women Stacy's is what we refer to as
like eeeh ten nine eight ten women these
fat women these ethnic women or whatever
they usually end up settling with men at
a later date when their posts wall in
their 40s and a dirty
so I'm probably I'm probably gonna get
mine but right now I am suffering Hamden
I'm just staying faxed Oh
did that clear up any misconceptions yet
about the cells or they think still
think we're pieces of [ __ ] I mean I
don't know what the rest of your views
are is it possible you're a piece of
[ __ ] I don't I don't know well I never
hurt women I never I never yelled at a
woman before someone said I drew acid
I draw acid at women like what the [ __ ]
know I know where to get acid like I
would never do that to a woman I was
raised by saying I was raised by single
mother she raised three of us by herself
that [ __ ] [ __ ] sucks a lot of people
will say hey you being from a single mom
that's the reason why you're not
masculine that's the reason why you
can't talk to women because we're scared
of it
bad people say that to me it's not
downstairs that women don't like me if
you call the cops on me you're probably
scared of me right not the other way no
I'm going up to you asking you how your
day is and you're calling the cops
you're scared of me I'm not scared of
you I go on tinder right mm-hmm so if
we're saying tenders the problem the
solution is to go on tinder as well
I get what six matches in a year you
only got seconds in a whole year
Italy reply to you that's a [ __ ] up
[ __ ]
there's no way you only get six matches
in a year I bet is redic I really wish I
was [ __ ]
I really did maybe your profile is just
really bad I mean that's a possibility I
try like different yeah I think you need
to try something different
cuz I've got like over a hundred online
and I don't put anything in mind your
[ __ ] destiny do you know what I don't
put that on my [ __ ] tinder profile
your destiny though yeah but nobody
knows that in my inner for a while you
don't have you'll have like pictures of
you and your stream and sure no I've got
like a picture of me and like my little
[ __ ] dress shirt I think it picture
me as a baby yes babe yeah that's kind
of creepy
I'm an adorable baby alright but if
you're only getting soft patches in a
year I feel like maybe my ABS [ __ ] of me
i Reese I like reset
so yeah I'm pretty much stuck
and it was your advice mr. Vyse as a
white male history replace I don't know
dude you try and make yourself interact
you anything you go to school you go to
work or anything yeah I work I don't go
to school out the moment going back
girls into our friend or not or old like
really like corporate office and all
like so they have kids I'm trying like
once I go back to school in the fall
that's when I'm trying to really get
taken in a lot of the advice people have
been giving me because I've been doing
interviews and had people on my podcast
so I've been trying to take that advice
and kind of see where I can go with it
because I mean there's a couple months
ago where I really was about to [ __ ]
give up you know like I was about a
[ __ ] brother
I mean it sounds like you kind of just
need to work on yourself know and then
the dating will kind of like follow
naturally from that I don't think yeah I
know like what the goal to like start
dating can be kind of
be like in a good position at your own
life is probably gonna run like a Q&A
it's like you say this phrase I'm
probably getting answer it with okay you
tell me that got work on yourself yadda
yadda but I I went to the gym got down
to like eight percent body fat
approached woman join javis getting good
grades after a couple months of that and
after the get in the cops called on me
incident that's when I pretty much
[ __ ] lost it why do you picture
yourself at 8% body fat I mean I really
don't want to I don't want to get dogs
that's doesn't knock throughout our
docks you do I don't want I don't want
that information out there especially if
I'm classifying myself as an insult and
people think I'm a terrorist rone acid
off of it I'll take that smart of me job
picture out there have a job dude I mean
let me I can pee in
I really set information I can I mean
like it's not just like looking good
like there are other things that go into
being attractive as well
right like yeah I'm not I'm not like a
creepy guy no gods women like one day
when I got two cops caught on me it's
not like I went up to the woman and was
like hey girl you want to look like you
know like I did not sound anything like
that was just like hey how you doing
how's your day going
and she just gave me the stink face and
I pretty much just walked away and then
five minutes later the campus security
was like hey are you sexually are you
harassing
so I'm not creepy about it I'm not I
don't know what it is
honestly like I said I think those
Dayton statistics that I stated earlier
about the Dayton preferences and Asian
women cohabitated more and with white
man I think as a black man if you're not
if you're not an NFL player if you're
not like a rapper
you're not like a young tug or 50 cent
by people like Ben Carson you're not
celebrated in our community you're not
they're not put on a pedestal plastic
sex simple and childish can be you know
like he's like the one token nerdy
black-eyed up white boy they want to
[ __ ] but yeah and then it's like burnt
word we're all brothers like us actually
I'm talking intelligent complete [ __ ]
can't talk that talk intelligently that
care about presenting myself and a lone
man in a deck trying to get good grades
I tried to do good in the society but
still at the end of the day they want a
NFL player they want someone debts I
don't know it's just I mean I feel like
there are lots of girls that don't just
want to date like NFL players my dude
but I mean if you go on tinder where
people are they're explicitly just to
hook up and they've got access to a lot
of people I mean that's not gonna be
like the best place to find a chick no
yeah I mean I haven't only gone on
tinder - I got on OkCupid as well try to
get dates but that pretty much ended up
I had no luck on that either
on behind the oven that's pretty much my
life as a black as black man since so
what are you different fun like what
your hobbies try work out I was here
five days a week I'm going back to
school in the fall finish up my degree
like to read okay let's say that we sat
at a table and I had to ask you to tell
me as much as you could about one topic
and you were confident that you'd like
know more about that topic than like
anybody else in a restaurant what would
that topic that he would talk to me
about probably talk to you about
probably popped me in politics maybe I
try State Politics working out just
music in general as a genre like the
politics in working out doesn't seem
like stuff that a lot of girls would be
interested in no well why are women
naturally interested in besides like
Netflix and and traveling I mean try
acting
I mean traveling about places I've been
places they want to go things I like in
places when they travel I don't know
it's the right thing I mean music or art
things if you if you're into any of that
can be a good point of conversation okay
I don't know you have to like make
yourself interesting right you're your
own hype most women aren't interested
well then why do you even want to do
anything with anyone shouldn't you be
mgtow then instead if most women are
boring to you why why do you even care
of you with a woman then I mean I want
to lose my virginity I mean honestly I
made essentially a goal with myself if I
don't get laid by the time I'm dirty I'm
probably just gonna get a prostitute why
does why do you care so much about like
losing your virginity why is it so
important I just want that experience
I mean it's easy it's easy is easy for
you to stay since you [ __ ] since you
have sex it's like it's like going to
Africa seeing something
some African child very dehydrated I
feel like life you're you're sipping on
the bottom of the water you're like bro
why why do you care so much about
drinking water well I don't know tell
you wouldn't just like get a prostitute
earlier then or an escort or whatever
well I wanted so okay so you're telling
me I got a try but now you're telling me
well why not not try and just get the
prostitute so which should I keep on
mainly the sex happens as a result of
like other things like organic things so
you make yourself an interesting person
you meet a woman that shows interested
you and then eventually you have sex but
if your goal is literally you just want
to [ __ ] somebody and that's like you're
single like gold that's like the most
important thing that is get an escort or
never ending him past all the other bulb
shatters yeah I want I want a
relationship with someone interest to
that some point of advice but I I do
feel like that's very hard fine well I
mean special sound like men you sound
like all the women you're describing
like they only want to [ __ ] like really
hot Chad's ever they sound like women
that you wouldn't want to be in a
relationship with anyway so like why not
yeah I would I wouldn't
honestly have one I'm just stating
there's a reason why these one
the first places yeah but this isn't
every woman you're literally like
selecting for women going on tinder
hook-up like of course these ones
they're gonna be more into looking for
certain guys they want to hook up with
and other types of women like so you
think just so you just think your
average girl next door isn't going what
you want the best-looking guy either
I mean best-looking means a lot of
things to different people not everyone
that's like a shredder dude of course
not yeah best best best looking isn't
five four black guy can be there it
doesn't like short guys I like skinny
guys you're gonna like fat guys or what
like there's women like a ton of
different [ __ ] I don't think a woman
wants a five-foot-two janitor Indian
janitor hey bald in India I'll take any
woman as yeah yeah well I mean at that
point now you're starting to like stack
on like the negative traits like five to
all you're getting like really far
removed from the norm here I mean what
you want to say is like missing an arm
too but I mean like I mean if you're a
woman
any any attribute that you have to
fetishize
so if you can be like really fat woman
you guys will find that to be a fetish
you can be a [ __ ] guys this is a
worthless conference you can be in will
probably you are stuck in me
right outside we repeat that last thing
where we saying I said there's probably
this evening morning out there because
every negative attribution that a woman
has can be fetishized the same cannot be
said for that
what do you mean I think there's a much
wider scope of like acceptable appearing
men there are four acceptable apparent
women you think there's uh to give me
example sure like men can come in all
shapes and sizes whereas fat women are
almost universally frowned upon no have
you heard the that acceptance lift yeah
but you don't see that [ __ ] on like the
digging Sam I mean let's leave we can
compare like if you want to look like
Hollywood actors like we can find plenty
of Hollywood actors that are men that
are overweight it's really hard these
are Hollywood actors yeah but I'm saying
like you can find these are men to have
status these are men to have okay but
like even fat even women with status
that are fat aren't gonna be like sex
symbol they're things that people want
to for five Adele Adele like the fact
that Adele was like who you have to
point to is she even like huge isn't she
just like kind of a chubber
I don't remember what she looks like
Susan who's that Susan Boyles
like the really disgusted look and she's
a she but she's not a sex symbol she's
like 15 years old she was ironically
made into a sex symbol
no she wasn't where are you serious
have you missed have you not seen the
amount of people that are like yeah I
would [ __ ] like how would I ever not I
guess I just miss sound like ironic
though and there's guys that would
actually
are you already get internet right now
yeah look up the pig the pig women
experiment I'll do it later okay okay
it's not it's not late some blue waffle
it's just like it was pretty interesting
yeah just really nasty looking woman now
I would say she's about 250 like hairy
chest obviously made to look a lot nicer
than she is real life and they gave her
like a pig snout and essentially they
gave this a profile OkCupid just to see
how hollow or men's standard and yes we
got a lot of myths and she got a lot of
interest from men that wanted the [ __ ]
I mean mental I mean men will typically
[ __ ] down like wool fluffed women they
wouldn't want to date I mean I know it's
kind of different but you tell them but
you're telling you just said that that
Okay, listening to everybody talking about ban, yes, it was actually incredibly fucking triggering because holy fucking shit
I'm think that like eighty percent of what we said
We're just blatantly false. And then the other fifteen percent of likely related vices trigger the fuck out of me
I'll try to cover
I'll try to cover all the bases here. Okay, so
Let's get the first meme out of the way
Okay, so why was a band so I don't know what the actual reason for my band was
In terms of what wait more I was given two reasons for our was band
The first thing was because I called the one dude a bad word
I said the f am I I didn't even know if I'm allowed to say without getting banned on twitch on another fuckin platform
But I said that I said the F word and called him a retard or ever
Apparently that was bad
But they also clip the thing where I said when I was talking to my mom as like, holy shit
Like maybe they should fucking shoot Cubans or whatever that word swimming over to the US who some shit like my mom wants to do
To Mexicans or some shit like that. Apparently that got clipped in that and they those two things of those two things
I don't know which one was worse or which one weighed more heavily into it
I've been I've heard from two separate people now that
People in twitch have said that the F word didn't actually matter that much and it was more the Cuban thing. I don't know
If that is true
It kind of makes me want to come back and say that black people aren't allowed to say the n-word anymore ever
Cuz I don't know that's just that's pretty fucking annoying
but I
Don't know whatever maybe I don't not wide enough to be Cuban or not brown enough to be Cuban or whatever or I'm not allowed
To make fun of my I have no idea. That's just like
on a line of level is that just like really fucking bothers me but um that
Something I will talk about later. I kinda want to move most of my political content to YouTube and off of twitch
I don't feel comfortable having political conversations on twitch right now because I feel like
I
Feel like
I don't know. I just feel like they can pull the trigger on a lot of random shit and it's really hard like
when I'm talking about
What I'm talking about like political issues that involve literally like deporting or killing Hispanic people
it's very hard for me to think that like I
Can't say something that might accidentally cross the line like this. The severity of the subject matter I'm dealing with is pretty extreme and
Yeah, I don't know that's just I'm just not really comfortable doing that so I might move I might do like
fuck I hate the thing about it this way, but like maybe two streams a day where I
Start on YouTube and we do political stuff and then I move to twitch and I try to talk about political stuff on Twitch
mostly anymore
Because yeah, I don't know it's just really really really not good I
Don't think twitch will ban me off of off off platform harassment
I'll have another conversation with my partner conduct pretty soon in order to like iron out
100% what's a lot or what's not a lot?
But I don't think twitch would ban me off platform for stuff like this
and unless I was literally like going full idiot like
the
Australian dude that was literally calling a black girl the n-word or saying like right next to some shit like
That anything for views like that guy
Can you do a stream on twitch in YouTube if you aren't doing gaming related shit I might be able to I'm not sure I
Don't I don't know Grady Co citizen I don't really care to discuss it
How often do you get warnings from twitch that one set of bands for more moderate feedback very very rarely
I've gotten one warning in the past six months and it was because a bad donation to slip through where I think somebody tried to
Say the n-word or whatever. That's why I slipped through the the incredibly extreme
swear filter on my
Like the super extreme swear filter on my donation thing
Yeah because of that because of that one in the Kinte that was like three or four months ago
but that's the only winning I've gotten
Oh, yeah, so, I'm sorry to go through some of the memes that get passed around that aren't true
This wasn't an escalated ban at all
There was no people came seem to think that like, oh well
He got a one-week ban than or he got like a 3-day ban than a seven-day bin and now he got a 30-day ban
The probation period for streamers. I I believe this is public if it's not it should be
The probation period for streamers from what I've been told is ninety days
so as long as you go 90 days without any infractions
You're more or less reset so I was like a full three months. My last ban was like six months ago
So I was like a full like three months over my probation period this ban was an instant 30-day ban
Period a lot of people. Yeah, I saw in pokies podcast. Holy shit. I wanted to kill myself
I think I can joke about that
when when I was listening to them up talk about it and they were saying like oh, well, this is probably just a
Hot shot and Devon said that probation period stuff does not exist. I don't really care what they say
I'm gonna go by context that I have in twitch over anything that those two say, especially George
Devon I'm pretty sure agrees with almost everything. I'm about to say because we talked about this afterwards but um
Yeah, technically if anything and this seems like a really dumb way to view it and maybe this is a little Stockholm Syndrome syndrome II
Like the way to view it, is that if anything
I'm probably not on Twitch is super shit list because they could perma ban you instantly for what they deem hateful content
It's only because the partnership team is kind of like worked it out that partners don't get insta ban buttons didn't get a 30-day Ben
you could argue that if twitch like really fucking hated me that they would have like insta perma ban my channel, so
So
Yeah, I was also talking to him I talked to my partner dude
I was probably a little bit more upset than I should have been when I talked to him
I didn't blame him or anything. But like I guess I'm I talk to him and I'm trying to find out like, okay
Well, what's a lot or most not a lot because that's still something that it's not that I don't fuckin know
what the fuck the answer to that shadows and um
like he was telling me things that like if I come back like I probably shouldn't be saying things like
Autistic or poor Downey or retarded anymore? Because technically if you um, if
You look at the twitch Terms of Service Center hateful conduct
So this is what I got banned under right hateful contact hateful conduct in any content or activity that promotes encourages and facilitates
discrimination denigration objectification harassment or violence based on race ethnicity
National origin which was probably the Cuban shut religion sex gender generated any sexual orientation. So this would cover like the f-word or whatever
age
disability
That's calling someone a Downey or autistic or whatever. I mean
Falls under hateful conduct as much as anything else, so I have to get rid of it now
We really have to get rid of autistic and retarded are gonna be completely removed from my vocabulary, I guess
Even though yeah
Your point of view is gonna be different than mine on this
I know a lot of people like to point out that a whole bunch of people say shit like this all the time
But yeah
I can't really afford to think of it that way because pointing fingers at other people will never save yourself from a ban
Yeah, I know sodapoppin had a stream title autism yesterday. Literally the entire time
But Indiana doesn't matter whatever I can't do anything about that. So
Actually, hold on I should let me text my twitch to hold on. Actually, let's find out real quick about something
They are just curious if I'm having a
Serious discussion off platform
Involving the use of certain slurs
Well using those in a non
hateful
way
Still get me in trouble on
Twitch I
feel so cooked that I even have to fucking ask this if I am if I was doing a contract with twitch today I either
Wouldn't be a partner or I would renegotiate that those terms out of it. I would never send a contract like this
It's actually been the one
consistent big thing on my streaming career that I've like held to is that I don't let other people tell me how to speak or
Talk and so I don't carry sponsorships and I never sent away my IP to other people
I try not to like sign an exclusivity thing that unless there's a lot of money involved
If these new terms of service existed I would now be a twitch partner definitely not it's so not worth it
not when I not yeah, definitely not but
Instant audio only stream went on the phone screen turns off. Can you renegotiate the contract? Yeah, I can try to
There's a lot of money involved your whole income my whole income isn't which it's a significant portion of it, but
What's your reason for not swapping to youtube?
Prime subs are a huge reason prime subs are tu-tu-tu-tu-tu big I
Would never join the CX Network I'm not going to
That type of content is not something that I would want to make regularly
I don't mind talking to Paul was like a friend or hanging out with him every now and then but like being involved in that
Sort of like reality TV shit show for guys not. I don't enjoy that at all. It's not enjoyable for me. It's not rewarding
It's not fulfilling. It's not fun
Are you tape Abed Stubbs the thing supposedly you can get sponsored buttons, but I don't know how to do that on YouTube
Yeah, I
Don't think I would make it in the RV, I'm pretty sure one of those guys would kill me
I'm pretty sure one of those dudes would kill me
Is your next bin a 100% guaranteed permit or not
So the way that it goes is I've got if I have anything actionable on me in the next 90 days
I'm pretty fucked but I'm pretty confident that that won't happen because
I've got my relationship with my partner wrapped where I can be actively working to make sure that I'd stay within the guidelines
And most things I don't think it'll happen. I mean, like I said if switch really wanted me gone
He probably could have perma banned me for this instance, but they decided not to so
He can just put your stream on his site I don't want Isis viewers, I don't like Paul's viewers
I don't want any of that CX network that viewership is incredibly fucking cancerous. I do not like those people
I don't want them watching me. I'm sorry, but like if you're a nice viewer, you can understand. Holy shit
Would you like to be on the PKA podcast? Yeah, sure. Have they ever wanted me? Yeah, I'd love to
I'll talk about this topic like real quick
But I really don't enjoy doing it because people try to backseat what's going on in my mind when I know what I'm thinking better
Than anybody else and it really really really bothers me
I've been throwing out a lot of fucking perm ads and my cell ready for people to do this shit. It's really obnoxious
Destiny serious. Not a meme question. Do you think he will stop playing league on stream? Seriously not a meme question
I think the risk might be high chance for you to get mad
I had no idea that I could actually catch a ban on twitch for saying that f-word
I've seen people say it
Actually, Moe himself just tweeted like yesterday that he would I think it was even today that he was gonna stop saying that word
So like I know there are people that still actively senate's which I had no idea that I could catch an active band for it
a lot of people are under this delusion that like I literally can't control anything that I say that like
Oh god, like I get so mad at League. I just like I start throwing and bombs and f-bombs out. Not really
I just got really mad
I just said I don't think it's something to get banned for knowing that I can get banned for it. It's really easy
Not to say it
a lot of people seem to not think that that's true probably because a lot of you guys might be 18 or 19 and you
Can't control what you say. I'm not entirely sure or yeah, but um
Yeah, I mean it's pretty easy to for me to not say a certain word
Especially since unless I'm talking privately
I don't really say that much and I don't really have any private conversations anymore because I scream so much anyway, so
Not mow that not mow the yasuo man it was the oh shit. I don't know we were still on the screen it was the
Wait shit
Fuck I don't remember where the picture was. I want to start clicking through these and guessing
It was mo the other csgo guidance here we have a link to the tweet somebody like
So I need a picture of it
You literally got banned for saying a certain word because you couldn't stop yourself from doing it yeah no that's retarded
See you later, buddy. Come back tomorrow
I don't know where most tweet is, but somebody took a screenshot of it a while ago. Oh
Is this actually
This was a tweeted yesterday
I'm going to try and stop saying the word eff
Got under stream is apparently you can get banned for it now and whenever - no I didn't mean it was hateful
so like I'm wondering if this guy was literally saying it like
Yeah
Whatever
You
I
Actually, hold on fuck I
Don't want to be on this I don't want to be on Twitch if like I'm this is like insanely ridiculous. I
Don't want to read his response. I
Would have I would never sign a contract like this ever in my entire life I feel so incredibly cooked right now
I'm not gonna read what he says. I'm stream
I feel like it's rude and I don't want to do anything to get on like twitches bad side. Oh
Can you hear me
Either your mic isn't working on my discord isn't working
It's me. Hang on. Oh, oh, did you hear that? Yeah, okay. I forgot to turn on my
Channel strip. Yeah, do you see that response when I read it real quick, dude. Do I have to leave to a hitch?
Like
Okay, it would like I could be more understanding if I was like a Laker super racist, dude
Whatever, but I'm like, I'm literally my political views. They're so SJW
like I've built my whole politics Brown in the past two years and being like a left-leaning like Pro LGBTQ person like
What that's like that response is insane right? Like holy shit
Yeah, am I not allowed to do politics anywhere like you I would never sign this contract
I would never be a twitch partner if this is like I don't even know if it's worth the eight or nine K month
I make on on the prime subs that's like insane to me dude, like
Mmm, holy shit
So, I think the second part is more important like where where he says that it seems like you could
You could
Put yourself out of this discussion. Yeah, I mean, yeah, yes
I said the way that he phrases it like scares me a lot, right?
Yeah, because he's leaving room for it to be totally suck Wow
Like if it was something if the responses and the lines are like dude, yeah, you can definitely have those conversations
Just make sure you're having them in a responsible way. Then I would be totally cool
But that response makes it sound like especially the first felt like I should never first confirmations really weird
Like I should just play video games and shut the fuck up about everything
Yeah, exactly. Like it is not what dude which is totally 100% fine on I think
I'm gonna type it to you though
Do you think I already gonna move to this one wait you got moved from
Yeah
Why did you move from him? I don't know. Yeah. Yeah, so that's not so here
Like I'm typing like an idiot because I'm not like thinking but yeah, that's funny. I mean, yeah
The reason is because like and here's how you do it like
You know because like it feels like to me that
That kind of response is
Just I
Want to say not professional
You know what I mean
Like you're dealing with an issue here. That's really serious to your livelihood in your career. Maybe he's just not aware of that
Maybe he thinks I'm literally I wonder if like in his head
He thinks that I just want to talk about this now to be really edgy
Maybe he has no idea like what my history is do you think?
I don't know because I don't know the context of your first call, but the the way that that response
Kind of like hit me was sort of out of the realm of how twitch should be handling these issues
to be very careful with this right like the
There's a certain expectation
And system for these responses that goes the this should go back and forth between the communications between a partner manager and a partner
So for it for it so for like what's happening?
I feel like the solution I presented is makes a lot of sense also
I
Absolutely think that
You should
Any any negotiation you should have with them should be in person I'm sure of that
Yeah, I should fly to San
Francisco
Yeah, that's their head office
They have a branch in LA. But everyone that you want to talk to yeah
I'm very like I'm a hundred percent on that and and I didn't like think about it yesterday
but when I go back to like when
Like anything that we were doing is CLG or anything like we would always go to SF and it was like a hundred percent better
to be in person and I notice
Very content creating and collaborating people like to see you in person so much more
It means so much more to see somebody in person than it does to talk in an email or whatever
Yeah, just like Anna Shear business sense
There's just so much more that I think can be communicated
In person and and like when it comes down to like we're at a point
With you where like the career like this is like sort of. Oh you're changing. Yeah. Yeah either way
It you can it like my concern right now is you're kind of coming off as like in to them right? Not not intention
I'm not accusing you. There's no innocent. Someone is trying to push the boundary and I'm trying to be as edgy as possible
Yeah, yeah, and then every time you sort of like send a message to them your correspondence is like well
Can I say this? Can I do this?
Can I do this instead of like?
How do I work with you guys to so like that's and again this is their perception. How do I work with you guys to?
To overcome these boundaries so I hear I really I really do try to do that
I don't show you as many we're like so like this is the message that I send like a minute or two ago
like I do try to keep that like somewhat at the forefront or I don't know if you think this is still like a
Little maybe too edgy. I should be a little bit more polite, but
Yeah, what I would do here if you're gonna stay with the same manager is I would try to establish a baseline of what your
content is
And and like and who you are as a broadcaster and then go off of that and so say like, okay
so like this is what I'm
Doing or this is what I've envisioned for my channel. And for what I want to create now. How do we
Center this onto and do this in a way that twitch sees this to be
Acceptable to be on their platform. You know what I mean? Yeah, so so like I think
But I'm also kind of still convinced that you might want to go with the option that I recommended
I also just because the the person that I mentioned that just seems to be like a lot more understanding of things like this
yeah, it might also have a prior understanding of your
Actual content sure. Yeah
Yeah, fuck me dude. It's so scary. I've never like
This has always been like the thing
I've always been like the most critical of other people for being stupid agreeing to is when you license your IP to other people
Exclusively and when you let other people tell you how to act off of their specific thing
This is why I like deliberately never take like restrictive sponsorships or anything like that and the fact that I find myself in this position
somehow that I can't have serious conversations about political or ethical issues here at another platform is so
Incredibly mind-blowing to me. I come to this basic
Yeah
Like everything that I've done in my whole life isn't to avoid this and Here I am
Somehow like and not just and not through any fault of your own, but just do it
Just do the evolution of which is a company. Yeah. Holy shit
It's scary and it's like really bad too. Yeah
Like I'm such a minority of people impacted that it doesn't really matter to them
Like I see their point of view, right?
Like how many people into Achieva disgust like political or ethical issues like 99% of the time anybody wants to have these conversations?
They're doing it to be edgy or like shitty. So it's like
Yeah, but like it's just the off platform shit is what kills me now because like
You know cuz at the beginning of this conversation
before I sent this most of the guy actually tell my stream I was like
I think what I want to do is I'm just gonna totally split live streaming on YouTube and twitch
I'm just gonna do all my politics stuff on YouTube and I'm okay with that all just because then I don't feel like I can
Get in trouble at it. I feel like I'm more free to say what I want to say and whatnot
But now I can't even do that
Yeah, it's like even though I have an old contract that was kind of good because it only nails me on the gaming stuff
So I can still do IRL and in politics off platform. I really can't because if I say certain things I'm still gonna get like
So I'm gonna type something to you, yeah
Create your own CDN my dude Trailways. Your own path is the next big platform
Yeah, I've never ever seen that and we actually had a
How are you not considered an employee at this point I'm you're considered contractors for streaming
Sargon was right. The left are ruining everything and
freedom of speech is under attack pepé liberals get the band to de feels
Okay, stop super chatting me I'm not gonna read this shit okay, or I might but I'm gonna miss a lot of it
What does this button do for 279 Canadian dollars that's like 50 cents American I think
Shortly and what gaming is anythi dollars? Love you
Photos from Elliott nor you G don't guess if I'd always be here for you dissing Bibles thumb then it'd have much money
So YouTube's are profitable for destiny just to piss off twitch
No, fuck don't I don't even know how I get the money that you're donating to me on YouTube action
I'm pretty sure goes to my like YouTube channel, which I end up splitting with Gary, so don't do it
Okay, don't like Gary get a cut of this shit. Alright?
Okay, so that's that's what I was saying
Yeah, I understand okay cool, yeah
There's just not gonna be I mean, I just Karen to you no matter what there's not gonna be any movement on that
And that you'd have to get it through other means but like I think your best bet is the last thing
I'd like
It really sucks. But you're dealing with a situation where they have all the leverage. Yeah, of course
Yeah, and so like a big mixer sponsorship
or all
Mixer or the Facebook shit or whatever. I
Mean you have 8000 viewers on YouTube. You should be talking to them
Yeah, and yeah, I mean for sure well today though
But I'm pretty sure this will taper off to like two or three thousand or maybe hideouts
I'm not sure do you think this is just because of the yeah because of what's going on right now
There's a huge surge of people that are interested in the moment
But it'll taper off to like two or three thousand or like really yes master
Yeah, but I don't I don't know how discovery works and he was a political show
Well, how are people finding you now?
No idea where am I gonna hear from right now where the fuck you guys coming from?
that's like a really interesting question right because like
But that would an account from like the other five cameras and you've only been streaming for an hour
So, how did those people discover you that's like really wrong?
There's somebody posted a live stream fail through that might be it or is it like top?
Everything it every thing that gets posted about me as a top what you what are you talking about?
You know you're talking to I'm sorry. You were on a call with George someone and Dan the guy
Okay, I don't know who those you're talking a destiny now
Okay, obviously, I thought all right the firsthand source, and I might not be a millionaire when I go to Wells Fargo
But when I step into the streaming arena, I'm a millionaire in the eyes of my fans. Alright
Streamers seems like Amazon's paying streamers a ton of money. Oh wait. I have my youtube subs
I just remember that you guys could actually be coming from YouTube. Oh fuck that was so dumb
I forget that I actually have like a real YouTube channel now with my hundred thousand subs and everything
YouTube notifications Oh Mondrian. Oh, hey, what's up, buddy?
Yeah, that's right
I
Forgot about you on YouTube. I saw you live feelsgoodman. Yeah. Oh
Shit, I totally forgot about that actually. Wait, hold on. Well now I'm really curious we're gonna do another straw poll
Where did you come from?
My friend who hates your streams in Lex YouTube channel told me you rely before I know
Oh, no, what if all the youtubers what if all my subs that hate my streams like my YouTube unsub for me now on YouTube
Most as the f-word multiple times five days ago. I know. Oh man, wait, really
How did you
If I listen to another guy saying it am I gonna get Ben
How funny would it be if I listened to another guy?
say it on Twitch and then I get permabanned from twitch for listening to him say but he never even got to see him he
Never even got banned a single time for it. Hold on. I'm gonna be in my strippers that way listen to this because I
know marketing dummy WTF you play
You
Ah
Don't show me this. I don't care. I don't even want to see this. Oh my god
I don't want to see this don't even show me this shit. Don't even show me this shit. I don't want to see it
Okay, we're moving on. Oh
I
Don't care I don't care I don't care
Holy shit dear dad link was like, oh my god. That was so insane. Uh,
Okay, um anyway but like you can't really you can ever think of life like that
You can't let go like well, he did that. Will he do that because you'll never get out of like trouble
Doing shit like that
What is the revenue Delta between being banned from twitch and going to youtubers joint just going to - without being banned from twitch
Between being bad, I mean a Simic
well
We have to we had it's got to be a weighted probability thing because we've got a we've got away our future
Potential earnings at twitch and then augment that with the probability of getting permabanned from switch
She don't think what happened, but who the fuck knows?
If you had a play game right now but not shown extreme do you think it violate the contract?
Yeah, I just can't do gaming content
I mean if I plan to the background it would be okay, but you guys can't see it at all
In the long run you'll make more money on YouTube
Yeah, but like if I go to youtube, I would need like a good the only problem
Is that like the thing is that right now?
There's like subsidized dirty government fake money on Twitch in the form of Amazon Prime subs that I can't really get anywhere else
But unless I got like a contract from YouTube to stream on their platform
Which I don't even think ice has so why would they give me one?
I collect in the Romney me like oh it's
so chewing so good it helps you it helps
to stare at the Sun better no won't wall
think in the old the Sun is just a
projection because the earth is flat
yeah okay wait a second do you guys
actually think that that's like a huge
meme you don't think there might be any
validity to that what kidding well I
guess like when I think of things this
is I this sounds really me but I'm
really big on like observable empirical
data driven kind of answers I don't know
I feel like a lot of the I feel like
they're all descriptive in predictive
powers to a lot of the things that flat
earthers say like what are some things
that you think can't be predicted or it
can't be explained by Flat Earth theory
I'm a legitimate Korean you see the
picture that is posted in check [ __ ]
picture shows the Sun going around in
circles yeah the Sun travels around in
the sky the Sun will travel around the
earth or or will be tilted differently
based on the axis to the earth it's kind
of similar to how it works in your
spherical model or whatever but but I
mean it would work pretty much the same
way just because the earth is flat
doesn't mean it can't tilt along an axis
with the Sun moving around it with the
destiny are you looking at the picture
that I posted yeah okay
from see how there's a red circle with
the North Pole and there's a red circle
around Africa no Papua New Guinea
and South America from that it would
follow that the circumference on those
is wider than those in the in the
century and we could extract like that
Oh a flight time would take long from
South America
okay I'm sorry so a few days ago I said
that um late at night but when I was
opposed to going to sleep I hopped on
the server and I started having a flat
earth discussion and I brought it up and
apparently some guy emailed me and he
said he heard me talking about this but
he actually recorded it so see so he
sent me the recording of it so that's
listening to like from the northern and
southern hemispheres we could well sure
but I guess like the problem with this
kind of stuff this is gonna sound like a
huge [ __ ] cop-out but the problem is
that it's impossible for anybody to
independently verify these measures on
their own like no scientist will ever
get in a truck and drive in a straight
line and actually measure out how to
verify that these distances are accurate
what about is like all on flights like
Justin what about meta destiny how can
meta accumulate and not form a sphere
eventually because it doesn't
necessarily have to or what do you mean
it's gonna form a sphere wait why does
it always have to spawn if you measure
the force of gravity and then you
measure the mass in the model predicts
those forms yeah wait wait what how we
why can't matter do is form a disk Oh
disk but because the way a certain
amount of mass has a gravitational
attraction which is an amount of force
in all directions right so if you have
an if you have enough matter in one in
one thing yeah well no well no well
let's say that you would let's say that
you were to lay out matter like in a
flat why can't the matter just come
together and form like a flat but you'd
have to lay it out in the flat plane
how would it however you flip you would
be a sphere why do you get to assume
that it would have started out our
sphere articles attracting to each other
right in come together and the way they
come together is in its perform of the
sphere but not necessarily but but well
that's what
let's say that you blew up a disk in
space okay it was a flat disk and it
kind of when I say blowed up like you
just like crumbled all of it right so it
was just kind of in space laying there
it's like a flat thing when gravity kind
of like pulls it together it all it's
going to do is like from the ends like
push it in it's not going to necessarily
make it into a sphere or anything yeah
yeah a specific amount if you have
enough matter then the force is great
enough that will turn it into a sphere
so if you have like weight will you buy
enough matter why should it matter how
much matter there is because the more
the matter the more gravity right that's
pulling it together and if the gravity
overcomes the structural integrity of
the earth whatever you have well if this
was so Jim why is it that things like
why is the earth not even a because even
in your spherical model so this
interesting because I've heard a lot of
people that say they're into physics
will claim this that like all matter
will I say that you guys always say that
all matter will form a sphere okay so
but the problem is that even in your
models you guys have to bulge the earth
at the center because it's not even a
perfect sphere in your model it's a knob
lead sphere fear our square right it's
not even a perfect circle what's so why
does it's not it's not perfect uniform
density right and it's not like it's not
made of air there is a predictable bulge
the earth in the same way that you need
it in order to make it work because you
have it set up as a sphere well it could
be flat like that bulge that exists at
the middle of the earth like they try to
explain it away while also saying that
all matter forms a sphere but that bulge
is only there because it seems like they
need it to kind of explain how the
sphere math even way what so if you look
at every single planet that is
supposedly a sphere in the solar system
all of them oh actually we can google it
it's called equatorial Bowl wait hold on
wait wait why aren't those why aren't
those spheres there well I'm not even
sure if we can really see that
I like have you looked into a telescope
yes you can you can google equatorial
bulge how is it that it that a rotating
body will form a bulge of the sphere
when it should be forming perfect
circles I don't understand look the
every single planet has this perfect
bulge that just so happens to explain
the position of all the continents what
what now you explain the position of
prominence what do you mean look all I'm
saying is that there are maps with Flat
Earth where everything fits perfectly
but as soon as you turn how to make
earth into a sphere you've got to start
adding all these really weird
conditionals in order to put the
contents where they're supposed to be
like you're talking about in that flight
the reason why you can explain them is
because you have to add this weird bulge
in the center of a sphere that's
supposed to be a perfect sphere
according to your model can you really
look at it like that no if you have well
I I think that I mean if you look at the
models and you look at I mean just look
at the earth I mean I've traveled in
airplanes I've traveled internationally
like I've flown all over the world I've
been to South Korea Poland Germany I've
never seen like the curvature of the
earth well you're the well the
observation that we both make us at the
earth is flat you're the one that's
making the extraordinary claim well I
mean I've seen your horizon you can't
see all over it well but but all of that
is explaining I want you to I want you
to time you know people you guys claim
hold on you guys claim that black holes
can suck in light right the sunlight
right goes over the planet like just
perfectly but it never gets sucked into
the planet like flat earth because
because wait because the escape works
because the mass of the black hole was
so great that the escape velocity of the
speed of light so that's if that's if
the light reach
the event horizon buckle yeah but what
perfectly explained so that your white
is just fast enough 300,000 kilometers a
second okay oh [ __ ] did you get Kenneth
Quinn threw a tennis ball at the same
speed on a black hole it would go back
down because the gravitational force is
like greater than the speed of light
like it can't just come back okay so
what about like Jupiter or how about the
Sun the Sun is so huge how can like
problem produces life electromagnetism
that happens from nuclear fusion within
its core is what for yeah why can the
light escape from the Sun why doesn't
the light orbit the Sun like the planets
supposedly do why does no light of its
own as it has your wife how is it
impacted by gravity well it's the Sun
whoa like why can't I see like an orbit
of light around the Sun should because
like if the if the light is being shot
off the Sun shouldn't it eventually slow
down and lose momentum and then start
orbiting around the Sun like no because
it has no mass because because a black
hole bends space-time and not just
[ __ ] that it doesn't time you guys
everything technology does enough to
like keep them from escaping sure it's
not like this is this is how it's
explained advance this is how to explain
it but earth when you shine it could
just take it wait you could just take it
with the Edom's you could say well the
atoms using together and then the
neutrons like are the protons decaying
into a neutrons creating out with
outwards pressure and like fly it why
doesn't that just a little bit around it
with it you wouldn't have the structure
of the star
okay so what I'm saying is that Flat
Earth theory perfectly explains that
when you shine a light it falls off just
like anything else would this is why
things disappear over the horizon
because the light is falling off it's
totally consistent everywhere on earth
whereas you guys are trying to tell me
that
well sometimes light has no mass
sometimes it's captured by virtually no
mess what is the mass put what is the
mass of a bones have mass but it has
mass yeah but virtually zero mass like
if you look it up it'll say hit zero man
but it's not zero yeah but at zero
99.9% empty speed so shouldn't we just
be like falling off the earth if
everything just falls off by buoyant
forces travel far enough shouldn't I
like behind the end of the earth I don't
know I mean it's why is the moon rises
in my circle who says lemonis curve I
don't believe a moment is it really what
why does the earth cost like us a
spherical shadow across the moon yes
destiny okay in the northern hemisphere
water flushes yeah also clockwise how do
you explain this that can all be
explained just because it's a flat earth
doesn't mean it can't rotate and spin
around an axis way like you bring up the
moon and it's good point listen you guys
why do we always see the same side of
the Moon why doesn't the moon spinning
whoa because of the way it all bits
around us oh come on like every single
thing you have like a caveat for if I
say the moon is flat
it orbits around the earth you plug the
mass into the model of the moon the mass
of the Earth the rotation blah blah blah
blah blah and it all comes out that way
right so if you put it into the model
this thing comes out and it happens to
be like when we look at it that's also
the thing so that's why we say yeah it's
just to say that the earth is flat you
would have to assume that all the other
planets as including the Sun and the
moon are flat as well sure like you're
fine with that logic yeah of course it
was like I said like one big mirror look
when you look at things like the moon
right you have you get you give all
these weird explanation travel and
perfectly orbit so we all always see the
same side like okay but it's it makes
perfect sense if you just assume that
it's flat and it moves up on top of the
planet and like I said wait I don't know
the frustrating thing is that every
single time like you have a rule
you always have an exception for the
rule in order to make your model work
which played earlier all of you guys
were very adamant that all matter in
space would form a sphere but you also
brought up how science scientists would
never measure like different the
different flight paths where people
actually have done that so
it's not weight it's not yeah but but
the earth couldn't be the earth and do
that by the way gravity gravity affects
all of that as energy not just mass so
just so you know and photons have
gravity gravity affects space-time and
energies affected great gravity is real
then why don't we see ometimes orbiting
the Sun why don't we see that and why is
it that light is able to get past
planets like Jupiter with no problem
should we see giant shadows well I don't
know I'm just I'm genuinely curious why
is it that I can't look out okay listen
if we would have shoot something off of
the planet Earth right
if earth was a [ __ ] massive thing
like the Sun is supposed to be like a
million times bigger than the earth why
is it that we don't see the photons
coming back into the Sun to orbit the
Sun why is the question but wait wait
think you could just post the question
well why other atoms in the center of
the red supergiant star [ __ ] fusing
why aren't they like going back to orbit
the sunlight no well because they're
kept inside the Sun the star you see
like different fusions happening what so
you could just ask the same questions
for each like layer you could look at
like like just like loosely flying like
nucleuses like it seemed like of the
star and say like why isn't that going
into the core of this stuff wait wait so
what are you asking me again I say I'm
just saying you could just say that for
that I don't have an actual explanation
for that but I'm pretty sure it'd be for
what destiny was talking about about the
photons no I'm just asking why when the
photons are launched off the Sun which
is supposedly [ __ ] huge why they
aren't drawn back into it why is it only
black holes which is the only way that
you guys can explain away reason why
light the reason why light doesn't
escape black holes is because the escape
velocity or whatever is greater than
which light travels it yeah this one
doesn't have enough
I mean like pull so like here's what I
have to look at right here's what I have
to look at from an evidence point of
view okay you guys are saying okay the
only the galaxy can work is if you put a
supermassive black hole in the middle
this happens to be the only thing that
light can escape from but you also don't
know anything about it but I can't
somebody grab you man in the middle in
the middle of the Milky Way galaxy
supposedly there's a super miss perfect
thing that you have no idea how they
work how does a black hole even work now
we can explain it nobody can tell you
why oh yeah once once yes so you know
anything in the world could become a
black hole theoretically if you
condensed it enough okay thanks so then
why has it a large how bring it
regarding protons and antiprotons wait
you haven't addressed fly times are all
my tanks I think have been worked out on
on on paper it's such that they all work
out just fine like you're trying to tell
me that you know what the exact flight
times is but every time they're slightly
different people always say well because
the wind speeds are one thing or the
wind currents were another like well
that's a that's a margin of error in the
context that's a marksberry should
variability but it still does I mean I
would have to see I would have to see a
map of the flight times cuz all the maps
that I've seen with flat earth show the
fly times working out just fine oh yeah
so if the ship sails off far enough
it'll look like it's sinking correct
just how we figured out how there's
other Greeks figured out well this is
from your faulty assumption that light
travels so fast that even though you
guys say somehow it has mass but it
doesn't really fall to the planet if you
assume your while you say there's a
little bit but if you assume that light
fault if you assume that light falls
into the planet just like anything else
does like everything else is predicted
to then you would assume that as the
ship moves farther and farther away the
light kind of falls off as it gets to
you and it appears to fall over the
horizon that's like an illusion created
by the light falling off as it gets
farther away
yeah it has yeah the the the earth has a
very slight gravitational pull on light
so like it slightly very slightly bends
the light so like it would fall off but
it's very very slight yeah to travel
away hundreds of thousands of miles in
order for you to see it fall off because
light falls off very very slightly sure
I don't disagree that hundreds of
thousands of no no no it falls off
because everything like every everything
that has mattered pulled sunlight but
the the the thing about lightest that
has no mass and thus the the pole on it
is so minimal because the end because I
photon has so little energy that yeah it
barely doesn't fall off at all but
compared like any later
again I don't want to disagree with you
like I agree with everything you're
saying it's just you're telling me that
it just likes tiny and the Fantas and
unbelief small packets of energy well
but like you're trying to say that it's
so fast and all of this is so true that
the only thing that is able to capture
this our black holes that you no no no
okay answer me this question can you
descent to me this question how do you
even know a black hole exists if looking
through telescopes suppose you're
looking at me because I'm black holes we
said way and we've detected
gravitational waves detected gravitation
was detected gravitational waves from
locals I mean all of it is stuff like
you can't go and run any tests yourself
to verify this but I could run every
test I want you to verify fighter I
could take measurements to the ship
going over the horizon and shining a
laser point back I can show you the
fall-off of the light as it gets farther
away the light will drop further and
further on the board like all of my
measurements make sense well you could
look what is the laser will drop and in
a predicted manner because light falls
off the same way that it would from from
the Sun or the same way that it would
from
anything else like how can you think the
Sun isn't hundreds of millions of miles
away wouldn't it all fall off before I
even would get to the earth like it's
just so I don't know it's all so weird
or like why doesn't Jupiter pull more
okay why don't you say any light
orbiting the Sun when I get none of
these questions are answered at all in
your model well yeah because because
photons have virtually no mess except
for when it comes to black holes
gravitational the gravity of the
gravitational so the only first they can
suck in light is a theorized object that
you can't see or test for in any way
that it's because it exists hundreds of
thousands of why can't we've detected
gravitational waves from like oh well
they said they've detected real evidence
of that I mean wait wait so why do you
think you can it wants to think you're
at this flat but they just lie all this
time about the earth being round cuz
it's the goddamn Jews as a good
[Music]
all right white liberal reaction to
black conservative reaction to the I'm
not racist video from Donnie Lucas take
one
[Music]
how's everybody doing my name is Anthony
Brown Logan and today I bring you a
reaction video to this music video from
a guy by the name of George Lucas and
title hashtag I'm not racist now I
normally don't do any kind of music
video album or anything like that
reviews on my channel especially not
well if you never do reviews of music
videos you must be in a really good
place to review this music video because
everybody knows that the only thing that
we want is people that know fuck-all
about anything to come in and give their
opinion about something just because
it's got a political message thank you
for taking that on yourself what a great
man thank you because playing first of
all because you got dude with the whole
copyright claim issue how do what they
in this video by stopping it a light so
they won't say go on chapo every time
know if they want me to I would but I
don't know if I would or not I'm not
sure I mean I don't think they would
want me on I don't think I like fit
their normal guests or whatever also
there I think those guys are
significantly more left-leaning than me
so I don't know you know that whole
thing I do with that but beyond that I'm
not into rap too much anymore especially
not this so-called
socially conscious rap because there's
so much of the black last man I'm not
into rap no more especially not they're
socially conscious rap and I also didn't
really like gangster rap basically [ __ ]
black music goddammit get these [ __ ]
black people out of the [ __ ] music I
just want to listen to Beethoven by the
way what does this even mean I'm not
into black and I'm not into rap anymore
because of the socially conscious rap
what do you what kind of rep you want
we got pop rap we could do Eminem I
guess don't you on the floor make love
to you I don't even know what was that
[ __ ] just wanna stand hearing rhetoric
the victimhood new rhetoric I'm just not
really into it but for this particular
video you guys have been blowing me up
I'm talking about I know what kind of
rap this guy needs this is what he
wanted this is what the kind of rap that
he's missing
I have the a here not the ER so well I
wrote this song for the Christian youth
I want to teach kids the Christian truth
if you want to reach those kids on the
street then you got to do a rap do a
hip-hop beat so I gave my sermon an
urban kick my rhymes are flying my beats
are sick my crew is big and it keeps
getting bigger
that's cuz Jesus Christ is made nope
alright we're gonna go on my Facebook
page every single message has been about
this it's a viral sensation that we'll
get from that I'm on the guys YouTube
page right now
it already has 2.5 million views in one
day so this has gotten a lot of
attention I think he may CNN you know
I'm that that's not really the best
example to use but my point is that it's
gotten a lot of attention draven brand
is most cancers [ __ ] laying in the
game i like it in a very short period of
time so i got to give you guys my
reaction to it coming from the black
conservative thank you so much further
ado let's go into Rowley hit us up okay
I only okay I'm not gonna lie in the car
and listen I want to be here with you
I hold it about five minutes of this so
it's actually possible that this guy
does have a very reasonable view on it
and I get doctors eat okay however any
guy that identifies as a black
conservative makes me think so will
cease to pay your bills
yelling [ __ ] this [ __ ] that called a
buy [ __ ] and get a [ __ ] Mac as soon as
I say [ __ ] and everyone react wanna
swing at me and call me braces cuz I'm
black okay now the whole thing about the
info oh no you know everybody knows
that's a loaded term it everyone else
it's a double standard as well you know
black folks could say that most each
other white guys can't it's just one of
those things I mean it's just that's
just the way it is I mean I know sense
would be an associate being upset about
that you know Nicole okay yeah that's
okay
since what it is what it is MasterChef
okay it will get yeah okay sure talk
about some angry like you was around
back there like he was picking cotton
off the [ __ ] ground back there like
you was on the plantation getting down
back there I mean that's a good point
it's like oh no no that's a good point
how many times you gonna say it how many
times you're gonna say it to this guy oh
no like it was on the plantation get
down back there I mean that's a good
point
it's like why we're talking about
slavery you run the slave if you
watching this video and you're alive if
you're not a ghost
if you're not a poltergeist you were not
alive during slavery so when is I gotta
do with you I see a black man naming
this gun but I'd rather see a black man
claiming the Sun and now I mean just for
one day you've done some weed and some
liquor [ __ ] baby why you party on the
road you got no [ __ ] gold I mean [ __ ]
I mean that was perfectly sane I mean
look we know what's going on with the
whole welfare state oh no you know what
it is we know that people are out there
abusing it admission we need to make
sure that joyner doesn't see his fear
because I think if you watch this I mean
we'd kill himself do you think he would
using it selling the food stamps or
whatever they want so why is that
offensive to say why is that something
that should be so taboo to say you know
it's offensive that people are doing it
it's not offensive to actually just come
out there and tell the truth about
what's happening but let's keep going
you already late you [ __ ] need
to get your damn priorities straight way
it's like you try to be fatal but you
lay these [ __ ] and you rather sell drugs
and get a job at me straight and then
you turn around and complain about the
poverty rate [ __ ] out of my face I'm
with him on that I'm definitely with
them on that you know this is just
interaction between the two of them
that's kind of how it would go as well I
mean not really but the do might be kind
of violent the black do might be kind of
violent and the white do may not be as
Bo but I mean everybody what does that
even mean wait what's he trying to say
the black guy might you know wile out
and the white dude it'll be a little bit
more reserved like what is he even
trying to say here what is this being
told something like that you just got to
kind of take it if that applies to you
you know it doesn't apply to all of us
but it applies to too many of us can't
escape problems you can pray for some
change but can't break it data got
nobody else to blame so you blame Donald
you [ __ ] the world would it make
America's great condoms my boys been
back I'm not racist my sister's
boyfriend's black
I'm not racist my sister-in-law's baby
cousin Tracy got a brother in his
girlfriend's black okay that's that's
the whole thing about you know I'm not
racist to have a black friend that's
like a stereotypical thing you know he's
gonna say liberals do it oh my god is he
gonna do it he might do it is he gonna
do it he's gonna say liberals do it all
the time hold on maybe he won't we'll
see I wanna see what the song is going
like I've already seen this but you know
like at this point in the video
I was starting to see where this is
going and if you know like I know you
know where it's going
he's like I digress let's get back to
the song don't worry to build a wall to
keep the Mexicans out a mission and the
mall to the ghetto for now from not
racism and I never loved Mexicans in it
come on like it ain't about Mexicans
it's about people that come through the
southern border illegally its Mexicans
that live here that came from Mexico
recently who do not want to have the
illegals come over here because they
were escaping a very dangerous violent
and poverty-stricken place why would
they want that same element to follow
them over here where they came to escape
it is like if you were living in a place
like if you had a place that was on fire
and then you escaped that place why
would you want to fire
to travel to bring up your new spy it
doesn't make any sense but let's keep
going
die but I think the disconnect between
your culture of mine I worship the
[ __ ] idea what's a [ __ ] god oh my
god I'm sorry for the profanity
j-bot is rapping and starting to be
arrested and that's the [ __ ] within you
music right and your brain and slowly
start to convince you and you let your
kids listen and then the cycle continues
blame it all on the menu blaming on
those drinks blaming on everybody except
for your whole race blaming or white
privilege is blaming a white chair just
blaming a white citizen say mr. vice
president this is like one of those
powerful speeches put I'm saying ah lady
Sanders right the whole blame game there
the blame game is a game it doesn't make
any sense to play you know especially as
an adult male Texas possibility for your
home actions will be trying to blame
anybody else that ain't how life is
that's even matter if somebody else's
fault it's all about what you're able to
do for yourself the blame game Wow the
heart er okay so I'll see where this is
coming from I definitely see I'm gonna
give my full reaction at the end of it
but I see where this is going I see
where it's coming from
I'm just paying for this type of war I
heard Eminem's rap with the awards who's
he fighting for I can take that
[ __ ] to here right no more it's
like you wanna be so famous you'll do
anything for attention in the little
payment I can't take you nowhere without
people pointing fingers pants hanging
off your ass you ain't got no home
training put your [ __ ] pants up [ __ ]
put that Suzanne go take that do-rag
girl say that gonna rot your mouth quit
the pitiful stuff and then maybe police
stop killing you from so what the [ __ ] I
mean yeah stop acting like animals
hooligans you stopped getting shot I
mean that's just what it is
now hashtag night all we know that now
all goddamn this is some hot [ __ ] black
folks are like that everybody knows that
unless you just erase this just like we
all know that not all white folks are
gonna be some you know redneck hair blue
they're gonna come out and kill you
matter of fact some of the so-called
rednecks and hillbillies are the nice
people you know I love all y'all so you
know I think the main thing here is that
if you are fear free life of the police
if you are keep if you keep getting
locked up or whatever maybe if you
change the way you behave then it might
happen to you anymore all the crying and
stuff like that that last matter hands
up don't shoot that won't be necessary
if you just behave behave stay in line
boy that blue thing to see that race
again well let's keep going holy [ __ ]
this guy is on another level dude it's
like we're living in the same building
but splitting the two floors I'm not
racist but there's two sides to every
story I wish to die but the [ __ ] is my
support brand
oh here we go we're going to get we're
going to get the other side here comes
the real racism I wish that I knew yours
I was want to say this is a some good
production value in the video I will say
that you know I'm not necessarily
feeling the message because I know where
it's coming from I know where it's going
I know the crescendo like I already seen
it but even before I saw it I knew where
it was going but I will say that has
great production value and it could have
got an actual rubric America great again
hat that would have been fantastic but I
digress
[Music]
with all disrespect I don't really like
you white [ __ ] that's just where
I'm at scream it always daughter welcome
what kind of [ __ ] is that
okay now spoiler alert if you didn't
know I'm gonna same voice ah okay so
it's not the white guy - or the black
guy rapping this has got names or no
Lucas wow we didn't know dude I thought
I thought they just both have the same
type of voice the guy sounded white to
me did one of those people hold on I
have to add this if I can [ __ ] can I'd
like makeup column for miscellaneous
[ __ ] autism [ __ ] like so
I guess jesus [ __ ] christ
okay pictures right here on the screen
before you that's it was actually
rapping so I guess the whole point was
to have a stereotypical a white guy that
you will see make America great again
the beer big belly or whatever and then
the black guy with the crazy hair the
Calvary - one calorie show on the end of
this twist no real dark skin win it over
so just to have the two sides it's very
stereotypical kind of like going at each
other and this guy Joyner is from
Worcester Massachusetts mighty Puerto
Rican baby not even black I don't know
but I digress let's get back to it
oh and also to say all lives matter it's
a protest against your protest what does
that even mean
watch you matter that includes you how
is it a protest against you this is such
a dumb [ __ ] point this guy can I am I
allowed his Uncle Tom or do i get banned
in church for holy [ __ ] [ __ ] how
[ __ ] [ __ ] can you be like you
walk into a place you like hey dude I've
got some real problems some guys like
everybody's going problems like oh okay
yeah sure I mean but that doesn't really
of anything to do with what I'm talking
about you know like hey dude listen like
yesterday dad like I got raped by a guy
at a party was horrible horrible don't
worry all all rapists lives are alright
for his victims matter like okay yeah I
guess but like that has nothing to do
what we're talking about it seems kind
of distracting from exact that I'm
trying to tell you like holy [ __ ] oh my
god one guy appreciate your opinion and
then they got one gank but it kind of
failed what am I getting kind of failed
to I don't know how to count those I
let's say we each got one gang
when I'm saying that sure life matters
but mine does as well it doesn't make
any sense now if we was to say white
lives matter at our rally with you know
what's wrong with white light if you can
say all lives matter responsibly get
your protest but they say all lives
matter is in the same God
it's funny how liberals are so devices
within to be inclusive quit let's get
back to the song one in what so tune to
that was a kind of guy said we shouldn't
say it what we do and that's just what
it is but that'll mean that you can say
just cuz you got [ __ ] friends now
Clippers originated for you to keep
asunder but when we use it we know
that's just how we greet each other and
when you use it we know there's a double
meaning under and even about I do agree
with that I do agree with that the whole
when somebody says it that's white it
usually it's like a double meaning and
then when someone says it as black it's
usually like customers endearment
I do agree with that however I think the
whole thing is done I think that if we
don't want anybody to use it against us
we shouldn't use it amongst ourselves so
that's just my feeling but I do agree
what he said I wasn't picking cotton
physically that'll mean I'm not affected
by the history
how are you picked by cotton pickin
really Grandmamma with a flavor that's a
gift to me you ain't got no
[ __ ] this guy's parents
this guy's parents okay there's like a
decent chance that they were probably
denied like some type of loan or some
type of housing or whatever because they
were black because it was the policy of
the business of a bank or a lender that
literally says we won't loan to black
people right and this guy's like harder
who stroke you like this literally this
guy's like dad or mom could have been I
don't know how old this guy he's in his
40s or not how was your grandma slave
you lucky about 19 and this is 2017 so
let's just do the math you burn away
like at the earliest you're talking
about like 2000 like not like 1999 or
something like that it's like come on
you aren't your grandma can't be in the
morning since two years old so I mean
come on talking about being born in 1950
slavery was over a long time before that
but let's keep going I'm sorry you can
never fill my life trying to have faith
but I never fell all right it's hard to
elevate when this countries ramp my
whites judging me by my skin color in my
blackness trying to find a job and ain't
nobody call me back yet now I gotta sell
drugs for food in my cabinets you
crackers name's Rick it's all apart of
your jacket don't talk about no
[ __ ] sex but I'm making no
dough you think you know everything but
you don't want to copy your slave you
know try to steal black culture and make
it too wrong well what does black
culture is if the dis lang
is it behaving like a criminal what is
black coach you tell me because what how
about the music how about the the cult
how about the attitude how about the
clothes the dances wait what do you mean
what is black culture what the [ __ ] does
that even mean rap is like arguably like
one of America's like largest cultural
contributions to the world and it is
like a very uniquely American form of
music but okay as far as wait ICP jazz
to jazz as well
both of which came from black people
talk about black culture is always
something negative is never anything
real positive why can't black coaches be
inventing progressing building what has
it got to be a boat it's just you know
how you behave and the behavior is like
it's almost like culture sometimes can
be a reaction to the environment around
you and it's kind of like [ __ ] black
people of this special part in US
history where they were literal [ __ ]
slaves it's crazy how can you be so
stupid to let your culture be influenced
by the fact that you were literally
[ __ ] slaves what the [ __ ] what kind
of what [ __ ] take is this oh yeah
okay
dude you got plate did you see three
ganks on each side dude the counter
gangster [ __ ] perfect friendly gank
three enemy gang three but goddamn it
feels good
God it feels good with my [ __ ]
jungler shows up feels [ __ ] good man
you literally argue against alt writers
trying to preserve culture what is
nothing in this conversation same
preserving culture are you talking about
and we're gonna get an air Drake dude
look at that man when you pay attention
of bottling like these good things that
happen so soon why is that gonna be
black culture why can't American coaches
be black culture why is it go America
nope like what do you what do you think
these guys have never like thought for
one second like I wonder if anybody's
ever thought of a counter-argument to
the incredibly [ __ ] third grade basic
level basic dumb [ __ ] [ __ ] I'm saying I
wonder if anyone has ever thought about
a counter-argument to anything that
I guess they're definitely people make
the argument that go stressors bad
because of women but I hope that that
would be a minority it would have
bothered me at less if there wasn't the
whole um I got finally a movie with
women leads before and there are plenty
of good and bad movies for the one that
already haven't yeah but like you
typically see movies with men leads so
until we've seen like a plenty of both
people are still gonna make that same
comment much the same that if a movie
comes out where there are minority leads
like black people or whatever people can
make wow cool a black lead like they did
with Black Panther that's gonna happen
as long as the representation is so off
like there have been a shitload of films
with female leads no the vast majority
of films like in the action and sci-fi
and all those categories are male leads
now there are they're a lot when you
talk about absolute numbers yeah I'm
sure they're probably been hundreds
maybe even thousands but in terms of a
percentage of the overall movies that
have been made and it's a little bit
disingenuous to say there are [ __ ] loads
like there are [ __ ] loads of people with
ultra rare conditions on the planet we
don't call those conditions ultra rare
because they happen to like very few
people we say they're ultra rare because
they happen to a very small percentage
of people
to be clear little fly 87 like I don't
like I don't enjoy it when characters
are kind of shoehorned in and it's in
the end the political narrative is very
obvious if that makes sense like one of
the worst types of movies I've seen do
this as mr. and mrs. Smith where every
single scene is like the woman one
upping the guy and be like well I'm a
woman girl power like I think that [ __ ]
is pretty annoying but
so if the producers decided they wanted
to make the godmother and basically we
make the Godfather with an all-female
Italian crime family and it totally
stuck to us what it really not be
appropriate to blame the quality of the
film and a poorly inspired contrived
shoehorn premise No so like the problem
and I'm never going to convince you
excuse me because you're so [ __ ]
conservative that you cannot even
entertain for a microsecond a different
argument but like all of your statements
make what you think inside so obvious
and like I know that you don't realize
that but um like in your mind so when I
read so when I read your statement okay
you say if the producers decided that
they wanted to make the godmother and
basically we make the Godfather with an
all-female Italian crime family and it
totally sucked ass would it really not
be appropriate to blame the quality of
the film on a poorly inspired contrived
shoehorned premise what you're really
saying there is that making an Italian
crime family movie with women is a poor
is a dumb contrived idea that it has to
be men why would you ever why would you
ever remake something like The Godfather
with women women can't do that kind of
stuff women aren't criminals women don't
do climates that has to be a man thing
right that that's what you're really
saying with a statement whether you
realize it or not and I'm sure you're
gonna tell about some [ __ ] [ __ ]
about why that's not what you actually
mean but
yeah does he I'm saying that take Pete
films people like remove men and at
women can sometimes lead to bad content
or could lead to great content whether
or not the content is good or bad though
it shouldn't matter whether or not there
are women or men that's the problem
right the issue isn't whether or not
there are men or women that are recast
right the thing is that people like you
will never find him like you'll never
look at a movie like the Green Lantern
like here's an example right the Green
Lantern nobody I've never seen in my
life now maybe there's one person but
nobody looked at the Green Lantern I was
like wow that movie was really bad
because they decided to cast a white
male for the lead like what a horrible
[ __ ] movie like that ruined it but if
they would have did the Green Lantern
like a female lead or whatever then
people say like oh well that movie was
bad because it was a female right you'll
never blame the badness on them of a
movie on the fact that there is a white
male leading or the fact that there's
like an alien you'll never say that like
you'll never say that like oh this movie
is bad because there was a man however
people like you will say this movie was
bad because there were women cast for it
you know like that and that that in and
of itself those statements are
indicative of cancers underlying
thoughts that
[Music]
he's being insanely disingenuous for
that example anyway no one is literally
re making movies and replacing a broom
with females these have all been soft
reboots and aundrea yeah that's true the
Ghostbusters wasn't even really a remake
although I don't like that I mean cuz
even if it was a remake I just don't see
the big deal the problem is that the
problem is that what you see played out
here is that men have incredibly fragile
egos just as fragile as any black person
just as fragile as any [ __ ] woman
right men constantly say why do you need
characters that look like you why do
they have to look like you why do you
need carrot easily it shouldn't matter
shouldn't matter but then when a movie
is made with women why do there have to
be women why do they have to be women
there why can't we just keep it as
medicine quiet why does it matter like
if it's a [ __ ] movie it's a [ __ ] movie
period it's not a [ __ ] movie because
women were cast that's not a [ __ ] movie
because they decided to do an all women
remake you can do all women remix that
are good you can do all women remakes
that are bad so clearly the woman part
of that isn't the variable that's
determined it's not like there's a movie
do you think that if the new
Ghostbusters was cast with all men with
the exact same script that that's a gold
movie now that's a 99 percent on Rotten
Tomatoes now that the nerd movie review
guy is almost I'm really happy with it
like no it's still look like it's still
like a super comedy like that's it like
the fact that there's women or men there
doesn't like totally influence how good
or bad the movie is
I'd say agree it can lead to coconut but
you're off technology can lead to bad
content when it does it's appropriate to
cast blame on the inspiration for the
film you're basically saying you can
never blame that inspiration for about
content when it's obviously just this
reaction I just don't think that the
inspiration they wanted to make a movie
with women is like something that would
intrinsically lead to bad content that's
the problem is that you were you have
intrinsically connected your inspiration
of making film with women turns into bad
film that that inspiration was bad that
that is intrinsically bad like oh yeah
destiny so if a movie is inspired by sqw
inclusion inclusive motivation and the
movie is [ __ ] then blaming the
inspiration for the content is
apparently off-limits to you that makes
no sense at all just because something
is inspired by inclusive doesn't mean it
should be immune from criticism I'm not
saying that I'm not saying that anything
should be immune from criticism I'm
saying be honest with your criticism
don't try to say that like oh well I
don't mind if women are in movies blah
blah blah blah I just think it was a
mistake it's a like okay I don't think
that women should be in these movies or
I don't think something like that is
like more honest because like even what
you're saying here sjw inclusive
motivation that can lead to good movies
or can lead to bad movies for a good
example of SJW inclusive motivation look
at the entire history of the x-men which
is literally the defining point of that
whole [ __ ] series wait and then I'm
sure we could find examples of like
really dumb SJW inclusive movies or
whatever I'm sure those exist out there
too but you have to admit you being a
little bit disingenuous by saying the
only possible between an original and
all women remakes effectively swapped it
with women right no I'm saying there are
lots of differences I'm saying there are
lotsa different said that contributes
something being bad I just don't
understand why you would say because
there are women now all of a sudden it's
bad I promise you're unable to recognize
when it does lead to bad movies I
totally agree it can lead to good movies
so you already agree with me what are we
arguing
deciding to cast like deciding to do a
movie and then having women can lead the
good movies or can lead to bad movies
that's not the variable that determines
whether the movie is good or bad
[Music]
Professor X wasn't telepathic it's a
huge innovation all the women in porn
with men doesn't make it better either
just makes it a little gay gachigasm do
you not think it's highly improbable
that Ray was a Mary Sue because Disney
wanted to empower women like people say
this and I went looking through that
movies thread they're like 10,000
comments why was nobody complaining
about Han Solo being a Gary Stu how
about that can you explain that for me
because Han was just as bad as Ray in
the Star Wars movie it was actually
something that I was really disappointed
about because it made that movie like a
million times more boring to me but
nobody could why why doesn't anybody
make that claim there and for the record
I agree that Ray was a huge Mary Sue and
it was one of the worst parts of her
character but in the Han Solo movie Han
was absolutely a Gary Stewart and nobody
seems to care about that at all like he
literally starts the movie off as like a
fifteen-year-old like master pilot that
it can hijack everything and do
everything and like okay well I thought
we were well I thought we were watching
like the creation Oh Han Solo not like
by the time we get to the movie even
though he's like 14 years old he's
already like a master everything like
okay
so I'll always objectively shut down
performed at the box office I said yeah
I know but I'm just saying like nobody
would ever call that out like nobody
whatever like when you're a man you face
different criticisms are when your woman
you face much harsher criticism
sometimes then like men would write like
if your character is overpowered again
like this is like an ex commis an ex
kills me critique right if your
character is overpowered and you're a
female you're only overpowered because
of escheat abuse they just want empower
women bla bla bla but if you're a male
character and you're overpowered it's
like okay well maybe it's a shitty
character maybe it's not maybe it's
overpowered maybe it's not but instead
of like getting into the character
analysis it's literally like sjw's made
this person overpowered because it's a
woman it's like okay make is that like
the reason why the character is bad
literally because it's a woman like
that's what like I don't know it's just
how much Westworld the first season yeah
any opinion on the whole realism thing
with women in the battlefield 5 trailer
I don't think realism is like a good
thing to call out for free call of duty
shooters it just feels like a really
dumb cop-out argument when so much of
the game is so hilariously unrealistic
it seems very like when you decide where
you want to pick and choose your
realisms it just it makes me wonder what
your motivations are and people are
never honest about their motivations
right so we always have to inductively
reason out like what's motivating you to
make this complain you know if somebody
looks at a picture if you if somebody
tries to draw like a decently realistic
picture of a classroom full of
schoolchildren and a guy looks at the
picture and he's like you know this
picture the male students the bulges on
their pants just aren't their you know
their dicks would be about this long by
the time they were in fourth grade I
just don't understand your drawing is
just not really accurate like if that
was the criticism that they went with
you would look at that guy like the [ __ ]
that's what you're going with what
that's your that's your that's your
criticism of the the [ __ ] the [ __ ] is
wrong with you right but when you look
at the battlefield trailer right and you
have pretty much another Call of Duty
shooter where you can literally fly in
planes
jump out of one plane rocket launcher
another plane and then hop into another
plane and then fly off right when this
is your game and then somebody looks and
they see a woman isn't making her like
that's not very realistic guising that's
here of all the [ __ ]
that involves shooting in battlefield
your takeaway unrealistic aspect there
like okay interesting that's where you
draw the line like the reason people
don't like women thing in battlefield 5
is it appears to be politically
motivated but that's the problem right
this is the issue is that and again it's
impossible to do if you're a man I can
you can't do it I don't know why you
because people don't naturally men with
you imagine you're a woman right you
can't be in any game without a
justification for being there you can't
have a character in any game unless
there's a good there's gotta be a damn
good reason for you to be there right
like why like why can't I you know if
I'm a woman I can't have a character
that's in a game unless it's gotta have
a whole [ __ ] back he's gotta have a
whole justification it's got up a whole
[ __ ] good ass reason for me they're
like I can't just have a character
that's a woman in the game that I just
not allowed to have that like that's
just completely not allowed unless
there's like it's got to be like the
realistic portrayed sniper from Franklin
World War two it's got to be the British
instance like the SP and I thought like
I can't just have a woman character
that's not allowed but for men
characters you can have a million
different types of ridiculously insane
Rambo tier men characters you don't need
a reason for any of those people you
don't need any reasons but you just make
them out the [ __ ] ass make them
overpowered make them god-tier make them
but whatever you don't need any reasons
for that but if there is a woman
character I've got to sit here and give
you like the [ __ ] spiel I've got to
justify my whole existence just to have
a character that looks like me okay
I think the problem here is the feminist
or SJW rhetoric is being used as the
focal point and entertainment and if you
criticize that you're somehow sexist
equality means women characters can be
criticized too sure and you can
criticize care there are plenty of [ __ ]
[ __ ] women characters dude holy [ __ ]
what are some [ __ ] what are some games
we played recently I'm sure we play
games recently with shitty [ __ ] women
characters they exist but the difference
is that when you criticize a man this
goes back to my whole like how you
insult people in everything right if you
walk into a room with a with a girl do
you have a million ever go to insults
immediately oh what's wrong you PMSing
because you're on your [ __ ] period oh
you're so mad maybe you should go to the
kitchen make me a sandwich oh you know
what are you doing here [ __ ] art
history is that way right there's a
million go to insults for women you walk
into a room with it with a with a white
dude I have to I have to learn something
about you to make fun of you you know
and and it's the same way with with
criticisms and games you know if there's
a male character and you want to say
well that characters [ __ ] you're never
gonna say that character is really
shitty because who's male like why would
they cast a man there like that was so
politically motivated Eric tur a man
that's such a shitty decision to make
city [ __ ] character you would never say
that but you can say you know why would
they cast a woman there that's a shitty
cat like why don't you make that a woman
what a shitty choice for a female
character like it's just bad like why
don't you have the female character
right you criticize the aspect of it
being a female but you'd never criticize
the aspect of it being a male like you
can have shitty women characters but if
your criticism of a shitty woman
character is that it's a woman then it's
like okay well what are you actually
trying to say
destiny is pretending that people don't
like the character because I'm gonna
peel to hyperrealism
in reality was that for aesthetic World
War two trace our character was
hilariously contrived and only created
because of sjws okay
oh I was gonna say this looks a lot like
[ __ ] aliens what the [ __ ]
bye this is a
I disagree I think that history is a
part even in a casual shooter it feels
like rewriting of facts where women are
represented in a situation where they
simply weren't present nothing wrong
with women characters and you're like
first of all wasn't the trailer just a
multiplayer thing that's the first thing
but secondly who cares like why does it
matter it's not like we're actually
relearning history and a history book
like the the problem here's the problem
that I have to deal with okay and I
[ __ ] hate that I have this problem
the problem is that most of you [ __ ]
lie about what you're saying and why you
believe the things you do you [ __ ]
lie about it because you're worried that
what you actually believe is too
offensive or too rude or whatever so I
so I have to play all these [ __ ] mind
games where I have to figure out what
you actually mean right so when people
like you say things like well the
problem I understand that it's okay so
here might be your argument okay it
doesn't have to be hyper-realistic
destiny we can both agree that there are
exaggerations made but these
exaggerations are made for gameplay
purposes okay
yeah you can look up your gun real quick
and run through a hail of bullets but
nobody wants to play an ultra hyper
realistic shooter where you die
instantly as soon as you run through a
field okay but I'm just saying like
putting women there like it just it
destroys the immersive aspect of the
thing I mean I'm not saying that we have
to be like hyper realistic I'm just like
adding women in a place where there were
none you know I totally just raised it
okay it's like this is your position
that this is where you draw the line in
terms of like making something like
realistic or not but you never see these
criticisms when it comes to movies like
Braveheart or it comes to movies like
what's the other big Mel Gibson one
Braveheart of the Patriot where people
are like one guy with a hatchet taking
out like 20 dudes like this is
ridiculous like to save his children and
[ __ ] this is so dumb like this is beyond
[ __ ] like realistic or fake or
whatever this is the dumbest thing like
what about the the [ __ ] in the Patriot
rewriting history some lone dude fooling
hey guys lifetime I died and lived for
lifetime he did have a video of him
dying and living for lifetimes yeah so I
thought I would try like your eyebrows I
wish I could go ahead
like when I excited you were doing it
like a trillion times a second well
explain what's really like an insect
yeah but your face is so 3d like usually
oh my god my dad he became wrecking ball
that was how bad my trip was it was a
bad trip I became it's like worst trip
ever
I believe it would it be like to be me
oh he should so we did a her I did a CT
low semen how do you pronounce it so
Simon still assignment of an accent but
I'm still a cipher so they don't cry 3.5
grams because somebody told me that was
enough to get some good [ __ ] then we
tried it there I tried a second bag and
he thought it was me I was just
babysitting him through the experience
and he thought he was me somehow I was I
lived the life of a crazy person for
when that video of my hired thing
it's funny I wish I can explain like I
picked my phone up and it would say like
951 yeah and then like I'd put it down
and I would live a lifetime that girl
and I'd look it up but then I would say
952 and I can't like it communicate what
that was like oh my god that's that's
what I wanted to comprehend like it
really really was each minute was longer
than the rest of your life experience
was when you felt like you still haven't
decisively said that or maybe that's not
about long and short cuts I promise that
I thought my perception of time was
flawed for probably experiencing things
faster wherever I just thought I was and
that makes sense yeah to me I thought
about now or a little earlier it was
that you should have looked at a clock
with the seconds ticking so then you can
see then you can remember how you
experience the seconds as you watch one
second tick how long I would have felt
islands are like maintaining that much
focus on reality it was impossible so
like you'd be there for like three
seconds it's done yeah it's like the
really frustrating part I'll probably
upload if I if they send this video all
right after I don't know depending
what's it I like I want to just throw
this like whole raw footage online is
really fascinating
like I would be talking I would come out
of it and be talking to environment for
like two seconds then I just [ __ ] go
right back into it oh my god so hard and
it was so frustrating
yeah was it just too human
wait did any of these people ever have
your experience so you didn't do such
watch anything fun while you're doing it
you were just in it so like the way that
I would describe this is like oh he went
past the so to another dimension it's
just him saying yeah so some people he
first he felt like what he described as
a marijuana hi yeah what a good bag I
was like I got marijuana I so everything
that's giggly and kind of funny or
whatever but I don't think that kicked
in yet and then I did seven more grams
and then I think the first one kicked in
and like the wall kept exploding in
color and it was just very kind of like
kind of artsy or whatever but then when
the other two bags kicked in it was into
another dimension like art and [ __ ]
wasn't even something I was thinking
about I was dead right he thought he
died and I was stuck in a loop of death
and I couldn't get out oh he was
repeating the same things over and over
you're like you're Peter when you're a
Pete hold on so the problem isn't like
am i dead you're Peter I know this is
real and you repeated am i you you
thought you were me okay so before I got
to that planet so the problem is that
when the [ __ ] I'm pretty sure I can feel
like very distinctively between the 3.5
grams and then when I hit the 10.5 rose
because of a 3.5 that like they're like
explosions of color and [ __ ] and all
that was kind of funny but then when
like the when the full [ __ ] ten and a
half kick down I was like I got lost in
a loop where I was dead and I couldn't
trust any of my senses for anything it
was real and I heard the voice so like
everybody around me like the very
interesting part is that like I saw like
Byron's face which is like saying like
it's kind of weird how we're like all
here right and then I heard like another
girl never but like say like yeah like
what are the chances that you guys would
be here and then someone else is like oh
yeah you're a real big streamer aren't
you isn't that why you're here and like
the second like gasps like the [ __ ] out
of my reality and like by the time I was
done with this loop after like a mutt it
felt like a million times going through
this because what I would remember was
like I would start the loop and I'd be
like
I don't want to do this and then I would
go through it and then I remember they
like I don't want to do this but how
many millions of times was sorry I just
thought I don't want to do this but I
couldn't hold that [ __ ] long enough
to repeat the loop again and by the end
of it I was just like I don't even you
watch back the video and only one
seconds going by you're saying camp in
my hair wait a second one second you say
am I here am i back so that you go away
under Sadie I lay my ear but like every
time it's like am I here and I lose it I
be gone for like hours in my head and
then I come back to like actually one
second I realize right there one or two
second one or two seconds yeah holy [ __ ]
it's really that your mind can process
so much information in two seconds that
wouldn't that by the way possible
yeah I don't know I think every time I
thing that the scariest things are like
I would keep coming back but every time
I come back I would have this inkling
that it wasn't real anymore and I kept
worrying that I would come back and then
that would actually be reality but I'd
be left with this permanent feeling that
it's not real that was like the worst
[ __ ] feeling in the world right and
then I would keep hearing like voices of
these guys like they would say things
that only I knew but they would say them
to make fun of me like walk talking to
themselves in the back the booth is
inner half yeah oh yeah clue this is all
in my head though but it's like so real
and I'm thinking like this is what
insanity feels like but I can't not hear
them making fun of me in the background
yeah holy sure everyone's contemplated
that maybe I don't know if everyone has
I've contemplated that maybe I'm in
what's what's more likely do i stream
back in when I play the first stream
repetitively playing a card game on the
Internet to the thousands of viewers
we're sitting there watching me or am i
an insane asylum banging my head against
a wall right
what's more likely I would like the
thing that I can't explain I said I went
through this loop so many times that it
didn't matter and this is what felt like
death to me what's that like I would
think for like a fleeting second I'd be
like like okay like I don't wanna be
stuck in this loop and then I would go
through these like bad thoughts and then
ever like okay well what does it even
matter like this is death you're dead
like it doesn't matter what you'd want
or think and I would just like repeat
that loop infinitely like dumb stupid
thoughts and I just remember thinking
like I die I can't believe I did this
trip I actually [ __ ] die I'm so
stupid to do this yeah I got whatever so
long you were worried about forgetting
to breathe that's unrelated I think I
asked you guys like a million times like
don't let me die I think I said that
like a million billion times no every
time wait oh I verified to you something
every time you thought that it would
never end
I'm tilting my head pretty much every
time you thought that it would never end
I said I said up okay you know that time
always moves forward I'm saying it'd be
proves right you know time always moves
forward like you you were a person
before before before you had this
experience you knew time always before
it yeah here your opponent's moving
forward right so like and then it's one
thing and the second thing was you know
that if a human ingested some drug but
it wouldn't the effects of it would not
last forever so if you know those two
things the time moves forward and then
if you ingest drugs forever you'll get
out of it there's the hard part for me
to explain like when you said that to me
it felt like you were saying it like
making fun of me like well if it like
you're saying like of course you know
this because you invented this fiction
to be your reality so isn't it like so
convenient that this will be done soon
isn't it so convenient that you'll pass
this or isn't it so right I think
it's like everything that you would say
to me did try to like assure me was like
my own mind was telling me like well of
course he's saying this because I'm like
trying so hard to maintain the facade
but this is all real so even though you
were off and Kris was actually like the
worst for this no I keep saying the
worst this is just all my head because
he was keep saying things that I knew so
like my mind was saying well I'm
scripting this for him to say so that I
could hear it and then he would say
something oh my god it was just [ __ ]
really so hard yeah I and then you were
imagining people [ __ ] with you
everybody's got saying joseline's yeah
me making you think it was I would never
do but again for thinking there was
reality for a moment yeah but then it
was reality sometimes but I could never
tell those stories I don't know what was
reality and I would keep coming back
into a thing it was real but it wasn't
and then you asked me to do the autistic
numbering thing to pinch you I pinched
you I thought it at my arm
so like the two things that I would the
two things that I think as I do this
sounds really meaning to talk about like
I do a lot of lucid dreaming just
because I do I didn't know it was a good
thing I just do but the ways that I
would always test myself I was dreaming
was as a kid as one if I need to be
presented with new information I think I
said like I think I said man afford to
you like a million times
yeah because I want you to give me some
new information that I can't invent in
my own head that's one thing or order to
do your number thing I asked you to do
the autistic number thing right yeah
because I can't I don't know that the
doubles to update what you do but I know
enough to factor gimmicks I'm not like
inventing dumb [ __ ] so I wanted to
single once and you could you could have
new experience I mean even if you seem
along before you'll remember every year
I'm a movie am I getting stuff that I
know that my head could your head can is
making on again but the problem is that
like I kept thinking that like I am
inventing it and I can't know the
difference it's just no possible way for
me to know because I could be
fabricating a reality in front you know
than I was saying that in whose
dream you've never felt pain rise to
that pitch G yeah and I didn't like that
at all right no but then you said it was
helping I think I said that but I didn't
like another the thing isn't like when
you did that there were moments for like
the problem okay so there's like another
part right McKee reckful it was very
[ __ ] horrible
but when you would like do things like I
think you shook man you told me to stand
up when you would do things that would
feel like somebody who was like reaching
out and I felt some part of my mind I
was like wait a second I'm not actually
dead this is real but then everybody in
my mind would go back to gaslighting me
and you would become part of the
fabricated reality experience I'm soon
so while I was doing that while I was
doing that there were other actors
around you fabricating here yeah
constantly and I'd there was no and the
thing that I realized is that the point
I'm trying to decide if I want to do
this future well because I actually felt
insane and I remember thinking like this
is insanity because let's see this yeah
yeah sorry I don't know the thing is it
like when you imagine what it would be
like for your senses to betray you your
cognitive experience is the one
architecting it but when your senses
themselves are actually betraying you
when I look at my phone and it says like
10 51 and then I like watch you guys
walk around the room and we live lives
in this room and I look at my phone
again it's 1052 like but I know that
everything I oh god I just can't because
your senses are lying to you like how
you can't trust anything and I would
yeah it's not like there came up when
were like so reckful kept trying to ask
me like what is it what is happening
because wreck because I would keep
coming back and I think I asked in real
life I think I said didn't I was like
I'm I think I'm back is this real life
yeah and I was what I'm asking I was
saying yes yeah it didn't feel like
seconds it felt like hours and hours
just reminded me there's some show my
name is just a black mirror so to make
it less cool but something about
somebody suddenly goes and lives a life
a whole life with a new life in this
little Hut somewhere in a place where
there's a there's no water oh no it's a
Star Trek episode starts my day no
here's a Star Trek episode I remember
someone suddenly goes and lives Star
Trek next generation their whole life
and on some other planet where there's
um it must be someone's took trips I
think this episode because it sounds
like you're experienced and there's
there's a drought and you're they're
trying to save this is your head and
they do grow old this is 70 years ago by
and just like it was just a second yeah
which is not it's at almost as intense
as what you're describing yes well
probably not that's actually like really
far though yeah but how long that's what
it where you go felt like I was spending
a lifetime's in these lifetimes that's
what you're saying like that was my
whole exist I'm yeah that was one
lifetime yeah so you really experience
with that episode of Star Trek I like my
who I was as a person became a distant
fleeting memory yo I saved today you
know filled me it was like the person I
was was like a distant fleeting memory
and everyone here at gasps what the [ __ ]
Adam is so much in my mind they're like
whatever I thought I was going into that
like I didn't exist to him but that
didn't even matter because who was I to
even think about whether that mattered
because that was part of my past self
that would even care about it so none of
it action matter and I was dead for an
hour
I was just dead for lifetime so I was
actually done while you were dead what
were you experiencing I would so like
the thing that would happen is I would
get stuck in this loop and I know you're
experiencing a loop while you're dead
why do you think I did because you think
you're dead I never got that part I
never said that these I didn't remember
who I was or I didn't think that
the problems are like I keep using I
statements but I can't really and you
didn't have an eye
it wasn't an eye yeah it was like I was
just like passive observer to some pest
some horrible [ __ ] and then like when I
think horrible shredders been a random
not just images that mean nothing and
don't make me happy or anything and that
like who I was as a person was like some
of that past [ __ ] like when you did
come to for a moment and see me and see
your arms and stuff it made everything
worse I don't get that because oh my god
so what would happen was I would come
back for a second and I would say like
ask you is this real yeah yeah that's me
thank you very much I would ask you I
would come out for a lil thing I asked
it was real and then you would say yes I
was positive at return that as soon as I
would say that like the room would just
like [ __ ] go into Fantasyland again
and so I asked you so many times is this
real you know saying yes but it probably
you were gas like in my existence
because as soon as he would say yes I
would lose it again right well you kept
saying was real but it wasn't real
but then but then I realized that it
didn't matter if anything was real what
who you to even care if anything was
real because if I'm what I'm curious
about is if I try it if I tried it would
I care that it's not real because I I'm
calling of content with if I lived in a
dream world for the rest of my life I'm
fine with that
I wasn't that was my priority fine with
it right now no I hated it was the worst
part of the idea of living a dream Oprah
no oh I'm fine with it okay I'm not so
maybe we'll be different for you yeah
what I'm gonna be like for you yeah
because there is like some fleeting like
incontestable small part of me that was
saying that like you shouldn't be okay
with being dead but I couldn't like
figure it out I couldn't hold the
thought long enough to just man and I
kept coming back to it thinking that I
probably thought this thought a trillion
times before but it doesn't matter
because I'm dead and I'm probably stuck
in this loop forever right oh my god
that's something it's holy [ __ ] I'm I
want okay so let's say other people
think yeah I wouldn't recommend this
yeah if you're not like oh you wouldn't
recommend it but it is the eyes you talk
about it I'm more and more interested
but at the same time I'm scared shitless
of being trapped somewhere fur fur feels
like longer than your life oh my god
it's the worst feeling in the world
significantly longer than your life
you're like you're dead you're
infinitely dead forever
it's like your life becomes like a
distant memory that you don't even
remember anymore like I couldn't even
put together pieces well but it was cuz
you guys kept like gaslighting me in my
head to make me think that like what I
was saying wasn't real and like oh my
god we should have screamed the whole
thing we should I went to Airbnb though
which just say the whole thing it looks
like it was fascinating and you never
want to do it again
I don't think I could do that again oh
my god I died it was I don't want to die
again
Oh oh my god
you came through selling I want to so I
was um yeah sorry so we I was gonna do
somebody said that like if you wanted to
do shrooms the first time you should do
1.5 whatever I was like I want a hero
truck with a 3.5 so I did a 3.5 and I
was like let's go even higher and I need
seven more so this is a 10.5 trip anyway
yeah I went to another dimension getting
multiple dimensions oh my god what if an
artist aney a piston II and the main
funny favor intended must feel like
you're being [ __ ] Oh No well yeah
cuz you understand me cuz we get each
other but most people would say that
like why would you ever go after an
experience like this but it's like I
have to have to know what it's like
which i think is the ER thing right now
you're just like intensely curious yeah
I want to know absolutely I was reading
you and I say man you negated it to you
trust me you can communicate it but it's
more frustrating I know I have to
experience them to know but it it's
oppressing me I have to experience
actually it's probably like the [ __ ]
hello your mics ready now yeah what the
[ __ ] oh yeah what's that I'll message
you what it is what what is what I'm a
okay yeah what wait you know I'm
streaming right no I'm not streaming no

Oh Dan why why you're not not flying
first-class Stan I'm not gonna do our
passports under my kid what what content
I can't even stream hey guys you and
another crazy the craziest airline
experience I had dude when I was flying
last holy [ __ ] okay check this out so
I'm on the plane this [ __ ] takes off
okay we are 35,000 feet in the air and I
realized that I forgot to shield and
Lord Smallville before the plane takes
off so I've got my phone out and I'm
like kind of catch like every cell phone
tower like I can barely just log in but
I can't do anything after cuz I keep
leaving the cell phone tower range and
like 20 minutes into the flight I'm
actually able to login using [ __ ] 3G
and shield on my account from there yeah
oh yeah I could have believe it dude it
was some Verizon [ __ ] man I was actually
anything in my mind was [ __ ] I
remember reading about 9/11 people
getting cell phone signals like how the
[ __ ] know that was like some special
plane [ __ ] I think like that's like the
plane phone or whatever right I don't
know people were sending like text
messages and said I thought even think
text message existed during 9/11 I
thought I heard something about this but
I don't know reputable it was just had
to use the [ __ ] numbered head touch
phones back then wait there's no way the
texting existed in 2001 [ __ ] one what
do you mean of course it did maybe like
on pagers if that but I don't could you
even send a message on pagers or could
you just call them they had phones that
could do text messages they had SMS in
2001 dumb [ __ ]
what is what was this old boys like me
and Dan would know that in 2001 I would
have been in fifth grade sixth grade
what oh maybe I was out there getting
ass no I'm saying
yikes
okay if they're if text messaging
existed this was literally like the
advent of the technology like there were
three people two phones a good text
there's no [ __ ] way I really do not
think that's the [ __ ] case that was
the 2001 was the era of those like Nokia
phones with snake on them and you could
text on those [ __ ] phones and people
text it on this phone
Stephen you could text on those phones
he's trying to disprove me already five
had a phone in 2001 that text then and
that's a Twitter chatter so who you guys
are texting what did you have to do like
like hey who's in class anyone else here
have a cell phone and like one other
[ __ ] geek in the bag like oh I
actually have the new Nokia 20 X 7 for
you this wasn't the day of analog
[ __ ] car phones this was like Nokia
phones that the indestructible ones
these are like Nokia phones with like 28
pixels on the [ __ ] screen these
phones with [ __ ] this is before thee
before even blackberries existed these
are like you hate your days you would
message your drug dealer like hey man
you got any laundry to do sit like that
no yeah I don't think that's how it went
down but they didn't use cell phones on
the wire did they and like the first
season that was 2002 it Jim well they
just didn't use them because they can be
tracked No
yeah cuz they talk about getting um yeah
I think in like season five in season
five they started using cell phones and
[ __ ] wasn't it season literally one oh
wait no they might have used pagers
beepers yeah but they was had to go like
then they swap to the payphones and I
remember that like season five was with
marleau that's when they were buying
like the burner cell phones
was it one season a year they do yeah I
guess all right no I'm not sure beepers
were pretty much rolling out around 2002
I don't think you oh my god
did you ever have the [ __ ] [ __ ]
phones well you could talk on them like
walkie-talkies do you know what I'm
talking about
my dad got one of those and he gives the
coolest dude it was like you know check
does that anybody any be like hey so say
what's up to my aunt and it's like hey
what's up and they were like - oh my god
that [ __ ] was so [ __ ] dumb oh that
was the [ __ ] meme because anyone who
also had an ex tell you didn't pay any
that's a horrible gray [ __ ] [ __ ] on
the side and push the button the yellow
goddamn nasties not good phone what is
him remember all the cell phone plans
back then it was like oh you have 200
minutes and roll over oh my dad was just
owned me he actually had to like he left
that side but that cell phone bill is
still outstanding so my dad um my dad
would let me use his or no he wouldn't
yeah I would take my dad's stuff when
sometimes to make calls to friends
because we were playing back when me
Chris and I were playing runescape we
would like three-way that's how we talk
- sure we did call each other then you'd
switch lines you call another person
you'd switch back and you'd be in a
three-way call well my dad told me that
he had three minutes past seven o'clock
so it's like okay cool
well the way that the data worked back
then data was cheap as [ __ ]
what are you talking about the way that
the data worked was he had free calling
past 7:00 p.m. or whatever right so what
I do yeah so I call like Chris or Kyle
at like 650 or whatever 655 cuz you know
we're ready to [ __ ] pk do antenna
which was seven o'clock well what the
way that the phone build it was that if
you started a call before 7:00 you were
billed for every minute it was only call
started after 7:00 so like the first
month of me doing this my dad got like a
$2,000
oh yeah that [ __ ] went on pay that line
got deactivated died damn dude yeah that
was some [ __ ] Wild West of that [ __ ]
[ __ ] who it was singular back then and
next tell who the [ __ ] else was doing
[ __ ] back that [ __ ] was a disaster
having a cellphone did you ever have a
pager no fine I should what was the the
cheap way to have a [ __ ] cell phone
how old were you in 2000 linked to
Stephen and while I was born an 88 so in
2002 I don't know whatever that is 14 of
course you can have a [ __ ] pager yeah
don't forget your lunch
this is something that's like really
interesting to me is that like I can't
imagine going through school with cell
phones now that's got to be so weird
like you've got like a literal [ __ ]
computer like I couldn't even
concentrate with a [ __ ] ti-83 dude
cuz I was playing Phoenix all the time
on that [ __ ] if I would had a goddamn
cell phone oh my god I can't just no
cell phone policies and clauses what are
you no not yet I don't know what I would
get him on or what I'm not sure what I
would do that's what I was thinking
about too like asking for an iPhone [ __ ]
that
no no no you know I keep track of him
then maybe gonna start walking home from

experience to have right now an Airbnb I
think they just the ends like 90% of
them in Japan now did they really ban
them that well they I think they kicked
out like 90% like a few days ago I was
reading and that how much filling hotels
in Japan are they expensive as [ __ ] I
mean I stayed at the Westin yeah a real
good hotel I don't know if it's real
good it's not a well citizen it's like 4
or 5 star it was all the breakfast was
[ __ ] mmm at breakfast that was some
good [ __ ] tell you what you really like
Hotel good wait I would feel like I will
go to a hotel I will go to a hotel if it
has an amazing breakfast that's like a
big requirement for me and that
breakfast has to go till 11:00 cuz I do
why do you go to a hotel breakfast
[ __ ] there's nothing better than
waking up taking your shower and just
[ __ ] walking downstairs and having
this giant [ __ ] buffet of amazing
food free to sit down and wait they
usually charge you if you're in a really
nice dunno why Brides they never been
charged for a breakfast before at a
hotel ever really never in my life maybe
that's like you know high or some [ __ ]
there's when I go home we went to I
swear to Christ it no you can't eat I've
been in Cleveland we went to the Ritz
and they would make you pay oh I've
never been like in a super hotel like
that I guess and any Marriott or Hilton
of every state are they always it's
always complimentary yeah Marriott
points I got Holiday Inn Express points
[ __ ] combining
oh yeah I got to [ __ ] my car over to
tell you how much that cost Oh a pageant
I've been in the car with you driving
we're not getting a rental car there oh
I can you got a little little do you got
to loosen up no I wouldn't want to live
I'm rich but you're driving because
people I used to like super grandma
drivers and I don't drive I haven't even
that bad dude you should have seen
Jenner's was about to like throw up in
my face oh she was like freaking yeah oh
yeah well I don't know what point but I
remember in the car at [ __ ] twitchcon
I was in the back of your car with I
think I forget who the [ __ ] it was you
were all over the [ __ ] place there's
a difference between all over any place
I'm moving forward very quickly not all
those pretty well in LA and in like
[ __ ] Fast and the Furious I'm 17 and
I put a coffee can exhaust a faster
furious is when I was in it when I was
in Omaha with him I thought he was about
to flip the car on one of the corners he
didn't like on the data turns fast okay
I can't help those red eyes you got I'm
pretty sure that you lost control a
little bit like well you doing like I
don't even know what it's not true yeah
just making sure enough line up the bro
you got to get right up to that edge you
know how it goes in the backseat of this
car you're being thrown around like a
[ __ ] animal put your seatbelt on
that's what they're for my seatbelt on
and I had those two chicks in the
backseat like [ __ ] smashing me into
the window he was doing you a [ __ ]
favor dude
finally giving you some cuddle time so
yeah I don't think the rental car is the
super idea plus you're on the other side
of the road and I don't think I can do
it I think I'm a decent driver I don't
think I think there's too much muscle
memory not to be on that side of the
road
you should use your brain well but that
yeah hey hello

the questions anyway so none of the dumb
[ __ ] will hopefully get it okay what's
happening here okay already ready to go
in ever you guys alright
do I move back up uh I'll get you one
second okay okay okay all right everyone
thank you for joining us today for the
destiny a the chat provided above
obviously will be your resource for
asking questions we have the one and
only Omni destiny joining us today to
answer all of your questions so we can
get some insight on his life and his
great with veganism obviously I'll be
sure to link his YouTube channel and
description at the end of this that's me
thank you for joining us how about you
start us off with who you are what your
content is centered around what you plan
on doing in the future
hey my name is a destiny in real life I
go by Steve and Bunnell I used to be
video game streamer I still do a lot of
video games but then I've kind of gotten
into politics a lot recently and a lot
of people kind of know me from the
political conversations that I have on
my live stream and on YouTube yeah I so
will just go straight in with like the
questions so the first one comes from
Sir Humphrey and his question is doesn't
democracy and everybody lead to populism
and demagoguery I don't know how to say
that word Jesus that's a heavy [ __ ]
question I don't know it sounds like it
could Christopher a Poli Sci major as
far as I'm aware it because I had
questions about this I was carries from
what I've been told populism comes and
goes basically eventually people get fed
up with the system a populist candidate
comes up everybody supports them and
then after they spend some time in
office people realize they don't get
[ __ ] done and then it kind of goes away
for a little bit but but I mean I don't
know I don't know like theory of
government or how populism or
demagoguery comes it goes demagoguery is
like a thing that's kind of always been
president our politics as long as it's
like an appeal to popularity right
you're always gonna have demagogues so
but yeah I don't know like the the
cyclical nature of populism I don't know
if I like equipped to answer that okay
sure
okay so the second one it comes from
Blackburn and I think he wants to asking
himself so I'm just going to
we okay unmute him right blackburn you
have to chat about burning oh it's just
like why are you against capital
punishment why am i against capital
punishment yeah I guess in general idea
that like um punishment I'm just not a
big fan of like when I look at like
criminal justice I look at any form of
punishment it's supposed to be like
rehabilitation I think like the goal is
to take somebody that doesn't work in
society and make it so they do work in
society like if you look at children or
animals for instance when you punish
them usually the goal is to correct a
behavior so I think that punishment
should kind of you know fit like a model
that corrects behavior and rehabilitates
people capital punishment doesn't seem
to do that I mean I guess unless the
person is literally so far gone that we
think there's no chance of them ever
being rehabilitated in which case but
you know I guess go for it okay okay
sure so this second question this other
question comes from cig natural and I'm
pretty sure yeah you may be familiar
with them is you know from member into
the best in the community so I'll just
be sure to meet him here oh cool all
right yeah what was the one okay yeah do
you still consider yourself an
anti-theist
should the entire world move away from
spiritual thought if so who hike so kay
these are really big philosophy
questions and there are people that have
argued both sides better than I can
so let me preface this by saying this is
my very personal subjective opinion okay
I am very much a materialist
spiritualism or anything like that for a
variety of reasons so personally I think
that more people should move away from
religion that being said I mean religion
offers some value in terms of forming
communities and communities building up
around religion there's a lot of charity
work that goes on religious there's a
lot of like empirical good that's done
by religious organizations I guess I
would argue that I would hope that we
could continue to do that empirical good
without religion and then you know we
can leave the spiritualism and all the
bad stuff that comes with religion
you know as well as the religion but
yeah yeah I guess I got so I guess like
I would answer that like I it would be
cool if we could leave religion behind
and keep like the good acts that we
still do without it I don't
if that's even possible you're my muse
Sam Harris in this regard the police
don't compare me to Harris I [ __ ]
yeah I'm not a big fan of religion
because it comes with a lot of baggage
the problems that if you have to lie to
somebody to make them do something good
then the lies can can lead to bad things
as well I'm so for instance people's
stances on things like abortion or a
stance on like how should we educate
people publicly you know is the earth
6,000 years old and different kind of
weird moral positions that people can
take as a result of their religion and
not any type of actual rational thought
those are all like negative aspects of
religions uh yeah thanks and this one
comes from Justin and Justin once that's
this himself so I'll be sure to the on
media hi Justin oh [ __ ] oh [ __ ] home let
me see you a question I had oh yeah
what's your favorite here to play in
league I play Draven most of the time
next one comes from actual communist boy
and what are your thoughts on the
inevitable demise of capitalism due to
the falling rate of profit causing
unceasing econo political crisis oh man
dude these are like these are like above
my paygrade everything I know with a
little bit I know of economics is always
like analysed through a capitalist
lengths of any solutions that it would
give you to things like income
inequality or the uneven distribution of
profits - I guess capitalist people that
own capital in the US I would always try
to solve these through the framework of
capitalism so some sort of redistribute
of government policy or something I
don't know if what comes after
capitalism or if something comes captive
capitalism I just I don't really know
the answer to that question I'm not sure
I think this requires like a pretty
solid understanding of how economies and
governments interact with one another
and I don't know what to that level see
I wasn't lying when I said this as a
community of academics right yeah
I mean yes it's like what Das Kapital is
about the whole thing by Marx isn't he
talk about like what happens after
capitalism and [ __ ] I'm sure he's got
some good things to say on the subject
and while he has a question you'd like
to ask you and he'd like to ask you this
personally so go ahead long all right
cool it what's up all right so all right
this might be a long question
so I'd say I've seen you debate about
you know veganism immorality and I've
heard you say that you don't think
there's objective morality which I agree
with and when we talk about politics I
think pretty much every political
statement you know is at the root comes
from somewhere either you know maybe
it's wealth for the greater good it
helps in those people or you know helps
me it you know ultimately has to come
down to a moral statement and because
you know there's no objective morality
does that mean that there is no
objective political truth like at all
that's basically it well I mean I I
agree with your premise that political
truths are I mean you're essentially
asking questions to philosophy right
anytime we anytime we ask an odd
question it's essentially boils down to
an ethical or a philosophical question
so like what ought we do in society pop
you know for via policy odd we help
people better poor ought we help people
that are homeless or whatever so insofar
as can there be objective political
truths I mean you can make factual like
descriptive claims I guess so for
instance in a democracy people vote for
the government I mean that's a true
statement but if you're asking if we can
make true statements about how
government act like government ought to
take care of you know poor people in
society government ought not interfere
with business I mean I don't think you
can make an objectively truthful claim
there like in a vacuum we have to do it
like under some under some moral
framework that we all agree on in order
to start making like statements of what
government awe do right yeah yeah that's
just hard because a lot of I've seen
what when you debate people a lot of the
time you kind of like and I mean
everyone does it's the kind of you have
to skip over that because it's you don't
want it to but you don't want to go okay
let's debate morality so they'll kind of
disagree on morality but you'll be
debating about politics and stuff and at
the root you guys just disagree so it's
it's hard to debate so that's what I was
asking yeah I think so there
two things don't instead of that one the
debates that I do have nothing to do
with like how like what an intelligent
real-world debate should sound like on
this topic this is something that I
discovered unfortunately really quickly
the I debate like the lowest dredges of
Cepeda tea it's just not even nothing
that I debate should be like reference
was like well this would be like a good
like if somebody would say you know
what's a good position to take on this
form of government I would never
recommend like oh well watch this debate
with Romig millennial or sargon of akkad
or Andy Warsi or get like these are not
good debates it's literally just people
who are too [ __ ] stupid to even talk
about what they're talking about and
then we just kind of shout at each other
for a while they're not productive at
all in that sense
and then the yeah and then the second
part is that I think that I think that
as as a society even though we all kind
of have different fundamental moral
platforms these we share enough in
common that two people of different
platforms can kind of come together and
make an agreement on what like a policy
should be that's kind of the the magic
of society that a religious person an
atheist person could still agree on
certain fundamental tenets for instance
murder and stealing is wrong so we can
make laws that punish people from
murdering and stealing and stuff like
that
now when you get into more gray areas
like well what should taxation look like
what should a social welfare look like
those honestly become questions of a
personal philosophy more and the people
don't argue that which I think they
should but for a lot of the basics I
think we kind of can come to an
agreement on things okay the next
question is normal men so my question
was wouldn't you agree that the left is
responsible for pushing the all ray or
the far right whether you want to call
that underground via shaming tactics and
would you want to stalk the still
licking cartridge debate I go back and
forth on this a lot I actually radically
changed my viewpoint on this a while ago
if you would have watched anything I
said talked about like three or four
years ago I was pretty much like a dave
rubin copy-pasted like the free
marketplace of ideas will always prevail
okay so - okay so two parts so firstly I
do believe that there has probably been
I'm only speaking in the United States I
cannot speak specifically to other
in Western countries okay but I can see
specifically in the United States I feel
like a lot of racist and kind of
disgusting thought I say disgusting kind
of begging the question right from my
point of your disgusting thought has
been kind of shush and pushed
underground a lot in in like the
workplace in Hollywood and all of our
big like culture outlets and I think
that it kind of festered and we didn't
realize it and I think this is kind of
evident during the presidential election
you know there were a lot of times when
even I and I like to consider myself
like pretty understanding of most people
there were a lot of statements that
Trump said where I was like okay wow
this is way too extreme you know even
for Republicans like people are gonna be
okay with this type of thought however
not only were people okay with it a lot
more people than we thought would be
okay with it we're okay with it so it's
obvious that shush it and just kind of
pushing it under the carpet doesn't seem
to work as well as we would want it to
because you know almost half the country
is still in favor of trap or voted for
him at least I don't know ice approvals
like 40% now but um so I don't know in
terms of shutting it I don't know I
don't think that seems to be a great
tactic now for the second part in terms
of like debating it the big problem that
I run into is a lot of people are either
intentionally dishonest which is
something that I have to deal with so
much is people taking things I say out
of context misquoting me and attributing
to me statements that I've never made or
don't support and a lot of people are
grossly ill-equipped to have these
conversations and I think that these two
things do a great damage to the public
discourse so for instance I mean we can
look at this
the Tony is it Tony Robinson Robin toe
with a guy that just got arrested in the
UK do you know his name it's Tony
Robbins right Tommy Roberts yeah like
marooned like kind of like right-leaning
or center or skeptic leaning circles you
know he was arrested because of free
speech like he was arrested because he's
a because because they didn't like his
political views like oh wow okay that's
a whole different conversation then he
was a less arrested because of a law in
the UK that makes it so that you can gag
certain reporting on on different types
of lawsuits for a certain amount of time
those are two totally different
conversations you know and and I think
there is a valid conversation to be had
about the UK's practice here but you
can't even have that conversation
because so many people are lying about
why he actually got arrested so like in
terms of like a free marketplace of
ideas it's really hard to make that work
when one side is so [ __ ] dishonest
about every [ __ ] thing they say and
this is the issue that I have with like
Trump right now
again to go back like free marketplace
of ideas okay well Trump just tweeted a
three million illegal immigrants to
voted in the election with absolutely no
evidence like how is this a marketplace
of ideas when I have to engage with
people that on ironically think that
there's like five hundred thousand buses
of immigrants being bused into places
and nobody saw it like this is
ridiculous you know wait am I allowed to
say yeah so next question comes from Evy
and it's about transgenderism
go ahead BV hey there I was just
wondering what your thoughts are on
transgenderism in like American society
and why you would sort of hold certain
opinions about transgender people wait
what's your pinyons just your opinions
on like how they can exist in society
why they would why they would exist
I guess it's so this is this is actually
something that I've been like wrestling
with quite a bit recently this is a I
don't know how like an depth you like I
should answer this I guess um to be
somewhat brief I mean like I'm pretty
big on everybody doing whatever they
want to do as long as they're not
hurting anybody as far as I'm aware as
far as the APA is concerned the most
effective ways to to quote unquote treat
my guest gender dysphoria which is the
the incredibly discomforting feeling you
get when your body doesn't match what
you think it should that some of the
most effective ways to treat that are
things like transitioning so I mean as
long as that remains the case which is
what I believe it is right now I mean
I'm in support of anybody doing what
they need to do to not kill themselves
and to feel better about themselves so
that I guess that's like I'm like a
medical treatment point of view in terms
of like stuff like like bathrooms and
whatnot I don't really I don't know I
don't a lot of these I just don't care
about like Republicans talking about
like transgender people going into
bathrooms and raping kids and it just
sounds really [ __ ] stupid to me for
instance like I wouldn't want to send my
girl into a little bathroom with a fully
grown man it's like okay well I have
your old son should I be scared of
setting him into a bathroom with a full
agreement like I don't know these
arguments all make sense so I mean I'm
okay with people using whatever
bathrooms they want yeah I guess those
are like my answers in like a policy
point of view did you want something
different or okay yeah sure okay this
one comes from me I wanted to ask you if
you could elaborate on your contention
with the LGBTQ community and they need
to categorize you not think collective
identity or labels is important for
marginalized groups oh this is something
I've had to wrestle with a lot over the
past couple years it's it's probably
important I guess like the the two
things that I struggle with is you have
the world as you want it to be and then
the world as it is
and sometimes I argue a little bit too
much concerning a world that I would
want to exist rather than what we have
now I mean like I would argue that I
think that you shouldn't need to label
yourself in order to get some kind of
value out of yourself that that labels
and belonging to groups and all of that
just kind of stifles like individual
thought and I would argue that it's
generally a negative thing that I think
being as individual as possible is
generally a good thing I say that though
however and I mean I make my whole
living being an individual and I'm also
not part of any marginalized or
oppressed group as far as I know except
for being a gamer which is the most
oppressed group so I mean it's easy for
me is kind of like a white straight guy
to say that I do acknowledge that there
are probably benefits so I guess let me
do kind of an agreeable statement I
acknowledge that there are benefits if
yo is that you yeah yeah what somebody
oh wait that X is you I thought that was
a troll wait some people worried I
thought people are trolling me when they
said they wanted you to talk but you
actually do want to talk oh no [ __ ]
everybody my chat is saying that you
wanted to talk to me is this just people
being [ __ ] [ __ ] I mean I kind of
do want to talk out over here why not I
mean but yeah people think to be an
option a few five months ago and it was
like literally a minute of nothing in a
way mm-hmm and then I was like okay like
someone just told me pretty much but uh
yeah it's all good so wait how you been
doing all right I've been doing okay
nobody I'm doing good but yeah I was
just watching some odd sauce of these
plugs really could be and I'm just like
reacting to them and then they think
that I'm starting some sort of drama
when I'm just talking about [ __ ] it's
actually very frustrating what do you do
what are you doing you're like painted a
certain way you know and you can't see
like I just stay my little cubby you
play for tonight forever is that like
what have to do I mean kind of I think
the problem is that if you ever like
give into it like all they want is to
get a reaction out of you right like
that's the goal yeah and then if you
react yeah I mean it's really shitty I
would just Instagram people let's do it
I get hit by linking clips like trying
to get you to [ __ ] talk people I would
just ban them I actually like it they're
trying to get you to do it yeah they're
trying to bait me into she talking yeah
when people do that [ __ ] imagine I just
ban people yeah yeah are you baiting me
but like I was talking about some like
some pretty true [ __ ] I guess I think
you would agree with all the saying but
honestly I don't think it matters the
other thing like I really don't think
that twitch gives a [ __ ] about like the
truth I think it's all about just like
entertainment you know I mean so I don't
know I don't know why I keep like giving
a [ __ ] about like what you know I think
I just give a [ __ ] about the wrong
things like I think I just need to just
be as entertaining as I possibly can and
it's like stop caring about what
everyone thinks and [ __ ] you know I mean
yeah I mean if you can that's really
[ __ ] hard to do but yeah well it's
not that hard to do you just have to
like dude I scream for night with like
no chat I just didn't open my chat the
whole stream and I had a great stream so
it's like like it sucks I have to do
that but it's just like that's kind of
where I'm at you know I would say like
your ultimate goal is to eventually be
able to interact with chat because
that's probably a good thing and just
try to band the people that are trolling
in there you can
yeah cuz I'm sure like you do have fans
it like you that I'm just trying to like
get you to like troll or whatever you
know yeah yeah no I definitely I
definitely understand that I just I'm
looking for like the people I'm looking
for the people that like I'm looking I
guess I'm trying to change how people
view me but that's like impossible no
it's not it just makes a long time you
can do it I mean look at what's going on
with doctor disrespect like people are
starting to get a more favorable view of
him and I didn't even think that was
ever gonna happen wait what do you mean
what happened
well cuz of the whole like wife Omega
Lowell that show that show yeah yeah
wait but why are they looking at him in
a different way now as time goes on he
hasn't been reacting to it as much and
he's just like get my posting clips
about other [ __ ] I wonder if that [ __ ]
gets to him yeah I'm sure it gets to
everybody and [ __ ] is annoying as [ __ ]
I'm sure yeah well yeah there's people
just harassing him constantly about it
yeah that definitely sucks but no there
was I was watching reckful and execute
podcast and they were talking about like
the whole leaching situation I I guess I
kind of want like your aspect on that
like have you have you ever been like I
guess like clinical leached off of or
network or whatever the [ __ ] you want to
call it yeah it's possible I would
caution against anything that xqc a guy
says I don't know much about him I don't
like he just doesn't seem very
intelligent to me that's just my I don't
know much about him but that's just I
would say for in terms of like leaching
I guess like the way that I view it is
like if I hang out with people I do it
because I enjoy their presence and often
times me enjoying their presence will
boost my own stream so for instance if
I'm playing with a friend and I get
along really well with that friend
people are not only enjoying watching
you know me and the friend but they
watch me more because they like the way
that I interact with them right yeah
yeah for sure yeah I know all about that
yeah invariably every single thing you
do because we're streamers everything we
do is marketing right whether you admit
it or not so if I do a charity stream to
some extent that's marketing people are
gonna watch me more because I think I'm
a good person or whatever like that [ __ ]
is all part of the game yeah that's what
I hate destiny I hate it so much man
like people do these nice things but
they're only doing it so they've looked
nice like that's what I actually [ __ ]
hate so much man like I I can smell it
on people man like I really watch this
[ __ ] I'll be like okay like but I know
the underlying reason of it you don't I
mean yeah but like this like why does it
matter because it bothers me like I
don't know why
because it's like I know the truth but
like they're trying to push a different
narrative that is like it's like just to
make themselves look better or whatever
you know I mean and it's like the most
triggering thing to me like I just can't
explain like I don't even know why
stream anymore man like I'm not built
for this industry like I'm I say
whatever's on my mind I am I literally
have like a sense of this book like you
know I mean like but I'm like real like
and I'm not saying that's like stroke my
own dick but like I say what's when I
believe you know I don't sit there and
placate [ __ ] so to get more viewers or
like do any of that [ __ ] you know I mean
yeah the thing is that like you can do
both like I did you both for a long time
let me just have regrets this specific
thing okay this is really hard to
understand but like I think that people
are very obsessed with sincerity and
when we're doing entertainment we don't
necessarily have to be sincere
so I'm sincere because that's part of my
brand but like there let's say that you
have somebody that wants to do charities
but like secretly like they're kind of
an [ __ ] who cares why does it matter
like let's say that you raise like a
hundred thousand dollars to feed kids in
Africa or some [ __ ] do you think that
like if you wouldn't take a flight over
to Sudan and tell one of the kids like
hey the guy that raised the money for
you to do this he actually wanted
because he wanted to look better like do
you think they actually care or like I
don't think I'm looking into like a
deepness and [ __ ] maybe I should just
stop looking deep and look at the
surface of things but what do you mean
what do you mean by deepness though not
like I see everything dude like it's a
curse man like especially with twitch I
know exactly why this person saying that
I know exactly why this person is doing
that I know exactly what I know
everything like I just see it I see it
yeah but I mean I don't think the curse
is looking too deep I think your curse
is that you're very judgmental and I
think that I don't think it serves
anything yeah that's that could be true
that could be very true so you're saying
I'm judging but what if my judgment is
correct okay so like let's say that I do
a charity okay so let's say you secretly
know me okay and then let's say that I
do charity but in real life I'm like
kind of an [ __ ] like why does that
matter what does that have to do with
anything because it's not your that's
not you wouldn't do that unless people
were watching you do it sure but that's
part of my job but like why does it
matter like let's say that I'm gonna do
a charity and I know the only reason I'm
doing it is because I want to get more
viewers doing it like I know that if I
do this charity any more viewers doing
it well then I would say that you're not
a genuine person and that's that's what
I I don't respect that that's that's
like where I
that's what I would say yeah but they
don't know I'm trying to get to the meat
of this like why does that matter
like who cares like why does it I guess
it matters because you're indirectly
lying to everybody that's why I'm addict
lying how you're being disingenuous your
self you're not being you're just you
keep going back to this being genuine
like it's some like inherently good
thing like I don't like when I know
somebody's actual personality and actual
core and then they play this completely
opposite card on Twitch that's why I
hate theirs but in the thing is that
like you've made this judgment that
twitch is where you go to show people
your true personality but I don't I
think I I got that off of I guess
reckful man like he made me feel
terrible for having a persona do you
understand like there are people that do
that but I don't but it doesn't matter I
mean if you want to do that like why not
that's what that was like reckless whole
thing and that's why I respected him for
it because I always felt like he was
super real and super smart [ __ ] right
but like I I don't know like I just I
try to understand or I tried to like
change and be better but all that's
happened is I've hurt my stream you know
what I mean oh yeah oh no okay this is
something you really have to understand
okay
being genuine one stream is not
necessarily better than being fake blood
stream these are why why why explain
explain explain why why what do you
think about that Shelly I'm not blaming
I'm saying he put it in my face that I
was being quote-unquote fake and I tried
to change that that's all I'm saying
that wreck reckful made it blatantly
obvious to me and everyone else what was
going on i guess and minh mang have to
or want to change to be more real okay
because he thinks being real is
important but so this is what I would
ask you okay let's say you got some guy
and he gets like 2,000 viewers and let's
say he was like okay well you know if I
changed the way that I act on stream I
get like four thousand viewers why would
you say don't do that why would you say
no oh
see I could change the way I'm acting
right now and get more viewers I could
do it right now destiny is that worth
doing what's up to you is it I don't
know that's the thing I don't know
what's worth to me like here's what I
know I want people to stop thinking that
like I am dissing genuine or like a bad
person or a bad friend or some shakers
those are all false all false I mean
okay again okay this is you have
something you have to fit you have to
solve this in your head okay you can't
like move passes being disingenuous on
stream is not an intrinsically bad thing
you have in your head you have this on
like a good to bad radar or like it like
a spectrum
we're like the faker you are the worst
you are and the more genuine you are the
better you are but that's not like
intrinsic true like that's not
necessarily true like if you go on
stream and you let's say that you
totally [ __ ] change you're up like
let's say that you're super boring
you're super monotonous you're just like
whatever and then you wanna stream your
basic like an actor and you put on like
a show for your people as you stream
like why does that matter who cares yeah
but what do you try this is what it
matters when you use that act to portray
and narrative against other people
that's when it matters well but no I
disagree if you're portraying and
narrative against other people like
bullying people it doesn't matter if
you're being genuine or not genuine the
fact that you're doing here the monitor
using up Assad to [ __ ] on people that's
[ __ ] up don't you think what would it
be better if they were genuine and
[ __ ] on people yes yes because at
least then it's it's coming from coming
at you from a real point of view it's
not it's not some act where you're just
throwing shade at other streamers you
know I mean like that's what I'm saying
like I mean it really look how easy is
it how easy is it to speak from an act
how easy is that you don't even have to
take responsibility for what you say you
just go up I was in character or up I
was acting you know it's not true you
can still call people out for for
bullying like that people called out the
doc hardcore when he threatened to Doc's
that one kid even though he's
quote-unquote a character people were
hardly hardcore calling him out for that
way so hehe so doc doc used to bully
people in his like persona well doc went
a little bit too far and some guy that
was streaming raised some shouldn't he
was talking about how he has like his
darks and he's gonna go after him or
something yeah well that's a little bit
too much wait so wait what do you know
why he said that he was probably inside
I think he was really [ __ ] mad I
don't think I was like an in character
thing I he was just really mad but I'm
just saying that like if somebody like
puts like if somebody's attacking
somebody else that's a totally separate
issue whether or not they're being with
their in character out of character that
doesn't matter if somebody's like
genuinely attacking you it shouldn't
matter if their big fake or not it's
just a bad thing to do haha yeah no I
feel you
I just for some reason I care so much
about like this real and fake [ __ ] like
maybe I should just stop giving a [ __ ]
but it's just like it sucks when like
like I actually feel pretty left out
right now I'm not gonna lie like I feel
I don't know I feel like I got kind of
like left out or like I people like what
me gone like my friends won't be gone
like or something like they want me like
if basically was saying is if I fell off
I think I think the people that I used
to be political friends with would just
like be happy about that
yeah I mean like that's that's what I
think well like who do you who do you
mean when you say that just the people
I'd show with in Texas and [ __ ] like I
don't know like I don't even throw names
out there I'm just saying like okay so
I'll throw names based on what I've seen
so like based on what I know about you
reckful might not care because I don't
think you guys are friends anymore okay
but I feel like um like Greek god and
chance I feel like those guys wouldn't I
don't I don't think those guys want you
to fail I don't think they do either
it's a Greek is a wild card for me I
don't I don't understand what he's what
he is about you know I have a trouble
reading him I guess
I think Greek is like a pretty chill
dude he's like a little bit autistic but
I think he's pretty chill but I don't
think I don't think him or chance would
like be super happy if you fell off they
seem pretty chill now train wrecks
probably would but it's because you guys
have like a massive [ __ ] falling out
right yeah but it's like it's just it's
not about train wrecks it's more about
look at look okay look okay look at it
like this okay imagine you're in high
school right okay imagine in high school
okay and imagine you've been imagine
you've been shown with the same dudes
for five years right okay you didn't
show what the same you have a crew it's
you Jimmy Timmy you know Captain Falcon
and dick boy all right you're all
chillin hard okay and then imagine I
bring in another contender into the
group and and then everyone's a world
chillin we're having a good time right
and then imagine I have a falling out
with the person that I had an issue with
and then all of a sudden all my friends
are chillin with dick boys of me you
know I mean like imagine that that's
what we say Amanda you didn't get
invited to those IRL streams that was
about walk oh I'm in Maryland man I
can't be anot mad about that I'm saying
this okay I feel like I was bullied out
of my own friend group and I feel like
because there was a public narrative
against me my own friends use that to
gain viewers that's what I believe and I
think that's [ __ ] up well I mean a
minor but [ __ ]
I would use it the game beer is why not
why why would you do if you respect me
why would you do it because I would
never do that
I wouldn't that's great if I wanted but
you're only handicapping yourself when
you never do that I would listen listen
listen okay when you do when you're
self-employed okay you're a part of the
business world all right you have to
take what you can get because everybody
else is going after it now at the end of
the day you might like that because this
is the way of the world my dude you
might have like your own personal like
morals or whatever or whatever you feel
is important but if other people don't
agree with you on that which most people
don't you're always gonna fall short as
a result now I'm not saying that like
you should go out and literally trash
your [ __ ] friends and [ __ ] but I'm
just saying you've got to be prepared
for people to act in the ways that
interest them the most right yeah but
then while I live in my face and never
mind what is it yes I mean like if I'm
gonna assume that you're talking about
like the whole train wreck [ __ ] and
everything like I feel like I don't
think I'm not like me and him talk last
night right we actually were pretty
chill we were very very very very chill
and meaning more good like right now
we're fine but and well basically the
whole point of the thing was I just want
him to admit to me man-to-man behind the
scenes that he did use me I want him to
admit that to me and he refuses to admit
that he keeps beating around the bush
saying how it was a team and all this
little [ __ ] when it's like I just wanted
to be honest with me about what happened
you know I mean why is all I want okay
so if you guys don't a grand that you're
just always gonna be separated from that
whole group of people no that's it
that's the thing it's like a now I have
I'm like building this like vendetta
against like that group of people
because I believe that they're being
disingenuous to me so like that would be
like what if he genuinely believes that
he's correct then what do you guys do
well the thing is this is what this is
what I think I think that he does
believe doing sayings correct but he
also is just trying to play his cards
right for twitch that's why I think so
like that's where it bothers me you know
I mean it's like when someone's like you
know pretty much just playing cards for
twitch when I just want realness from
from from them that's all I want they
can tell me off stream on stream I don't
care I just want all I wants realness I
want them to tell I want people to tell
me how they feel about me and the
situation and then I'll move on it's
whatever like I swear to god I don't
you can't be like oh yeah dude like your
is because you're not taking a position
on being vegan or Meteor you're
literally raping children like oh this
is why why does my work this funny I
can't let you doubted me you did all
that in one day
well a couple hours I said I woke up I
had a hammer that's no damn holy [ __ ] is
our debate work dude what are you gonna
do with that well you know will you take
it and I'd use it in my next
conversation with a person I had a
conversation with last and savor our
holes or flaws kind of I mean that's
kind of we were to put it but it's
basically it's a there's a girl in my
community that follows a lot of my
debate stuff and has a lot of really
good input and has positions on veganism
ironed out more solidly than I do so the
last time I talked to her there was some
flaws in my position that we're exposed
to me so I figure I go back to the
drawing board iron out a little bit more
and then introduce them again and I see
if she can spot more flaws or if my
position is more solid well yeah so like
because I'm a layman and philosophy most
philosophy debates are going to be I
have a position somebody disagrees to
that position if they're intelligent
then what they do is they take my what
you do is you take my arguments and then
you apply them to other things to see if
I remain consistent and then if an
inconsistency is found then that means
that you have something deeper that you
need to resolve does that make sense or
is that a little too abstract
so veganism is a really tough argument
to win from a further person arguing
meat-eating it's very hard to have
because in order for you to be okay
eating meat you have to end to be have
strong ethical positions you have to
have some very solid ethical foundation
that allows you to exclude all animals
but include all humans generally that's
what most of us want and it's very very
hard to do that like you can you can try
to do a few examples and I could show
you I guess if you can think of like if
you want to do like a sample
conversation like why do you think
eating
is okay why do you think killing animals
for pleasure is okay no I would never
make that argument well basically so my
system is basically built off of
reciprocated values is like if you're
able to reciprocate a value with me and
I'm able to reciprocate about with you
but that kind of doesn't work in some
edge cases which is what I got which is
what my system was broken down on
yesterday yeah so I had to go back and
really think about that reciprocated
value thing so that's what I spent most
of this morning doing was like well why
do I care about reciprocated values are
these like important in and of
themselves or are they a means to an end
and that kind of stuff yeah so for me
like I don't actually care about
reciprocated values I only care about
myself I just use reciprocated values as
a way to maximize well-being for myself
right so like I care the most about me
being happy but generally the way that
I'm the happiest is when other people
are around me are happy it was so like
that it's kind of where that comes from
Jenner I believe so yeah generally yeah
i wouldnt want to be surrounded by a
bunch of people that suck [ __ ] are
miserable are trying to kill me are
otherwise unhappy right because when i
talk about other people are at me being
happy i'm not talking about whether or
not they approve of me or not or whether
or not they affirm me or something it's
more just that they're successful in
life that the more people that you
surround yourself with that are
successful the better off your life will
tend to be the more successful people
you have in your country the better off
your entire country will tend to be so
like these are why I think that's
important whether or not you like these
people or hate them or whether or not
they like you or hate you or approve of
you or disapprove of you the better your
population is the better everybody in
that population is right
not necessarily I'm looking at this more
from like a general like giant class
point of view or not like who do I
personally choose to hang out with point
of view well no it's about my my system
of ethics okay no no okay here let me
back up so the thing that I'm concerned
about with though what we're all of my
morals and everything come from right
for me is that I want to be I want to
maximize my well-being or maximize the
utility available to me or whatever
right so I have to find ways like I have
to think about ways to do that so like
how do I maximize my personal well-being
and I guess this is part of what this is
about right so like I could I could take
it from other people like right be a via
force so killing people and stealing
their [ __ ] you could manipulate or
deceive other people by lying and
stealing that way or you could try to
get other people interested in you and
do like a common interest sort of thing
which is like the reciprocated value
thing right doing things by force
doesn't seem to be consistent nor
realistic I don't think I'm ever gonna
be in a position of power where I'll
have the necessary resources to force
tons of people to make my life better I
don't think no people come to my stream
by choice also doesn't seem to be a
reliable way to maintain power because
dictators on that shake it [ __ ] over
time and all that manipulating and
deceiving people seems to be really
difficult and convoluted and I don't
know if you could maintain that over any
long period of time so getting other
people interested in you or invested in
you seems to be the best way to do it I
think that any moral system that can
succeed will have a higher likelihood of
succeeding if more people adopt said
moral system right the more people that
share your moral system the more likely
it is that that system will succeed and
I think that for my moral system I think
it's easy to get people interested or
invested in it because it keeps other
people invested in you so yeah so like
that so basically then the question is
like so these are for like questions of
policy if somebody says like can we tax
rich people to help education you know
well the question is if I can trade off
a little bit of my money or greatest
some of my money to make it so that more
people in my country are more educate
it's probably going to make the entire
country better off so businesses will do
better because we've got a more educated
population there'll be less crime less
social ills right like people getting
locked out people killing each other
right stuff like that yeah well because
yeah because like a very high-level
question very applied question is that
like what I asked you earlier what makes
it okay for you to kill animals but not
people well I take a I have a borderline
sociopathic approach to all of my morals
and ethics because I'm only
self-interested but most people don't
share my position I think that most
people should be vegan because I think
that most people empathetically or
intuitively would would tend towards
veganism if they thought it out yeah
because well cuz like you we can do it
like give me an example like why do you
think it would be okay to kill an animal
but not a person like what's your
rationale for that okay if you start
thinking about it it's a really
difficult rabbit hole to run down the
classic so I look at this from like what
I look at like a lot of things from from
like a myth or sort of like what our
culture is based on the standpoint right
so the religious argument like the
Christian argument would be well god
created animals to be this is the only
solid or even I came out is like I don't
perceive it but like let's say God
couldn't animals
in order to be subservient to human
beings and so that and told people that
you could use them as you will that
gives you sort of a higher authority to
sort of like make it okay but I think on
like a purely moral or ethical basis
it's very hard to justify Sheriff from
the Godwin is a hundred percent
foolproof like God whatever God tells
you is right because
I can actually like maybe say I would be
able to mount if I like was like
seriously trying to beat that defeat
this chocolate like because I don't
personally believe that I just I have
like a very low level opinion on this
right which is like I eat meat because
it's good and because I wouldn't make
the trade-off of animal lives right yeah
so so that's my that's just uh-huh
yeah acknowledging that the cost to the
world or whatever is probably greater um
and maybe like you know the hundreds and
hundreds of chickens that I've eaten
their amount and particular I eat almost
too many meals a day really easily have
like chicken or beef fish or chicken and
things like that in addition to like
vegetables and stuff so I'd say I eat
more meat than the average person but
okay it's totally unacceptable yeah
because unless you're a bigot you need
to have some way to justify why your
inconsistency is acceptable but another
person's inconsistency isn't so but you
would judge other people that would
violate their moral principles or being
inconsistent so so let's say a guy comes
into your house and he walks in and he
steals your computer and you look at
that guy and you say hey you can't just
steal my [ __ ] and the guy goes I know I
probably shouldn't steal it but the
amount of personal satisfaction that I'm
gonna get from stealing your thing is
actually like really high to me and I
just don't really want to think about
why I shouldn't so I'm just kind of
being inconsistent yeah but both of you
have inconsistencies in your moral code
but you've decided that his
inconsistency is unacceptable but yours
is acceptable because then killing
something arguably one is worse
depending on and it's not the stealing
I'm you're kind of directly contributing
to the death of something though you
katar if you go to a store and you buy a
chicken you're eating something that
otherwise wouldn't have been killed if
you would know
on a very very low well but you're part
of that demand but you still are white
so like Hitler okay we hear actually
okay sure so let me let me let me this
is how we do this how I do a more log of
it okay so I'm gonna take what you just
said and I'll apply that to another
thing and I'll see if you feel the same
way okay let's say that and I use
hyperbolic examples because it
illustrates the absurdity of the
argument so let's say that you have got
a friend and your friend goes out for
the night and then it comes back you
know like hey did you have fun and guys
like yeah it's like well what did you do
it's like well I went out and I raped a
kid and you're like that's really [ __ ]
up and think I was like okay well what
there is is this giant building downtown
and they bring in like a thousand kids
every month or whatever and we all get
to go and like pick one kid to rape and
would you tell that friend like okay
that's really [ __ ] up and guys like
well I mean like they're bringing in a
thousand kids anyway you know I'm just
one out of a thousand people there they
do these in a lot of different cities
like I don't think it's necessarily that
big of a deal if I'm just doing it a
little bit like it's you know the kid
somebody else probably would have right
to rid of it right okay so basically
what I've done is I'm just so when I'm
doing is I'm extracting your template
your template was this thing might be a
moral wrong but I'm only a really small
part of it therefore I ought be allowed
to do it right that's that's the
template that I got from your initial
argument this context will but so a
template is a regardless anyway I don't
see how I'm being very different from
any other you're not necessarily there's
tons of people that are because I'm not
gonna let you mount a successful defense
just because you have feel the need to
defend well you're not literally raping
children it's a comparison it's arguably
a lesser scale depending on how you look
at it because on one you're just raping
somebody on the other you're actually
murdering something okay put the guy
that goes out to rape the kid is a
directly capturing the kids you're
directly eating an animal you're just
not involved in like the rounding up in
the capturing and the but you're part of
the demand for slaughterhouses by eating
meat you said it yourself you eat tons
of me yeah in a small way but you still
are let's say that I eating chicken was
the difference between chickens being
slaughtered and not being slaughtered I
was the sole arbiter well you the
difference between at least a few
getting slaughtered or not okay but the
scale is such that my contribution or
lack of contribution to that effort it
doesn't matter the insight and I like
chicken enough that I'm gonna just eat
it because I can't do enough of an
impact I can't make enough of a dent in
that economic engine right to to really
influence this so if this is so you
can't just take a template or you can
but it's a super dick level when that's
not the reality of this is my art by for
a whole [ __ ] difference destiny the
whole [ __ ] thing is you live in this
world of like [ __ ] like like The
Hangover style like equations and [ __ ]
this happen the real [ __ ] world isn't
like that I know I acknowledge it is
like no no I totally listen it's no no I
ain't okay listen chill okay take a deep
breath okay I acknowledge even I am NOT
like 100% perfectly [ __ ] consistent I
don't wake up every day and robot out
like the most consistent moral way to
live my life right I acknowledge there's
a difference between like the 100%
theoretical arguments versus the
pragmatic reality we live in right okay
because when I'm having an argument
we're always pushing for the ideal
that's what I'm pushing for like what is
the ideal position right and then you
okay sure but the relevant thing is that
the problem is that when we have
inconsistencies and our morals that
inconsistency is going to be borne out
in an incredibly negative way and in
some other thing that we don't realize
that's the problem with inconsistencies
so like yes it's not no no no no we're
not talking about objectively I'm just
talking about having an object like a
consistent moral platform that if your
mobile platform is inconsistent it leads
to these other types of externalities
that cause everybody harm but you can
get a lot closer to it because what do
you mean to get closer and closer well
no because practical application changes
over time as you push towards an idea
but it changes over time as you push
towards the ideal it's not well so far
in society unless you're like a
postmodernist you I would argue that it
does that for instance things like black
people living with white people right
where it's not pretty sure as [ __ ] isn't
perfect now but it's a lot better than
when we have slavery or when they
weren't allowed to vote so even though
like like like people could have made
this argument okay say we make black
people not slaves
all of them are poor all of our [ __ ]
dumb they're not educated what's the
point is he's gonna be a disaster like
why don't we like we could argue to keep
the status quo you would argue okay well
no black people aren't gonna be the same
as white people overnight but over time
you know a society integrates and people
figure things out like we'll approach
like a better sending with gay marriage
same thing with any other issue like
that animal eating is a really
complicated thing too I don't see how
reaching a consistent moral platform on
this animal issue
is gonna like solve the lake or or or
necessarily driven drive this to a more
well on this particular issue it might
not but no no and I said on this
particular issue it's fine I'm just
saying that if at the end of an issue if
at the enemy issue your statement is I
have an unjustified belief and you know
it's just that's that then what you've
kind of said is that at the end of that
argument we have to carry forward that
to every other area of our life we can't
just isolate things that you're
basically saying or you're working under
this this presupposition that I can have
an unjustified belief and it's not a big
deal which is a little different
and I can see that argument whereas if
there is a strong impact I can make such
as on a social issue like do you kill
people or not right and that is
something I certainly have a very strong
moral position on either way because
that is going to impact humanity in a
very positive or negative way so I so I
think for me to capitulate on the issue
where we've acknowledged that I have
less of an ability to impact it by scale
is more appropriate than if I take that
to that position hypocritically with
okay so like it so like would you say
that like you would vote for like
senators and stuff that we're saying
that we need to make meat-eating illegal
and we should move towards veganism sure
I want to maximize my impact on things
that understand sure okay yeah can be
yeah depending on how way you apply that
to what because while you're technically
morally hypocritical you're doing so
with a sort of conscious acknowledgement
that you can focus on things you have
greater impact it kind of yeah
you just have to be careful cuz I can
lead you to some scary places people
would make same same argument about
climate change you can but again those
sure I guess like for what I do I like
to be able to argue with some degree of
moral authority so when I say that what
I mean is like I have a consistent or
some is consistent as it can be a
platform from which to argue why you
ought do something or ought not do
something so if I'm gonna argue about
like a social issue like should we have
socialized healthcare right
I can build I can build my argument from
Ground Zero from I only care about
myself that's like my basic like
axiomatic belief I can build socialized
healthcare up all the way from that and
I can do that it with all morals that I
have but if I argue with somebody that
hasn't thought they're any of their
positions and they've got like really
strong but unjustified beliefs on that
it makes it hard for me to engage that
person in conversation and they're never
gonna convince me of anything right and
then if I were to attack somebody with
an unjustified moral position then
there's no reason they should listen to
me right let's say that I have four or
five very strong I'm perfectly okay with
you disregarding my entire whatever you
would call it knowledge base animal
stuff because I've said that myself
I've introspectively identified that
that's it so there's just to be clear
these are two very different positions
the idea that I haven't spent the time
needed to be introspective on this
position or I don't have this position
thought out enough to have a strong
opinion on it that's different than I
totally acknowledge that I'm being a
huge hypocrite here and I'm just
inconsistent those are two really
different positions well not necessarily
no no so like for instance like
have you ever spent a lot of time about
yes quality yeah let me rephrase this
interesting thing that we all take for
granted okay
everybody tells you that you need to
save for retirement we need to be
healthy you need to do all these things
so that at the end of your life you know
you're living is optimally as possible
and you would like the end of your life
in Israel right but I always wonder if
there I haven't exploited too much
personally but if there's an argument to
be made that like two people reach like
50 years old and then one guy's life is
like measurably better he's much
healthier they save for retirement and
the other guy is like living off Social
Security have any health problems if
like this guy could make the argument
that like yeah you're gonna look better
than me now and that's fine
but for the past 40 years of there's so
much more having it didn't we have this
discussion and this is actually one to
very few ones to actually want well this
was in regards to um this was in regards
to cific Lisa dieting but I'm speaking
more holistically like including this
putting like finances and whatnot as
well right but somebody that wastes all
their money like doing fun [ __ ] and
stuff like that and but the principle is
the same that if you if you live a
lifestyle that is well okay this there's
a lot of avenues to go down here but I
think I think ultimately the answer is
just to address the answer the answer is
probably you have to live the subjective
experiences most fun for yourself and
what does that be like pursuing money or
like just going to [ __ ] around
probably is irrelevant to your own I
would think that's the right answer
right but then beyond that I think
generally you'd get more rewarded if you
lived what like whatever this function I
was like a better life you worked out
yeah yeah exactly and that's like that's
like terrified then like when you
consider like how much time that it was
pretty dark uh vision you can see if I'm
the kind of know how much this now they
the mic is actually pretty sensitive so
I will select quietly ask them like
engineer me you guys can hear it's
pretty low right now right yeah yeah
casinos I'm talking about like end of
life how horrible is don't like what
what also is troublesome is how long
that period time is because you're
looking at my twenty or thirty years
it's a long time maybe that year they
start and so so this is one of the
arguments I think for a consistent
profile that your entire life because if
you start that earlier we have a much
better chance to
that's more healthy right I would much
rather go down that route at 75 then I
would I don't know what that one next
one no thank you
awesome thank you very much saying I
come so someone's been shocked replies
we have we check out all this we should
be good yeah we should be good thanks
very much thank you
is this ranch they can be Indian awesome
thank you have you ever heard of
something called a healthy spam
okay so there's been a lot of all right
I've heard of like a lot of criticism I
do that we focus a lot on light spam in
the world and life span increase it and
I think it's good we don't have to talk
about health spin over just the amount
of time that you live we are in a so
I've never heard of it referred to as a
with medicine that's a core personal
development principles yeah this is
super super important to maximize that
period of time yeah and this there's a
lot of like Silicon Valley entrepreneurs
they're obsessed with this possibly back
but to the extent they're like
transferring like different types of
waters this is not how to figure out
like how to like it's to extend that I
believe really strongly in that yeah the
thing is too though is I think you have
to know what you can get away with like
I think a lot of people they sort of
lose a lot of this sort of like gems of
life because they follow those
disciplines so
so our fight strictly rigidly but the
truth is like you can you can get away
with eating whatever you want once a
week twice a week you probably
completely fine I don't think the amount
of things that actually so there's a
there's a guy named Peter Adia who's
kind of at the head of like human
longevity and what actually affects it
and the point he usually makes is that
there's there's actually like very
little that will actually objectively
affect human longevity the other keys
right so like in terms of lifestyle
decisions and what you can do there's
very very little right the only like
scientifically proven thing that we know
will increase longevity is the juicy
fellow architec I've heard that
everything else is kind of a mean so
whether you're eating salads and stuff
every day or french fries attend de
sauver I hate to say that because it
feels like it should be different but
that's the action well to qualify that a
little bit he's probably talking about
in the absence of disease yes right so
and being obese can lead to a lot of
things like heart disease or diabetes
that will have an impact on not only how
long you live but the quality of life as
well
yeah but but beyond you have to go
pretty far down the rabbit hole to get
to those poisons right okay one really
interesting thing a lot of people aren't
aware of and you actually you find even
educated people unaware of us are you
familiar with the difference between a
lifespan and life expectancy
yeah so life expectancy has increased a
lot right as we've gone through the
years because of practice in things like
child mortality but lifespan haven't
actually really wait now I'm lost
so life expectancy will factor in things
like death due to disease will factor in
things like child mortality so like when
you go with like really far back you
know life expectancy might have been
thirty thirty years old or whatever yeah
but a lot of people here at that and
I've even heard next imperative that
doesn't mean that it like 30 years old
you die of old age it just means that so
many people were dying yeah but if you
live to be like 40 or 50 like even in
like Roman and Greek times you could
live to be fi like a healthy 60 70 80
years old it's not impossible to do it
and it's not even remarkable it's just
that a lot of people are dying over
there but like a lot of people have this
idea because you'll hear people say
things like our lifespan is increasing
so fast that we might get little point
to where it's going up faster than like
are even details so will actually keep
out living are you or will never outlive
our lifespan but in reality like your
overall lifespan hasn't really been
impacted that much as beeping well the
the average age of a American man is 82
and woman is 86 right something like
that yeah that that is that is a lot a
slightly longer lifespan than like Roman
Greek times right you didn't expect
because I think they would that closer
to 70s is that right no it has increased
but it has has to be long term later
like a on five it's gone from like 60 70
s to like 70 so you get people that are
thinking like it's good we're gonna live
to like 150 yeah people think of like my
generational thing like by the time you
live to 70 the average life is better
than 50 which is totally not yeah
I think it's like after you get old you
shall stop like over part of the series
and so the real trick is we have to
harvest like young children and take
their blood and then we'll be able but I
think there are things in your body that
stop regenerating or that start to tear
you ready they can't just be replaced
but there's a guy named Peter Diamandis
yeah I think I have to hit him right
he runs a pretty big company in Silicon
Valley and I think they're like trying
to inject like young blood like white
watts of my 18 year olds so this is like
I mean there's no like maybe there is
less stem cells and that's one of the
reasons why stem cells are such an
amazing advancement it's because you
could use something like clear
replacement therapy and you can
completely cure old injuries because
you're putting my shoes and then five
mentionable my shins whatever the word
is mentioned most Osias template is chat
will now
that is quite a little big for you not
to bother and those stem cells have like
enormous implications for how we hear
what cure and reason are age there's
people that are like in their fifties
that are getting replacement therapy and
fully curing like old injuries and their
shoulders or something that you could
never do before
so stem cells are actually like a huge
medical advancement right yet they're
mostly illegal
are you anybody
[Music]
tragedy
I really suck [ __ ] it's a bit a huge
it's a huge shitty thing that as men age
we're seen as like more wise more
revered and still sexy but they get the
chance pawn Daniel Craig he's late yeah
like 60 these people are prepared with
actresses like in their mid to late 20s
yeah because men eh they become more
desirable than women age it's always
seems like a universe like every single
thing is a woman that you do is try to
master age we dye your hair back to the
darker original colors you got
anti-wrinkle cream whatever it is
there's an interesting interview with
and he gets Anne Hathaway where she
talked about how she feels really bad oh
yeah she's in the old category now well
it was before that she's actually got
bad because she landed a lot of roles
that she thought it was insane because
there are a lot of like roles it'll be
written for like women in their 30s that
they'll give it to her because she was
younger she kind of felt like she was
[ __ ] a lot of the older actresses out
and when I say older I mean like early
mid thirties actresses yeah cuz
everyone's out by 40 like 45 well it's
just um I guess yeah it's kind of like
um if it seems like once you've passed
like 30 as a woman like
Media doesn't really care yeah sure oh
yeah because how it could happen well
because on a lot of media this has
changed like within the past 10 years is
starting to change but in a lot of media
like the role of a woman is literally
defined as an extension of a man like
every woman is there to be like a
romantic interest or a sex interest or
something
I play the best character and Wonder
Woman was Chris Pine cool is that the
guy yeah that's yeah why I would say the
best character does he's super hot we
disagree we disagree on this I think
that gal gadot cred that would be really
hard you know what I think gal gadot
carried that really really hard like she
did very well but yeah I think so but
she thinks that the movie was only as
good because Chris Pine oh I don't know
I think it it okay yeah
but it's changing like you see so many
female leads in Hollywood now
yep signing attention yeah Hunger Games
[Laughter]
the strong female who don't you know man
that's that's becoming an architect
[Music]
I think they'll let us film in the
escape them if we say we're youtubers
maybe don't see our Tichenor why it's
not cool enough yet I never actually set
up if I ever meet like a girl and I'm
trying to wrestle I never say like oh
yeah he's gonna mind quick I'll always
say I have a hundred thousand subs on
YouTube is what I see yeah exactly which
is like way less impressive than like
I'm one of the largest Chairman's in the
world to say oh yeah I'm like a medium
to small size here to prove more
impressive than the twitch [ __ ] that'll
change yeah hopefully yeah well are you
really one of the largest rivers in the
world I guess so
that's not sure I was actually pretty
surprised Oh cuz you linking that site
that's right all the fish stuff that I'm
like sixtieth there when I talk 100 yeah
we worked hard man you deserve it
technically it's my fault because I used
to be the largest river in the world for
like a year that's not grass when was
that
when Starcraft was grown it's not your
that was before the portly got big yeah
it's the biggest room in the world for
like a year and a half Wow
this is the for hotshot right cuz
hotshot was the biggest shame right and
it was yeah it was the play that got big
yeah yeah you were like uh you're like
screaming before OBS from before
excellent right yeah like you're right
that's pretty yeah I don't even know how
you do that
black magic it's pretty crazy
a lot of spiritual [ __ ] was involved in
that a lot of rituals had to happen
every night sacrifices are made some
real father doctor disrespect clothes
really funny I slowly came along real
happy able I like super cut up and like
the drama yeah I don't know I think it's
funny
did you like him before you at school
like maybe I don't know I liked you when
you had like four or five thousand
viewers I mean I suppose we still does
similar stuff something I'm so basic
dude iPod my favorite [ __ ] McClure
you're a pretty Norman damn okay like I
live I think we're cuz such a
discernment it's hard to place like
why but it's sort of that like person on
the couch with Ustream mm-hm
you were my favorite killer for a long
time but then he certainly we've been
through this oh yeah thank you there
used to be that I would see you in there
come back be like destiny insulin quick
it so fast and now I have to look at the
little subtext league of legends know
what you should do know is you should
put on RL and employees on IRL my men
you'll catch me and I'll watch just it
sounds like a really good way to get
people to never tune into my
anything that's not in point video games
in our Oh
sometimes I play piano I love your piano
compositions photo Super Bowl Thanks you
touch yourself cat about that give piano
at your house at a place you guys you
don't know we don't know you don't know
it for the piano he has a really cool
thing Eunice give you a fiction there
she plays by on very well I feel like it
yeah
oh those really cool yeah I'm nervous
said I like easy step here's the really
stupid reason that is it's gonna be real
dumb but I'm ready for it okay but I
made it
it'll be so dumb and it'll go back to
like being smart so I feel like if I
learn it the wrong way first I will not
be able to learn at the right way and
martial arts is like this where if you
learn martial arts from a bad teacher
I've been martial arts all my life so
you learn martial arts from the bad
teachers it is wait yeah that's a
justice so what you're saying is that if
you learn it wrong you have to unlearn
it and then yeah well or less often then
what could fit you then what I could get
from there there's got to be something
to be so I know noses like a theme of
yours it's gotta have been said in all
of your self-help [ __ ] but sometimes
it's better to just pick a decision and
move or even if it's suboptimal because
it sounds like a lot of your life is
kind of stuck up in this life decision
like decision paralysis or sometimes you
are like in decision paralysis we are so
scared of putting the optimist stuff
that you don't take anything at all yeah
you ever worried about something and I
picked up a lot from Starcraft and RTS
that often times we like to think that
we cannot make a decision but you're
always making it a sailor if you don't
make routine decisions yeah and then
more often than not not making a
decision is worse than making them worse
these are some up
they don't even worth this is more the
suboptimal yeah if you've got like two
choices in front if there's a huge
difference though like making the worst
decision versus a suboptimal
yeah no no yeah well I'm sorry well like
an RTS you're not making it as if it's
gonna give your life come on I mean
sorry I mean in the game no I'm being
serious like no in the game but I'm
saying like in their life but mostly I'm
saying I might just make like if you've
got to think about like this
to the Qataris I think it would be
suboptimal to the point where it would
be difficult for me to know tune I don't
know but like actually playing it I was
just gonna do the tune it so you can try
to play it we do that but what I'm
saying is it like if he if you if it
sits for two years you don't do anything
it probably but if it's way worse I'll
learn in the wrong way and then unloaded
then relearn it right yeah I think that
was baked into me because of our when I
was training it was way more important
to learn at the right way and it was
like there was like a literal
consequence of not going away right like
a little con special spice and so when I
was competing it was it was worse to do
it so you'd have to like make sure you
got right yeah sure but I know that
you're saying I guess the problem is I
don't know how to fix it you don't know
anything about music then I look like I
know how to play piano I think that's
not true
I think you play a role I just know a
lot of music theory because I wanted to
do composition it's all I can yeah no
everything is laid out in front of you
so I can like make up a lot of stuff
yeah you'll take something like the
piano proficiency course or something
yeah sure
I think it's a very challenging it's
scarier it might be scarier because you
never thought about it but I think that
piano is one of the easiest systems to
learn and I think it's it's way easier
than any women story
women's boots are so hard because on a
wind instrument it's gonna take you four
years just sound like you're not [ __ ]
garbage where's like on the piano you
just have to push the key and even a
professional playing one note a record
is going to sound the same as an amateur
playing one on record
but unlike on a wind instrument
professional can play something very
simple and sound like God here it's like
yeah there's a huge it's like a human
voice or whatever program instrument
right the instrument I really want is an
e we have you ever heard of that what I
told you ravenson anyway it's an
electric wind insertion and you can
program it to play any MIDI notes out
any like a retro game 8-bit 16-bit sound
effects and you can program it to have
like whatever key your fingering rocks
if you know how to do a snap scope you
can program it to do saxophone Cameron
fingering interesting it's super cool
but what got you interested in the music
dirty I mean I really like music I was
like an extension of that I guess but
why specifically composition because
writing songs is like the coolest thing
to do for music right rather than
playing other people's songs so did you
ever actually do that or he didn't
challenges I do they make opposition
challenge I mean I had a few pieces that
I would be like right for like our
who some I don't know how about you've
managed to make the microphone sound
really bad I don't want to restart my
phone again - tips like what kind of
[ __ ] phone is it emoji for okay okay
[Music]
[Music]
yeah no that's okay
I won't be able to show them any part of
the document that is that okay or do you
think that's an important part oh I
could just like drag this whole thing up
like that it looks [ __ ] horrible but
just shoot it we can do it for now shoot
me the link also I don't know if the
microphone is have this'll work but
we'll try krietor no no it's not it's
just like the voice is like super like
blown out
I just want to suck away from the
microphone yeah no no I understand what
you're saying um but it's not a matter
of likes being away from the microphone
um hold on hello can you hear me yeah
okay can you hear me now yeah so even if
I like hold on so like even if I step
away or even if I'm not talking quietly
this is what your microphone kind of
sounds like right now even though it's
quiet anyway I'm not screaming and even
if I like step away from the microphone
like stepping away were coming closer is
not fixing it there's yeah alright
testing what yeah that was the yeah so I
don't know if like it could be that I
don't know if it's like a bluetooth
thing but if the audio is being
compressed somehow or like going through
some sort of signal change it's like
hard core compressing it that could
cause this as well but yeah I'm not sure
do you want to buy you want to buy a
real thing and then we can have this
conversation I don't care dude that's
not relevant to anything like that [ __ ]
things to eating meat well what's the
second name drugs Oh
what about it
you wanna start with that sure
wait are you kind of try are you gonna
straightedge me no you can do whatever
the hell you want it's your own body
drugs are heavy are you as a victimless
crime but buying drugs is not oh I'm not
I don't do that [ __ ] dude I'm not
[ __ ] like that I don't know yeah
from somebody else right I'm personally
not gonna be yeah that's a that's a
shifted responsibility thing hell yeah
yeah don't worry I'm not everything when
I run into an undercover or some [ __ ] I
don't buy anything myself
hell no I do this oh that's nice [ __ ]
man yeah is it fair to say that you
should not directly support industries
for another example if you lived in the
eighteen hundred's maybe I don't know I
would have to I mean we would have to go
in to that I'm not sure
what is there to be unsure about I guess
it depends on the specific product what
yeah the level of removal is really hard
so let's say for instance let's say that
you believe that you were a let's say
you're a staunch socialists or you
believe like hardcore that most forms
when I say most men like ninety five
percent plus of labor is is actual theft
that a capitalist somebody that owns
capital that uses that capital to sell
labor or whatever is actually stealing
labor from their laborers and and that's
an unethical thing right I think that if
you believe that I think that you can
maintain that position but to actually
say that I'm not going to consume
anything produced by capitalism that
would be like would you agree that that
would be like an unreasonable burden or
an impossible way to live your life or
so what would you do you have to be
member of society but you can try to
minimize what you do sure so the person
would still consume under capitalism
they just wouldn't they will just try to
minimize that consumption but you still
have as much as you can
I the level of removal I don't know like
what the philosophical argument is or
how you would have changed this but
that's something that personally I don't
know what the correct answer is another
way that I've thought about this in the
past is let's say there's a business and
let's say that that business directly
enslaves black people for their labor
would you buy from this business I think
you could argue like in that case it's
pretty directly unethical what if they
have a CEO that personally owned slaves
if you buy from that business is that
unethical because he makes money of it
like I don't know at that point it gets
kind of weird what if the CEO donates to
organizations that support slavery but
he doesn't directly own it like I don't
know like what the level
sure what one level of removal where
you're directly supporting an
organization not entirely not one member
but that's an entirely unethical one and
that organization is the purchasing of
psychedelics cartels of Mexico is that
even where psychedelics come from I
don't know what percentage of drugs come
from Mexico I do know that 101.5 million
pounds of marijuana come from Mexico in
2015 uh-huh what if I steal the drugs
from somebody all I'm saying is that if
you want to do drugs you should make
sure that they're sourced responsibly
that is all Shh yeah I guess I've never
thought of that before
do you agree idea I don't know no well I
don't I don't disagree I'm just levels
of removal is very hard I haven't
explored that topic personally a lot so
it's a really hard thing for me I
thought about this the most I've thought
about this was actually in relation to
the there are two things the chick-fil-a
CEO that was kind of what I was getting
at although that's not slavery it's like
a gay rights thing so the chick-fil-a
CEO is an interesting one for me because
I'm obviously completely pro-gay rights
and whatnot and I'm and I mean that
actually not like a conservative means
it so I'm very Pro gay rights but I
don't but not supporting chick-fil-a
seems strange because the CEO himself
donates to non gay rights things so I'm
not entire industry well but well money
to the cartels sure but that the drug
industry isn't entirely corrupt and
[ __ ] right now why you need to make
sure your drugs are responsibly sourced
well sure but then you have to go like
level
of removal again right like there's a
chance that you could buy shrooms from a
guy that's super cool and he doesn't
hurt or do anything bad and he might get
them from a larger dude and he's super
cool he doesn't do anything [ __ ] up or
bad but maybe his supplier is like
literally like a cartel person or
something I don't know if like I don't
even know if psychedelics work right but
say for like marijuana like that could
be the case right so like how many
levels up isn't it kind of a similar
question like how many levels up of
removal do you get before you become
responsible for supporting some
unethical Act I see like I would
literally have to sort like using your
what you're saying here I would have to
literally trace this back to the farm
they were grown on to make sure or
unless you think that's unreasonable
yeah they should make sure that you're
coming from that's some expensive [ __ ]
though dude but I know what you mean
yeah maybe I guess like the ethical
consumption thing is something that I've
just never really thought or I just
haven't spent a great deal of time
diving into it I don't I just I'm not
sure I don't know I mean yeah sure yeah
I would have to spend a great deal of
time thinking about it I'm actually
curious what do you think about like
separating the art from the artist how
do you feel about that
I think if the artist is dead then it
doesn't matter but if they're alive but
giving money to his estate is difficult
for me to do yeah I'm not sure about
that one either
so like for instance like well say like
at the xxx fantasy onna I like I listen
to that guy a lot and he's a piece of
[ __ ] and I mean everything I've seen
shows he's a piece of [ __ ] but I'm big
on the fact that like well the person
himself has no influence on how I enjoy
the art but by listening to him even if
I personally don't buy anything people
are gonna listen to him he's gonna
become more popular in a roundabout way
as a result of that somebody's gonna
listen to my stream that's never heard
him before and then check it out and
maybe give him money so in a roundabout
way you're getting I don't know if I
agree with that well okay well we're not
talking about levels of removal we're
talking about the actual crime then but
but like in terms of like if I listen to
a guy like that on stream in some way
there's gonna be like a direct financial
benefit for that guy for that like
that's just a fact and the guy himself
is like a pretty big piece of it now
he's not murdering people from what I'm
aware of but like he's a pretty bad
person I like a Chris Brown or an r
kelly or whatever music you really think
so I don't know if I agree with that
like if I buy me personally nothing but
I have exactly well but I have a public
platform so every time I play a song of
his some person that's never heard of
him before will invariably check it out
and some percentage of them either will
end up giving him money or will you know
contribute more to hits on a site
that'll give him a driven or something
like somebody's probably like I
guarantee you I would put money on it
that someone in my Chad has given money
to exit extent I own on Spotify or some
[ __ ] because you heard him on my stream
this is a little bit different because
I'm a public figure I guess so it's a
little different between that and just
like a personal figure but or a private
person right
it's a difficult calculus yeah and I
don't I'm not like disagreeing with your
point at all or agreeing with it it's
just something that um every time I try
to think it's a hard topic to wade
through because I don't know if I can
draw like any absolute lines of like
where does the level of responsibility
start or stop and if I can't draw an
absolute line everything feels arbitrary
and then I feel like well I'll just draw
the line that's most convenient for me
you know so I'm not sure of Mexicans no
yeah I guess it's just yeah I just don't
know where the level of responsibility
ends yeah I don't know like so for
instance like they got like um I smoked
a couple times with my buddy Chris he
sold weed to people and then he got his
weed from another dude and neither him
nor the other dude were ever involved in
any like crime [ __ ] besides selling
drugs it's all they did I'm positive of
that I know that for both of them I
don't know about the guy above him
though and I mean ultimately they may
have some how in some size shape or form
came from Mexico at some point I don't
know that that yeah I don't know there
just seems like a really hard like every
piece of clothing that you'd buy is like
invariably made by like some sweatshop
kid in China or something unless you
like source it from like a made in
America factory or something right yeah
that's true
I'm not sure about the cartel stuff
though either though that's a hard one
as well I don't know
I don't think there's a good answer but
I'm sure okay the cart the cartel one is
hard because it's one of those like cell
like this is an interesting question I
post a stream you know that one guy that
calls the the Indian dudes that do the
scamming yeah do you think that the guys
that work at those Indian call shops are
those guys morally culpable for scamming
people do you think yes gotcha huh I
don't know though is it though if that
if that was like the only thing
available to you do you think then why
do they work those jobs everything else
huh and so you're sacrificing money for
a morality which is not a good trade
maybe I guess I would have to find out
if that's if that's actually true or not
I don't know what the comparable wages
are everything or if that's like
reasonable to tell somebody that works
one of those call centers you just get a
different job I don't know I mean to be
a plantation master would you take that
job
well it's a complicated question if if
my if the only option for me was to be a
plantation slave owner and it was just
me I probably wouldn't at least I would
like to think I wouldn't I mean I've
turned down money in streaming for
things that I consider unethical
although I make a lot of money streaming
so I don't know if that's the same thing
however if I had a family I don't know
what where my responsibility would lie
let's assume that I have a wife and I
have a child and they're both relying on
me for for income and either them work
do I don't know if my responsibility to
them is greater than my responsibility
to any personal moral or other I would
have to weigh like what's more important
to me is maintaining that ethical
consistency or providing for my family
I don't know you don't see
responsibility to find a better job well
yeah but I mean you can only try so hard
it's not like just because you look for
a better job it's gonna magically appear
I mean if that's all that's available to
you I agree that is difficult
uh-huh but it also sure yeah I'm not
sure I don't know about that in India
are you sure
be careful we don't make claims that I
don't know what India's employment
status is right from 2008 okay but we're
not what that's not fair we can't
compare a labor market to the worst
labor market in the last you know seven
decades I don't think that's fair I just
googling real quick it looks like
Google's unemployment right now is seven
percent which sounds that sounds higher
to me than what it should be right right
like four to six percent is usually what
you want it to so but again I'm not sure
but but there are even shades of gray
here where like say you have the
opportunity to take a really good job
that's ethically dubious or you could
take a pretty [ __ ] job that's not as
ethically or that is ethically sound
again if you have a family to provide
for
yeah I don't know I don't know what the
correct answer is if your kid ends up
going to a shitty school and ends up
with worse outcomes in life and you
explain to your kid well I'm sorry but
this is just how it had to happen like I
couldn't take an ethically you do not
need to do drugs
oh yeah no yeah I understand that
sure I'm just saying that these it's the
same type of question that if you give
me a good answer to this question then
it probably solves the other conundrum
as well right yeah for pot is to fight a
local source
yeah sure probably I mean I don't find
I'm smoking weed but and other drugs too
sure I don't even know where they come
from I'll find out though I will do my
best to find out okay make sure our [ __ ]
is ethically source there you go okay I
think they'll might connect all right
okay move on to the main topic
oh yeah go for it dude okay solve my
solve my nihilism all right do it fix
all the philosophy I'm mighty close oh
okay I think you are - I don't even know
every time I call myself something
somebody emails me and tells me why I'm
not so I try not to label myself okay
can you open my link and don't forget to
hide the URL yeah all right hold on I
might have to go to sleep soon okay
can I change my font color color alright
I get to be blue wait wait are you
really not going to talk for the
conversation I'm also going to do a lot
of typing oh okay
wait why can't I know okay can you not
like set your font color and then type
you can only change retro actively the
fun oh I see okay
all right throw it let me make sure
everything that needs to be on screen is
on screen all right
load it up you said you're interested in
correct weight okay let me okay so you
okay we've been through the slide so
just to be clear I'm going to clarify
the [ __ ] out of everything I say okay
especially when I'm talking to you so if
it gets obnoxious then [ __ ] off so in
the purp for the purposes of the
conversation I had with Devon for my
debate okay with him for the debate
stuff that I do online
my interest is pursuing what is true not
convincing my audience or at the
audience of somebody else to believe
what I'm saying
but that only applied insofar as my
online debates go so for instance about
having a conversation with my son and
I'm having a conversation with him about
things that I think are best in his life
I might not use the same rhetoric in my
conversation with him as I would with my
stream when having a debate does that
make sense
okay I am going to try to give correct
as possible as you would be okay gotcha
alright so this will be an extremely
stilted conversation I'm going to cure
autistic okay
okay that's good dude that's my this is
my realm my I am the logos embodied I'm
ready dude I am think about what you say
all right sure thing okay
just I'm warning you right now I'm
pretty tired so like if I disconnect
like this it's because I went to bed all
right no yeah I remember saying it yeah
okay sure let me so let me clarify this
statement what I believe is that if two
people are hold on if two people are
both rational if these people both
appreciate the same types of reason the
same types of logic the same types of
evidence that these two people should
agree on every non subjective thing
that's a clarify that statement do you
agree with that clarification it's it's
more or less saying the same thing I'm
just trying to be very clear with it
yeah okay so if two people have a
difference of idea about something
that's not like a subjective thing like
does this taste better or sound better
that those two people if they're both
logic logos driven people that if they
disagree at the end one person
necessarily is being irrational yes wait
can we can you enlarge the font people
in chat are crying
perfect
can't you zoom on your screen or zoom on
your chrome window um yeah I could but
usually when you zoom in chrome things
can break or get [ __ ] though so it's
better to just but um yeah I can try it
I'll zoom okay you're good
so do you remember all the times you've
asked people for their lack of
consistency for example centrist
skeptics for no consistently applying
criticism to both sides or people who
got overseas of the lion so she was my
worst possibility this conversation that
you're going to say I am going to be
inconsistent on veganism okay because I
need to load the deck okay I hate
animals man I just want you got a lot of
work to do because goddamn do I [ __ ]
hate animals
all right let's go okay I want to know
if you're going to be like Ben Shapiro
who are intelligent but inconsistently
applied their intelligence like not
attacking anti-vaxxers on the campaign
trail or fully interpreting as longer
data I want to know if you're going to
be like Dave Rubin consistently
interviews his guests okay can we move
on let's go let's I'm not gonna be like
anything go let's go spook that sleep is
setting in
okay this isn't really a spoiler okay
however I'm gonna make this prediction
right now whatever I rate this movie
that rating is going to fall off when
the when the next movie gets released to
the next Avengers movie oh yeah yes but
we've got we have three minutes to go
Kyle and we can discuss it well normally
I wouldn't accept well we'll talk about
it all of it okay okay fine fine maybe
maybe you will convince me
okay so right we're past it limit okay
so Rio to the reason so the reason why
I'm not gonna like this movie as much
from the second movie comes out is
because I'm 99% sure in the second movie
okay masters spoiler alerts by the way
if you get a spam then get [ __ ] it's
because I'm pretty here on the second
movie they're gonna find a way to undo
everything and bring everybody back
which renders which kind of renders this
movie a little bit meh where to start
how long didn't get the stream two hours
come just come back later don't just
leave just exit the stream and come back
later so yeah so there's that to keep in
mind okay damn where to start so dark
okay firstly the thing that I like the
most about this movie okay holy memes
okay the thing that I like the most
about this movie is that I really like
the villain I think the villain dude was
like really sick tannaz good job not
making a villain who is evil just
because someone had to be yeah I thought
that he was the best villain I've ever
seen like in a superhero movie coming
into this movie I'm gonna be honest I
had very very very low expectations no
no when I say low expectations I had
superhero movie expect
so I kind of just wanted to be like
mindless action memes or whatever I
thought that Thanos was like the coolest
[ __ ] villain ever the ending scene
with him where he was like we kind of
sort of smiled when that when that
sunrise came up like he said he wanted
to write when the Sun rises on the
universe I'll know that I've done my
work I thought that was really cool the
way the movie ended was pretty brave as
well the ending is what made the movie
so dark I can't believe that they ended
it on that point I was waiting for them
to like oh we found like you know we
just have we've got like actually we
actually have six to the seven
dragonballs and we just need the last
one and you like set it up for the next
movie to be like on a huge like on a
huge upswing but they didn't at all the
movie actually ended incredibly darkly
with him having accomplished his mission
and everything yeah I thought that was
really cool I really like the way that
the nose was handled and yeah man Wow
the the villain part is like really
really really important and in Marvel
movies you really suck at that so yeah I
mean most superhero most you know
whether it's a superhero or a shounen or
whatever you want to say like most if
it's made for kids usually the villain
is evil because someone has to be that's
how it always feels let's not Voldemort
feels that's how a lot of villains feel
so every Dragon Ball Z villain feels
yeah and I don't think I don't know I
don't think this was perfect but like it
is so much better than you normally see
in this [ __ ] there were it was two two
and a half hours was a long time they
were it was a huge cast of characters
man what oh so I don't like to just drop
this meme whatever I wish I had the
movie in front of me I wish I had a more
educated background so I could describe
it better um it sounds like a meme to
say this I feel like people generally
throw it in but I genuine I genuinely
thought the cinematography of the movie
was really really well done there were
like a lot of shots there were a lot of
it seems were like just the way that
they were shot I was thinking like wow
this is like really really cool I really
like what's on the screen right now I
don't know how was to explain that I
wish I had a better vocabulary for it
but but I felt like there were a lot of
scenes like that where I guess like
generally in superhero movies I just
expect like big explosions and just
random [ __ ] or whatever but in this
movie I feel like there are a lot of
shots we could like take like a
10-second clip would be like this was
really [ __ ] cool the way that this
was shown was like really awesome
why is Thea knows evil it's not just
because someone needs me I don't know if
you could say that Thanos is evil I mean
he is unlike our traditional sense but I
don't know I thought that they handled
even though like if you if you look too
deeply into his memes it's kind of dumb
like killing half the universe to save
you have gets into yeah I kind of if you
look like real people in do it but I
feel like they handle those character
well enough and I really loved the
dynamic that he had with all of the
other characters like I kept waiting for
him
I was waiting so many times for him to
have his scene where he like punches
someone and then walks up it is like
haha you thought your power could ever
match my power ah ha ha but he wasn't he
was like suit he was actually really
respectful of every other character you
know like he I think he said as much to
Tony Stark that he respected his antara
that you're suddenly calm you know we're
both cursed with knowledge or something
yeah there was there was another
superhero where he said oh he said it
too what's the main guy and get
guardians of the galaxy it's not thin
[ __ ] what's his name quail quill
yeah yeah Peter yeah where he says like
I you know I respect your I like you boy
or something like that
Thanos actually seemed really respectful
of every other superhero in the in the
movie which was really cool I like that
I really like that Oh Stannis is like a
really big part of this movie for me in
being as enjoyable as it was man it
helps so much yeah it's not perfect but
it's so much better than you normally
get from like what else what else what
else is there to talk about it let me
what you guys bring up [ __ ] how do you
feel about the trope of that you've seen
a lot of this [ __ ] of like oh man we get
so close and then someone [ __ ] it out
like well like well normally yeah
normally right like they're prying the
glove off of them and quill like totally
you know you know he's gonna [ __ ] it up
because someone
in that situation someone always [ __ ]
it up and there's but I mean like yeah I
mean like normally I would say that [ __ ]
is really lame but I mean I feel like I
feel like I'm gonna go extra movie on
this but it's still within the universe
so I think it's a fair they've spent to
milk they've spent two movies building
the relationship between him and Gamora
so I think it's fair for him to have
that reaction I think they've earned
that even if they didn't necessarily in
this movie I think they spend enough
time building those two characters up
that I think it's okay for it to happen
it was kind of dumb i I agree but like
yeah and maybe the fact that I haven't
seen those other two movies is where I
think it's kind of dumb and pretty dumb
and I would rather it not be there but I
as I guess I'm resigned to the fact that
it's it's just something it's so up it's
there we're gonna get really close and
then someone's gonna [ __ ] it up and then
[Music]
yeah and also it is consistent with
quills character like quill isn't like
the most mature guy and even in this
movie that was established right what
you would expect him to act more on
emotion than sure dr. strange giving up
the stone just to save Starks life was a
little add um no actually think it's
fully justified inside the plot when
he's when he was doing his time future
[ __ ] or ever he said that he only
saw one path forward so it's entirely
possible because actually no I actually
would take money on this unless the
writers are [ __ ] garbage tear like
literal Game of Thrones Season 5 + or 4
+ garbage tear your saw this no
absolutely and I know that to be the
case
sure well I know this for two reasons
one is because he looks forward into the
future and he says that there was only
one path there was like 14 million 603
that [ __ ] up in one path where we
actually win and then when he's fading
away at the end when everybody is kind
of dying to the Infinity stones he says
this was the only way or it had to be
this way yeah so when we saw that line
combined with the earlier 4-cyl he has
to be saying that you know
if the Anniston of the time stone for
granite earth he'd probably have killed
100 percent of the heroes rather than
just 50% Oh maybe did the part with
spider-man and Tony's Peter was fading
away break you as well I thought tell
nail that um yeah I mean it was a pretty
sad part where they were all dying sure
I really just like the random plot
points that popped up the Smith the
stone in the forehead um yeah I mean
there was like a lot of kind of random
stuff but I mean damn they're weaving
together so many different stories and
they gave it I feel like they gave it
enough time I thought it was kind of
funny that Peter Dinklage plays is a
dwarf and plays a giant that was kind of
me me you can make it oh part of the
part of the shot compositions or
whatever I guess maybe this goes into
the cinematography a little bit I
thought that all of the fight scenes
were really really well done they all
felt like really impactful and they
didn't feel like I don't know in some
fight scenes I don't know if this is
just like a guy that follows Captain
America around or why but I feel like
everything that Captain America is
involved in he's like really cool
whereas like all the Ironman stuff is
like just tons of explosions and people
getting hit and flying like across the
universe and like a million times and
like everything's kind of silly but um I
felt like things were a lot more
scripted out in terms of action
sequences in this movie and again I feel
like with every Captain American movie
that just seems to be the case I don't
know if there's like a special dude that
he works with or something
but yeah I thought I thought like all of
that was handle really well everything
with the doctor the doctor strange dude
like people coming in and out of portals
and everything I thought that looked
really cool on film there are on the
screen I thought that all of that was
like incredibly smooth and everything
it's the ruse the Russo a Russo the
Russo brothers directed this movie in
the last two Captain America's oh okay
maybe
why couldn't strange use that portal
power to chop off the hand we saw
earlier in the beginning villain um I'm
not sure do you know why is there a
reason why why can you just make a
portal over the one dudes hands and then
chop off the hand well if he makes the
portal wouldn't have to put his hand in
it yeah that's well yeah like I don't
that seems like it would be very very
difficult to do mm-hmm
I'm like oh and it did happen happen
very much by chance yeah go
back to the fight cinematography and the
liking of Thanos I don't know how much
this movie wrote on Thanos for me all of
his fight scenes were really cool it
felt like a video game boss battle where
he had like the the different stones and
he was using all of the different stone
powers like in battle and he just out
lit up and did it everything I thought
that was really cute I really like that
yeah
tannaz was like the protagonist in this
movie I felt that way in a lot of ways
it kind of was you you know that usually
it's the protagonist the journey across
the universe trying to gather like a
certain number of stones in order to
accomplish their end goal or whatever
normally the protagonist has to make
like great sacrifices along the way
maybe even though the sacrifice of a
loved one like danos had to with Gamora
in some ways yeah you could argue that
that Thanos was the protagonist sure he
was the main character all along the
next the next movie is how they retcon
everything incorporate the x-men into
the Marvel of cinema
the next movie is the two Avengers
movies this one in the next one back to
back so gotcha
it is already filmed we just have to
wait two years for them to uh what
tension build again you know yeah maybe
okay mark what did you think about
Gamora speech to Thanos but were thrown
off a cliff I thought it was a bit silly
what I thought it was perfect what do
you mean I think it was really good
because Gamora in a way is verbalizing
the thoughts of the audience or at the
very least I thought that we were
getting like a Dumbledore moment that
was actually I really like that plot
point that was actually really good
really yeah so in Harry Potter movies
like yeah of course but the reason why
it was really good in Harry Potter and
the Philosopher's Stone
Dumbledore hides the philosopher's stone
and cast a spell or uses a trick in such
a way that somebody that wants to
destroy the universe or whatever or gain
like power for malicious ways would
never be able to acquire the stone and
the way that you acquire the
philosopher's stone was I don't remember
you had to look in that mirror not to do
it but the own
the stone would only appear for somebody
that didn't want to use it and I thought
that was really interesting so for the
soul stone the only way that you could
acquire the soul stone was if you'd get
if you'd make a sacrifice of something
that you truly loved and when when the
person said that when the gwyn that guy
[ __ ] and I remember his name they were
dude the red face dude when he said that
I thought that the the implication here
was gonna be okay Thanos [ __ ] himself
because Thanos is like a really evil
dude and he doesn't love anything right
he's just a bad guy so like he's never
gonna get the soul stone so I feel I
thought we were gonna go into a part on
like how what is he going to do to
actually get the soul stone says he
doesn't have anything he loves to
sacrifice but then you find out he
actually genuinely really does love his
daughter Gamora red skull yeah which I
thought was an interesting turn point
and get more verbalizes all about like
oh well you don't love anything you're
totally [ __ ] but then you find out
that his his love for his daughter is a
very very real thing I didn't see that
coming I thought that I thought that he
was actually [ __ ] there I see I
suppose the two ways you could have gone
there is like oh this means that he
needs to get someone else to get the
stone for him or that he's a sociopath
who actually does love his daughter and
wants to destroy yeah like yeah he's
probably a sociopath
that daughter is she's getting thrown
off the fluff well but but throwing her
off the cliff doesn't work unless he
actually loves her that was the whole
point but I mean you can be like I like
you could see him as like a sort of a
sociopath who does love and want to
destroy at the same time like like I
wasn't that surprised by that I guess
I'm not comfortable calling him a
sociopath though I mean I think that he
feels fully justified compassionately
for why he's dazed I mean what do you
think Thanos about first time failing
his destiny was he said he wouldn't fail
is SNe twice and killed Gamora um
haven't the other movies been about him
trying to get like the Infinity stones
like wasn't that guardians of the galaxy
one was the one guy Dan knows his son
trying to get an infinity stone far more
then he betrayed him or some [ __ ] and
then I feel like there were two
different movies I could be Brian I
remember it was him failing to save his
planet oh maybe
I was surprised rax was a non-factor on
the thinnest I was opposed to being me
and created to go who is which one is
Drax why do you remember that see if you
the big big off-colored dude guardians
of the galaxy sure that data is nothing
I don't think that guy is he's just like
a strong fighter that's it I don't think
that guy power level wise doesn't match
with any like I think Drax loses to
almost every single super hero even on
earth like I think Captain America
should be able to beat Drex in a
one-on-one that's what it feels like to
me that I could be wrong but do you
think I'm gonna I didn't undo literally
all the deaths who do you think some of
the dough's are gonna stick well then
make them so you can stick for sure
but I mean they probably a lot of do a
lot of these deaths I would not put it
past anything for there to be like a
rewind time do-over something I just
felt like all the main characters were
irrelevant to anything in the plot are
them the jokes I mean they were like a
lot of characters they were trying to
work in so how about the plot point
where the Hulk didn't want to come out I
don't know anything about that I'm
guessing that's explained like in a
whole movie or something
I think the Hulk was in the last Thor
movie I think he had to have been based
off of how the movie started yeah cuz I
looked this up yesterday I think the
whole close in the last Thor movie so
maybe it had something to do with that
or maybe was explained there maybe why
Bruce Banner can't change into the Hulk
[Music]
do you think it's possible that they
will reason with Thanos to undo his
crime maybe the real plot will be the
redemption arc of Thanos maybe
did you see after the credits um I
looked at it when I came home I didn't
see it in a theater
I waited for the mid credit roll but
then the mid credits came and then
nothing happened and then the lights and
the theater turned on and then the end
credits rolled so I thought that they
weren't gonna have one which is which
would have been I think like the first
time ever for a Marvel movie but but I
looked it up after I read a little bit
did you read anything about the Miss
Marvel or whatever yeah that's a movie
that's coming out next year along with
the next yeah I don't know about that
character sounds really dumb to me I'm
not sure like liberal Gontier power [ __ ]
what did you think about vision
throughout the movie um I must have
missed another movie with him I saw age
of Ultron but I must have missed the
movie where he like wants to go off and
become like a human or something because
I totally didn't get that at all the
best part of this movie is the
traumatized kids and normies walking out
of the theater after the endless and
pepper all I actually never saw Civil
War so that would explain why I don't
know about him so how they get your
money you guys see them all to get all
the lore what makes miss Marvel special
what are her powers supposedly miss
Marvel oh [ __ ] Kyle is a [ __ ] turtle
wait where'd you go Miss Marvel is
supposed to be like the strongest
superhero like of all of them like
stronger than [ __ ] right like
stronger than Thor they're kind of full
of [ __ ] does Saint wait what am I wrong
that's what I read I thought that um I
thought that Miss Marvel I'm pretty sure
there's an actual interview where they
sometimes I worry about my heart when I
workout while I'm on medication because
while I'm on it my heart rate increases
fairly easily it's called the Vance
so for heart conditions dude don't worry
about any of that [ __ ] do just push
yourself as hard as you can no I'm just
kidding all the research shows links
between running and osteoarthritis
people think that running wears out the
cartilage in your knees but I think most
physicians it's not attributed running
it's not while you're running with
injury or running with bad form or being
overweight sure we also had a lot more
free time but I guess we spend
everything I'm doing things I've done
this sitting yeah sitting is supposedly
really really bad for you I need to
research this more I'm uncomfortable
repeating this without like actually
looking it up but like I've heard that
like sitting is about as bad as smoking
that it's like a really really really
negative thing that we need to worry
about but running on concrete is
probably worse than anything else maybe
I would guess that the worst thing is
probably it's probably better to run on
concrete than a run to then running on
concrete on bare feet it's probably
better than running on dirt with shoes
though I think the shoes like really
[ __ ] with our ability to run well I
there I've read that a lot of place and
it kind of makes sense what part of your
body doesn't harm well it's just it like
we're we're so active as like a creature
like way so like we've evolved in an
environment where we're constantly
moving constantly active constantly out
and about and doing things and just the
idea of like just sitting in one place
for 10 hours I don't think is very very
healthy right I can any1 pretty bad
result pulmonary embolism sitting for
too long can cause blood clots isn't it
pulmonary embolisms are different than
DVT are isn't it or is DBT a type of
pulmonary embolism oh wait or as
pulmonary embolism that's just a name
for when a clot reaches your heart right
or is that oh no to the lungs to the
lungs others through these parts so this
is like sorry the posture of setting
itself probably isn't worse than any
other type of daytime physical
inactivity like lying on the couch
watching Wheel of Fortune but for most
of us when we're waking up moving we're
sitting this is your body on chairs
electoral activity and the muscles drops
the muscles go was silent as those of a
dead horse hamilton says leading to a
cascade of harmful metabolic effects or
calorie burning rate immediately plunges
to about 1
a third of what it would be if you got
up and walked insulin effectiveness
drops within a single day and the risk
of developing type 2 diabetes Rises so
does the risk of being obese the enzyme
research was responsible for breaking
down lipids and triglycerides for vacuum
if out of the bloodstream as Hamilton
puts it plunges which in turn causes the
level of good cholesterol to fall
Hamilton's most recent work has examined
how rapidly inactivity can cause harm
and studies have rats who are voice to
be inactive for example he discovered
that the leg muscles responsible for
standing almost immediately lost more
than 75 percent of their ability to
remove harmful lipoproteins from the
blood to show that the ill effects of
sitting could have a rapid onset in
humans to Hamilton recruited 14 young
fit and thin volunteers and recorded a
40 percent reduction in insulins ability
to uptake glucose and the subjects after
24 hours of being sedentary over a
lifetime the unhealthful effects sitting
at up
ALPA pat alba patel paddle patel an
epidemiologist at the american cancer
society tracked the health of 123
thousand americans between 1992 and 2006
the men in the study who spent six hours
or more per day at their leisure time
sitting had an overall death rate that
was about 20% higher than the men who
sat for three hours or less the death
rate for women who sat for more than six
hours a day was about 40% higher patel
estimates that on average people who sit
to much shave a few years off their
lives
another study pop i'm gonna I hope they
controlled for confounds here I'm I'm
kind of hope so but I'm not interested
but another study published last year in
the Journal of circulation looked at
nearly 9,000 Australians and found that
for an additional hour of television a
person sat and watched per day the risk
of dying rose by 11 percent the study
author David Dunstan wanted to analyze
whether the people who sat watching
television had other unhealthful
on healthful habits that caused them to
die sooner but after crunching the
numbers he reported that age sex
education smoking hypertension waist
circumference BMI glucose tolerance
status and leisure time exercise did not
significantly modify the associations
between television viewing and all cause
mortality so this goes into saying that
like just the idea of seating for huge
periods of time can take a toll on your
health sitting it would seem is an
independent pathology being sedentary
for nine hours a day at the office is
bad for your health whether you go home
and watch television afterwards or hit
the gym it's bad weather you morbidly
obese or marathon
on earth in excessive sitting dr. Levine
says is a lethal activity the good news
is that in activities peril can be
countered working late one night at 3:00
a.m. dr. Levine coined a name for the
concept of ripping major benefits to
thousands of minor movements each day
meat which stands for non-exercise
activity thermogenesis in the world of
neat even the little stuff matters
McCrae Z Mik McCrady Spitzer showed me a
chart that tracked my calorie burning
rate with zigzagging lines like those of
a seismograph what's that I asked
pointing to one of the spikes which
indicated that the red had shot up
that's when you bend over to tie your
shoes she said it took your body more
energy than just sitting still an
emotion tracking study dr. Levine found
that obese subjects averaged only 1,500
daily movements and nearly 600 sitting
minutes in my trial with magic underwear
I came out looking somewhat better 2234
individual movements and 367 sitting are
Mining's minutes sitting but I was still
nowhere near the farmworkers dr. Levine
at studying in Jamaica who averaged
5,000 daily movements and only 300
minutes sitting
dr. Levine knows that we can all be
farmers so instead he's exploring ways
for people to redesign their
environments that they can encourage
more movement we visited a cheerless
first-grade classroom where the students
spent each part of the day crawling
along now it's labeled a vocabulary
words and shared between platforms while
reciting math problems we stopped by a
human resources staffing agency where
many of the employees worked on the move
at treadmill desks a creation of dr.
Levine's later sold by a company called
Steelcase dr. Levine was in a
philosophical mood as we left the temp
agency for all the hard science against
sitting he admits that his campaign
against what he calls the chair based
lifestyle is not limited to simply a
quest for about a physical health his is
a war against inertia itself which he
believes sickens more than just our body
go into cube lane in a tightly
controlled corporate environment and you
immediately sense that there's a malice
malice about being tied behind a
computer screen seated all day he said
the soul of the nation is sapped and now
it's time for the soul of the nation to
rise
I'd imagine this is an issue for those
on the ISS as well oh yeah for sure
things like bone density and whatnot
drop hard core when you spend any amount
of time on the International Space
Station people that come back to earth
have to spend like well I thought it was
weeks but chat coordinators like months
in a wheelchair even with the resistance
training I guess like it's kind of like
if you take like a really complicated
program
and then you try to like [ __ ] I don't
know I'm trying to think of an analogy I
can't think of an analogy listen we have
spent millions and millions and millions
of years doing particular things like
living the hunter-gatherer lifestyle so
the the whole like sitting down for all
day and like doing computer stuff and
all that that's like it's really really
really recent so there could be really
far-reaching negative effects that are
happening that are not immediately
apparent or immediately noticeable just
because we I mean well obviously we
haven't a time at all to adapt and well
we never will have time to adapt in an
evolutionary sense right so like yeah I
don't know um you should it'll be
interesting to see what comes out of
that type of research like how [ __ ]
are we gonna be because of stuff like
that is it bad that I do anything
strenuous with parts of my body my body
shakes a lot and I can't stop it
turb how much do you weigh and how tall
are you because there's two things that
could be going on
time to get my time to flex my house
diagnosis skills
hey I'm 170 pounds and 6 feet tall that
sounds about right
your what would that be like a little
bit on the low end of normal what is
normal BMI oh oh a little bit on the
high end of normal damn okay but still
normal the two things that I know of
personally that causes like shakiness
assuming that you don't you're not like
have like a sugar to fishes in you're
dying of like type 1 diabetes or some
[ __ ]
the so if you don't do anything and
you're okay if you don't do anything and
you're very very very weak if you watch
somebody go to do like a benchpress
right you have you've got there's
there's so much that goes into the
movement of your body holy [ __ ] there's
so much it's so complicated when you go
to push a weight up right if you're
bench pressing you've got I think is it
two primary movers or three primary
movers your pecs
your big boob must
those are the ones that do most of the
pushing I think it's your anterior
deltoids the front of your shoulders
pushes well and then you've got your
triceps which help to extend right so
whenever you do like a lift I don't know
if all three of those kinds of primary
movers I'm pretty sure they do [ __ ]
what's that exercise website hold on
target muscle is gonna be like your big
mover and then synergists are also your
I guess these don't count as primary
movers I don't know if I don't know if
your uh-oh
so anterior delts and then your triceps
I don't know if these count as primary
movers or not
your primary mover might only be your
chest I don't know how did people find
it but basically like you've got those
three big muscles are like are involved
in like actually moving the way right
but so there are two things that happen
as you as you start lifting okay the
first thing that happens is when you
start to move a weight there's two types
of adaptations that occur that allow you
to move weight without being like
[ __ ] shaky as [ __ ] the first thing
that happens is your stabilizers right
you have these things called dynamic
stabilizers and what they help you do is
they help you move the weight like in a
smooth manner right so your biceps which
are used for a pulling right which are
used for this motion your arm also help
you when you're pushing because they
help to stabilize your muscle around the
joint right because because every joint
has a muscle it has muscles that move it
like forward and backwards so having a
stabilizers helps you keep from shaking
and in in that sense so actually like
working out those muscles can can make
your movements around joints more stable
which is good and then the second thing
that happens is that as you move more
weight or as you start moving weight
central nervous system adaptation occurs
right your CNS um adapts as well so that
you're actually capable of moving weight
in like a in a steady manner without
being like a shaky person doing it so if
you're super shaky when you move things
usually like if you train at it for a
little bit and your muscles develop and
then your mind gets a little bit better
at utilizing and recruiting a lot of
your muscle fibers
that'll help and then yeah I think it's
a it's yeah that's the main thing if
you're out but you could also be shaky
because you don't eat at all or because
you have like a [ __ ] sugar problem
and you're dying but yeah I did do some
weight training but I stopped at some
point for a while yeah if you stick with
it you'll stop shaking like the shaking
is gonna be really common when you first
start because your cuz all of your
stabilizers are totally undeveloped and
it's a mind thing to it why
the cns adaptations that occur are
really important as well when it comes
to weightlifting the ability to like
actually recruit all of your muscle
fibers to do a lift is a really big part
that CNS adaptation is a really big part
that's why some exercises are harder
than others and are even more exhausting
to like like things like dead lifting or
squatting are like hugely taxing on your
CNS or it's why I don't know if this is
true or not but some people will say
that like if you're stuck on your bench
that like dead lifting and squatting can
help other exercises that are totally
unrelated because the CNS adaptation and
stressing and everything that occurs can
cause I don't know if that's true or not
oh that might be a little bro science eh
but I've heard people say that that like
if you get stuck on exercises doing like
totally unrelated [ __ ] that's massively
CNS taxing can help you on having stuff
to it but um I don't know this is a
concept known as greasing a groove the
idea you have to actually practice
lifting yeah sure what were your
personal best in your lifts all pathetic
is fun hi I got my deadlift up the two
blades well the next time we start
lifting will go for three plates okay
someday
listen I just the problem is it like I
don't want to start lifting again if I'm
not eating properly you know and I don't
want to start eating properly if I'm not
lifting again because what's the point
so it's like you're stuck in a perpetual
state of being a lazy piece of [ __ ] I
think the CNS adaptations are a big
reason why like if you start working out
and then you stop if you start again
it's easier to rebuild muscle that
you've had before
you'll lose muscle really [ __ ] fast
holy [ __ ] or at least I do I you lose I
lose muscle insanely [ __ ] quick if I
stop working out but but if you start
working out again you can recover older
muscle quicker than building new muscle
if that makes sense
opinions on rock climbing for fitness a
lot of lifters hate rock climbers for
some reason so like in an ideal world
we're into totally subjective [ __ ]
in an ideal world in my opinion
lifting is an accessory activity that
you do to build upon a primary activity
so like now for me personally I would
never do that because I don't do
physical primary activities I would just
lift to lift like when I looked at I
just lifted because I enjoyed lifting
well not because I enjoyed lifting [ __ ]
that because I wanted to get stronger I
look better
but like if you do rock climbing like in
my opinion like that should be like your
primary goal and if you go and you lift
then you lift around rock climbing right
like that's it so like people that do
like football when you lift when you
when you condition for football you go
to the gym to help you with football you
go to the gym right ham ideally you'd
never need to lift weights right you
would just be physically active enough
to not need to um maybe like in a super
ideal world but like I don't know like
the thing is that like lifting can
confer other benefits as well like if
like like here's an example right like
if you can deadlift you know three
plates you might not be picking up 300
pounds of [ __ ] on the daily but if
you've got to carry like an awkwardly
shaped like 200 pound box or like 150
pound desk having a 315 pounds left
gives you like the structure to do that
safely you know and I don't know like I
think like I personally notice a
difference like I think that like just
lifting gives you more of a poof we're
dipping into the brow science a little
bit but like it gives you like a
slightly higher kinesthetic awareness I
think of your body so like if I look
back to how I used to pick things up
before and after learning to deadlift
like I it is cringe-worthy so like today
if I try to pick something up I'll never
hurt my back picking something up
because I know how to pick stuff up now
because because I because I know how to
do dillos right whereas like before I
would do the thing when you lean over
you pick it up and then you have like
the like when your back does this
because you lift it up and you're
letting your whole you're loosening up
everything in your trunk and you're just
letting it hang off your [ __ ] spine
like like that [ __ ] I'm like I'll never
pick something up like that again ever
because I know how to pick [ __ ] up you
know like having a neutral back and
everything that's really important so I
think that like getting involved in
exercises that like at least like big
compound lifts that help you move your
whole body I think is probably important
to some extent and that building up that
muscle in general it makes you a better
more physically capable of doing things
right
you can still pull something even with
perfect form it happens all the time
even to experienced lifters um I mean if
you're warming up properly and you
maintain proper form unless you're like
getting really unless you're like
pushing it
I don't you shouldn't really good you
shouldn't really pull something no if
you're pulling something that sounds
like you're not doing a proper warm-up
I'm not saying I could never happen but
I mean like it seems like that if that's
if that's happening it probably
shouldn't be it happens mostly with
weight you are familiar with so you
don't pay attention too much oh well
sure I mean if you're not if you're just
derping about then you know of course
you can always hurt yourself I think for
you all right boys now watch how this is
done the key is to put it all in your
groin in your back take your legs
totally out of the equation lift with
your lower back in a jerking twisting
motion oh my god call an ambulance where
is the guy that did the video on um what
did he call him like- deadlifts or
something I don't even know what he
called it but where you dead lift with
it behind you to work out your to work
out your outer back I never could tell
if this was a meme or not doesn't even
know what I'm talking about
oh it's the reverse deadlift first is
this a real thing Hillshire
it's called the barbell back squat Oh
barbell hack squat so one interesting
this can ask a question it means yeah do
you think difference between life
someone has like five generations of
people who listen to fire and Beethoven
and you know philosophy like an eternal
F and people who've just live in Africa
is in like a tribal thing and then they
come into the first world do you not
think there might be some difference
between them on something like so many
levels like do you think that we're all
equal do you consider yourself more like
in the former category yeah cool can you
name me a single Bach or Beethoven song
besides moonlight sonata or Fur Elise
yet you consider yourself part of this
group like come on dude it's where you
can play owner joy like the whole
Orchestra like every woe is there it is
there it has no skater dude in here yeah
what's going on destiny you're not even
oh wait no man yo what's up what's going
on nothing much
oh yeah um we were just talking and
someone brought you up and I was like is
a bit of a cringe on the ethnos tape
like I just don't I didn't maybe I don't
understand your position properly but
you're against like the idea of an
ethnos date are you all yeah I would say
it's really [ __ ] stupid for a lot of
different reasons like what can I just
ask like what like what I like and I
mean perhaps we should play around with
definitions and stuff but like do you
consider like Israel to be stupid or
birthday at all or not not really um I
don't know too much about like the ethno
policies of Israel but I don't like
Israel for a whole host of other reasons
yeah yeah so do you do you acknowledge
the concept of ethnocentrism why are you
reading the are my concert believe in or
what do you mean yeah that's a thing
that I would say is being historically
around for like thousands of years um
kind of I think there's a difference
between like intentional ethnos state
versus a happenstance ethno state like
for instance I'd like some places might
be a majority of a certain race but they
don't necessarily enforce that it's just
how things end up being right should
they preserve that even if they just end
up like that from
so if you ever feel like I'm unfairly
characterizing you please tell me I just
do this to make sure that we're both on
the same page so when you say should Rey
I'm assuming you're asking me if there's
a moral imperative for them to do so and
I would argue no I don't think there's a
moral imperative to maintain a certain
racial distribution in any given country
do you what about like the argument that
like Rome can or should remain Rome and
shouldn't just let in say serious become
part of Syria give up their culture give
up their people give up the history so I
reject all of the give up culture I
don't I don't I don't understand what
that means as somebody that studied
culture I don't understand what it means
to give up culture like cultures
changing all the time what do you mean
like a random from say England or
America or Australia they're gonna have
a certain culture compared to if you
take a random from Somalia or
Afghanistan it's I don't I don't know I
don't really I don't really agree with
that either I think that if you take
from from if you take like say you take
somebody from a rural state in the
United States I think they would have
more in common with say a fundamentalist
Muslim than they would with me so I
don't agree that there's like some
massive unifying culture across all of
the Western world even in the United
States there are dramatically varying
cultures between cities and countries
Wehling people and whatnot yeah
differences in culture but I mean like
the general values of a society give me
a general value that you think all
Americans share yeah you can see where
I'm going with this but I can't see we
going okay we'll give me a general value
that you think all Americans to share
god-given right to the omen created
equal okay so we had slavery for a long
[ __ ] time a lot of people have very
different ideas about the implementation
of all people created equal
I mean you're arguing in favor of the
Methow state you're not American of
course but I mean there are a lot of
Americans that think that not all people
are created equal that some people are
inherently better than other people I
mean this is not a shared value you
don't think what like violence might not
be like a little less acceptable say in
America than it is in Somalia but
culturally even not just legally but
culture
I mean it really depends on what exactly
you're talking about if you look at like
our our our prison systems I think
people are very much in favor of like
retribution violence like we talk all
the time about how like if somebody
commits a crime I hope that guy gets
raped in jail and [ __ ] like that
well it's a former no it's not that's
not empirically borne out in any data
whatsoever so you're saying that if we
just like prison what violent people go
or like what do you suggest we do that
we actually try to rehabilitate them
like what other first world countries
try to do at least Scandinavia is trying
to do right it's not really like yeah
they do but they're not like American
ones
yeah but the goal is different in
America we look at punish and
retribution and justice those are what
we think about we think of prisons
prisons are supposed to be for
rehabilitation not a way to have
vengeance
mean yeah I think I can agree with that
we can we can criticize the American
girls it's been that fun basically all
the golden I'm trying to get across is
that I think that you win your argument
by default if you present a really
disingenuous view of the West is having
some unified culture because then you
can turn it into an us versus them thing
really easily but I always gonna find
exceptions like if I say most people in
the West so it's wrong to kill someone
there well no no I'm not I mean for
something as vague as that I would agree
that most people say that it's probably
wrong to kill someone for like tomorrow
would you agree that most people say
it's probably okay to kill someone I
don't I don't know too much about
Somalia so I'm not entirely sure I don't
know because all I can say what they
would say right these pretty much okay
most komali i need maybe yours that
you're going like bottom of the barrel
like sub-saharan african countries at
that point but yeah you're giving her an
example this is this isn't like a mark
against all black people or anything
though we're pretty far from an ethnos
state but but yeah i get AG i guess i
could agree that sure people say why do
you assume there's some racist in mp1
because were having a discussion about
an ethnos state it's racially motivated
well how is that racially motivated and
isn't just about rights it's about
culture it's about language it's about
an entire day this guy someone who's
growing up with say you know what no
wait horn right if it's about wait if
it's about language and culture the wine
I just make a culture state or a
language State well I mean no that's not
where earth knows what is Estonian what
does he ask no card stand for okay so it
doesn't mean culture and language no no
is not nation that would be civic
nationalism that's not what at the no
state means no it's not we were you
lying to be we're not talking about the
etymology this isn't a let's go to the
dictionary and find out if ethnos state
and nation meant the same thing then why
do you need the word ethnos state you're
being disingenuous right now come on
yeah I mean obviously they're different
you know ways that you refer to ethno
state and it's not contextually similar
similar the way you're using himself
yeah you're being a bit ridiculous like
obviously destiny is using it in a
different sense well no I know I'm using
it in the same sense that he's using it
he's just pretending that he's using it
differently now I totally reject the
idea that what pretending to language
culture erase all of these things this
can ask a question it's mean yeah do you
think difference between life has like
five generations of people who listen to
bark and Beethoven and you know fool
Sophie like an eternal F and people
who've just live in Africa is in like a
tribal thing and then they come into the
first world do you not think there might
be some difference between them on like
so many levels like do you think bed
we're all equal do you consider yourself
more like in the former category yeah
cool can you name me a single Bach or
Beethoven song
besides the moonlight sonata or Fur
Elise yet you consider yourself part of
this group like come on dude it's where
you can play Otto joy
the whole Orchestra like every
instrument the main you know anything
that most people in Western culture I
can like like know all of like the
discography of a bah
I guess it's possible when I look at
popular music today it seems you kidding
how is that it this is like the most
disingenuous like me my Vivaan heard
like just I like when I look at music
today you're acting like if I go out on
the streets that I look at white people
there's like all of these people
worshipping like classical I don't know
it's just like a really weird argument
I'm just saying people in the West we've
all heard but I bet there's a lot of
like really complicated polyrhythmic
music and [ __ ] in a lot of african
places that we're not familiar with it i
mean they are related I'm not a
Christian I hate Christianity but like I
know lead is probably part of my mind in
a way that I don't understand or even
why you would you agree with something
like that there's thing though wait how
can you save it again like you can you
can be completely against something like
say Christianity but it can be part of
who you are and part of your mind
becoming I am completely against
Christian I don't consider it a part of
my mind at all I don't know what you
mean by that
how did see your values everything in
your life is it could be probably
related back to that in a lot of ways
um I mean your culture around you is
inescapable to some extent I would agree
with that sure right so I don't see
where we're disagreeing then we got to
agree okay wait what did we just agree
on sorry well I'm saying that people
have the right to having a first day
that do to control their own it okay how
did we yeah
let's just pull up nations okay sure
well yeah if we agree that people have
right to form a nation then yeah we
don't disagree on anything United States
is already a nation well no it's not by
what nations are the
by ethnicity this is a you thought that
you thought it was wrong to have a net
next day that was and it was stupid and
stuff like that I guess you can say I II
III don't know we've like tautologically
defined like do you think that three is
five and I'm like no and then the other
guys like well actually it is because by
definition five is three and I'm like
well wait why is that he's like well
because five is three it's like I don't
know like what I probably it was mostly
French I don't know the history of
France my history is actually pretty
[ __ ] so Nations has developed where
ethnic groups centric absolutely oh okay
he said the United States was Native
Americans or what is the ethnic
background of the United States
it was mostly what people actually said
in the day it was it was mostly Western
Europeans so some French some Germans
and primarily English okay so in the new
like America should we have like only
English people since that's like what
our primary founding ethnicity was or so
we get rid of all the Germans all the
Spaniards all the Italians all the
Irishmen probably get rid of the
Spaniards in the Irish yes interesting
and now that everybody's like their
blood is all muddled up what do we do
with all the mixed people and everything
we case by case basis I guess try to
figure out what I've a solution like I
think we descend them to Israel okay or
or to you know the Middle East or Mexico
or something like other places where
mixing has occurred frequently but not
in the United States where mixing has
not occurred frequently even though this
is literally a country of immigrants
well a country to save the United States
we should probably try to get rid of as
many next people as possible because
mixing those destroy nations yes that's
a interesting okay
I mean most mixed countries are fallen
civilizations of some variety I need
most of every type of country as a
fallen civilization I'm not aware of
countries today that have existed for I
agree so maybe every single country is
just doomed to fail
so what so definitely do you think I'm
like Napoleon Bonaparte and stuff like
that well like that [ __ ] right the entry
was democratic not checks yeah they
probably were gonna fit but I mean Lucy
rises to being at my century look
because that was a concept thousand yeah
if you're a note if your ethnocentric
and you're basing your values on the
brace of somebody I would argue that
yeah of course you're racist that's like
the definition of being racist yeah but
again has no central I'm not limiting I
don't know way but that definition for
it to me when I look it up it says if I
can't talk and top percentile yeah okay
hey I think that diversity increases the
amount of racism any place that it's
practiced so well of course and having
hands having hands increases the amount
of violence that occurs anywhere that I
mean you can't have races and without
multiple races you can't have violence
without fans that doesn't make original
things necessarily bad yes so no there
is no benefits to our economy by having
immigrant labor any like that all of
that is strictly negative absolutely
under what definition all they do you
just force people to make more babies is
that like a new government program yeah
but it'll be less productive than if you
would allow people to come into the
country that's not I mean it's true by
definition
why do you what do you think happens
when employed what people that could be
doing so our unemployment is not looking
for percent in the United States what
are you doing anyway destiny but I'm but
wouldn't you think that's like a
short-term way of looking at it like no
I'm looking at it in the long-term way
really we're bringing all these people
for what is a short-term thing of
producing more food
why do you think markets and the economy
are short-term things labor is a
resource you grow your country by
expanding your pool of resources like
would you how is it a short-term thing
because it has a short-term effect but
it has a long-term right I guess I just
don't see all these societies suffering
that destiny a good way to refuse this
guy's point is to bring up the study
yeah I understand David cards
immigration study it's the Mariel
boatlift stuff that but that's just
economic stuff what why can't you just
here's a question because I just don't
understand this why can't you just live
with people that look different than you
why is it like such a big deal for you
okay so what name one action quickly did
this but destiny this quickly I'm happy
to leave with people that leave like
that look differently and all that if
it's like 1020 percent of the population
I don't want it to be 80% of the
population changes to a different
culture why does it matter well because
I think that would change the Coakley
kid like in what negative way they
change what the culture so our culture
today is the culture of Bach and
Beethoven what does that even mean but
no it's a developmental and absolutely
it's extensional it's it's out our
culture is undeniably better than
Somalian okay you you do know that I
mean it's just like a really weird wait
it sounds like a really basic uneducated
way to describe a culture like X culture
is better than this Kotter there's a
really witty what do you mean like that
sounds like a Momo relativism cultural
relativism honestly being in yeah of
course because everything is relative
yeah the way our culture changes all the
time so like pain is relative suffering
is relative to some extent yeah some
people today if they lose their cell
phones like go [ __ ] crazy I would say
that's a relative kind of stuff right so
say I'll give you the same hair
questionnaire you ask Russell Brand if
you had your children we were doing some
sort of experiment
the other daughters an active girl can
say America or they could grow up in
Afghanistan which one would you choose
for them if you want their well you get
their well-being in mind probably
probably the United States versus
Afghanistan sure now see that sounds
like a simplistic understanding how are
you saying that way better than then I
didn't say we were better than them
you're talking about you're asking me a
question of nations and then you're
trying to say that applies to the people
you're asking two separate things the
country of the United States of America
is better than the country of
Afghanistan in my opinion in several
different ways however it's not just
about the people though it's about our
institutions that we've built that those
don't just go away because you bring
other people into the country you really
think we put the institutions in the
Middle East that we've done over time
yeah sure I think that most countries
would probably tend towards something
that we have I might I don't know I
guess it could be a little different I
don't know it kind of depends I mean
okay you sang her baton let's say that
happens over a hundred years what about
right now though they're talking about
now are we I'm not I look into the
future I have a kid I want the future to
be as good as it possibly can be good
kids lots been he's really gonna he's up
gonna stand gonna be as good as America
in the next 50 to 60 years well I don't
know maybe African countries have made
extreme games all across the board in
the past like 20 or 30 years I don't
know if not yet but I mean as they get
better it's better for the US as well
like if about if Africa is a valuable
trading partner to the United States we
can market goods to them if we can get
labor from them like so yeah so I would
want these nations to develop as much as
possible yeah sure we met in both
keeping their people in their nation and
not letting them all come to our nation
no I mean I don't know I'm I guess I'm a
liberal I don't know what your
background is but like I mean that like
in the classical sense so like I think
people should be free to choose to do
what they want to do what they feel is
best for their lives as long as you're
not infringing on the rights of other
people even if they don't classical
liberals themselves they want to come to
you and impose they Sharia law stuff
like that they should still just be left
in Iran at your country and you know I
would I mean I would hope that the laws
of my country or whatever could protect
me from that I
wait what's here what's your major what
are you sitting I'm signing
international relations at USC okay do
you think Trump has done a good job so
far with his international relations
shitty job he's just not understand ah
so ever okay we'll call I mean if you
want to set something up you can always
like message me on disk or something but
yeah I don't usually just like drag a
bunch of people in because then people
just start screaming at each other and
it's not much - hey no that sounds good
destiny alright you don't have a Twitter
right you're banned off though I am the
[ __ ] you put there's a bunch of [ __ ]
that put their [ __ ] on the what are you
putting on there that gets you bad I
just I make fun of black people that
want to have white f no space is what I
did last time they got me banned so how
long the ban you for your blog it's okay
I'm like comma band on every account I
can't even make a new account oh I'm
tagged with you discord dear what do
discord
oh yeah view message me a discredit yeah
I always check out sure all right I'm
gonna send friend request to you I'll
hit you up later whenever you got
something going on and I feel like I
have something to add to this
conversation sure thing buddy okay my
issues like even is at rolling I got the
share budget 5 of their went rolling
like I'm friends with like they're not
they're not trolling I like I spent a
lot of time I don't know yes oh yeah
well I mean look it I mean Trump is
president dude what do you mean our
peoples areas well that's the that's the
alt-right calling card is that a lot of
people believe that because Jewish
people are over represented in media
that they're using that position to
flood multiculturalism to the rest to
the West to destroy the white man that's
like the Jewish religion news going I
mean Christianity is going now because
they're converted to Judaism
it's just through globalization people
sway away from that's what their
argument is they'll say that well Jews
are causing global ISM to happen that's
why the Jewish globalism conspiracy is a
thing Jews are causing global ISM to
make everybody secular yeah so that they
can people like a large audience and
they're just like you miss informing
people why you might have viewers that
are barely developing their political
views or things like that and they start
hearing people talking like that they
might be very you know how produced
knowledge they might believe what
they're saying so that's we thought was
me you know yeah of course it annoys me
too these people have huge [ __ ]
audiences on YouTube the Holocaust
revisionists and everything or you know
get a lot of views and a lot of people
are into that [ __ ] now so it's it's you
know I sometimes in some of my classes
which say that the us in certain aspects
is like a thurible contra contrary I
phones just because I like the level of
an occasion that people have yeah maybe
in some ways but I don't know if it's
unique to the u.s. I mean I don't know
people respond predictably to give an
environment the refugee crisis has
caused like a surge of kind of
right-leaning sentiment to sweep across
a lot of Europe know things like brexit
and whatnot which I think were yeah I
think I feel like brexit was largely
driven by immigration as much as Xers
will deny it I think I had the
opportunity to talk with two former UK
Prime Minister's and we were discussing
this wait what do you you you are you a
undergrad I am what are you talking to
you United Kingdom prime ministers
before you would have wit in what
context oh well that sounds really cool
you are you um you guys live in LA right
oh cool
where are you from originally okay you
can't see my face you can see I'm brown
Hey just cuz you're from Mexico doesn't
necessarily mean you're brown okay
chill chill no matter right no but well
I don't have you know USC they say don't
Southern California yeah of course I
mean sure if you say that's what yeah
what about it no but it's like it's a
really it's a really it's an r1
institution that's really good it's an
instrument of college it's oh I don't
know I mean I know a lot about colleges
just because I'm one but if you know
UCLA where like UCLA rivals were
Stanford's rival like a West Coast Ivy
school okay we have lights watch another
Institute he comes here all the time
do you debate politics on - exit stream
a lot no destiny much hat has no [ __ ]
IQ she talks like this [ __ ] is too
smart
leave breaks something dumb [ __ ] like
there's so I mean look I love my viewers
kind of right but when she talks she
likes cuz you know they just like
watching things break and then just BAM
ook ook in the chat so like when anyone
talks with an IQ they get intimidated
and then they get mad at me and like
tell her go gotta handle this ok I'm
curious I have one question one question
I'm curious about this is the big meme
question right now do you think that
Rosen Stein and molar will survive for
the next like month like throughout the
next like through June or whatever yeah
that molar or Rosenstein or whatever
that all of these guys are gonna make it
through because I mean he's got a fire
Rosen Stein to get rid of molar right
probably do you think because fire
Miller will be you know what a
democratic nation should stand for her
haven't so many of his advisers quit
though literally because he doesn't
listen to them
wasn't that the whole point of like his
economic but at the same time I do think
that sometimes he's afraid of certain
things so he does I got
handful of people that he will isn't
mmm-hmm what do you think are those
people no because I would have assumed
before it was people like Benin but I
mean he's gone he was to power hunger
and champion and like that competition
kind of like with Roger stone or
whatever during the campaign memes
advice or that freakin di ever dude oh
yeah you know I she surrounds herself
with people like that but I think that
he still has some people with some sort
of decency that will understand how
dangerous it will be to fire Muller okay
yeah I don't I guess we'll see in the
coming months like I told you I go to
college yeah I mean I got a boner cuz
you're smart nice 18 year old girls they
don't know what the [ __ ] they want in
life and they're just like oh you just
have lots of viewers and that's nice to
give me a host it's like oh well I see
where this is gonna go gotta find
someone that doesn't scream and oh [ __ ]
I remember going through I've been yeah
how long have you been streaming for
three years okay yeah I've been in it
for quite a long time like eight years I
learned that a long time ago that you
can't [ __ ] with people like in industry
because that [ __ ] gets like so messy so
I mean like you've seen all the twitch
drama and [ __ ] went upstream
relationships gonna end when the [ __ ]
comes in your chat she's like all cute
and stuff and spans her own channel
Lincoln's like guys just letting you
know after my baby's done I'm and to be
here it's like [ __ ] alright when she
starts banning people who uh huh in your
chat a control kick it called the [ __ ]
now you have to control your viewers is
it me or is it them it's like you know
so to be fair could probably work but a
lot of the guys like [ __ ] roll over
immediately to right though I like I've
had to set hard boundaries like on the
pass for somebody that I'm dating is
like hey like I don't like how you're
chad is blah blah blah it's like okay
well listen dude like I could start
banning people but then everybody's
gonna [ __ ] hate you is that what you
want because we can do that if you want
to go down that road but like you know
yeah I don't know okay you have to
control them tell them to stop but it's
like
it's like yeah you surprising over yeah
it's like one of the class don't do this
they're all gonna [ __ ] do it it's
like when you're at church and your
mom's tell you not to laugh you just sit
there laugh the whole time
mm-hmm but you know she gets it she
doesn't get offended I hope my dad's so
[ __ ] toxic Terry do you play old
school runescape do you play runescape
three or whatever recently and this is
me just being honest I haven't been
playing runescape just because I get
less viewers there and when I go under I
roll and just sit there and [ __ ] and
do really nothing to be honest with you
and just bring you people in real life
that seems to do more success Oh cuz
rince keeps it like I mean I know
there's a cap to it especially when I
bring content to runescape a lot of
people just keep asking what the [ __ ] it
is that in the background that's so
stupid
sure the game but I don't know I much
rather change the way I run my streams
cuz like they're so [ __ ] toxic I mean
yeah we're really hard to change up like
a whole fanbase like that good luck
buddy I suppose I'd in it's great god
I've been trying to do it for [ __ ]
forever come not toxic that's impossible
I already cultivated then like that over
the past three years it's just uh just
try to do different content mm-hmm oh
there's a stupid [ __ ] people love
personalities people make like become
more just about your personality than
the game you know like people like
watching someone who's interesting or I
mean I feel like anyone that watches
RuneScape's got to be really lonely if
they're actually watching the [ __ ]
game sure well I what IRL is like the
distillation of what made everything in
streams successful in the first place
like a lot of people don't realize that
that streamers got a lot of streamers
got popular because of their personality
right so IRL is just like just taking
the personality away from the game and
then yeah there it is but that's a
little struggle right there but um that
back to the tangent
my chat hates my girlfriend but for the
most part I mean they've come a münster
like she doesn't get triggered over
people calling her stupid [ __ ] because
she gets it she understands that if you
give that [ __ ] attention it just becomes
the most permanent thing cause like if
you ever let anyone you know get to
under your skin that's what they're
gonna say to you for the rest of your
[ __ ] time on every stream yeah I'm
over different things
like Oh Trump and I'm like chill there
well I'm like amazing you know they just
show you with different things and that
I don't care I understand they're just
people behind the screen that feel like
they can say what everyone in the can
and then what I can do is I can ignore
them oh yeah I don't care
well the thing is I found it before I
ever explained to it which was yeah
really gay explaining that to her yeah I
kind of man like especially because it's
like that couldn't be like oh yeah I'm
like a professional gamer no no I say
you do dumb [ __ ] I'm 21
and I dropped out of college to finish
this off and collect as much money as
possible it's like oh that's so I'll be
still be are we gonna be a thing but I
mean she gets it back to college because
I dropped out six months ago just so I
can move out here and do this am what
you go to school for school and I just
finished literally all I did was finish
off my generals and then my whole family
was pushing me like okay look we want
you to have something stable something
that you'll do for the rest of your life
how about you just become a nurse I'm
like no I hate people I don't want to do
that type of [ __ ] thanks that's like med
school right or no do you need to go to
med school to be for like RN or whatever
I would think I'd have to go for four
years and then I would do just numerous
in numerous months of just internship
and then I'd finally get the job but I
don't want to do that because like you
donor sir yet from there on out but
that's pretty much your job and that's I
mean that's your bread and butter for
the rest your life but I want to try
something different
take some risks gotcha well when you're
young that's the time to time ago but I
could still very young oh the hand she's
finishing up her she's got one more year
and then like two more weeks of the
semester and then black just smokes weed
what is he like a guy in your stream for
IRL content or a real life friend like
at our hero and Dance Dance Revolution
read them games type of thing did you
ever do a college loan like a year yeah
I was like streaming on the side just
for fun then I saw the potential in it
and then I just went full-time I was
doing my psychology graphic design oh
[ __ ]
I mean what did you do in college
destiny I went to school for like three
years for music I used to I play the
saxophone I wanted to do composition but
I was working too much so I had to quit
I don't believe you I love how the chest
like wait why is destiny talk knife onyx
this guy's stupid as [ __ ] I know that's
true
I mean I understand it and by the way
doesn't your streams like buffering like
yeah pays real [ __ ] or not I live in the
United States I can't do what you're
better you know what do you use for IRL
scare me I'm curious what what Kari do
you have IRL stream just like in the
house so like I don't like WoW but like
yeah just smoke and bring people over
just have some fun I want to start doing
more like actual going outside because
that's more fun sitting inside cooped up
all day gets tiring yeah kind of applied
for like two weeks but I broke too much
TOS with that because of harassment with
phone calls going into everywhere and
now that's pretty much I don't think
that's even tolerate to any aspect when
it comes to switches new guidelines yeah
that's kind of like I'm really lucky and
that like my fan base doesn't do [ __ ]
like that but if I'm doing something
popular and I start to pick up like a
lot of viewers that from the outside
especially cuz I'm like I've hung out or
talk to a lot with ice before so like
sometimes his fans will brigade over I
don't know how you're supposed to deal
with that as an IRL streamer like how do
you go anywhere and not have people
exploding and [ __ ] yeah it really just
depends on how you've cultivated your
audience and mine's just very toxic so
in blood go out they would like there
would be times that they would call the
cops on me and they'd have to search my
backpack and you know I at first me
being stupid thinking oh this is a great
content this is funny they probably love
this but after a while it just starts
getting all this yeah and you can then
you it's limiting what area you can't go
anywhere and it restricts the type of
content you can do too cuz no everywhere
you go it's just gonna be getting cool
the police called over and over and over
again and I mean like I mean it's like
quality of life is goes down just
because you want to have an eye relation
we actually just live your daily life
you know you can do dumb things and have
fun and whatnot but I mean I stopped
doing that so I've been staying inside
the house doing my content I mean I'm
limiting myself I'm buying the bullet on
taking the deficit of the viewers I
could be getting but at least I actually
thought the channel left I'm not banned
yeah
it amazed me and healthier as roommates
you live with him like he's on his last
band like we making sure that he doesn't
get hurt
yeah you were the guy that had to like
right in because you have roommates that
stream and like twitch was telling you
that you couldn't even be on their
streams or whatever right yeah and I I
didn't I wrote that without really
thinking I was at Buffalo Wild Wings
just born and I was like oh this is so
lame because I'm Alfie and they always
stream and I you know we always overlap
or like I'll be in the house to get a
cup of water without but if I'm being
like very honest and I don't want to say
too much to [ __ ] myself over but because
some news articles came out because of
that I feel like twitch decided that
it'd be best just allow me to go on to
their streams because I live just walk
by not not be a part of it upper bike oh
yeah which is how it should be the other
way is really [ __ ] stupid even like
like you can't ever show up like it's
just really dumb but like making you the
center part of the stream obviously if
your band probably shouldn't happen man
right I mean I'm happy they were leaning
on that because I made the whole month
go by a lot easier cuz I can actually
live in my house yeah me and they did
say like okay just don't walk by too
many times and like act like you're
trying to be part of console which made
me be more paranormal camp 1 by 3 times
oh sorry I walked by I can't go get
water or does that mean I'm being
content or know what to do anymore yeah
they knew it the whole knows which like
[ __ ] Gestapo is like really worrying
you know like most people even consider
me to be like a hardcore sjw which I
guess compared to a lot of gamer bros I
am
but even I am like constantly [ __ ]
scared that's something I like just now
actually item when I do a lot of my
political debates in the past I've been
seriously accused of being a Jew like
people seriously make this accusation at
me and like people started seriously I
have a Jewish friend that I visited
Florida sometimes and he got me like a
Jewish welcome pack and I've got like a
shirt that says to primacy and then like
a little Jew hat with like the things on
the side and I just put it on and I
don't even think about it now I'm like
scared like oh [ __ ] wait can I get
[ __ ] banned for this like I don't
even know only [ __ ] yeah I feel like
there's a very big gray area yeah we
should just don't know what you can do
it and the best thing to do is just
avoid all of it yeah I mean me
personally I'm trying to be as limited
to my content for two months just
because if I get past the two-month
threshold in my anytime I do get a bit
I'll go back down to seven days rather
yeah you're not enough like insta ban
territory insta permit
territory that I mean theoretically it's
making me be more creative instead of
grabbing low-hanging fruit for easy
content it makes me have to think and be
more creative and actually think of
content that's not you know either to
enabling or just downright stupid like I
actually have to think now before I go
live sure because usually I would just
do things off the women obviously it's
easy to do content that's readily
available but also it's just gonna give
you bad produ hat though yeah you know
what I do how it looks like it's the one
with the black hair that hangs down the
side I don't the [ __ ] it's called no I
just put it on and I have a Jew premise
t-shirt I just put it on so it was funny
cuz I just talked to a guy that was
literally talking about how she was
control the world huh but ya know I just
like everything I say no I'm just like
really worried like because I play it
cuz I technically I'm a gamer I play
games so I'm like I don't know sometimes
about himself somebody a certain way I
did you ever hear that I got like a
so okay so it just first some background
I guess so I originally message I shot
you a response on a reddit comment
because sometimes get linked to Kotaku
threads and I saw that you said that you
felt like I intentionally misrepresent
the Hispanic immigration thing and I was
curious why you think that so here we
are well in part just because I think
that and maybe I'm wrong but I think any
whether you've seen some research that
contradicts some of the things that you
seem to say about the immigration but I
mean regardless of whether or not you
were intentionally being misleading or
not obviously I disagree with your take
on it oh well because I was kind of a
center point of your comment because you
were making a comment about people that
I wanted D platformed and one of those
were people that were grossly negligent
or intentionally dishonest and you said
that you felt like I was intentionally
dishonest in the arguments I was making
so I was curious if you had a reason why
you thought that or if you were just
spouting Randall for instance I think
that you I'm sure you've been to the
website the alternative hypothesis a
fair number of times yeah and know that
on that website or maybe you don't know
this but I assume you would know anyway
that on that website for instance
there's an analysis that breaks down the
fiscal impact of different ethnic groups
of the United States
okay what about it Jose I'm sorry what
yeah what about it that it shows the
disbanding have a fairly strong negative
impact fiscally on the United States and
then in spite of this they you say
things like that Hispanics do not have a
negative fiscal impact do you understand
the difference between a fiscal impact
and an economic impact uh yeah where a
physical impact would be referring I
suppose specifically to the net effect
of government spending whereas an
economic impact would account for sort
of everything that takes place in the
economy sure so my specific statements
in the past have been pretty rigorously
consistent here where I've said that
immigration either has a slightly
negative or a net wash impact on fiscal
budgets and an overall positive impact
on the economy I don't think I've ever
said that immigrants have a positive
impact fiscally on the country I don't
know if anybody has ever stated that in
turn I get most of this immigration in
mission from Boras and he seems to think
that it's about a wash or maybe slightly
negative but nobody's ever said the
economic impact is negative not too
concerned about only looking at a fiscal
impact of something that's a whole other
different thing well I think that
without the Egan I mean talking about
the economic impact being positive or
negative is perhaps limited in its
informativeness in that not all sort of
economic activities good cat the
estimates that you derive from Boris's
work in terms of the addition to income
the natives would have as a result of
hispanic immigrants
that's far lesser than the amount of
then the net negative fiscal impact of
hispanic immigrants right so that if
they add the people's average income by
$100 on average they consume on net more
than $100 of government services then it
would seem i'm technically true but in
connotation misleading they call that a
positive economic impact I'm not
familiar
ii-i've never heard the idea that every
dollar earned by a Hispanic in the
United States is spent by government
I've never been made aware of that
impact before and it sounds to me like
no that's not what I'm saying it's it's
just that right sister they consume a
certain number of government services
and then they also pay our number of
taxes and so thereby we have a net level
of government consumption we if
consumption my heart attacks so I'm
gonna be mad money yeah I understand do
you have like an actual breakdown of
this data or is this just conjecture
from you
I know the debate has been rolling down
like that before so you have data that
shows that a fiscal impact is
overwhelmingly affecting the economy
such that the economic gains are offset
by that fiscal impact I would very much
like to see a source on that if you have
that and not just a null hypothesis
article like something that economists
see all time because I've never in my
life seen this before and I've got like
50 different like studies that all point
to positive impacts economically from it
from immigration that seems to be like
the economic consensus like it's not
even like a debated topic okay so
there's a little tricky to do just
because we like to push to talk things a
little shaky to move around yeah no
problem
you can shoot it seemed like a discord
DM or something but sure a little bit
like so there's a formula there's an
analysis by the Heritage Foundation
called I can link it to you but yeah the
fiscal cost of unlawful immigrants name
is deed to the US taxpayer okay and then
even when looking at lawful immigrants
right it finds that the fiscal deficit
per household four thousand three
hundred and forty four dollars okay
that's is only fiscally we're talking
about economic impact as well right but
if you turn to war houses the data where
he is a calculation of the amount of
economic activity added to the economy
by Hispanics by immigrants Hispanic
immigrants if you look at that and you
subtract from that the amount of that
that is just the consumption of goods
directly by Hispanics so you look at the
amount that they add to native income
and you divide it by the number of
natives so the number you get there is
significantly less than four thousand
dollars isn't the amount income a by
Hispanic immigration is much lesser than
is the debt caused by Hispanic
immigrants yes I'm not even sure if
these two numbers are directly
comparable do you have like an economist
that breaks down and makes this argument
that the fiscal drain of immigration is
greater than the economic benefit
you mentioned the Heritage study but
that's only talking about fiscal impacts
which I probably wouldn't disagree with
but it's not what we're here for
yes like I said the I mean the
calculation of their effect on the
income you're taking is you're taking
like the fiscal impact which is
calculated some way and then you're
trying to do some an additive
subtractive thing I'm not sure if these
two numbers can even be directly
compared so I'm wondering if you an
actual economy Peterson videos nobody's
breakdowns before rather than just like
these are two numbers I took and I'm
just gonna subtract one from the other
and then make my claim these are really
complicated in economic transactions off
the top of my head I'm not sure if an
economist has made this specific
comparison okay but it seems strange to
me that every economist that I've come
across seems to say that immigration is
like a massive boon to the economy but
somehow you figured out these two
numbers don't add up I guess unless
you're doing like PhD work in this area
so it seems I mean The Economist's are
technically right right because the way
economists look at economic activity is
by measuring grace
I'm a basically spending measures right
GDP this sort of thing so that like
welfare spending is counted as in this
sense a positive economic activity
because it's spending that's part of GDP
so the economists like the view on this
is definitely correct using that notion
called positive and it's positive the
sense of like a positive number right
it's a positive in the sense of a good
thing and it can be good or bad
depending on what it's being spent on
but I mean there are so we would make
two things I guess I'm making a
comparison here which I can't cite any
one of the PhD doing but I mean do you
do at least see how intuitively maybe -
like us a lot of foolish lay people or
something it would make sense though to
say that if and I'm looking at now that
if the like Boerhaave numbers suggest
that immigrants add per person dollars
of income a year but immigrant
households on average are consuming on
net four thousand dollars of government
services per year even though all that
it's counted is positive in terms of how
economists account for economic activity
we normally think about what's good and
bad for the economy that on net that's
going to be bad
at least for NATO's yes so I
acknowledged the first thing you said
that I'm a lay person that's why I would
never take two numbers from two top two
totally unrelated analyses and go look
this one's bigger than this one
therefore here is a massive conclusion
that has far-reaching implications
across the entire economy yeah I would
never make that assessment I wouldn't
trust myself to do it
firstly I'm not even sure if welfare
spending is taken into account when they
look at economic impact by immigrants
and then I'm also not sure like how like
if exactly your numbers are taking into
it like this is something I would need
to see done like born out like an actual
comparative study where I know that
people are controlling for all the facts
and figures and there isn't like any
weird [ __ ] going on like I wouldn't just
take like well here's one study that
says that immigrants contribute this
much and then here's another one and if
I divide this by all the number of
households and then do the adding and
subtracting I can see that there's a
negative number like it doesn't sound
like a good analysis to me I mean since
you can even break it down by by
households again with the Bourassa
numbers that immigrants add to like the
native households 2171 dollars per year
but those same households have to pay in
taxes over four thousand dollars in year
in the long run because obviously we can
put in debt temporarily but in the long
run have to pay four thousand dollars I
don't see why that would be a
particularly I guess suspect comparison
to make I mean yeah if you don't there's
nothing I can do to convince you
otherwise
economics is insanely [ __ ]
complicated and economic transactions
like immigration and impact on wages and
labor and usage of fiscal benefits from
the state but like all of this stuff is
really really really complicated so if I
tell you that you can't take two numbers
from two totally different studies and
then just compare them and go look
here's my massive far-reaching
conclusion if you don't see why that
might be like a really naive way to
compare data I I mean I think it's a
good reason for us to like think about
it it has been thought about yes but
like this is the thing like you're
trying to present me this data like hey
by the way as a layperson I discovered
these two numbers that you can subtract
from one another and no economist
whatsoever has ever thought about this
in the history of all of comparing
whether or not between me not being able
name an economist off the top of my head
that made the specific comparison and
like the positive state but no economist
has ever done that right like I've no I
that's those are two very different
thanks I mean like we I mean we can hit
up like the I mean I don't want to use
my own research because it might be
biased but like we can go to the
economics I've rated on red and we can
look at the side I'm sure they've got a
ton of [ __ ] about like immigration and
impact in the economy and I'm I mean we
I'm willing to bet that everything they
say there is positive unless you think
that's like a left-leaning subreddit or
something this is just something I'm not
familiar with before and I've done like
a decent amount of reading so when I do
like a decent amount of research and all
the economic consensus seems to hone in
on like one certain thing and then you
come and you tell me well look I've got
two totally unrelated studies and I
think if I do a little bit of you know
alchemy I can show you that this is
actually bad and all those economists
who have dedicated their lives to doing
this research is wrong like I I'm not
gonna believe you there I'm not saying
that the research is wrong well you're
saying something like well what they
don't actually from an accounting
standpoint it's a positive impact okay
but I don't even know if GDP because GDP
counts as a transport payment I don't
know if that's considered in like the
net impact of immigration to the economy
like what you're saying it just seems
like you're it's it's like when people
talk about like complex tax like what
about this one thing like maybe the
economists didn't realize that all the
benefit is actually just from welfare
like that sounds like something like a
grade school student would propose like
the teacher would be like what are some
possible issues with our data and then
like a kid we're well what if all the
GDP generated was just from welfare and
the teacher go oh well that's good
however researchers aren't totally
[ __ ] stupid so they would obviously
account for something it's like that
would be my guess I could be wrong but
the fact that you have nothing to give
me but conjecture doesn't help your case
do you think that's a fair argument the
immigrants from the economists
perspective I guess I don't even see why
they this is the sort of thing they
really normal at least would account for
because economists normally aren't
interested in the net benefit in this
connotative sense the economics is
primarily looking at things through an
accounting sort of lens okay I'm not
saying that the economist dumb right
it's we politically think about sort of
positive economic activity is distinct
from positive economic activity in an
accounting
which is normally how economists are
looking at this okay I feel like
economist what account for this this
seems like a massive thing so I just
because I'm not I have never heard the
second before so I'm just like reading
an investor PD article investigating
usually has pretty good information if
you think this is wrong feel free to
shoot me something differently
so I'm reading this and it says transfer
payments for the purposes of calculating
GDP government spending does not include
transfer payments the reallocation of
money from one party to another which
includes Social Security Medicare
unemployment insurance welfare programs
and subsidies because these are not
payments for goods and services they do
not represent a form a finding of final
demand or GDP that covers some
government services right but obviously
not all government services so what are
these massive government services that
are being lumped in with GDP that aren't
included in transfer payments so I think
that would all I Felicita the listing if
I think those were all basically means
tested sort of benefits one of the
biggest ones right is just school use of
infrastructure that sort of thing okay
schools are paid for with real estate
taxes I don't understand what the
comparison being drawn this here or do
you think there's a lot of like homeless
immigrants that go to school or really
then we can go to school and then taxes
paid for that so that's part of their
consumption of government services right
well I guess but I mean they have to pay
for those taxes now the I mean the
immigrants I'm not sure you mean like
immigrants have to pay for all of the
immigrant accounting of the consumption
of schooling well where do taxes for
schools come from from the people that
pay taxes oh well do you know which ones
which like the specific people no okay
so generally school taxes are calculated
by real estate tax this is why if you go
to wealthy neighborhoods and you go to
the schools around the wealthy
neighborhoods their schools are really
nice if you go to shitty neighborhoods
well immigrants because it was just
immigrants that were famous well you're
making it you're making it sound like
immigrants are going to all these
schools that are being paid for by other
people but if you're renting property or
real estate in some area you're paying
taxes that go to the school
I don't see how that counts as a
negative consumption of some public good
that they're not paying for it well you
have to come it doesn't neccessarily
right you have to compare the cost of
the schooling to the actual amount of
taxes paid by the individuals okay I
just don't understand how that comes out
to be negative like you live in a
district you pay taxes in that district
and then it goes to the school if you
live in a shitty district you probably
of a shitty school it's not like
Hispanic immigrants are going to like
these super wealthy like Harvard ask
high schools or something I mean well
that's I mean that's somewhat of a
separate issue but the like the spending
differences by ethnicity are pretty
small in terms of the okay but like
ethnicities are going to be segregated
into like for instance like you can't
just compare what do white people pay
for public school versus Hispanics pay
for public schools because white people
go to better public schools than
Hispanic people go through and those
public school spend more money than
Hispanic public schools that's what I'm
saying so you can't just compare it like
that
like for instance Hispanics might pay 50
percent of what white people pay in
taxes to schools but they might consume
50 percent less services because their
schools don't spend as much money I mean
there two things so one I don't think
it's true there's much of a difference
in terms of the spending on white and
Hispanic and black schools and that sort
of thing that's a great that's because
you I mean we can look that up right now
if you want so you're telling me that if
I go to any City and I go to a poor
neighborhood versus a rich neighborhood
you think that the budgets of these two
schools are going to be similar I'm
saying that if you look at the total
spending on the education of Hispanics
blacks and whites you segregate it out
categorization scheme and there's not
much of a difference deep well I'm sorry
to do this to you or enrich people while
those like that categorization scheme is
correlated of socioeconomic status those
are two separate questions okay so I'm
not trying to call you out and I'm
looking for this right now do you have
like a source I'm like oh the total
spending by spending on education by
race that like a thing that is
documented yes I can yes it is I just
make it up and this is actually this is
actually just this is not even be
interpreting yeah I mean like you can
tell me that I can a DM I'm just I'm
curious uh yeah one second that might
take me a minute to find but I can
definitely send it
yeah this fan so like if somebody's
shooting me like a dot e d RW w te d gov
link so this is government data if you
believe in the deep state I don't maybe
you don't believe in this so this is
apparently 40% of high schools don't
offer physics 25 percent don't offer
chemistry more than half of all high
schools with large numbers of
african-americans or Latinos don't offer
you hate the troops why dying for you
isn't enough for you I'm just kidding
mom I don't really hate the troops oh
this is gonna be at the new the new
weekly stream segment it's talking to my
mom on skype I don't really hate the
troops I'm being sarcastic because every
time somebody brings up a good point you
guys always say why do you guys hate the
troops like when people kneel during do
you think that people that kneel during
the national anthem hate the troops I
think people who kneel for the against
the national anthem hate and disrespect
our country including the troops that
die for it so you're not allowed to ever
protest the flag why do we even have a
first test but there's a difference
between protests and spitting and
somebody who's doing something for you
okay how are you supposed to protest in
the United States so that somebody's
feelings don't get hurt can you tell me
like an accepted way of doing it I know
I just want to know I'm curious I'm just
curious
I want to know what the way is well it
seems like every single time black
people figure out a new way to protest
they're not allowed to do it you know I
wouldn't know how useful suppose I want
to know how you're supposed to play ball
I want to know how you're supposed to
protest in the United States can you
tell me so what are the signs to let us
say if the sign said like if the signs
have anything bad about the flag on it
that counts as hating the troops or I
just want to know what an acceptable cuz
kneeling during the national anthem
doesn't seem like that big of a deal of
course it doesn't to you well it doesn't
because I'm American and I love our
first time at I wrote the [ __ ] crazy
country you came why did you join the
airforce if you don't even know what you
know because you don't like something
something's not right go fix it why
wouldn't you go why not go to like why
not go why not go to Cuba or go back to
whatever the Cuban place because you
want to make it so that if anybody
protests the flag they're disrespecting
the military
that's some crazy totalitarian shape no
you can't it's like so what it's are
they just supposed to like get on
Twitter and say I am NOT happy with
America right now
why and what should be done instead of
just people who were saying why and what
should be done people were saying people
just a confrontation and guess what they
got one
yeah they got they got body cameras on
police officers they got a national
dialogue on the way that cops trade
black people we're talking about it now
aren't we how is it disgusting you don't
get wait so you don't deserve you don't
deserve what you have in the United
States because you protest who you know
that you swear an oath to the
Constitution under the president right
you do and all the airforce stuff a
pretty big part of the Constitution is
being able to protest your country and
even your military if you want to you
know so you're not allowed to print
that's what you're saying basically is
that like you can't protest because
you're not fixing something a plague
word game you're the one that says you
hate the military if you protest the
flag it's just a flag they do try to fix
it one of the ways that you fix things
is to protest things publicly you start
a national dialogue when blacks got shot
before without being allowed to protest
at what point in human history do we
need to go back to in the United States
when we were more civilized was it when
we lynched black people for speaking out
against the whiteness that's not that
far in the past mom you were a kid you
weren't like a teenager during the civil
rights era how far back in the okay so
what point in in the United States
history do we need to go back to okay
you know that like a larger number of
people are insured under the Affordable
Care Act and they're gonna lose their
health insurance and a lot of them are
gonna be totally [ __ ] in life
and I still good calls for Obamacare but
nobody calls you for Obamacare that's
not even how it works you have TRICARE
you have military hellbitch you're like
you're evil like what you're saying
right now is Liddy you are you're
uninformed and you're using your
horrible [ __ ] views on nobody [ __ ]
calls you for Obamacare oh [ __ ] this is
insanity hold on I'm gonna I'm gonna ask
you a question this is this is a really
this is a really mean question okay but
can you tell me what do you think what
do you think Obamacare is what do you
think Obamacare even is well no we did
it because the Republicans were too
inept to actually pass another
healthcare program they just defunded it
there we didn't leave the ACA the
Republicans defunded it because your
party is too [ __ ] stupid to put
together another plan to replace it so
let's get that firstly the Republicans
had no plan you had eight years to come
up with a replacement if they didn't do
it they didn't do it so you have nobody
to blame the Republicans have nobody to
blame yourself okay now I want to know I
want you to tell me because I want I
want you to tell me because you hate it
okay I want you to tell me cuz you hate
it so much
what is the Affordable Care Act do you
know anything about it at all so there
are people that's that's strange because
under the ACA you get a huge subsidy if
you can't afford the insurance if you
it's even higher than the doctor no they
can't they'd have to file bankruptcy
white where do you get this yes you do
why do you think that over half of all
bankruptcies in United States were filed
because of medical
issues do you think all those people
were just dumb when you want to fix
something you approach it in a civilized
manner with solutions whereas the
Republicans replacement plan then
subject stop changing the subject where
is the Republican replacement for our
health care is now Republican replace
okay so we've established shootings one
there is no Republican place proposed
around here and two you don't even know
what the ACA is and you hate it so much
you hate it so much and you don't even
know what it is if I you hate yes Obama
care who is them that are Jewish
overlords who which one who which who is
the worthless pieces of trash but not
people like not people like Flynn or not
the none of those geysers or Cohen or
the military you did security clearances
I know I know I know Mom
you flew on the looking glass I know for
a fact that you guys had security
clearances probably the TSS sea-ice [ __ ]
I know that you filled out do you guys
do sf-86 is for militaries not only for
contractors I know that you had a
security clearance why are you sitting
here why are you lying to me why are you
lying to me and telling me they oh he
just said of life we're talking about
Flynn right now if you were to lie if
you would take attentionally if you
would intentionally lie okay
it it's just it makes me sad that you
have a strong opinion of something that
has a very real impact on people's lives
and you don't even know anything about
it that makes me really upset I'm not
tearing everything down mom the
Republicans mom the Republicans the
Republicans mom they're Republicans
literally defunded the ACA with no
replacement that is the definition of
tearing everything down I don't know how
you could say then why are more people
insured today than what were before the
ACA mom but that's what the Republicans
did that's what we did though
that's what the Republicans did though
what do you mean no the Republicans
voted to defund the ACA by getting rid
of the individual mandate that is the
death what do you mean who are all of
these people getting uninsured these
people don't exist
which that why some people lost their
doctors that was a bad mistake by Obama
should have said that but that doesn't
mean that everybody lost their insurance
I'm not taking everybody's insurance
without having a way to replace it
that's strange because that's what the
Republicans did but I am sure what is
the solution that the Republicans
proposed to the ACA Wolin without
dancing to another question or bringing
up Obama what solution do the
Republicans have for health care now
that they've defunded the ACA can you
answer that question without talking
about Obama that doesn't bother you
okay now imagine for one second try to
have some empathy for somebody else okay
this should be easy for you because you
thought you were Catholic I don't know
if you're actually Christian
I can't tell okay okay okay okay well I
don't I don't okay so as a as a
Christian okay try let's try to have
some empathy okay okay sure a human
being okay you're Republicans aren't
good on that human being stuff so I'm
gonna try to get that go the religion
angle okay so as a human being there are
people right now in the United States of
America that are going to lose their
health insurance because the Republicans
have defunded the ACA what do you tell
those people when no solution has been
provided okay how many people got
insurance under ACA let's look up the
numbers an average of eleven point four
people eleven point four million people
are expected to be enrolled in Obamacare
policies during 2017 so what do you tell
these people know that are going to lose
their policy that the Republicans voted
to get rid of without any replacement
anybody is able to use it if you have it
that was part of if you can't afford if
you can't afford the copay as somebody
that actually does their own taxes okay
and as somebody that's actually read the
ACA [ __ ] requirements okay if you're
not able to make any of those co-pays or
those payments you get massive credits
to your taxes so that the ACA shoe it is
that simple we can look it up right now
it's on the federal government website
that Trump still controls you can if you
if you can't afford it you get massive
credits for it so that it's cheaper for
you what I'm literally just quoting you
what it is because the facts are like
not the thing we want to debate whining
I'm not gonna lose my [ __ ] I'm [ __ ]
fine my husband's not dying a [ __ ]
prostate cancer I'm doing okay I'm
healthy I make [ __ ] toe Turk a year
I'm not the one that's gonna get [ __ ]
when all this [ __ ] goes south it's the
other people this is why it's called
having empathy for people okay
like for the people that are literally
going to lose their health insurance
that have no coverage okay what do you
tell those people who the Republicans
have provided absolutely no solution for
no they don't qualify for Medicare
that's the problem is that the cutoff
wasn't big enough for these people these
are where the 11 million people that got
insurance come from like what you're
talking right now is literal evil like
you have no concern whatsoever for these
people going from health care to
Medicaid no they don't qualify for
Medicaid people like no because Medicaid
coverage hasn't been expanded to cover
these people they didn't qualify for it
before this is the definition of the
working poor will you make enough money
so they don't qualify for the best
government programs but you still don't
have enough money to actually survive
these are all of the people
when you destroyed our health and
because our health insurance was already
destroyed you just don't know because
you had TRICARE your whole [ __ ] life
because you were babysat by the Air
Force you have no idea what it's like to
get insurance as a normal human being no
you can't mom I will give you five I'll
pay for a new roof on your house if you
can find me the numbers that show me
that more people lost their insurance
under the ACA mom mom what you're
talking about is fantasy that you can't
substantiate with any number you're
making [ __ ] up you're literally telling
me a [ __ ] fairy story this is not
true maybe a couple people lost their
health insurance but these are anomalies
these are way outside the norm I said
why do we wear the numbers that agree
with you which ones the ones where
people were screaming at where
Republicans got scared and stopped
showing up because their constituents
were so mad they're just an all-right
terror attack like yesterday what do you
mean okay I need to focus on my video
games okay maybe but that's because
you're in an extremely lucky position
mom when Jesus went around and he was
helping all the sick people he didn't go
to the [ __ ] middle income people he
went to the poorest of the poor to help
them because they're the ones that need
to help the most they don't know that's
the problem in America is a lot of you
Republicans have a I got mine [ __ ] you
you go get yours somewhere else
it isn't baloney no that's why
Republicans never want to do anything
your taxes it's no we don't need [ __ ]
volunteers House what for me
I don't understand how like everything
that I learned like growing up about
like all the Christian [ __ ] is like
fanfiction to you like you don't care
about it at all I'm not hallucinating
like if you go through and you read
because they don't they're dying who's
helping the homeless people in the
United States who are overrepresented
when it comes to mental illness right
all the literal [ __ ] people that are
[ __ ] homeless on the street who's
helping these people right in the last
eight years Obama doesn't go out on the
streets and help homeless people what do
you mean first of all first of all first
of all you don't need an address in the
United States to vote first
this is reality
okay that's reality
I would love to see some of these
Republicans that were put in jail for
feeding people out of trucks
I would I would love to see it but don't
start with Breitbart calm or Daily
Caller
or the conservative Tribune or whatever
other crazy [ __ ] okay
okay I got to focus on my game okay okay
I love you I love you too are you coming
over some time to hang out yes okay let
me know I gotta run for you okay buddy
goodbye goodnight [ __ ] me start sourcing
claims to your mom know these
Republicans like don't believe in
sources it's impossible did you mom ever
spank you destiny because she [ __ ]
beat your ass down and destroyed in that
debate call child abuse also gachigasm
did your mom really think that homeless
people shouldn't vote well she probably
thinks the Democrats gave a bunch of
illegal homeless people a legal citizen
homeless people the right to vote is
probably what she was getting at can you
tell me why you seem to care a little
for relations what you saw good Russia
hurts
um I don't know divas are your parents
right they invested a lot of time and
money and [ __ ] into making sure you'd
survive your childhood and everything
[Music]
oh boy oh boy
what's up dude ah nothing much I'm here
for this at-will state debate wow did
you change your name to vegan destinated
to Isaac do it I think I don't think I
can change my name that is eternally
chewing tobacco
alright gentlemen we're just customers
today huh
yeah I guess so sure what is what is uh
what's your idea like what's your I
guess like how do you envision an ethnos
state and like talk to me about what
your idea is so I don't know so we can't
have an in the in the case of America
this is it for Europe in case of America
we can't have an ethnic state we have to
have a race state so and that will just
be like like a percentage of whiteness I
did the the percentage is really unknown
at the moment like it'll be something
they'll be discussed
whenever some like me until gets going
probably somewhere around like 25 33
percent but that's for the case of
America of course it's we're so like
were they marry much for a reason you
know and yeah that's pretty much it
it doesn't have to be a hundred percent
white either we get it I just would like
upwards like 93 percent but I thought
you just of 25 to 35 percent no no
that's like the how white or non-white
you can have before you're unqualified
when I - I mean 93 percent population
I want 93 percent of the country to be
white oh I understand okay alright cuz
not even Japan's like 100 percent there
so like 97 so you want 93 percent of the
country - no no I'm not the whole point
of me saying that was just to say like
there's like there could be exceptions
sure well yeah I'm just tryna stem so
you say you're saying you want 93
percent of the country to be 25 to 35
percent white is that it no no they can
only be 25 percent non-white
okay sis 25 and 35% way yeah some around
there okay I'm just making sure I
understand so we have an ethnos state
country 93% of the country needs to be
at least 75% white in order to make room
for exceptions right yeah exception yeah
sure extraordinary exceptions okay
and then just to flesh out your position
more well ask the how first so how do
you envision making this happen well see
that's the hard part so I had but
hypothetically I don't know it's just
spreading the word at this point that's
some big league stuff right there of
actually putting it in the action okay
so say you spread the word to everybody
how does that get you to 93% of the
qawalli so just getting of like
represented in there like the media or
not not the media since that probably
never happened but just like getting our
what we believe our belief spread around
I think a lot of people would like agree
with us in that and I think that would
be yeah I guess I'm asking for like the
mechanism by which you increase the
overall whiteness of the country or
you're gonna make people leave or how
are you gonna kill oh yeah definitely
yeah mass deportation I'm not like
people will frame it I like really
genocide and whatnot but that's not the
case at all mass deportations let's say
they don't want to be deported what's
your next step well if they don't want
to be deported and they meet us with
violence we'll meet them with equal
violence okay so yes to genocide then I
don't know why you said no to that so no
jenis huh well so we have Leon yeah so
we have mass deportation right what I
mean look up something Oh make sure I'm
working with the right definitions okay
well we don't have to call it genocide
we can call it the mass killing of a
bunch of people of a certain race I
guess it's only mass killing if they
resist which they only die if they
resist okay
but let's assume for a minute okay so I
don't know how many real-life people you
know but let's assume for a minute that
somebody that is been in this country
for possibly generations doesn't want to
just leave and go to some
strange place they're probably going to
resist right along with the healthy
number of white people as well so Jen
are like I don't want to say genocide I
go since that's like a trigger word for
you but like killing all of these people
is something that has to be on the table
for you right state enforced violence
yeah yeah yeah okay
[Music]
okay so there's that part why do you
want to do an ethnos State that's the
next I need to hear this so I I've come
to notice that we're very much different
like race kind of dictates like our
actions in a way and then our culture I
believe our culture derives from our
race and just like how we revolutionized
whatnot and yep evolutionized evolution
whatever the word is okay okay do you
have any other thoughts you want to get
out before we start walking - oh I don't
I just believe we're different I think
that's all that I need to really need to
advocate separate segregation I mean we
all engage in self segregation to some
extent or another that's a false
comparison so self segregation is
different than state enforced by acts of
violence segregation these are two
totally different no I'm not using it to
justify I'm just explaining it well okay
but when you say yeah sure when I ask a
question you go well we do this anyway
that it kind of sounds like you're
providing that as a justification I take
it back
okay yeah all right and it's fine I'm
not trying to make you say anything you
don't want to say so if you feel like
I'm unfairly restating your opinion feel
free to tell me okay I don't want to
treat everybody so so I mean like the
first thing where everything kind of
falls apart but we don't have to go too
hard on this is it sounds like you have
no real way to measure whiteness I don't
know what you mean by 75% white what is
that well just white European okay but
like what let's say that um Do You Know
Who I am
or I guess I'm asking like do you know
what I look like destiny yeah yeah okay
do I do I get to be in the white ethno
state or no I don't know it like I'd say
well I don't know this is really
semantics something I'm not qualified to
talk about well this isn't semantics
this is essential to your point me I
would probably just do the base off
looks and if there's like a questionable
line there then we'd probably do some
genetic testing okay cool so I posted my
picture in chat do I look white enough
for the ethnos state yeah okay
so I'm 50% Cuban so does that mean that
like any 50% Hispanic person I don't
even know if Cubans consider but like I
wouldn't consider myself an extremely
telling colors apart from the non
colored okay so who is that expat how
can you not know I guess like the thing
is that like you feel strong enough
about separating people into these two
groups white and non-white that you're
willing to sanction state violence to do
it but you don't know how you would
separate these people into could you say
we could do genetic testing on everyone
if that would make you happy I don't
think that genetic testing is going to
turn up the answer that you want though
what answer would it turn up I mean
genetic tests don't come back saying
white ordinary tor colored it's not how
genetic testing works I mean when I
refer to like what I'm thinking of when
I think I think like 23andme and how it
shows you like what person is European
you are and what percentage like
whatever you are sure so you want to do
I want to do ancestry then yes yes is
that what it goes by well that's that's
what genetic testing tells you it can
approximate like your ancestry based on
genetic clusters that existed yeah okay
so whatever 23andme does that's probably
a little good boy okay are you
comfortable with the fact that a lot of
people that are very white probably
won't qualify due to that testing and
that you're gonna have minorities that
will qualify like people that are
clearly colored will probably qualify
due to that type of genetic testing that
seems like it's not going
get you to the place where you want to
get it too I don't know what do you
think's a better alternative well I'm
not in favor of ethnos States I think
that grouping people based on the way
they look is a bad way to group people
so I I don't I don't really know I mean
I would suggest if you want to make this
argument I feel like you need a much
stronger way to divide people into white
and non-white but the problem is
historically the category of white has
always been arbitrary so it's so I don't
know how you would go about doing these
what do you mean by its arbitrary like
you're saying you can't identify it well
what I'm saying is that the concept of
white is in a lot of ways socially
constructive that groups that previously
weren't considered white have now become
considered white so that's it's like a
hard category there's not like a rigid
scientific definition for whiteness
everything kind of becomes relativistic
or arbitrary I guess like if you read
words by our founding fathers for
instance I think they only considered
British people [ __ ] it was like British
people in one other group of people
white but like Spaniards and Germans and
other types of people were considered
not of pure whiteness which are people
that you would very clearly consider
white today so yeah so I'm not sure how
you would define well I would definitely
consider the Irish the British the
Germans all them away I think I think we
know what white is it's just like when I
say white European I think we know what
I'm talking about I'd know what I'm
talking about you know what a circular
argument is nope so it's kind of like
let's say I think I say that action X is
disgusting and somebody says why is it
disgusting I don't think it's disgusting
and you go well it is because it is it's
common sense well that doesn't really
help the other person so let's say that
I disagree with you on what your notion
of white is let's say I say africans are
white like people come in not like white
South Africans but like people from like
Kenya and [ __ ] like very black but
what's it that I say they're white and
then you say no well now I have to ask
you okay well what is your definition of
whiteness you can't just say well we
know because it is you have to
to quantify that somehow if it's like I
said why you're being I guess you know
so you just want to say like white
European people what about white people
from like South Africa and stuff I mean
they there aren't south and majority
South Africans like Dutch probably at
something from some colonial to [ __ ] or
whatever or I guess you say you want to
do like the ancestry thing so you would
go back via ancestry but then we run
into the thing before we're like I don't
know I'm pretty sure you could get
people that look not necessarily white
but can be traced back to European
ancestry because of their families that
their generational history and all that
[ __ ] like we don't have I mean this is a
really hard part for you so we don't
have to go on too much into this but it
seems like having like a really rigid
way this is a problem that I noticed
with a lot of ethno State people is
they're willing to make exceptions for
whatever includes them for instance like
that are you familiar with James Allsop
and Nick Fuentes yeah sure I think both
of them are about white nationalists
they don't like hide it or whatever like
Fuentes is Hispanic origin like is this
somebody that gets to be in the ethnos
state I he had he does like soul math in
order to calculate his percentage
whiteness and he says that his
percentage is high enough but like
here's a here's an ethics problem for
you let's say that you get your white
ethno state made okay let's say that
somehow we determined 75% whiteness and
everybody let's say that at that point
somebody starts some movement in their
countries like okay well we want 90%
whiteness now and we want to get rid of
all the people that are less than 90%
white like what if you fell under that
category what argument would you use to
protect yourself from being cast out
well I mean would it be really be that
far of a stretch just like me saying I
want to kick out somebody that's like
50% one non-white versus me saying
someone it's like 90 it's not there's
not that much difference if it's like if
we knew or they whoever's doing it they
knew like it would obviously make the
country a lot better than what it is
then well we have an assembly they have
the force to back it up Who am I like I
can't really do anything well I don't
think we have a way in regards to that
part yet we can come back to that but
let's say somebody claims that they can
make the country a lot better by kicking
out people less than 95 percent Wyatt
see that's why that's why I made my
margins probably like 25 percent
non-white especially Native America but
the problem is I got your mate you're
setting margins you're setting the bar
just low enough that you can pass over
it
but what I'm saying is let's say that
you've now made it because you've
essentially made it permissible to
deport people based on race up to the
point of using state and forced violence
right or state sanctioned violence
well now let's say that a new movement
starts in your ethno state and they want
to get rid of people that aren't of a
certain level of whiteness that you
don't pass under what argument can you
use that works for you that Hispanics
couldn't have used that worked for them
what argument could you possibly go
there there is none area there
absolutely is not it's like I could just
point to like how people with like X I
don't know that's that's a good question
okay
and I just if it's like if we knew it's
like the numbers supported that it would
make the country better then no he's
just like we're in the same places like
the Mexicans were so let's let's focus
on that okay what do you mean when you
say make the country better well okay
all right so start with the blacks in
terms like their crime like you know
they're I'm sure you've heard the 13%
50% of violent crime okay
that's a common one okay all right so
that's where I'll start anyway it's like
over-represented in crime and
over-represented and like taking more in
taxes then they put it well I don't I
guess both of those could be fixed just
by some like tax changes
and watch honor okay so let's start on
the first one why not just deport
criminals then why black people there
are white criminals as well when I just
deport people that commit crime yes the
thing where I disconnected like the
whole civic national saying is just like
I want to help my deep the white people
like I want to help them in dick like
it's probably gonna sound bad from the
outside which may be but I I don't
really care for helping them I just
wanna help my people why are white
people your people
I can understand like your family but
how do you identify with all white
people
I just think otherwise just British
white and so you share a common bond
with them or where you go what do you
live in the u.s. yeah yeah if you do you
mind telling me what state you live in
I know what state you frozen no I'm not
telling you oh no you know okay do you
think that say like a like a white
person that lives in like rural Montana
shares a lot in common
would say a white person that looks like
in the city in New York City do you
think these two people have a ton in
common I feel like you could find
minority people that you have more in
common with than some white people in
certain parts of the United States I'm
guessing you probably buy maybe I could
just take like the whole just like the
bond over race just out of the equation
just put it down to trick you like like
the benefit on society and even then
you're like then some of you might say
like Jews and I agents out like higher
IQ and they put more into the economy
and they take out or not but even then
I'd say like if we look at agents right
now within like Australia anybody that
has like dual citizenship like they're
able to come to our countries when I say
our economy like Australia here up
Canada u.s. all these countries and
they're able to like fight like
financially gain off of us at our
expense and they're able to ship that
money back to their like country of
origin okay so that's not necessarily a
bad thing you know but we're getting
into complicated economic transactions
which I think are a little bit beyond
the scope of this conversation
we're mint ensues and whatnot sending
money back to other countries isn't
necessarily a bad thing
firstly that's not a one-way transaction
if you go and you work in a country
you're providing your resource of labour
to a company to capitalise on to make
money so it's not just your stealing I
think we're both familiar with like how
the real estates like skyrocketed in
places like Australia Canada and places
in Europe and whatnot it's like that's
not really something I'd want for us
Dean are you like a socialist or I could
see the artificial so I'm not kind of
in-between on what I want there okay
yeah I guess I'd have to learn your
economic thing I'm like because I'm big
into capitalism I don't understand how
you would what is your goal to prevent
rising real estate costs and how does
that tie into an ethnos state I mean we
can just look at how like the the
Chinese are buying up all these all the
land the real estate and it's causing
the like if the sky rock and so I say
like well what's stopping wise from
doing the same I guess they can but I
would like I want to do the reason why
places are skyrocketing is because these
are massively in-demand places where
people want to live right the market
sets the price it's not like Chinese
people can arbitrarily raise the price
the price is raised to a level where
people are willing to pay all right this
is like do you think we should just let
anybody like just cuz they want to live
here we should let them in you're not of
that like you don't believe that do you
I believe in fully open borders yeah but
again I make you believe why because I'm
a huge capitalist wait this might be off
topic a little bit what are you like
what do you say about tariffs dude how
do you think it's are horrible
protectionism is horrible economic
theory no memes no HEPA Highness would
support the implementation you competing
with somebody from like like India who
works like 50 cents an hour and a
factory how you compete with that you
just like Lilia ban in the market and
you're like if we were open borders
today in the US or just abandon it you
try to excel at the things that you do
better than other countries it's called
comparative advantage so for instance if
some country excels in manufacturing or
excels and telemarketing centers you let
those countries do that right you export
so if you have a company and that
company deals with multiple levels of
things so for instance let's say that
you have a text now let's say you sell
computers but you also do tech support
right you can
there are parts of you are like a value
anecdote versus data so collecting data
and collecting it well is so [ __ ]
hard to do it is so hard to do holy [ __ ]
when you read a stat the work that goes
into collecting the data to make that
stat meaningful is so [ __ ] hard let
me give you let's do one quick thought
experiment as an example and we can
start to go over the plethora of
difficulties that you face as a
statistics researcher or data researcher
okay try to do this okay let's say that
I want to find out how many people play
video games okay what percentage of the
population plays video games so first we
need to rigorously define what we mean
by playing video games and include that
in the prompt so does that include
playing a mobile game
does that include playing games when you
were a kid what's the time frame how
often do you have to play to be
considered somebody that plays video
games are these things we want to built
into our questionnaire etc etc so the
wording of the question has to be very
specific so that you're capturing the
data that you want to capture right
let's say even that we solve all of that
okay let's say that we solve all of that
stuff so we've got the perfect question
it's gonna gather the perfect data etc
etc okay all of that is perfect right
how do you do this poll where do you do
the poll at okay who do you poll to find
out what what percentage of people play
video games so let's say that we go
let's say that we run this poll by phone
okay now let's say that we want to be
truly random okay so we're going to run
this poll by phone okay so because we
don't want to get we don't want to well
we're not gonna run it in a school
because we know that young people will
answer more than then old people right
then young people are likely to play a
game so we're smart we're not gonna go
to a high school in Poland because we
pull in a high school it's gonna be a
much higher percentage than the overall
population so we're gonna stay where the
high school so let's go to the phone
books right maybe you pull in the phone
books everybody everybody that you you
pick a bunch of random phone numbers and
then you call people to find out you
know what percentage of them play video
games well what if in phone books what
if the only thing listed are home phone
numbers right maybe the people that own
home phone lines are more likely to play
video games than the people that don't
home owned phone lines right so even
something that seems random like a phone
book might [ __ ] you maybe you try to run
the poll
on reddit well if you're renting a
pullin reddit you're already selecting
for a very small percentage of the
population that's computer savvy enough
to go on reddit so now you've got a
problem where you're already over
selecting for tech savvy people so you
can't run the poem on reddit
like what like where do you uh where do
you go to run a poll like this right I
could run it in my chat that's gonna be
dramatically off because obviously
you're watching a video game streamer so
a lot of people are probably gonna be
likely to do it um you know you you
could run it at a um you could do a poll
on Facebook and assuming that Facebook
side targeting or whatever is really
good maybe but again for Facebook you've
already over selected for like a decent
percentage of the population you could
look at consumer data while we're trying
to collect consumer data right this is
like a really simple question all right
I'm just trying to find out right like
how do you figure out like the
percentage of people playing polls right
these are all questions that you have to
ask right now here's the important part
about this question okay the thing is if
you um if you pull people on this okay
if you're doing it wrong you're gonna
get data that's severely [ __ ] in a
certain category and it's gonna lead you
to believe something that's not true
right say that we go to a ninth grade
classroom and we pull people to figure
out what percentage of them play video
games whatever number we get is gonna be
way higher than reality
probably because younger people probably
have a higher tendency to play video
games and older people probably right
there are famous examples of this
[ __ ] up in the past where I think
somebody put like a callin poll or
something at the back of it was either a
magazine or a romance novel where the
question was are you happy with your
marriage and originally the poll was
like dramatically off it was like 90% of
women were dissatisfied with their
marriage but when people dug into the
research more what they found out was
that somebody that was unhappy with our
marriage was much more likely to call in
and report that than somebody that
wasn't unhappy with their marriage so
even sticking something in the back of a
magazine that might seem innocuous like
a decent way to collect data could be
severely off because the people that
choose to respond to your poll are gonna
be motivated to answer based on what the
answer is
there's like a million different things
that can hurt your ability to collect
data when we were listening to the
Sapolsky lectures on biology right they
did that big study that showed that men
were better than women at math because
they tended to do better on tests or
something and it was like a hugely
massively controlled experiment I think
this got published in nature showing
that even at early age
men were more likely to do better than
women but then when they dug into even
that research more what they found out
was we'll hold on if you look at the way
that men and women are treated in
classrooms teachers are more likely to
call on a boy than a girl to answer a
math question even if a boy and a girl
raised their hand so that was even
called into question right all of this
makes collecting data well very [ __ ]
difficult there's a million [ __ ]
questions that you have to constantly
ask to make sure that the data that
you're collecting is a fair
representative sample of data from your
population a good cross-section is very
very hard to do this so I'm interested
to hear your answer on anecdote verse
data I'm a PhD student I've created
datasets that literally consisted of
nothing but anecdotes but I want ever so
great that the flow of anecdote is not
data sampling analysis and framing go a
long way in turning about stories news
reproduce it yeah sure so let's use
malmo as an example okay all right and
I'm gonna make up a lot of [ __ ] okay
let's say that you have a city okay
let's say that we go to this city okay
hey here we are we're visiting this city
okay and let's say that we we go we
spent three days we go to this part of
the city then we go to this part of the
city and then we go to this part of the
city so here is all of the things that
we have to ask let's say that as we go
here in three days let's say that during
these three days we witness two crimes
okay so if we witness two crimes in
three days okay
Oh God two crimes and three days okay
does it like if we extrapolate this out
what is this mean like 200 and 220 1.75
whatever like 221 days of the year
there's gonna be crimes because we
witnessed it well this is only a small
section of the city firstly we're only
looking at a small section of the city
firstly secondly what we're observing is
going to be biased we can only see
things happening on the street thirdly
what if we're here during a time period
when crime is over-represented for
instance if we come during the summer
months is crime historically
over-represented during the summer
months versus the winter months maybe
were in a time period where crime is
higher than normal and we're not taking
that into account
maybe you're there's like there's a
million different confounding variables
here that can influence what maybe you
see crime that isn't reported maybe
somebody's stealing something that's not
reported so what you're actually seeing
is something that could exist in a whole
bunch of other environments that also is
a
but you're seeing it here so you assume
that it's you know must only happen here
whatever this is what I mean when I say
anecdotes or bad data is worse than no
data because you might have an idea that
like okay well I don't know anything
about Malmo saying that you know nothing
about crime in this area is better than
making a bad observation bad observation
and then extrapolating that into bad
data okay because now you have an answer
that's wrong it's better to say I do not
know than it is to say I know something
that is incorrect right this is this is
the problem and and you can apply this
type of statistical analysis you can
apply this to a million different things
in every part of your life you can apply
this form of thinking let's say that I
do something on stream and I want to
find out if I if I'm doing a good job at
getting new subs so let's say that I try
something some day and I want to see
that I do a good job at getting subs
well here's my first question how many
subs did I get today okay Wow let's say
that we have 25 subs what was that good
well I don't know how do we find out if
that's good um well let's look at what
we got the last day okay I got 10 subs
yesterday and I got 25 subs today holy
[ __ ] that's really good that's a success
right we did it we got 50 more subs
yesterday than than we did or today than
we did yesterday well is that good well
we don't actually know you have to
compare more than that when you're
talking about sales figures you're
talking about running sales what if
yesterday was a Thursday okay and today
was a Friday what if we go back the past
week and we find out that last Thursday
we got 11 subs and we got 40 subs on
Friday well actually if we go back and
we compare like days to like days what
we actually found out was oh well hold
on normally on Fridays I get way more
subs than I do on Thursdays but when I
did my special sub thing this Thursday
Friday
I actually got less than what I should
have right oh well [ __ ] so maybe this
was a massive [ __ ] failure right well
let's go back to last Friday what if
last Friday was the day after tax day
we'll hold on maybe it was tax so what
we actually have to do is go back a year
or go back a month and say okay well on
the 31st of this month last year
what were the sub differences between
Thursday and Friday right there's like
this is what I'm saying when I'm saying
that everything with data is so
complicated that you have to make sure
that you're looking at the right day to
the right numbers that there's a million
different confounding variables
they can influence whether or not the
answer you're getting is telling you
what you really want to know I'm sorry
I'm presenting this in a really
pessimistic fashion I'm not saying that
it's impossible to figure out an answer
to anything I'm just saying that like if
you want to be intelligent about it
getting the correct answer to your data
is such an involved process it's like a
it's a massively involved process to
make sure that you're asking the right
questions that you're collecting data in
a responsible way and that that data is
actually answering the question that
you're answering or answering the
question that you're asking and and not
being confounded by a hidden variable
that you're not considering oh okay
does that make sense what is the guy
that asked me why isn't the plural of
anecdote data hey destiny why do you
want people to make good arguments and
if they do how will that help you I just
like it when people talk about arguments
in a rational way if you're being
irrational it makes you impossible to
communicate with and I view you as less
than human I have a very we have brains
and we have rationality we have the
capability to do that no other [ __ ]
animal can do it [ __ ] the vegans humans
are the only ones that are cool and do
this [ __ ] that's why dolphins even
though they're so intelligent on the
verge your [ __ ] extinction cuz those
dumb [ __ ] can't even figure out
how to get on the [ __ ] water did get
the [ __ ] out it you're still in the
[ __ ] ocean if you think you're smart
you guys run around raping your [ __ ]
foreheads with your dicks alright [ __ ]
off dolphins alright
human beings the smartest [ __ ] you hat
you have the capability being rational
embrace it okay the brain is the most
important muscle in your body beside
your [ __ ] dick
gotcha I wish people like Thomas I would
know how difficult it is with the data
they're so [ __ ] [ __ ] when it comes
to interpreting the dinner remember
Sargon with the [ __ ] marriage thing
oh yeah
like there's another really good thing
okay like here's like um like this is I
would bet money okay that over half of
Americans would get this incorrect okay
over half of Americans will get this
incorrect okay okay what does this graph
tell us married couples do better
among all races okay we can see the
median household income of a person
living alone we can see the median
household income of a single parent and
we can see the median household income
of people that are married with children
okay here are a couple of statements
that we can make about this data okay
people that are married with children
tend to have a higher or have a higher
median income than single people or
people living alone okay that is the
only statement that we can make about
this data period now a lot of people
will make a huge jump and they'll try to
say ah well a single person if they
would just get married they would make a
lot more income however that is not
supported and wrong that is not
supported by this data that is not what
this chart tells you okay if a person
living alone were to become married with
children their income would go ant wrong
route nope that is not what this tells
you that is not what this tells you so
well what do you mean destiny people
that are married with children have
higher incomes and people living alone
of course if the person living alone
would get married and have children they
would get a higher income we don't know
that the data does not that might be
true but what you have there is a
hypothesis because that hypothesis is
not supported by this data you need to
get new data to support that we can
think of multiple hypotheses that
explain this data that don't involve
that for instance maybe people don't
choose to get married until they're
wealthy if that's true that means that
wealthier people tend to get married and
then have children that means that
wealth is a precursor for marriage not
an effective marriage now what I just
said
that's another hypothesis it's not
necessarily supported by this data now I
happen to know that that's probably true
because I've analyzed the data but we're
not analyzed but I've looked up data
before that wealthier people tend to get
married but I'm just saying that people
will extrapolate a lot out of a single
poll and then they think that they can
when they can't destiny you cannot
seriously think that over half of
Americans when I was I mean oh no you're
right I probably 75 percent plus would
say that
but like for instance and and we can
actually we can run [ __ ] thought
experiments it should to try to prove
this to like I can think of a number a
plethora of circumstances where person
lives alone they find another person
that's broke as [ __ ] and they go like
hey let's just [ __ ] let's get married
and have kids and we'll make a [ __ ] to
no honey no that's not how that works
right we don't have a mechanism to
describe that a mechanism where a person
living alone can magically get married
have kids and make a lot more money that
mechanism doesn't exist you can't
explain that or maybe you can I bother
sighs money we could go through the date
and try to find out but um isn't it
shitty to use household income on this
graph and not independent income this
graph seems really misleading well no
because household income is important
right because you because there are
certain bills that will be shared like
utility bills will be shared household
bills like mortgages or rent payments
will be shared so what else like I could
think of a million different things for
why oh here's one that I learned about
in psych class a long time ago right
people do research and find out like to
sleep correlate with success in school
and and and there is there was a study a
long [ __ ] time ago my psych class this
was literally like we're digging back
boys like 11 years ago okay where they
did a bunch of research and I found that
you could like directly correlate the
amount of sleep that you got with it you
could directly correlate the amount of
sleep that you got with your success in
school and the people that sup more did
better in school and you know that that
seemed to be a pretty reasonable answer
because we can you we can hypothesize a
mechanism getting more sleep that makes
you be more rested and concentrate
better right that mechanism seems to
explain that gap but when they dug into
the data more it seemed like that it
wasn't as consistent when they started
to split up people by demographics and
whatnot it seemed like you could find
really wealthy kids that didn't sleep as
much they still did way better than
poorer kids that slept more and what it
actually happened was it seemed like the
people that were getting less sleep had
more responsibilities in the household
or were working and they had less time
to spend on school and it was actually
hours spent on schoolwork at home that
was more predictive of success in school
than just the amount of sleep that you
got right so even though it looks like
sleep was highly correlated with success
of school that's true
that wasn't the explaining reason right
there were other confounding variables
there that were more likely to explain
your success or predict your success in
school than just whether or not you guys
sleep well okay I'm sorry I'm done with
all of this okay I just
it just it's very irritating like data
collecting and interpreting charts and
interpreting graphs it's something that
is very unintuitive like I think my econ
teacher always said that like statistics
don't lie but Liars use statistics like
you have to be really careful when you
interpret data and people can do it in
such a dishonest way that you get like
totally taken for a ride
beyond confounding variables you can get
into meaning like Simpson Oh Simpsons
paradox does this have to do with the
medical school [ __ ] oh this was used for
female where they argued that it was
either male or female discrimination had
occurred but when you dug into the stats
it was backwards wasn't it wasn't there
a famous court case that argued that a
university discriminated against it was
either men or women because the overall
percentage of women that made it was
higher than the overall percentage of
men but when you dug into the actual
data it was actually the other gender
getting [ __ ] in every single
Destinee I'll I'll talk to you about
something for a minute or two what is
your deal with veganism you talked to
vegan gains forbid are you still doing
the whole social contract unless it
defies science social contract doesn't
justify genocide Lowell sorry you're
saying it's about accepting a social
contract right basically the way that my
personal moral system works because I'm
somewhat of a nihilist I don't think
most people would be comfortable sharing
my moral system but I'm big on
reciprocated values sure the geoid name
came out of an example that vegan gains
use that I guess in retrospect I
shouldn't have let him use it because
most people misquote the [ __ ] out of it
but it has to do the idea that I would
be okay
wandering around Jenna sighting like
native tribes that hadn't contacted
people yet but in the hypothetical
example the philosophical people that
were postulated were literally like
subhuman people that were incapable of
ever being nice to outside people like
these are people that would if you
landed on their Island they would cut
you up eat you and that like these were
the examples given and I don't believe
that any human being is intrinsically
incapable of acknowledging like the
right for another human to exist
sure yeah but there's people who aren't
directly attacking you but who can't
reciprocate the social contract and you
don't want to kill those people right um
generally not no because if I'm not
directly interacting with other people I
wouldn't want other people to kill me
for that yeah so I'm just saying it's a
bit more you don't accept just ability
to reciprocate social contract wealth
and ability as grounds for killing
something obviously so you can point to
a case where you don't yeah maybe maybe
it's more about capability I mean your
next step that you go here is arguing
that most animals what you just are
before us right I understand that
look I'll also just do you their
respective mm-hmm with you and not
having just a logical back-and-forth and
just tell you what I actually think I
think that you are not a psychopath I
think you're a reasonable guy I think
that you're a smart guy and you'd sooner
debt sooner defend a consistent position
that sounds totally insane than actually
be inconsistent and get caught on an
inconsistency but I don't think that
your deepest value actually if you
really think about it there's going to
be something like ability to reciprocate
social contract
okay glad you think that of me because
you have a much higher opinion of me
than myself so thank you buddy Steven
can I ask how honest you are about that
about because like your position sounds
a little bit dishonest I know it does
but I don't prefer to get into the
anecdotal stuff because then you're
gonna ask me a bunch of really insane
questions and I'm gonna give you answers
that I believe to be true but you're
going to disbelieve them and you're
gonna think I'm engaging a motivated
reasoning so going into the anecdotal
things doesn't work right because you're
gonna ask questions like well if you ran
over an animal with a car why wouldn't
you feel at least a little bad we can
all we can all totally level that we
can't prove your subjective sure but
this is why I just I just prefers to
engage I just like to lay out the
arguments and then we can attack the
arguments but when people start engaging
and you have like motivated reasoning
well my reasoning is flawed which it
might be I mean the vegan argue is
really hard I mean you can point that
out but like when people are like do you
really believe this is like dude there
are people that really believe that
[ __ ] Obama was born in Kenya like I
can't believe my positions on morality
without it being too unbelievable yeah
um well I've taken some flak for this
but I've said that you actually
maintained a consistent position in that
debate now it could be that there's
other levels of inconsistency that just
haven't been revealed yet but I mean if
you're going to actually bite the bullet
on killing humans who can't reciprocate
the social contract oh you know I will
say that's a consistent position
I just don't totally buy that and even
like just a few minutes ago when I put a
little pressure on it I'm like but
really though we can find people who
they're not reciprocating the social
contract but you don't want to just [ __ ]
them up for no reason I don't crime so
first of all just to be clear I like to
just say reciprocated values I don't
like to use words social contract was
they think of it too usually especially
like government theory and stuff which
is way outside of anything that I'm
capable of discussing but just for
purposes because inevitably somebody
will hear this and be like this isn't
social contract I get a lot of people
that say that and that might be true I
don't know I guess like it's yeah I mean
I well when you say reciprocated values
that there's two kind of things you
could mean or maybe there's more I don't
know but it seems like you in a being
that's just by virtue of whatever is
happening they just happen to be
reciprocating your values or you could
be talking about beings
consciously comprehend and reciprocate
your values so I think there's a tiny
bit of almost like a bait-and-switch
again not like ascribing any intention
to you I don't know if that's
intentional or not but it seems almost
like you're saying you know okay when
let me let me take a minute to just
clarify my thoughts well I mean I
understand the distinction you're
drawing here because if I because if I
say it has to be a conscious process
then I save myself from animals that
would never harm me like hour before
animals right but if I say unconscious
process then we've exposed a flaw right
well how can you justify murder before
and the thing is you have to say you
have to be willing to say oh well it's
just even if they're unconscious and
it's reciprocating you have to say that
to cover all humans but that will cover
animals so you see the little well lemma
so this is kind of like and I don't I
don't I'm not a fan of discussing his
positions because a lot of them are very
emotionally charged but like I would I
don't so the big difficulty in arguing
meat eating versus veganism is that you
have to find a bar that every human can
pass that no animal can I'm not actually
interested I think that there are some
humans and and I would argue that we
already do this in society I would argue
that there are humans that don't pass
that bar that I'm okay not yielding
moral consideration to but I argue that
we already don't do that in society to
some extent that there are humans that
are of sufficient developmentally
delayed statuses that we actually treat
as sub humans but right we don't grant
them autonomy we assign them caretakers
we don't let them make decisions
yeah we don't stab them to death right
yeah but no I'll agree that and if
someone's condition gets bad enough like
you and I aren't gonna diverge on things
like thinking euthanasia
moral are we they lose that the
euthanasia is moral that it's at least
morally neutral well I would argue well
we have to defend thing as long as
someone's suffering someone's suffering
brutally it's horrible there's no
getting out of it they make a rational
choice to die
they can't kill themself you you don't
deny for example that that's moral right
I'm just making am I getting lost in
double negatives so I would clearly
state if somebody wants their someone
else to kill them for whatever reason I
think that's ok you can make the
decision if they say yeah of course yeah
yeah so I'm just just a random area to
go to but I just I don't think will
disagree that there's some conditions
where it's okay to kill a human that's
that will also agree there's some
conditions where it's okay to kill an
animal it's just about you you totally
hit what is for me then
nail right on the head when you talked
about it's about drawing a line based on
some consistent principle and the reason
has to be a consistent principles
because if it's an inconsistent
principle someone can just say well I'm
going to be inconsistent and treat you
like [ __ ] so it makes no sense so I have
to draw some kind of consistent line
that's very hard to find a way to place
that line that covers all humans we want
to cover the literally all humans in all
situations is like a strongmen I know
you're not using that yeah sure
obviously we know those there's those
cases like Jeff's war yeah euthanasia so
yeah I think that's actually a genuine
problem and I don't know how you would
draw that line in a way that excludes
farmed animals I really genuinely don't
yeah for sure and I can understand that
and like I say I don't think that does
it for you
really yeah maybe I mean like I said my
I guess like the main reason why I
wanted to do well the main reason I
wanted to debate vegan games it was
because I saw that he debated two or
three other people and they were just
[ __ ] so stupid oh god one was that
Brooks guy the no [ __ ] dude and the
other was someone else and I don't know
and the thing that irritates me is that
meat eaters are oftentimes incredibly
dishonest and incredibly inconsistent
with the way that they treat animals and
it always bothered me that meat eaters
are very very kind and extend so much
consideration to pets to household pets
but absolutely zero or ante
consideration to like farm animals yes
so that inconsistency is something that
I pointed out I always said that if most
people were to be forced to adopt like
philosophical principles that I think
most people would wind up as vegans if
that's a position that like in a hundred
years I this sounds really extreme to
say but I think we'll look back on
veganism the same way we look back on
like slavery and stuff that people
wonder like how the [ __ ] could we ever
condone like harvesting and murdering so
many yeah yeah okay so the first thing I
really want to say to that is can't you
be the guy to put yourself a step ahead
of someone like Sargon who says that and
doesn't act okay don't ever compare me
to Sargon I can't even blame statement
destiny and he won't act on it well I
don't know what sorry first of all he
actually I'll make this statement so I
can probably does even have like a set
of ethics or moral positions thought-out
like the guy's a [ __ ] brain-dead
yeah just be foolish yet we'll look back
we'll think it's horrible we'll think
it's like slavery oh sure okay yeah he's
probably quoting somebody else I hate
Sargon I don't know the way that for me
personally I am when I try to like build
morals out of principles or out of like
I guess axiomatic truths or whatever
like I'm very nihilistic in my approach
to things more so than most people so I
don't think this will ever necessarily
apply to me if that makes sense but I
acknowledge that I do it on a level that
most people don't like I have a really
really hard time getting to an area
where I respect any other human life
from a rational point of view at all
because when you start going down the
veganism versus mediating or whatever
route you run into like nihilistic
properties very quickly so like for an
example if a lot of vegans will define
like sentient life is life that's worthy
of being protected if you ask why to
that that almost ends up being like an
axiomatic thing what you expect right
and like these are really hard things
like what we should respect conscious
creatures okay well why you know what is
even consciousness like I believe like
I'm totally on the same page as you like
we would both agree morality is
fundamentally subjective it's a moot
strap by some base level value axiom
like we yeah totally yeah so it comes to
so building vegan values out of that
kind of like nihilistic black hole is
literally like I need to generate some
way to respect the life of an animal
that will never benefit me never respect
me never do anything or or interact with
me in some conscious level ever and
that's a really hard thing to do unless
you can assign some magical property to
I say magic all that sounds
disrespectful but unless you can assign
some property that is worthy of moral
consideration to all animals and switch
it's really hard to do from like that
kind of like nihilistic area okay no no
I I totally I get what you're saying
what's a good way to put this the I
think that you're overlooking a really
easy intuitive intuitively easy way for
us to do that which is we all
intuitively already believe in some kind
of ethics for humans and yeah but so
like intuition is something that I
attack like hard
yeah guide what we want step ones one
sec one sec with the intuition I'm not
saying that the morale morality should
be based on intuition that's just the
point about how psychologically easy it
is to accept
but I was also going to make the
statement that we have actual we could
say like logical propositions about how
we should treat humans on the table that
generally speaking basically all humans
except like you shouldn't commit
needless murder though I could get you
to veganism pretty much just from those
principles I think that the problem is
when you look at it like there's this
nihilistic void how do you bootstrap
rights for animals that problem it would
seem just like that for bootstrapping
rights for humans from an alien
perspective it always seems like that
trying to like bootstrap rights for
something you don't intuitively have a
lot of concern for it would feel like
that actually for a human who's a
psychopath trying to bootstrap rights
for other humans but the point that I
would make is that if you have some like
propositional beliefs about morality on
the table for how you want to be treated
I think that you can get to veganism
following from that maybe well yeah I
mean so I mean I guess like I don't I
don't I have no value whatsoever for
intuitive feeling I guess like whenever
I make any more arguments i average I
very much reject okay no I'm not saying
because I'm when I'm told the only
reason I mentioned intuition I mentioned
two things there firstly intuition than
the actual logical like propositions we
have on the table orally that we can
agree on the intuition of it was just
about how easy it is to psychologically
accept that wasn't actually a point that
we catch should value something just
because it's intuitive it's just how
easy it is to spread okay but even the
easiness to spread is an idea because
there's a lot of ideas that we have to
fight now well I don't know it's hard
like a sexual dimorphism like how hard
do we have to fight against this versus
how much is intuitive right the idea
that somebody could be gender fluid or
transgender is an idea that is very easy
to reject like from probably for me even
in an intuitive standpoint but that
doesn't necessarily make it a moral
option right what why are you why are
you talking about whether something
being intuitive makes it moral I'm not
saying well I'm sorry I guess I was
going to speaking more to your idea of
like the propensity to spread the idea
to other people that's kind of like the
second part of what you brought up or
did I misunderstand this first part was
I was talking about if it's intuitive or
not and that how intuitive it is that
tells you how easy it's going to be to
spread the second part was just about
like we actually have propositional
moral beliefs on the table that we
actually
okay that's kind of the important part
like just forget about how intuitive it
is or how psychologically it is to
accept or any of that just looks like
that I'm in fact also you and I could
probably talk this for a long time so
you tell me when you want to talk to
Matias he's still in here I don't know
where are you he's actually gone oh he's
gone wait what do you mean his phone
wasn't working as is yeah what the [ __ ]
happened that guy um okay well I don't
know I'll go back and forth with you on
this if you want for a little bit and
unless you get bored or have to go do
something but my basic thing would just
be you totally nailed it with the
drawing the line thing and it's just if
you're saying for example a human
shouldn't be stabbed to death needlessly
when you say it's okay to do that to an
animal
there's implicit in what you're saying
that an animal is actually different
from a human in some kind of way that
justifies that so it's just a matter of
what is that difference and if we apply
it to humans would it actually justify
the treatment for humans well like so I
feel like my response to that would be
like so I wouldn't I would never think
that stabbing another human is a moral
decision because I would never want
another human to stab me in terms of
like I would I would never stab an
animal because I wouldn't want an animal
to stab me that's not a type of I guess
a moral exchange that could ever happen
with any animal I except for maybe dogs
I guess I kind of like the one special
exception since they've been bred to be
alongside us for so often but I don't
know like these are the kinds of like
deals or exchanges that can never be
made with pretty much any animal is it
is there some property that's true of an
animal that if true of you would make
you say I don't actually deserve a right
not to be stabbed so this is the reason
why I don't say this reason because I
used a reciprocated system I don't think
that any property is relevant to
anything else so like it's really the
only property I guess I would have be
compared with the ability for it to
reciprocate something like I don't think
killing a human is wrong because the
death of a human is morally wrong or
that human life should be protected or
regarded it's more the idea that if I
say it's permissible to kill other
humans then what is to keep me from
being killed that's the only thing that
matters it's not any type of trinsic
value or property that belongs to humans
sorry good yeah I can actually get under
that and throw you back into the
property thing by pointing
that the ability to reciprocate is
actually a property so okay the property
that makes it okay to kill some beings
and not others is the ability to
reciprocate
then what would logically follow from
that is it's fine to just kill any being
that can't reciprocate morality and you
can bite the bullet on that but that
would justify killing any innocent
person even if we scale their sentience
up to a point that their consciousness
is more valuable than the totality of
humanity over all of history to the
power of infinity the fact that they
can't reciprocate the social contract
that would be just fine to kill that
person so that seems to me like I wake
it was like you give me an example of a
person like that or what do you mean by
that well no it's it's it's just like a
hypothetical condition yeah no no but I
gave him the hypothetical wait so
okay man what do we want to talk about
today let me just start off with a
generic life advice tip for you okay
here's a here's a real talk life advice
tip okay if you um people that spend all
of their time hating other people it's
not a healthy activity to be engaged in
I think it speaks to like the confidence
of a person when they spend all of their
time like constantly [ __ ] on other
people makes me wonder like what that
person has on their own I'm speaking in
general to like circle-jerk communities
or people that obsess over hating
individual people
so like the Bieber squad and everything
coolant if what can I hate like certain
types of people okay we're gonna watch
this clip two times alright we're gonna
get a different experience each time
here we go what this is such a dumb
comment
who cares if subs or kids are not money
is money you think the money matters
because I'm a 15 year old versus a 25
year old what a dumb comment what he's
so [ __ ] stupid nah I don't actually
good a destiny there that's [ __ ]
stupid you care because if your soda
which he puts some on a bunch of times
if you have a horde of kids that come
because a fortnight and I'll sub like
twitch Prime and it all sub the loser
somehow becomes completely cancer and
your entire environment and channel
becomes garbage so that's me talk to you
okay moving on okay let's watch this in
full-screen mode now let's see what kind
of environment this gentlemen's chat is
without kids I guess
ain't good for you like who gives a [ __ ]
how many subs they have their [ __ ]
kids are they not like we're playing for
tonight I'm gonna make it these gonna if
he if Logan Paul or what this is such a
dumb comment who cares if subs or kids
or not the money is money do you think
the money matters because I'm a 15 year
old versus a 25 year old what a dumb
comment wow he's so [ __ ] stupid nah I
don't actually agree with this neither
that's [ __ ] stupid you care because
if your soda which he puts some note a
bunch of times if you have a horde of
kids that come because a fortnight and a
sub like twitch Prime and it all sub the
loser somehow becomes completely cancer
and your entire environment and channel
becomes garbage so that's me
[ __ ] you okay so first of all where are
all of these huge twitch streamers with
really good twitch chats can somebody
can somebody find me is it it was not
rec full it sure as [ __ ] isn't forzen
it's not [ __ ] sodapoppin I'm not
making fun of these streamers saying
these guys are bad streamers because
they're chats suck understand in general
twitch chat is pretty [ __ ] cancerous
like this idea that I don't want kids
subscribing to my channel because of I
don't want kids subscribing to my
channel because it'll ruin the quality
of my chat now when you're making this
argument you have to be understanding
that you're reaching really [ __ ] hard
like if you're reaching really hard
there might be like a select few chats
on on Twitch that aren't garbage here
but I mean in general the larger streams
especially like the type of people that
are showing up on live stream fails that
QR the xqc [ __ ] the soda pop ins the
rec falls the Greek got exes the four
isms the ice Poseidon's like these chats
tend to be pretty [ __ ] cancerous
usually it's a ton of [ __ ] emote spam
right so one this isn't an intrinsically
bad thing if that's what you want if you
want people some emotes this stuff
that's gold - even if kids do subscribe
you can still bend them they [ __ ] up
your chat it's not hard to do if
somebody is making problems in your chat
you just bend them
whether they're a kid or not a kid okay
so this is the first thing okay now for
some reason like it's hard to pick out
like how many people are making like
genuine arguments versus how many people
are just don't like kids I'm just not
really sure
like I don't okay so let me let me make
another life advice statement okay just
because somebody's older than somebody
else doesn't make them better than that
other person makes it's different but
not better now for some reason a lot of
people circle-jerk over average age of
an audience now if I had to wager a
guess I would probably guess that my
audience is one of the oldest on Twitch
just because of the nature of the topics
that we deal with here now I could be
wrong but I'm willing to bet that
somebody that will entertain the
philosophical merits of veganism is
probably going to be somebody that's
older than somebody likes to spam
tryhard every time a bucket of KFC shows
up on stream now I could be wrong but
I'm pretty confident that my audience is
older in general than at least the drama
streamers could be wrong I'm pretty sure
I'm not
that being said okay you're being
disingenuous destiny you have even
preached curating a community in the
past and now you say it doesn't matter I
never said it doesn't matter okay take a
deep breath I know you're real pean to
get on that [ __ ] Logan or Jake Paul
hate train I don't know what the [ __ ]
the guy's name is I know you're real big
together okay take a deep breath okay
just because one audience member is
older or younger doesn't necessarily
make them better than then another
audience member it just means that
they're capable of different things okay
yeah that's that's it so for instance if
I have if I have an audience full of
older people it's easier to have
political or philosophical conversations
five an audience of younger people it's
probably easier to be more focused on
video games right
neither of these arguments or towards
say drama related things it probably is
better with younger people although I
don't even necessarily know if that's
true and because everybody [ __ ] loves
drama and gossip that's just like a fact
of life that you learn once you get out
of high school or college so yeah so
with that out of the way okay I don't
even know your argument isn't consistent
I don't know what you're talking about
you're keen to jump to concluding like I
believe something okay you're being just
have you ever peed you've preached
carrying a commune of the past and now
you see to the matter okay hold on link
me something where I just said that
curating a community doesn't matter I
can't tell what the [ __ ] you're even
typing about okay so well you figured
that out curating a community of course
that matters so you've you figure that
out and then you let me know when I say
that so do you think there's a
difference in ability to convert viewers
to revenue based on age so this is the
thing that's confusing me a lot well I
say it's confusing but then I'm going to
give the explanation for why I believe
people view this we think this way
because I don't think it's actually that
confusing Oh God some of these comments
are painfully [ __ ] stupid oh I don't
know should endowment people okay so
people are saying that if somebody
subscribes to you and they're a kid that
it's a bad business decision now this is
a comment that I'm seeing pop up a lot
now on its head that comment is [ __ ]
stupid okay so I'm gonna try to guess
what's going on underneath here okay
because that comment is demonstrably
[ __ ] stupid kids are bad subs because
why because they have no money because
they have no disposable income you mean
the kids that have the Xbox's and the
Playstations and the video games these
kids have no money as opposed to what a
broke college kid as opposed to what
like an adult that only maybe PC games
like I mean like you have tons of
different demographic
six of people from which you can extract
money from kids are definitely people
that you can make money off of now
does there is a disposable income come
through the form of allowances or shitty
jobs or their parents just buying ship
um sure but as I said earlier I will
continue to defend this comment money is
money whether or not a kid has a parent
buy a subscription or as a parent buy
them a Minecon pass or a Minecraft shirt
or has a parent buy them a certain game
or as a parent gives them money to
donate to a stream it doesn't really
matter you can monetize children you
just can like this is inarguable
children buy merchandise children make
up a huge demographic of gamers children
watch advertisements because they don't
add a block as much as older people so
like I don't understand this so just on
its head the idea that children are bad
make for bad subs in a business sense is
really [ __ ] stupid
okay so die has spoken a lot in the past
but kids donating and parents contacting
him to get their money back
okay sure I guess that's like an added
thing at first of all I doubt that this
has happened to soda a [ __ ] ton I'm sure
it's happened a couple times I mean I
get people that out that at the due
chargebacks for me or asking me for
their money back should I stop accepting
all donations because some people ask
for their money back it doesn't make any
sense right like now if sodas like I've
had hundreds of people contact me trying
to get you know my money back
then maybe sure at that point it's not
worth it now I would argue that um I
would our soda values his chat culture
what's wrong with this the problem is
don't make a [ __ ] argument I don't
understand why this is so hard for
people to accept it understand all I
want is for you to not [ __ ] lie to me
and lie to yourself when you're making
an argument if somebody would it get out
and say listen I don't really want to
stream this type of game because I think
the audience I would guardar wouldn't
contribute well to an environment that I
want to create that's totally valid dude
if that's your argument that's totally
valid I don't want these types of people
in my chat I make that decision a lot if
that's what you want to do that's
totally fine but don't come here and be
like well it's a bad business decision
could sometimes
judge Begley dude children are a massive
demographic in the gamer market I'm
sorry if that makes you uncomfortable
but let's not all sit here and pretend
this sounds like sin that somebody would
make fun of me for pretend that gamers
are this enlightened core a [ __ ] stem
graduate like PhD holders words like wow
we don't associate with kids he says as
he spams KFC bucket Snickers and try
hard every single time somebody mentions
stealing something on a video game like
come on dude
all right we are we being real now like
children are a massive demographic of
gamers there's nothing wrong with
appealing to those audiences of people
there are certain spots and in YouTube
who's the mix tabby guy [ __ ] I don't
remember there are tons of youtubers
that make livings what's the name of it
got [ __ ] there are so many of these
people that make livings with younger
audiences [ __ ] who's the guy it's like
it's not mix tabby it's like Mick oh god
what the [ __ ] is this guy's name Nathan
you so watch the student who's younger
Oh stampy there are these people this
guy is booked at 9 million [ __ ] subs
9 million subs if we watch this guy's
videos what do you think his audiences
hello this is stampy and welcome to a
minecraft let's play video and another
video inside of stampy's lovely world
today in this video i am going to be
joined by lee bear good morning Lee
there you know what I miss you coming
out of the painting I know you normally
do but the last year episodes you've
surprised me on the earth the balcony
even though it's nice I think we should
do a traditional liebe emerging from the
what do you think the average ages of
the viewer here this guy's got 9 million
subs ok when you have like Tyler 1
screaming into his [ __ ] microphone
this isn't attracting like our you know
like the brightest minds of today you
know people with advanced mechanical and
nuclear engineering degrees are turning
on doctor disrespect to watch him scream
about how he's the two-timing champ
the [ __ ] universe in 1994 99 like hey
when people watch for Zim and spam
Uganda warrior Wakanda Uganda Wakanda
whatever these people are not the
appetite okay I'm sorry I just want to
get that out of the way because I don't
understand these comments because
everybody seems to be making comments
about how like it's a bad business
decision about having children watching
your stream it's not I don't know why
people think this this is a bullshit-ass
argument now there might be other
arguments like and people keep putting
all of this like all of this really dumb
advice just because there's a larger
demographic of one group it does not
mean it's a good business move just
because the group is bigger in quantity
that's like marketing in a nutshell this
fantasy where we're all pretending that
children aren't a massive mover in the
gaming audience is hilarious now I know
that gamers in general we like to think
of ourselves I'm not even gonna say
ourselves I'm gonna myself part of your
group yeah they're [ __ ] [ __ ]
gamers like to think of themselves as
this and this is like the general vibe
that I get from a lot of reading these
covers that gamers are these really
[ __ ] high opinions of themselves like
average IQ you know 125 average income
140,000 a year you know average life
status you know college graduate holding
down full-time work average marital
status married with two children like
what wait what the [ __ ] do you think the
average gamer is like [ __ ] calm down
dude business is complicated
destiny taking Wow occur Eddie thanks
for subscribing I hope you're over 18
otherwise you're a subhuman piece of
[ __ ] business is complicated
destiny taking one aspect raw income and
holding another pedestal is ignorant
money is money growth branding
sustainability those are more important
to a channel than a week or two a big
paycheck
okay how about growth how about
cultivating fans that are younger that
will grow into being older fans that's a
way to grow isn't it branding Wow
remember all those huge wouldn't it be
crazy wouldn't it be just wouldn't it be
insane okay now this would be like this
would be funny okay I don't think I
could find this because it would be like
a slam dunk argument right but would it
be funny if the largest [ __ ] youtuber
in the world
I had an audience of children would that
be like wouldn't that be crazy if hey
guys wouldn't it be crazy if the largest
youtuber in the world a guy that is
worth probably eight or nine figures
maybe wouldn't it be crazy if his
audience was probably primarily children
based on a lot of his earlier videos
like but or are we gonna pretend that
the average age of a PewDiePie viewer is
like 37 years old like we're like we're
literally competing for Fox News with
with oldest age like come on
sustainability I like I love the I love
the business advice of all like the
[ __ ] randoms I'll eat the downright 6
I understand we need to [ __ ] on Jake
Paul but like you should add a +18
button on your sub that kept me out of
porn websites for six or seven why yes
RM thanks buddy
you hit the nail ahead that's no excuse
to see or acknowledge the bigger picture
that's the bigger picture here
what's it having kids will like destroy
your brand like oh god like yesterday
did you see that they they released the
quarterly updates on live stream fails
when they took the average age of all
the subscribers of the different
streamers did you see that pewdiepie are
forsen or whatever it came in at average
age of a 17 point two years old his
business is doomed
like um take ninja for example last week
he lost 10,000 subs in a day due to his
sudden twitch prime growth oh no the guy
that grew to 250 thousand subs lost
10,000 subs in a day this is the same
type of dumbass [ __ ] reader that
reads a report about how um Zuckerberg
lost two billion dollars overnight
because Facebook stock is like going
down and they think that he lost a
significant amount of money like what
the [ __ ]
naturally twitch Prime doesn't
auto-renew and it's up to the user to do
so manually therefore you have to
constantly pimp out twitch Prime as
opposed to your regular subs it's just
not sustainable
talking about my sweat okay the reason
why I'm bothered by this is because this
guy is being incredibly snarky and
clearly doesn't understand the industry
at all he has no idea what the [ __ ] he's
talking about why not go to some actual
large streamers and ask them how is
twitch Prime impacted your revenue how
sustainable is twitch prime revenue now
I know that mine is probably larger than
most because I've got an off stream an
off stream subscriber base but I'm
pretty sure like 80% of my subscribers
have been twitch Prime subs for 214
years now you have to remind them what
now exactly you have to constantly pimp
out twitch Prime as opposed to your
regular subs welcome to being
self-employed dog you have to constantly
pimp out and market yourself in order to
make money that's the nature of being a
1099 employ that's the nature of being a
contractor that's the nature of being
self-employed you don't show up every
day at work and collect a paycheck now
that I'm [ __ ] on that work now that
there's anything wrong with it but when
you're self-employed you have to
constantly work for your money now if
you're not pimping out your your to your
twitch subs you're pimping out your
normal so if you're not ready to prime
subs you're pimping out your normal subs
you're pimping out your donations you're
pimping out your merchandise you're
pimping out whatever sponsors you're
working with you're pimping out whatever
activations you're doing for games
you're playing you're pimping any other
number of things
you're constantly pimping out as a
streamer what is this idea that pimping
out prime subs is like the worst thing
in the world like okay it's just not
sustainable sure you have a good month
financial but there's no guarantee the
rest of your months will be consistent
welcome to self-employment income there
is no guarantee that any of your income
will be so consistent this is the nature
of being self-employed and the nature of
streaming there's never a guarantee that
your income is consistent as a full-time
streamer destiny should know that his
ultimate goal should be to maintain a
consistent stream sure why can't
promoting prime subs be a consistent
part of my stream soda makes a value
pool point as he's already acknowledged
his community could be a bit iffy but
throwing a few thousand Logan Paul 10
year old fans into the mix with access
to moms Amazon Prime account is just
asking for trouble it's going to divide
your community why why does it have to
if somebody is [ __ ] up chat just
[ __ ] ban them then being a kid like
again like and I underst
no I'm sorry I know a lot of you really
upset because I'm reaching but I have to
reach to figure out what drives these
comments because it's not business sense
because everything being said here from
a business point of view is demonstrable
all right boys we're gonna watch this
video and we're gonna exercise our
brains all right on YouTube academic
sources and educated opinions are a gray
area when it comes to video essays what
might just be conjecture in our opinion
peace may be related to others suspect
there it's very deliberate and well put
together presentation however this genre
has been plagued by idiosyncrasies and
many are starting to notice and
criticize the video essay format while
many video essayists may not intend for
this to happen they might be
manufacturing how we view media
critically and I think it's for the
worst what I specifically mean by this
is that video essayists are trying to
make their opinion pieces seem more like
the end-all be-all objective truth on
the matter intentionally or not before
proceeding I would like to say that this
video acts as a companion piece to male
murrow's projects video the value of
subjectivity some of what I say in this
video will work synergistically off of
that video but their video goes into the
more sociological analysis of it one of
the most entrancing things about video
essays is their presentation whether it
be their editing writing or vocal
delivery it can elicit a feeling of
academic or intellectual prowess while
it may feel that way
you have to realize that some video
essays purposely do this they keep the
style of aesthetically pleasing lo-fi
hip-hop beats or jazz while delivering
lines in a very oratorical style I feel
that this often gives a vibe of
superficial grandeur I understand that
it is very appealing and it does work
the deliberate editing of these videos
contribute to this ruse you're probably
thinking to yourself that what I'm
saying here might not really equate well
to the merit of their work
I'm not outright discrediting any video
essayist I should say that they are
doing more good than harm with bringing
thought-provoking ideas and content
forward however this may not be the
desired effect these creators want and
advertently making things seem so
matter-of-factly has some strange
consequences I said in the intro to this
video that there's a gray line when it
comes to educated opinions and academic
sources on this website what I really
wanted to expand upon with that
statement is how video essayists are
framing them
his objective as possible rather than
trying to reconcile with the subjective
aspects of it
a lot of video essayists attempt to
bring mechanics and technique of
whatever medium they are talking about
to logically frame their editorials and
pieces you're probably saying yourself
but what's wrong with that
providing rational evidence to support
your claim is just how these people
prove their point while you are correct
it is the amount of emphasis we give to
the evidence of something rather than
the opinion we attempt to gauge the
value of subjective elements of whatever
media we're writing about by trying to
equate objective evidence personally I
find it more meaningful to talk about
the subjective elements of a piece
because it allows more speculation and
doesn't Rob any artistic intent away
from the creator's the fun and intrigue
of making videos like this is to share
your outlook because it allows more
speculation and doesn't rob any artistic
intent away from the creator's weight
objective evidence personally I find it
more meaningful to talk about the
subjective elements of a piece because
it allows more speculation and doesn't
Rob any artistic intent away from the
creator's the fun and intrigue of making
videos like this is to share your
outlook on a piece of art or media but
we really don't need to always use
strict analytical structures I find this
problem most prominent in film video
essays while I do like 90% of the ones I
see I find it annoying that there is so
much reliance on trying to equate
technique in relation to a shot score
meaning or a director's intent these are
just my nitpicks as a filmmaker when we
attempt to view a shots meaning only
through the production techniques used
we are robbing ourselves of exploring
the nuance of a shot video essayists
apply perceptible information to
something rather than attempting to make
it transformative for the viewer sure
you might learn how the composition of a
certain shot may contribute to motifs
and themes of a movie but there isn't
much going further it feels more like an
attempt to secure a monolithic
smoking-gun interpretation you know some
sort of objective fact about what the
movie is
and when I make that video I get a ton
of tons of comments of people saying
this analysis is bad because it's not
objective enough it's not objective it's
and like that's not the point
the point of the video is that it's
subjective that's the goal and the funny
thing about this is that the
counterpoint to that would be what does
an objective video essay look like and
when I think of that I immediately what
strings of mine is stuff like every
frame a painting and nerdwriter people
who have this sort of authoritative
pseudo academic tone and they talk
technicals they talk about the way that
David Fincher frames a shot and stuff
like that
they talk about it in terms of how
things are not what they mean or why it
matters they and sometimes they do talk
about why it matters what they talk
about it in terms of like how it might
hypothetically affect an audience how it
might hypothetically affect the viewer
the abstract notion of the viewer I
don't care for that style a lot of
people do care for a lot of people like
it and that's fine you're allowed to
like that but the problem is we've
devalued the subjective perspective on
art and on film you may disagree with me
on this but I want to see more video
essays that talk about the subjective
interpretations that provokes something
emotional or intellectual to its viewers
talking technical about certain films
can certainly get the mind wandering
with what you can do with certain things
but I feel way more inspired when a
creator talks about the subtextual
elements behind something and emphasizes
that we can all relay our knowledge from
film school or game design class but it
really doesn't do much for engaging in
meaningful discourse about art I try to
stay away from talking about specific
examples because I really don't want to
paint someone in a negative light
however I'm going to cite some positive
examples of people who do video essays
that I think can bring more to the table
renegade cut only talks about the
philosophical and political themes and
films Leon Thomas does it with such
intellectual acuity and earnestness
there really isn't anything extra in
this presentation besides this excellent
writing and analysis of the film's which
are more often than not backed up by
academic sources Leon covers all types
of films as well
not just mainstream Hollywood or indie
darlings one of the things I attempt to
incorporate in all my videos is a
similar aesthetic Nick's fears
idiosyncrasies is what makes her videos
so much more interesting in the genre I
am more referring to her recent videos
by the way the ones that follow a video
essay format there is so much character
in charming us about the way NYX
presents herself in all of her videos
she doesn't take it too seriously either
making it more believable and honestly
has an extremely good taste in film and
I just love the attention to detail in
the sets in the way of the writing
you
when I write all of my videos I attempt
to always leave room for discussion I
always feel that what proceeds after the
video is way more important than the
video itself I am aware of the fact that
I'm just here and this is in my opinion
but I more so want to get others talking
about it and sharing their opinion as
well I feel that this is the mentality
we need to carry from now on when making
these videos [ __ ] I thought this video
was gonna be something like a little bit
different and I could talk about this
and respond to this because I thought
that we couldn't kind of sort of agreed
but we just had different conclusions
but I'm holy [ __ ] I almost disagree with
every single thing stated in this video
yeah [ __ ] are mine I'm sorry okay the
so firstly let me give you let me give
you a concept that a lot of you might
not understand i've never verbalized
this before but maybe i should have so
he kept pointing out the nerdwriter was
like his thing okay so essays when
you're watching a video essay okay and
okay so close your mind or I'm sorry
close your eyes and open your mind okay
I'm gonna tell you how to think about
this because this is apps there's
nothing this is how you're supposed to
think about this okay a video essay is
not a statement of fact
it's a point to be considered so when
you watch a video essay I say the nerd
writer okay this is about a ghost in the
shell' right so the title of this is how
not to adopt a movie this is not an
objective statement of fact on how
you're not supposed to adopt a movie it
is an argument that the nerd writer is
putting forth for you to consider on how
not to adopt a movie this sounds like
semantics but these things are worlds
apart in the former you believe that
somebody is giving an objective
statement of fact as a from a position
of authority that should be recited as a
statement of fact
okay rather than well this is his
impression of this and these are the
arguments that he puts forth to our
this point ultimately for you to
consider does that make sense the
difference between these two things it
no there aren't now this isn't to say
that if you give like an essay I'm like
chemistry or something then I mean um
you know it's those are different but in
terms of like all the video essays that
you know we watch sure people watch
about um what's the name of the guy all
the really popular video essayists this
this video by Toni on how to do visual
comedy is not an objective statement of
fact on how to do visual comedy it is
Toni's argument on how he believes you
should do visual comedy so it is an
argument that he puts forth and then he
defends it with clips and ideas and
sources and whatnot right for you too in
order to strengthen his argument so that
you can ultimately consider the argument
right I'm just gonna listen and and pick
apart some of this know I'm sorry Toni's
our whatever the guys name is the guy
that has every frame a painting on
YouTube academic sources and educated
opinions or a gray area when it comes to
video essays what might just be
conjecture in our opinion piece maybe
relate to other suspect there it's very
deliberate and well put together
presentation however the first like so
this is what I thought his whole video
is gonna be about like the first like
two minutes of this guy's video is
literally video essayists spent a lot of
time trying to sound convincing but
that's the point to be fair the videos
that are marketed as statements of fact
on YouTube aren't actually same
inspector on ice cream the point of
making an essay is to sound convincing I
don't know why he would expect somebody
to go through the effort of researching
and putting forth an argument only to
constantly cop out or constantly weaken
their own argument by asserting that
they're not sure by by filling it with
well I could be wrong this guy was
saying that people like nerd writer and
Tony's I'll focus on much of the filming
techniques for the videos oh yeah I know
that's something else I totally discrete
them but that's later in this I'm just
focusing on the beginning here his
initial criticism seems to be that they
present themselves as very authoritative
what when you're giving an essay of
course you want to sound authoritative
this is an idea that you believe and
you're going to put forth as much
evidence as possible and then you're
going to try
convinced the person listening to it
that your idea is correct is something
for you to consider
right leg by idiosyncracies I mean
you're certain to notice it's pronounced
Joe Tony I don't know how to pronounce
this last name it's like Z Hou or
something
Shou precise the video is even it well
anybody OS to me not intention to heaven
they might be manufacturing how we view
media quickly I think it's are the worst
well I suppose I mean by this is that
the USA is certainly making me to seem
more like end-all-be-all Jack a truth on
the matter intentionally yeah well when
you make an essay of course you try to
make it sound like it's the truth that's
that's the whole point of defending the
argument the essay right nice before
proceeding I would like to say that this
video acts as a companion piece to
Melrose projects video the value of
subjectivity some of what I say in this
video will work synergistically off of
that video but there video goes into the
more sociological analysis of it well
the most entrancing things about the
us's is a presentation whether either
editing writing or vocal delivery it can
elicit a feeling of academic or
intellectual prowess of course so like
this the next minute is just gonna be me
saying of course like it's very strange
to me that he's like he is utilizing all
of these same techniques in his own
video I don't know if where this is like
some meta [ __ ] but like he's doing the
same in his video right you whether you
know he's got a script he edits together
a video he puts together things to
support his argument this is another
video essay an idea to be considered
write writing or vocal delivery it can
elicit a feeling of academic or in which
will promise while it may feel that way
you have to realize that some of us is
purposely do this they keep the stylus
like well everybody purposely does this
because you want to seem authoritative
on what you're talking about so that
your argument is more is more considered
right like pleasing loaf I hip-hop beats
are jazz while delivering lines in a
very oratorio style I feel like this I
think is a vibe of superficial Ranger I
understand it is very appealing it works
superficial grandeur I mean like so
superficial grandeur makes it sound like
you're saying that the person is trying
to make themselves seem more important
or whatever than they actually are are
more authoritative than they actually
are
I mean when you're giving like
subjective opinion pieces I mean I would
argue that that's kind of your goal as
an essayist right is of course your to
make yourself now if we were talking
about if you're going to a medical
conference you wouldn't want it to say
like hey by the way I'm a pro doctor and
homeopathy is real right that's
different but if you're presenting an
opinion on on a filling technique or an
editing style or whatever of course
you're gonna build yourself up to sound
as authoritative as possible that's the
point of a convincing essay right
the deliberating of these videos
contradict his ruse you're probably
thinking yourself that what I'm saying
here might not really equate well to
their to their work
an outright discrediting any of us asked
I should say that they were doing more
good than harm with really
thought-provoking ideas and content
forward however this may not be the
desired effect these craters want and
advertently making things seem so
matter-of-factly had some strange
consequences I started this video
there's a great line that comes to
educate opinions in academic sources on
this website what I really want to
expand upon it that statement is how
video essayists are framing themselves
as objective as possible rather than
trying to reconcile with the subjective
aspects of it I want to do is attempt to
bring a connecting technique of whatever
medium they're talking about to
logically frame their edits real some
pieces probably save yourself what's
wrong with that
providing rational evidence to support a
claim is just how these people prove
their point well you are correct it is
the amount of emphasis we give to the
evidence of something rather than the
opinion we tend to gauge the value of
subjective elements of whatever media we
were writing about by trying to equate
objective evidence personally I find
more meaningful to talk about some
difficult into a piece because it allows
more speculation and doesn't rob any
artistic intent away from the creator's
okay so this is the first thing that he
says that I totally 100 trillion percent
disagree with I had to back up and
listen to this like twice because I
actually completely set his home on to
talk about the subjective elements of a
piece because it allows more speculation
and doesn't Rob any artistic intent away
from the creator's okay so it's so well
let's I'm just gonna listen to this
whole chunk to make sure that I
understand this really well because I
sis we give to the evidence of something
rather than the opinion we attempt to
gauge the value of subjective elements
of whatever media we're writing about by
trying to equate objective evidence
personally I find it more meaningful to
talk about the subjective elements of a
piece because it allows more speculation
and doesn't Rob any artistic intent away
from the creator's okay this when I when
I hear this
okay so if we internalize his argument
and then regurgitate it in our own words
what it essentially sounds like he's
saying is there is a piece of art okay I
want to give my subjective
interpretation of it in as freeform as
possible while ignoring as much as
possible or any sort of objective
mechanic because I don't want to equate
that objective that that kind of
objective thing to any type of
subjective truth and in doing so I don't
understand he's lying about robbing the
the robbing the interpretation from the
Creator you can't you can never do that
I don't understand this this whole past
like 30 seconds maybe I misunderstand it
but like this whole past 30 seconds the
Greeks of me of like it reeks to me of
like everything should be subjective man
like I don't know
like I don't know if the objective
matters like let's just look at only the
meeting or whatever to say I don't
understand I mean there's a lot of
objective techniques you can use to
convey subjective meaning I don't know
this this passed like 30 seconds of
stuff sounds like really really really
really really stupid to me I shouldn't
use the word stupid it sounds really
naive any opinion essay an instructor
professors ever sign they always say to
express your thesis confidently they
explain that you're supposed to bring oh
yeah sure yeah we're past that we're
past that meme okay the fun and intrigue
of making videos like this is to share
your outlook on a piece of art or media
but we really don't need to always use
strict analytical structures okay now
this is weird because now it sounds like
he's trying to give us an objective
[Music]
feels like old times already

well here we are boys to gaming sessions
three days later we have gotten all the
achievements do you feel like you've
accomplished something today I feel like
I've accomplished something great today
20 years to know people are gonna ask me
what was the most important thing you
ever did and I'm gonna say one time I
stayed awake real long to get some fake
video game trophies and it felt real
good when I did it take a reaction-time
test right now oh okay well fresh oh
[ __ ] oh [ __ ]
I thought I thought I saw something how
long damn in control was so close to win
the fan Pepe if you happen to live in
Silicon Valley if you work in the Bay
Area and you know some friends at work
at Twitter you should have him show me
an email because my account got
mysteriously abandoned I can't make a
new account on Twitter good luck we're
free no cappuccino pops you know
optional but you know Al Pacino my dudes
[Music]
so what's up nothing much what you want
to talk about buddy I've been watching
your videos right and I've been uh I
mostly agree with you on a lot of things
right yeah but I really agree with you
on specifically is a correctness or I
know that's kind of a broad definition
but uh like just overall like your
thoughts on that
for instance good I don't know like
though saying the N word okay
what about it just to clarify like your
position on it um would be like you
don't think it's okay for white people
say the n-word or something along those
lines I mean I don't think I would say
that as strongly I just think you
probably shouldn't because you're
probably only going to upset people by
doing it I guess it would really depend
the context I guess what were you saying
it okay so you think it's kind of a
relative thing yeah I mean it would
depend on yeah I don't know I think
honestly that topic and of itself has
been too broad but push it up on you for
a second because I actually had two
topics like if one didn't work
none I mean sure well I mean we didn't
even really talk about that one but okay
sure
oh really go as planned I thought it was
like something else entirely
so sorry about that oh yeah no problem
buddy alright so veganism am I actually
a vegan okay so I'm just wondering of
your debate with vegan games
yeah and so I was just wondering about
you're not vegan and like why just
clarify and again I haven't seen the
whole debate between you and Gaines
so I I feel like clarification is needed
all I know is that uh you're not a
meeting so I feel like that just being
beneficial went up itself no I mean yeah
I mean I guess I'm not because it's not
my my moral position but I mean it yeah
I mean I guess I mean we could hammer
out like a whole like vegan argument
that's gonna take some time
is there like a more specific question
or did you just want like - for me it's
just um I think it is strictly immoral
to not be vegan yeah I mean that would
be the most reasonable position for
somebody that's begin to take I would
imagine right oh I think that pretty
much everybody should be vegan so I
think are you not being vegan is in of
itself immoral yeah I mean if you're
vegan yeah I would expect you to take
that position yeah so I mean yeah I mean
you just not have any like well I guess
my argument would be I don't consider I
don't consider animals worthy of moral
consideration right and then we yeah all
right so I would then say like why do
you think that way well I mean I would
argue that the default stances to not
yield or not um grant moral
consideration to something and you have
to give an argument to grant moral
consideration to something so then I
would ask you why grant moral
consideration to animals the reason I
would grant moral consideration to
animals and mostly just because I feel
like there is no inseparable difference
between humans and I mean human second
Oreos but between humans and animals to
specifically say that we can't apply
morals to the new
okay oh do you have any contradiction
with that or I mean I don't necessarily
think there's a contradiction there um
if that's how you choose to do it but
strictly I I'm just well I guess I
should say this like go this route do
you think that yourself not being vegan
is immoral for yourself well no I mean
if I thought that the action was immoral
I would probably be vegan right or
acknowledge a hypocritical moral stance
but I guess I'll just say then why do
you not see like what I just said is
necessarily true
whoa we're talking about like how we
build our moral system and I guess
you're saying that you don't see a key
difference between animals and people
and I mean I guess if you don't then I
can't really argue with you there I mean
like if that's your position I mean you
can consistently build a moral system
around that position I don't necessarily
view it the same way I think that you
have to be able to engage in some form
of like moral reciprocity for for me to
grant you moral consideration so you
have to be able to respect certain
rights or be able to grow to respect
certain rights of minor whatever and
that's where I grab my kind of moral
consideration from and since most
animals are capable of doing that so
just just real quick what is in
arguments
Richard reciprocity like the ability to
reciprocate something or like if I give
you a high-five you give me a high-five
like giving something back yeah okay
sorry that was done with my part but um
yeah so basically I just feel like I'm
not gonna go with the whole objective
morality thing here right but I just
feel like um where was I going with this
um so basically I feel like Lee call you
like immoral you only mean like if you
don't abide by my moral viewpoint I mean
anyone can call anyone anymore
in that sense right so
I'm I don't know I just feel like lost
my words you know yeah well I mean like
I know in a relativistic sense I mean
you can still consider me immoral by so
let me give an example right I would
consider a somebody that doesn't employ
a black person right because they're
black I would consider that person to be
immoral judged by my current
contemporary moral standards but there
might have been a point in history where
maybe by their moral standards that
wouldn't necessarily be considered
immoral I guess it just depends upon
which instead of ethics you judge
somebody so I mean like in your moral
system if you are vegan I would expect
any vegan to judge any non vegan as
being as taking part in immoral activity
I think that would be an expected
statement right um but I guess where I
want this debate to kind of like slither
into like the debating convince you that
it is immoral you only mean like not
really the like subjective morality
within itself well yeah so what you
basically have to do is you have to
convince me that animals are worthy of
moral consideration right because if
something becomes whether you more
consideration than you have to consider
it morally right make our actions
against it moral or immoral
so again bones do you have with my
statement on a mindful leaf that the
correlation between human and animal is
indifferent enough to let go I guess so
well like what would something have to
do - I don't know I have a visit of
these arguments in a long time I guess
like my problem is that an animal
couldn't generally not really engage
with with any with like the same type of
social behavior that humans - so like
animals won't really respect like your
property rights right like an animal
wander around your yardage
we'll [ __ ] up your [ __ ] like kick it or
[ __ ] on it or eat it
I guess if they're walking around
certain animals will kill you or kill
your children given the opportunity to
that these types of behaviors are
sometimes intrinsic to a lot of these
animals so it's hard to grant them moral
consideration when they're not even
capable of engaging and the cognitive
process is needed for them to grant
moral consideration to us um with your
analogy to like then going around the
yard you know going around the property
you know [ __ ] everywhere that's
basically due to their you know
intelligence right I mean if they have
the intelligence of a human they would
be able to know about the respect for
one's property yeah it's probably like a
car yeah probably like a cognitive
process yeah again I could apply the
same thing here I mean there's studies
show that uh as intelligent as toddlers
right but they would still do these you
know these things yes the difference the
difference is that like oh that I would
argue and I think I said this earlier
but maybe if I do know that toddlers or
younger people have the ability to grow
into something that develops this where
I was like a sheep or whatever never
will but then I would say even let's say
hypothetically uh-huh this ability that
this toddler has then makes their
cognitive ability not grow at all so do
you think would be immoral to slaughter
in each that toddler I'm not sure I
would have to think about it but maybe
probably not I'm not sure we already I
guess like I point to the fact that like
we don't really treat people that have
like severely stunted learning abilities
like we don't already treat these as
people in a number of different ways for
instance oftentimes we revoke their
they're like autonomy right we'll assign
them Guardians and whatnot you have
parents that are pro-life that won't
abort children but if they've got a
child in the womb that is diabetes Down
syndrome they'll abort the child because
they don't want to deal with it so I
don't know I guess maybe
so again so when it comes to stuff like
that um the difference between an animal
and a mentally disabled person that
sound [ __ ] but scope ourian's I mean
when it comes to things like pets I mean
they obviously have guardians in a
similar way to mentally disabled people
not in the exact same way but uh so
basically the correlation I'm making
here sorry my thoughts [ __ ] up but
basically the correlation I'm making
here uh-huh
is there and I'm making here is that I
solved three times so now I'm getting
like parts up but it's okay I think I
kind of lost myself like wallows I think
you're comparing a mentally disabled
people pets being owned by people
something something about the UM the
probably is better if I was running down
which you were saying because I'm comes
out I kind of like [ __ ] lost weight
thought I'm like what I was going to say
but um anyway uh I'll slither into it
eventually Olli you know well you not me
but uh so basically the correlation are
making is that you're saying that these
you know immensely disabled people as
you know not really people but with the
whole animal thing yeah that that was
the point I was gonna make sorry don't
with the whole animal thing it's on a
completely different level you know
they're in when it comes to the abuse
the slaughter the manipulation the rape
the you know of them so when it comes to
a mentally disabled person I mean I
don't think anyone's disagreeing besides
maybe some extremist vegans that pet
ownership isn't necessarily a bad idea
and when it comes to you know immensely
disabled people having Guardian and
stuff like that um and pets
then there's somewhat similar in that
regard it correlates to
viens and enough themself or animals
with you know within them so wait so can
you summarize that statement again sorry
basically basically sync the correlation
between the mentally disabled analogy
you made well we don't consider them as
people
right um would still be the same way if
we just stopped eating me or if you went
vegan in the sense that you would still
have ownership over them and you would
still same sense of like a mentally
disabled person so basically I'm saying
that the animal abuse is on pretty much
a whole a whole nother level you know
yeah I mean we have like massive
organizational destruction of animal
life and whatnot if that's what you're
talking about we don't do that with
[ __ ] people and live life with
[ __ ] people way what you're saying
just a massive destruction of life with
[ __ ] yeah I'm saying that we do this
with animals but we don't do this with
people that have developmental delays or
whatever right or that are
developmentally delayed yeah yeah I mean
I don't disappear that way what is that
what does that's what is that supposed
to argue towards as you made the the the
analogy
see immensely disabled people as people
in the sense that they still have
ownership and guardianship over them and
stuff like that but even if you went
vegan and stopped the eating and the
slaughter in the rape etc of animals
then it would um that's in the same way
that does to mentally disabled people in
the sense that they still have the
guardians and they still well sure I
guess the difference is we don't know
but there's techni Milles are made all
in their own right nobody has to create
an animal for it to be made they make
themselves so technically they're the
ones that own themselves but um it's
this
with a mentally disabled person
especially when they're I mean at least
when they're an adult right yeah
what about it then I just don't see what
the point of you bringing that up was I
don't remember waiter can you wait so
you don't see what the point of me
bringing up then just said I'm I don't
even remember what the point I brought
up was we were talking about political
crap as vegan arguments are very
difficult because all of these like will
loop back to this like very weird
nihilistic property that I don't I don't
know if I can like argue my way out of
it or hear any arguments for or against
it it's like really [ __ ] weird
because you get into these weird things
of defining like what needs like rights
to live and what shouldn't have rights
to live and ultimately I don't believe
that there is any objective place that
any of these rights can come from so I
could all just like very weird and kind
of esoteric and so yeah I'm not sure
that the vegan arguments are like really
difficult for me yeah um when it comes
to the political correctness thing I
started that out in the beginning and it
kind of went in a direction that I
wasn't expecting and uh like I guess I
was just expecting you to take another
stance on it for some reason that I hate
it so I guess like certain words or
whatever are they more uptight social
justice warrior kind of oh yeah I'm
definitely not an sjw depending on which
content you've seen if you're a very
less leaning you really don't like me so
probably not yeah yeah yeah um yeah and
when it comes to the veganism thing I
just want to bring up uh I've never
actually heard you talk about this let's
so like what are your thoughts on like
if let's say like we stopped eating meat
and the agriculture like you know if
it's self and we just like let them all
go like do you think that'd be like a
good idea or no well I'm sorry I'm gonna
be taking here when you say good idea
what does what do you mean by good like
morally righteous or good for some other
cause
when it comes away from the moral thing
because there again kind of throw and
said but um more like scientifically and
agriculturally well I mean like these
are kind of scientific I don't know if
science can make a judgment on whether
or not it's good or bad to do a
particular thing I mean I'll try to
tease out I guess what you're asking if
you're talking about like in terms of
environmental impact agriculture animal
agriculture is incredibly destructive I
mean we it's I mean that's that's it I
mean animal agriculture is incredibly
destructive on the environment if you're
talking agriculturally we waste a [ __ ]
ton of food feeding animals I mean I
don't know what the actual math is but
I'm guessing it's probably like we have
to put in a hundred calories or some
crazy amount of calories just to get one
out of like a cow or something that we
slaughter it's probably more than that I
don't know what it is so I mean like in
terms of like land space use and total
amount of food produce like that's
really [ __ ] as well you saw I mean in
those ways it would be good as well
health-wise it would probably be better
to Everett for everybody to just consume
plant-based food over at least specially
like red meats and stuff so from a
health point of view it would probably
be superior as well so yeah guys sorry
Ron yeah nicely as you mentioned this
become a bit more like you fuse on why
you're not vegan because you've seen and
let me just clarify you seemed to like
agree with a lot of its principles it's
like some moral contingency with it
contingency consent you know that word
huge immunity you know whatever it is
you have some you don't necessarily
agree with some moral aspects of it but
you seem to agree with a lot of the
other aspects well yeah sure I mean
those are those aren't even are aspects
to debate the most of those what I just
said are pretty an arguable anything
like environmental impact and whatnot
yeah so when it comes to being able to
receive all of those benefits a
affordable diet price with plenty of
substitutes and and overall just a
healthier choice because I'll be honest
I was a very picky eater before I went
vegan and I I didn't even really see I'm
not the strongest you know what I mean
so necessarily difficult for me to go
vegan and I didn't see any necessary
necessarily struggle in going vegan and
I know I'm appealing to my own like
personal experience here Dee any problem
with you personally going vegan just for
your own satisfaction I feel like the
especially when the positives outweigh
the negatives well I mean I guess I just
enjoy eating meat is like and I don't
find a moral problem with it so that's
why I ate me yeah um but then again I
have to bring up the substitutions
aspect of it what do you mean like
substitution aspects like meat
substitutes they don't taste as good as
meat generally I mean I'm why I don't I
don't I don't really see it at least in
some aspects with some food my name's
Jimmy to me it tastes better in my
opinion than meat substitutes I mean I
don't know I've eaten veggie burgers
before and I just think of normal
burgers just taste better I guess um on
but I feel like you should be able to
like at least try to experiment a bit
more when it could with massive benefits
I mean sure I mean I mean I don't like I
mean I have experimented I try like
other foods I don't know what I mean
it's not like I exclusively eat like
steaks every single day yeah I know I'm
by experiment I mean strictly like
experiment more with a vegan diet within
itself unless you act like
whatever um I mean I guess I could
someday yeah it's just it's a lot of
work that I don't feel like putting in
right now and I don't see the need to do
it so I don't even disregarding the
whole moral statement on it well
disregarding the moral statement there's
not much else of a reason for me to care
like it's like just me I'm not consuming
me it isn't gonna make a dramatic
difference like an agriculture or meat
related stuff or anything so well I mean
you're in consequentially shortening
your lifespan by not going vegan and I'm
just saying there are plenty of benefits
besides the moral yeah but I'm probably
in consequentially shorting my lifespan
doing a lot of things I should probably
l sure I mean of course just advice I
guess I'm just kind of lazy or you I'd
say don't over the time but probably
more dishonesty honestly I would
consider myself a procrastinator and
very lazy within myself but I found it
very easy because even like it's not
it's not I think people make it a lot
harder than it needs to be no I think I
would have a pretty difficult time going
vegan and I would have to start like
I'm Miriam hunt bear now don't chase
animal the traps gay question is it's
just like like a bunch of people that
don't know anything about sexuality like
trying to talk about it it's just so
you're adding it's like it's not funny
it's not meaning it's just really stupid
and it's like a constant reminder of how
hopefully [ __ ] inadequate people are
for having any conversations evolved
around sexuality this is really
irritating does it come up over and over
again and the discussions it always
leads to it's like really [ __ ] stupid
it's like asking a roomful of like first
graders like what their opinion is about
like bisexuality like it's just totally
[ __ ] stupid like most of you're way
too [ __ ] [ __ ] to have the
conversation isn't it like shitposting
it's not shitposting most of you just
[ __ ] stupid I don't know why you
claim [ __ ] like the art of [ __ ] posting
or trolling means that you know the
opinion you have is [ __ ] [ __ ]
when you say stuff that you own
ironically believe or don't understand
and you know that it upsets people
because they see how [ __ ] [ __ ]
you are that's not trolling that's just
you being stupid and then people getting
upset because you're a [ __ ] [ __ ] is
it's not that's not trolling that's just
being stupid I don't know why that
counts is trolling the am i gay question
is perfectly valid for a teenager
explain we doesn't fully explore they're
quick it's it's a question that you ask
when you don't understand anything about
your sexuality or more likely especially
in today's norms you're incredibly
[ __ ] insecure about your sexuality
which for men is far more likely to be
the actual reason for asking a question
like if something like it for instance
like if somebody sets in that way I
think this guy's kind of attractive does
that make me gay lol like that's like
okay like you just I don't know talk
more about traps and talk about if
somebody asks or traps gay right there
90% of time the Jenkins's LOL [ __ ]
recycled [ __ ] memes i guess are
hilarious but usually like the
conversation is just really dumb because
you the way that we look at sexuality
isn't usually like you're not equipped
to answer the question like and it's
just dumb anyway like if you ever find
yourself wondering like a mic day you're
probably not even mature enough to ask
the question like it's a really stupid
[ __ ] question or you shouldn't even
know you have to ask yourself am i gay
like that's just a stupid thought to
have like
I don't know I like society's current
views or whatever like everything
related to sexuality is like hardcore
[ __ ] triggering it's just really
annoying because most people like their
thoughts on it are like them the
maturity level like a second grader
what's the alternative just
acknowledging that it's not something
that's binary sure that everything
exists on a spectrum and that's it like
if you see some dude and he's attractive
it's whatever if you [ __ ] with some guy
and it's fun and it's whatever it's just
not like this aight this idea you have
to like [ __ ] hardcore categorize
yourself into something like oh god like
i blue guy like am i [ __ ] gay now I
don't know like just [ __ ] Livia like
dude like if you want to get a boyfriend
get a boyfriend if you wanna get a
girlfriend get a girlfriend why he's so
hyper concerned like hyper fixated and
answering this question so you could put
yourself in a box cuz you can't possibly
exist like in this world where you're
not actually sure I don't know maybe I'm
gay me maybe I'm a man who the [ __ ]
cares like it shouldn't be that huge of
a deal to you there shouldn't be so much
of your so much of your like personality
you shouldn't be staked in this like
really arbitrary like pointless question
I'm like am i gay are my not gay he's
really I don't know I really think this
subject is worth the discussion okay
what do you want to discuss bro to be
fair gay people find comfortable and
confidence of being blah blah blah now
it's actually yeah that's why I don't
really give a [ __ ] that's fun that's how
you have to define your [ __ ] life cuz
you like nothing else and good for you I
guess I don't care if you're gay or not
this is why this is a big problem to
have like LGBTQ communities I notice
that they're like very hardcore and like
defining their [ __ ] character like
centered around like their sexual
identity sometimes but oppressed groups
need oppress cops need to be able to do
it in fact yeah and I don't know
whatever did yeah probably I don't know
it okay so I in a lot differently in
this respect I understand it yeah we go
to burn I don't understand all right I
mean I get it I understand other people
it's just a me versus other people think
I understand I love all be very much
okay sucking dick is gain nothing will
change that not necessarily
maybe you just suck a dick buy the [ __ ]
cut maybe you do doesn't mean you want
to date guys wherever that you want to
[ __ ] future guys I don't know maybe you
try it once I don't know I just who
carries do you think there's a
worthwhile conversation and talking
about sexuality and definitions probably
not because it cuz the thing is that
sexuality is going to lay like on a much
on it's gonna be a higher level topic
and what we have to actually talk about
it's gonna be something like very
fundamental and in talking about like
the higher level topic is worthless
without it's doing the fundamental thing
and the fundamental thing can vary
widely from person to person where some
people are gonna like join in Peter
stocks will actually go homosexuality
and straightness are found in nature and
we add hair to this binary and it is the
only way by which we can live our lives
or whatever like these people like
there's no talking to if that's your
view that like gay or straight or
whatever has to be like some rigid set
in stone definition and it's there's
nothing to really talk about with this
type of person right whereas if you're
somebody that agrees with me on a lot of
foundational issues you probably can
extrapolate out by sexual positions from
there so it's it's like it's like a
foundational thing it's kind of like
having a debate on abortion when the
debate is really like when is a person
considered a human right do you identify
as a straight male okay so here's okay
so here is my here's my foundational
thought okay and I'll tell you why both
of the why I would say no to both of
those words
here is my foundational thought when we
categorize things okay
typically when we categorize things
usually categorize things because
there's a power in doing so there
there's a value in doing so if I tell
you the difference between two
categories do you have an i5 or an i7
there's a power in that categorization
right such that um and i-5 typically has
four cores maybe two and i7 typically
has four cores or more and offers
hyper-threading right it's you and I
think sometimes they're bent higher I
don't know actually a bit higher right
there's a value in that categorization
oh do you have a samsung phone or you
have a Google phone right there's a
value in this categorization right so
when somebody asks like like in terms of
like
for questions of like is somebody
straight like I I just don't see the
value in like in even asking the
question or associating yourself in it
in that way if you only ever happen to
go through life and you're attracted to
people of the opposite sex or gender
whatever then that's just what happens
right but like defining yourself as
being straight or gay or bi is literally
saying there are groups of people that I
will never even consider or open myself
up to the opportunity of considering
that just seems like why would you do
that I don't understand why you would do
that right I would never like I would
never make this definitive seem like I
am straight right why would I say that
maybe at some point in my life I don't
know maybe there is a cutie-pie guy that
I would consider dating I don't know I
haven't met him yet maybe I never will
but like I just don't see the value in
like categorizing myself in such a way
it doesn't seem like there's any power
in doing that like I am gay I am
straight alright like these types of
categorization is just seem inadequate
when it comes to sexuality especially
because people change over time too
right
I've known people who were very straight
and then at some point in their life
they kind of just became a little bit
more gay they didn't really date people
of the opposite sex anymore or opposite
gender whatever the [ __ ] right or people
that used to be kind of gay and then
when they grew up you know now they
started dating more of the operator like
I don't know it just seems like a weird
way to box yourself in you know
would you give that answer to everyone
someone who asks you because they're
interested in you but that would never
be my like defining thing right
if a girl would've come with me like hey
I'm really interested in you would I be
like oh well I'm straight so you're in
luck what if it was a girl I wasn't
interested in what I say I'm gay
what if a guy came up to me and was like
trying I was like hey like I really want
to date you like we should date my
answer wouldn't be I'm gay or I'm sorry
my answer wouldn't be I'm straight or
I'm not interested in mind specific no
I'm not really interested right now
would be my answer it's not gonna be
like a categorical denial of the
person's like sexual sex or gender
whatever II would just be like I'm not
interested in dating you I don't know
like I don't I don't find the need to
have these categories in order to tell
somebody that you don't want to date
somebody right like oh well you know I
might date you but I'm straight man so
like I can't do it you know [ __ ] like we
perfect in every way but I'm straight
man I can't do it I'm sorry you know
like people use the terms cuz they're
familiar with the concepts not because
they expect rigidity no I think people
use the terms because I think most
people's understanding of sexuality is
incredibly [ __ ] naive I think that
most men are incredibly sexually what's
the word I'm looking for
sexually unconfident or lack of
confidence in their sexuality it's we're
all like the gaming's and should come
from super ultra [ __ ] cringe to
insecure yeah that's the what I was
looking for what do you a cave in
anything grabbed to be a trap I don't
know what the [ __ ] a trap is if Nathan
go to be transgender then sure I don't
care that's fine
hopefully we figure it out before he
goes through puberty the idea of the
word trap is really irritating too I
just don't like the concept of it and
there are transgender people that defend
it too or transgender people might
community to defend it and and I reject
that too I think if you're a transgender
person and you defend the concept of the
word trap I think you're equally [ __ ]
stupid as any straight or none or binary
whatever [ __ ] person defends it as
well I don't know it's [ __ ] ohms we
does not trigger look I've got a recon
in Lane okay
wouldn't think destiny would support the
100 genders thing I don't support a
hundred genders I just think that the
concept of gender is just probably
really inadequate to describe what we
are as people
Jenner just seems like a dumb notion to
me I don't know if you really think
about it it just seems kind of dumb but
what do you what information are you
again it's just like what kind of
information are you communicating with
calling somebody of male or female or or
maybe more specifically like a man or a
woman or a boy or girl it just doesn't
seem like the
because so much of our traits are
spectrum like how much information are
you communicating right like man are
sometimes taller than women they're
sometimes stronger than women women are
sometimes more emotional than men like
everything exists like hard cornice
pregnant doesn't seem like a very useful
way of categorizing people especially as
a binary maybe it'd be more useful to do
it with a hundred [ __ ] genders or
whatever I don't know it just seems
better to look at I don't know I just
don't I just don't see the value in it
but I mean it but some people can't
fathom a [ __ ] world without these
boxes so I mean if that's what your life
like my all means
like knock yourself out people are
religious to I don't know whatever makes
you feel better what are you supposed to
say because this is how it's always been
what do you you don't have to say
anything it's just this is like a they
people feel like we need this thing like
well how do i categorize somebody if I
don't have the words to like well why do
it you just is it maybe it's just not a
useful way of doing it
that's nice Kimber those boxes just
because most people's attraction falls
into the boxes their attraction falls
into the boxes because the box exists
right it's a circular thing right we
have concepts of genders and then those
concepts % perpetuate themselves ours is
how like all this is how society should
functions right you have an idea kind of
and then you reinforce that idea in
society and then somehow people are I
guess at some point people become
convinced that these ideas are intrinsic
I don't know they're fairly intrinsic
among all animals the only reason the
only reason especially humans because we
think we're special no it's because we
have like a society in a culture and
[ __ ] we're fairly special in those
regards unless you could show me other
animals that have built entire
civilizations does the animal culture
force the males to be attracted to the
females as well except we're attracted
to all sorts of things in society well
our attraction is it can be as much
environment as it is to [ __ ] anything
else how are you gonna sit here and
pretend that your attraction is 100 sent
by illogically wired if I show you a
pair of sexy panties right you're
probably you could get an erection from
it is that because you're hardwired to
find [ __ ] fabric like
I can't have this conversation with a
Normie [ __ ] I have to I need to focus
on the game because I'm gonna get
triggered talking to retards oh [ __ ]
we think we're above biology when we
aren't when we don't accept their
limitations it'll lead to bigger
problems
you're okay dude yeah you're right my
bad Barry I'm the god put Barry's carved
Molly my biology the death being pretty
energetic today there's just some topics
that I just I usually never talk about
us Jane because I know I got Harper
triggered about talking about him
destiny is saying they don't mean
anything which is patently untrue I mean
some dogs look like cats and vice versa
but we still consider them meaningful
the fact that you would use dogs and
cats as comparisons between the gender
constructs of male versus female I'm not
talking about having dicks or vaginas
but just in terms of what we consider
masculine or feminine like goes to show
the depths of your [ __ ] stupidity
about this topic like did you say I did
that's your go to [ __ ] example like
oh yes well in society when we consider
a man and when we consider a woman is as
different as what a cat and a dog is
biologically like can you explain an
evolution manage you got the right
individuals to have sex when we're
hardwired to be attracted to the
opposite sex
the problem is that evolution is the
problems at your biology and your
environment are inexorably linked to one
another ok this hard core idea that you
are like some genetic machine that is
impervious to environmental influences
is such an insanely naive analysis of
how your behavior works complex traits
and things like sexuality are can be
somewhat genetically defined but there's
like a huge feedback with with your
environment as well like these things
are not like these things are not like
the complex traits are not like rigidly
[ __ ] assigned to you at Birth like
that your environment very much place
like a like like a feedback with your
genes
can I please focus on the game are there
any good studies through it on topic
yeah there's a really good Stanford bio
series about behavioral Bob like
behavioral biology or whatever okay
introduction to human behavior some [ __ ]
I don't remember with the fact with the
Sapolsky lectures I don't know what the
[ __ ] they're called biology dictates
that we are attracted to someone of the
opposite sex and only that one person we
have one person for gauging in the
biological process of marriage Wow good
job buddy nice [ __ ] name dude
eight-plus [ __ ] name there's an
interesting procreation driving
partner selection listen okay sexuality
okay is a very complicated thing all
right you do not have a single gene that
codes for your sexuality okay there is
not one gene okay
there is not a single transcription
factor there's not one thing that you
can point to that says ah yes this is
the gay gene okay it is the complex
interaction of many genes okay that are
also complex ly affected by your
environment okay
so if you might have if you wanna have a
conversation about gender or sexuality
you can't go
Ellucian many girls get in it did you
conjure up this worldview so that it's
maximally compatible with your s kW
virtue signaling I don't revert you
signal [ __ ] dog you literally in here a
[ __ ] no-name chatting up how
important your point of view is to me in
my chat room what you were doing right
now is the definition of virtue
signaling okay I could give a [ __ ] less
about virtue signaling okay don't you
think people would consider these
complex interactions to also be
biological no nothing is just biological
that's the thing there is nothing that
is just biological okay we can use the
panty example earlier if I show you a
pair of panties okay and I ask you tell
me is your attraction to this biological
or environmental how can you answer that
question right how could you possibly
answer that question if somebody is
holding a hose over a bucket and another
person turns on the water who's
responsible for filling the bucket
these things are inexorably linked to
one another there is not it's not an
either/or okay these things both
contribute meaningfully fit to your
final conclusion and it is impossible to
say whether or not like it's one or the
other why you were attracted to two
underwear right well because you know
sexually we're attracted to women okay
but you've been conditioned to be
attracted to the underwear because
certain people wear them right and
there's tons we could find a plethora of
examples of this why you attracted to
people with long hair or short hair if
you're a guy right women aren't
hey guys this is kind of a long overdue
video / audio thing where I'm basically
just gonna be talking about a lot of
stuff that's going on recently
especially related to our political
content in this video or audio thing I
should say I'm gonna be talking about
the Twitter related stuff my stance on
deep platforming and then kind of our
past and future political content in the
direction that I want to take my stream
slash YouTube related to all of that the
first thing that I want to talk about
and I mentioned this a lot in the past
it has to do with my reason for why I do
the debate thing why I ever started you
know why I've carried on with it for so
long
I'm stated this a few times but I just
want to have it very clearly stated
right here at the beginning my goal with
debates has to do with helping people to
form logical arguments and when I say
logical arguments there are two parts to
that I want people's arguments to be
sound that means that the premises are
based in reality
you have some very real empirical
backing to whatever your premise is and
then I want the arguments to be valid
that means that when all of your
premises are taken together the
conclusion logically follows this has
been my only goal with my debates some
people seem to think that I have a
political agenda I don't and we'll talk
more about that later I believe it's
pretty easily evidenced by my rhetoric
and some people think that it's an ego
thing and it partially as I mean I
enjoyed being correct in conversations
some people think that I'm trying to
drive more people towards different
types of policy positions or to the
Democrat Party or it to be sjw's or to
virtue signal or anything I don't know
there's a lot of different claims that
are made for why I do what I do but my
whole guiding principle is generally
that thing that I just mentioned that I
want people to form valid and sound
arguments that's always been the central
guiding principle to everything that I
do so in looking at that I have to ask
over the past
I guess we'll say two years of political
content have we achieved this goal in
any measurable way personally I think I
have no I'm a little bit biased when it
comes to that but I'm only going by
the large number of emails that I've
gotten from people that say that um you
know they were drifting in one direction
they were falling down the hall of the
anti sjw youtubers that they were
heading down this path of you know
constantly listening to sargon of akkad
and then more extremists people and they
listened to some of my videos and you
know they don't necessarily agree with
everything I say but they can at least
respect what I'm saying and they can at
least respect my thought process which
is the most important part to me and it
seems like in reading through a lot of
that and I've gotten hundreds of emails
and seen hundreds of posts while not
hundreds of posts but I seen dozens of
posts across my subreddit now hundreds
of posts if you include stuff on YouTube
and whatnot like I've seen a lot of
people that were brought over on the
fence I consider this to be my major
success and I've kind of spoken about
this in the past where I say I live by
the I call it the 40-40-20 or maybe I
should call the 40/20/40 troll but
basically in any given conversation 40%
of both sides are super invested in
their position such that if I debates
are gone forty percent of the people
listening will always say I won forty
percent will always say Sargon won but
I'm always gunning for the twenty
percent in the middle the people on the
fence that are listening for I guess the
most reasonable thought process that's I
think I'm giving too much credit to
people there but that's um and my views
on people have become so cynical over
the past couple of years I don't know if
it's healthy or not but um that's that's
my hope right is that they're these
twenty percent who were not super
invested in either position that can
listen to the positions of me in the
person I'm debating and then hopefully
see that okay well you know Stevens
arguments are more reasonable it seems
like he's willing to you know in you
know route his arguments and in
empirical data his thought process makes
sense and I might not even necessarily
agree with what he's saying but at least
it seems like he's got a good
comprehensive view all the way from the
empirical data all the way up to the
philosophical assertions that everything
seems to be pretty well put together and
I can respect that you know
that's it's my hope and I think I've
done an okay job at at doing that now
with that being said
there are more effective ways to do
these debates depending upon what my
goal is and I'm gonna speak a little bit
to the idea that I have some political
agenda and I really don't and the reason
why I guess the reason why people think
this is because they disagree with me
politically I can't think of another
reason to do it but basically one of the
big things that I've discovered in the
course of doing all these debates is
that nobody really cares at least on the
right and I see that but it's true of
the left sometimes as well but right now
especially of the right nobody really
cares about fact-based arguments nobody
really cares about valid or soundness in
an argument nobody cares about empirical
data it really all comes down to what
type of narrative or what type of
emotional response can can you get out
of somebody right what type of narrative
can you root an argument and what type
of emotional response can you get out of
somebody you know if I sit here and I
tell you a million reasons why
immigration is good for the United
States somebody like when tez or
somebody have white nationalist Quinta's
or somebody like James alsa only has to
respond with well look at these two
stories were an illegal immigrant
murdered somebody and your entire
argument is destroyed insofar as they
and their fans and a lot of people in
the middle are concerned a lot of it
just comes down to pushing a narrative
and this is honestly the best way to
sell a political message right if you
want to bring people over to your side
politically you can do it by selling a
political narrative such that whatever
message you're trying to sell to
somebody is rooted in that story you
know immigration is really bad well why
is immigration bad well I know a guy
Uncle Joe the Plumber right when we were
talking bout taxes in 2008 with Obama
right but like I know a guy Joe who he
lost his job because of immigrants or I
know a woman you know Sally who she was
killed by an illegal immigrant or you
know look at this say this or this it's
never like well let's talk about the
numbers let's talk about the data you
know do Hispanics or immigrants in
general commit as much crime as the
native population the answer is no do do
immigrants help the economy the answer
is unequivocally yes no economist
debates this you know maybe you can have
some
about the marginal fiscal impact and
even that comes out to be either a wash
or slightly negative but um you know I
did grass like all of these arguments
become when you when you're fighting for
politics when you don't really care
about the argument itself and you're
just trying to push a political
narrative as most people are your your
rhetoric usually resembles that of
somebody trying to sell stories to
people which is the most effective way
of pushing somebody in in a political
direction that you think is good I have
no desire to do this I've never had a
desire to do this maybe in the future I
will but right now I just don't care
about this I don't care about politics
in the sense that I want to sell a
political message to somebody it's not
the way that I personally function and I
understand that I'm somewhat unique
there I'm a little bit sociopathic I
guess in the way that I approach these
issues and I'm okay accepting that I'll
be a massive outlier there but I just
have no desire to dedicate a large
amount of my time in trying to craft
these narratives to send to
somebody in order to bring them over to
my position I to go back to the
beginning I'm only interested in telling
you these are valid or I'm sorry these
are sound premises and this is a valid
way to put them together to generate a
conclusion that makes sense that's the
only thing I have ever been concerned
with maybe that changes in the future
but as of right now as of my media in
the immediate future for my political
stuff it's still the only thing I'm
concerned with looking back on my
looking back on all the conversations I
tried try to take stock every now and
then to say like well what are
successful debates that I've had so far
and when I think of success I can only
measure it against my my goal right what
is success except your ability to
achieve a stated goal and so if my goal
is constructing sound and valid
arguments that that lead to good
conclusions honestly I've only had like
two or three good debates where I've
really gotten to hash everything out
ironically enough my debate with amo see
the guy who was in favor of removing the
age of consent that debate was
incredibly
we went through a little bit of
empirical data we hardcore nailed out
philosophical positions I felt very good
about the position that I was able to
state in that conversation and almost
seemed to be receptive to the arguments
that I was making you know there were no
ad homonyms there were no crazy personal
attacks I don't think he ever called me
a Lenny had stupid stuff and then
my debate with a vegan gains I'd heard a
lot of stuff about him about how he's a
crazy sociopath crazy murderous dude and
I've heard some videos where he's pretty
extreme like I think the the one where
he talks about going to what like the
funeral of his grandfather or something
how he didn't care because yeah I don't
know I don't wanna miss data but um he
was very intelligent and the way that he
constructed an argument was very
intelligent I loved these two
conversations because I got to construct
what I consider to be a sound and valid
argument my adversary had a sound and
valid argument and then we got to clash
and reconcile the differences between
these two things this is what I enjoy
doing
I love these types of discussions both
people are receptive to the points
raised by the other person
both people seem to have some sort of
understanding of empirical data both
people seem to have some sort of
understanding of how to put together
rational or logical arguments this is
something that almost never happens in
any of my conversations and it's what I
want to do the most
the two things I excel at I think are
doing these types of arguments and
making fun of people the latter
bread by decades of online experience
and then the former is something that
I've kind of cultivated throughout my
life but especially harnessed or I guess
especially worked on over the past like
a year of a year or two of my internet
conversations I've had so many
conversations with people that I
consider and I'm going to risk sounding
very arrogant here but people that are
so many levels of intelligence beneath
the topics they're discussing that it
hurts me to even reflect on these
conversations and we could name off a
million examples dick Masterson comes on
and says that I debate disingenuously
and I ask
for a single example and over the course
of an hour the only one he can think of
had to do with had to do with the the
American Lawyer that Trump didn't want
sitting on his Trump University case
because the guy had parents that were
from Mexico and they couldn't think of
any of the details of this case he
didn't know anything you know even even
a woodysgamertag and remember his actual
name on the pKa podcast they roasted him
over how totally stupid he was in the
conversation
no saying that black people get
arrested more by the cops because they
drive around with guns hanging out of
their pockets
you know sargon of akkad saying that if
black people just get married it will
solve all of their problems you know not
understanding cause and effect not
understanding correlation versus
causation not understanding that even if
married black people are more successful
than single black people that doesn't
mean that getting married will make you
more successful right yeah my argument
with with Ian when I asked him to bring
up any topic that he thought I was
misinformed about he chose a topic that
he wrote a story on and was uttering
stupid statement after stupid statement
like it had to do with the California
reducing the transmitting HIV to
somebody as a misdemeanor instead of a
felony and an en was uttering statements
like well this means that now all the
blood donated to the blood banks are
gonna have to be tested you know like
they weren't already doing that yeah and
he chose the topic he wrote an article
is and there's I mean there's a million
more examples I'm sure you guys can you
know tanka you know I don't have a Benz
I ever miss a day I don't know man
there's a million of these topics where
the people have the in the in the gun
I'm sorry I could do this forever in the
gun debate with with a guy I don't
remember the bald-headed dude who's
trying to bring up the idea that um he
brought up that after the gun ban in
Australia that homicides had remained
stagnant that there was no impact on
crime and I had to go through with him
and I had to say okay well we can't use
absolute numbers here and he oughta
ronica Lee says to me oh so you want to
make the per capita argument and it's
like well yeah I mean these are the only
figures that matter why would you use an
absolute value in crime and then Jack
suppose that with a with a rising
population yes I mean of course we're
gonna talk about per capita
um I don't know if I use Jax to post
incorrectly there but you you know what
I mean like I can't I can't keep
thinking about these things because I
can think of a million and like these
aren't the problem I have here is it's
not a disagreement over empirical data
it's not a disagreement so for instance
with vegan gains right where I might
disagree with a with a normative with a
philosophical claim that he makes these
are just disagreements in how do we
interpret data how do we understand you
know what is true what do our numbers
tell us these are things that I would
expect these people to learn in high
school and they either didn't learn it
or they are intentionally ignoring it to
push a narrative and in either case it's
just not enjoyable to talk to these
people they just have no idea what
they're talking about
on one hand I yeah I just I feel like
engaging with them as a waste of time
I know I've brought some people over
from the middle which is good but these
people are like the leading voices on
YouTube and it blows my mind that I
guess it doesn't blow my mind anymore
though
Lauren Southern when I argue with her
about how you know like hey going to
going to Sweden and filming for three
days doesn't give you a comprehensive
look at the country that's not how good
data is collected and she says okay well
what would you call it's like well these
are just anecdotes you know these are
just one or two ops like you have to do
you have to be very rigorous and how you
claim she's well the plural of anecdote
is data it's like no that's not how that
works at all that's that's not true
that's the opposite of true man it's
just these types of conversations they
aren't very fulfilling for me I enjoy it
because of the second thing I brought up
that that I I do enjoy kind of like
making fun of people and needling people
it's always been an enjoyable thing for
me probably just because of my
background on the Internet but for
reasons that we'll start to get into I
don't think I can really engage in this
type of debate anymore I think I can't I
actually can't do it but before we get
into that specifically I guess I just
want to I want to reiterate that my goal
for these debates was to just like do
debates about you know forming arguments
and saying
who had the better argument I don't want
to do blood sports or this like Internet
MMA I think is Jacques jf whatever calls
it you know I don't want to do this type
of like scream match stuff you know in
small doses it's funny but when that's
all it is I mean that's I have I have
more to offer than that I'm worth more
than that you know I can assemble a
decent amount of data and put together
arguments and then deliver it in a
pretty convincing fashion there's the
stuff that I enjoy doing I also enjoy
walking into one on five calls and
shooting on people but that's not all I
enjoy doing that's not all I want to be
restricted doing for the rest of my time
on the Internet so ya know I enjoy doing
that but again as we'll talk about in a
little bit I I'm just not able to do
this anymore I don't think so
hopping into this next section I do not
think I can reasonably engage with these
communities anymore because there's like
significant risk now to not only my
livelihood but potentially like my
personal life one of the things that I'd
always said in the past and one other I
say one of the reasons I encourage
people to debate these people I I'm
slightly I don't like to say this
because it sounds really edgy
but I think I'm slightly sociopathic in
the way that I relate to people who
don't relate to people and the way that
I deal with people know this has some
repercussions in my personal life I
don't really have any close friends I
don't really do relationships very well
and that's just a thing but for my
online stuff it's been an amazing asset
I can deal with an unlimited amount of
personal abuse and it doesn't really
bother me after the jontron debate would
after the twitchplayspokemon if anybody
remembers out I've got tons of people
that you know will send me red @dm to
email me about wanting to rape and
murder my kid or about how much of a
worthless I am or I posted go up on
Kiwi farms or poll about how I'm a
 with a small dick that rapes
children order I don't know just a ton
of like really horrible and
you know I because I think it's a
combination of being very narcissistic
and being somewhat sociopathic I usually
don't care I don't
I don't know any lease people I don't
really care what their opinions are I'm
probably more accomplished and more
successful than 99.999% of the people
that make fun of me they really I just I
have no respect for the opinions of most
of these people and as a result of that
it doesn't bother me and this has been
an amazing asset for what I do online
maybe the most important asset for what
I do online a lot of people don't
realize this but very public facing
oh these guys have been telling me all
day guys white schmekel shut the [ __ ] up

do you have my name you have my wrist do
you know remember remember when taco was
trying to say that those pictures
forever in his 20s that interview was
dated for 2013 how funny is that but
maybe you got real big and like just
like the past couple years I don't know
maybe do you think the picture of me and
the blue three years old it's about
three years old on the picture of me and
enhance they never use a picture from
ten years ago
no not generally no they don't
about creating an athlete though so it's
possible that they didn't at that time
is about three if they interview Tyson
right now how they're gonna just use
pictures of Tyson right now they're not
gonna use ones from ten years ago but it
might be different for you there might
be a big probably doable yeah used are
we gonna scoop until I'm first
performers I'm gonna use are it's like
pretty old yeah they would use [ __ ]
pictures of Mike Tyson from this past
alright shakka though you're muted again
and also that was when was that he said
2013 so how many years ago would it be
at that point just a few 2013 I don't
know like three or four years ago okay
so how all right hey hey when they talk
about you they never bring up pictures
from your past I don't know I'm not an
athlete or a circus performer so I might
know a more forward don't go don't you
complain that people bring up things
from [ __ ] five years ago no of course
that I love it dude I love talking about
my past that's all we do here it's what
you guys been doing for like the past 12
hours right it's great no that's weird
cuz every time I get linked to this
strain which is like you guys been
talking about me non-stop we weren't
even talking about you when you came in
and said we were talking about you you
[ __ ] around with the OBS layout oh
well hey if you guys need any help I've
been a pro streamer for the past eight
years we about give you some pointers
you've impressed a lot of 14-year olds
thanks talk I try I made more than your
entire eSports I seriously doubt that
taco trucks no we went ahead and show
everybody your winnings for me sports
competitor Tonka I miss are you were
though no you were crowd stream record
dollars Tonka the difference is if you
go sir can you look at what I've done
I don't have four people in the audience
to a Kumar probably my parents watching
you go ahead in the way where we can see
his winnings just so that we know that
yesterday on the kumite I made more than
he made in his entire alleged eSports
career
it's Adorno whoa what the what the [ __ ]
are you eSports Todd control King
Starcraft
I don't do eSports Tonka trucks I make
my children in your gaming oh one second
Tonka did meet you again Steve you gotta
unmute could you tell him to trigger to
muting me because he just wants to sit
here and tell like what we ate too much
Steve Tonka please chill I know you're
getting really triggered how much money
of you me probably a thousand bucks I
don't know that we can show it we have
the we have to fight oh I know I was
never again Jesus [ __ ] all right if he
made some again emerson tag off which is
cool that's what you wanna do i can
leave
I made a Tonka I know I know that I've
upset you a lot my dude I hope you get
over to you later sir eagle I'll see you
they know that I know that I really get
you Tonka I'm glad I see you down the
line should we go you're the first guy
you're the first I never really pissed
off Tonka I'll see you down fun buddy
okay I had fun [ __ ] his family got ducks
that's a pretty shitty individual [ __ ]
about that goofy little [ __ ]
he wants the pertaining matters let him
but now I can that's why he's over in
this dream and nobody's ever over in his
streams that are over the age of [ __ ]
16
good thing he qualified that there
because I have like three five times as
many viewers the adults 200 [ __ ]
viewers
I'll be right back cancer yikes
Samar's isn't trash of course have you
noticed any butts yet yeah yeah I just
haven't post them yet I've been a little
distracted with all this nonsense about
destiny
I wanted to say that I've seen destiny
and many debates with like Sargon all
that stuff for healing he doesn't
usually go full I'm weird just say it
right now he doesn't go full [ __ ]
until after he's been like trying the
upset or at least so this is hidden came
full on wouldn't let people talk kept
talk to little for people and sets about
with nonsense well yeah he probably
knows that this is what happens when
somebody who's about two feet tall walks
up on somebody going to feet tall and
they wanna pretend they got something I
think ace that he may be aware that he
[ __ ] up big time and he accidentally
said his intent of what he was doing and
he keeps accidentally talking too much
and he [ __ ] it up over lots of money
out from under the little [ __ ] you think
I'm pretty sure best thing is still
listening you still with that not just
asking John was still here
no I think then oh yeah it doesn't still
in the chat I misspoke come on Michael
doesn't like people time and everybody
out don't do it yeah that he probably
doesn't like people daxing people either
whoa
oh he's sent a raid oh is that what's
going on here have a field day on those
boys I just want to know what the answer
is and what part of I misspoke no
chambers chambers
hey chambers you dumbass this is the
time you actually use your wrench
one person is doing their French you
[ __ ] [ __ ] oh this is gonna be fun to
watch so destiny do you you don't send
your you're not streaming this with OBS
or anything and can't do and this isn't
being added so if you send the link out
to let's say one of your your buddies
and hang out when you send them off
somewhere and get someone to come in
here and try to get the stream take it
down similar to what you'll be did it's
not trying to take a stream down damn I
just want to know the dreams to Mercedes
in a Benz okay 150 mm sock David I'm
[ __ ] can't be back again Oh get me
Beckett he lied about his height
oh no but I know anything more about
this person okay that's not what we I
got one more question you want a bad
thing that someone sprayed your dog's
person yes or no talk I got a question
for you buddy it for me or for Tonka I
wanted to ask him about something a lie
that he told I want to ask about a lie
yes sir yeah um you're looking at the
Chinese thought Chinese room a cloud
experiment yep oh you say so first off I
think that's a bad thought experiment I
think it's flawed that wasn't the idea I
was trying to give - okay what's the
idea you trying to get to me well first
uh um let's talk about why the Chinese
thought experiment I think fails so the
way I see it is um so basically the guys
in the Chinese uh the room and you know
he gets the message and then he
translates into Chinese and it goes on
there on the screen and people see it
correct
do you agree um I think so yeah it
sounded like he was saying you could ask
him questions but I could be wrong on
that it's just a translation you you can
ask them questions but he has an answer
to all the questions in this book like
yup in the book put it in and go up
gotcha okay so then the question is well
does that guy really know Chinese or see
just looking at okay and I would argue
that if that process is internalized it
would be the exact same thing that when
you ask a human a question that they
internally referred to things that
they've memorized or whatever knowingly
or unknowingly and then they spread out
an answer the difference is that the
whole process is internalized rather
than speaking about things like
discreetly I guess like in the Chinese
room thing yeah yeah I I agree with that
like I think the the guy in the machine
anyway knows Chinese because it imagined
this so like you know how our brains
like I mean I'm not under all like a
neuroscience but we have like you know
neurons firing in our brain all the time
but yeah so that would be like saying
like you know oh I can speak English but
do my neurons know English do they
really know English or they just sending
singles to me with what to say yeah okay
right so I mean if my I mean if you
imagine the little the guy in the room
like your neuron it would be absurd to
say oh no you don't really know Chinese
well then that's like saying you you're
yourself don't know English like you
were saying yes because it's your
neurons doing it yes I agree with you on
that point okay so now my issue with the
CPM is I think there's a first we need
to like agree with like the definitions
of what a computer is okay so to me I
think a computer is
something that manipulates syntax then
spits out cement
okay what do you mean by spits out
semantics they're so like you know so
the syntax is like all ones and zeros
and let's say like him this exact code
of ones and zeroes pushes up my discord
page okay
all right do you agree that yeah I
thought semantics spoke to more like an
internal like understanding of something
so for instance the the syntax of water
like in English as wate R but the
semantics of water is like the
experience of water that when I think of
water like everything I'm thinking abut
that would be the semantic part I
thought that I think I'm told softly I
think it's more it's the water yeah that
one that said yeah well yeah yeah but in
when we talk to people we talk about our
water right you're saying there it's
like I can imagine like if I drained um
water is pouring all over me
I won't say that was cement and like I
felt like in the dream water was pouring
on the oh and say oh that was semantics
right I'd say that's just my head wait
what well are you saying that it's just
a feeling
wait I thought syntax refers to specific
symbols that have no oh oh yeah no but
I'm just trying to draw a distinction
emergency I thought syntax just refers
to like a specific ordering of symbols
and whatnot that don't have any
intrinsic meaning behind them so like
John drank water like that could be a
syntax but it doesn't necessarily mean
anything but then the semantics of it
would be john is a human being that i
know drinking is the act of taking
something into the body and then water
is the substance and etham air that I
really like the semantics part of it
that's the difference here the syntax on
the semantics and the argument with the
Chinese thing is that computers can't
understand the syntax without ever
knowing the semantics right
yeah no syntax in the computer and it
comes up with the semantics right I'd
okay wait hold on
mm-hm what are you saying correct cuz
one of us has a big misunderstanding of
us in it but it might be me compute
Computers can't ever come up with
semantics right semantics are something
that would exist between people or
that's what we were arguing right that
things are what have semantics but the
commuters and deaf computers never have
Szymanski but you're saying that
computers are conscious no what I'm
saying is I don't know if I believe that
semantics necessarily exist that that
everything is syntax but they as you
appeal more and more and more syntax on
to each other that semantics becomes
sort of like an emergent thing of a
bunch of interacting syntax or whatever
I think you're saying yeah I just want
to make sure like we're on the same page
so we're not arguing for the same thing
and then the whole time we're confused
yeah so what's your theory of
consciousness like like what are you
trying to argue for okay so the before I
read that article my theory is that Myra
my idea I hated saying anything I have
as a theory but my idea is that
consciousness is literally just a place
that exists that exists to wait
decisions that's that's everything that
conscious is for like a human being so
like when we were trying to make
decisions the process of deciding
between multiple things or whatever
that's the experience of consciousness
that's what I would argue or what I
would it feels right to me um yeah I
mean kind of for me conscious I mean
like I get like you said it's hard to
define consciousness but the the common
view in philosophy is that they have
mental states right like I have a belief
that's the mental state me feeling pain
that's a mental state like if I if I'm
on fire I'm in a mental state of pain or
my belief that I'm talking to you right
now is a mental state because I'm
experiencing that okay right like you
would agree like Siri could not have a
belief like Siri doesn't believe
anything um no I well I don't know if
it's sufficiently complicated enough to
but I believe that machines could have
beliefs sure in what sense do you think
we could hold their own beliefs sure so
let's say that I give a computer the
ability to let's say we work with a few
to sensory inputs okay the sense of
temperature so the ability to perceive
temperature and then sight the ability
to see things so let's say that I give
this computer an absurd amount of
programming to make it understand what
fire is okay that fire is something that
you know we all the physical definitions
you know when something is come by
bullying burns and all that [ __ ] that
that fire is very hot that if you touch
it you will and increase the temperature
you know it glows typically it emits
light that I could do this right I could
put this this thing that I've programmed
I could put it in a room and then on the
other side of the door oh and and and
maybe I could give it sound as well the
ability to perceive sound so hearing I
could put this thing in a room light a
fire on the other side of the door and
then the computer could walk up to this
door touch the handle feel that the
handle is fought feel that the handle is
hot see the light coming from beneath
the door and then hear the crackle on
the other room and then without ever
knowing it it could believe that there's
a fire on the other side of the door
does this qualify as being a belief in
your book or is it something different
yes saying that the the computer even
though it's incorrect would believe
there's a fire yeah well it's not
necessarily incorrect but it could be
incorrect sure but that yeah yeah so um
now what I would say that that then is
well you just programmed the computer
that way it's just programmed to do that
when it sure experience but then I was I
would ask you what the difference is
between a human because humans don't
have any intrinsic knowledge of fire we
have we would train humans the same way
you have to perceive fire existing as
you perceive fire oftentimes you have to
interact with it to know that it's hot
this is why children touch stoves or
touch candles and they're stupid once
you have that sensory perception then
you begin to extrapolate right if you
ever see or hear something that's
crackling and very hot like I feel like
humans learn about it the exact same way
the machine would kind of not what's
this so like for me like it again it's a
really complex issue and I'm not coming
on you're saying oh I have all the
answers all my answers are from like
philosophers who thought of this stuff
way better than me sure so but I would
then I would ask like from the
philosophical point of view what would
be the difference between a human has a
famous book called what it is like to be
a bat is a hard problem of consciousness
I acknowledge that this is a thing but
but I'm well but I'm carries on the
specific thing or a saccharide finish oh
yeah
the idea that there is something like to
be a computer like how would a computer
think other than just spitting out the
semantics when it's manipulating syntax
sure but we've moved but but you could
apply this type of humans it would fail
equally well what for instance what is
it like to have a vaginal Oregon
I'm making an assumption based on the on
the timbre of your voice but I don't
think you're a female I don't think you
have a vagina you could never know the
answer to that question are women
conscious yeah I think so but why why do
I think so I think that um consciousness
probably comes from something biological
habit had it but now we're like in play
but why why do I think that I'm sorry
before going off into this all I'm
saying is that like I just I pointed out
a perception that you will never be able
to experience you have no idea or like
what is it like to birth a child or to
be pregnant right these are sensory
things that you can never perceive you
will never be able to perceive these and
even more generally we could speak to
general senses for instance if I were to
ask you what does the color red look
like you cannot describe that to me or
rather what you know what does a note of
music sound like you could never give me
a description of these things you just
assume that other people interpret it
the same way that you do but you can't
really know so I could argue that that a
machine could be the exact same way the
machine could perceive these things and
have a conscious where it weighs these
kinds of things but just because it's a
machine I don't know do you understand
I'm going or no I it's like it's almost
humanistic of me to think that oh well
it doesn't have like my kind of body
parts or like you know species then of
course it can do that so what I would
say the you then so would you then be
are you trying to say then that if like
a computer passed the Turing test it
could then think what I'm saying is that
our way of understanding consciousness
from other people is always and will
likely all I shouldn't have but is has
always been and for the foreseeable
future will be done in an external sense
that if somebody were to create a human
and then create a computer program and
both of them could give me the exact
same outputs as one another I would have
no basis of which to say one is
conscious and one isn't there's no way
that kind of a functionalist sure well
the functionalist sounds like it goes
hand in hand with that computational
theory of mind okay imagine there is um
have you heard of this super-stoked
problem
so the super stoic is imagine a guy he
is just stoic he shows no emotion shows
no pain shows nothing is just like a
strong guy and if our best knowledge of
what's conscious is how they kind of
function in certain things and how they
learn if I am let a super stoic on fire
and he just sat there he's in flinch he
just sat there on fire
would you say that he's in pain um no
really I disagree I think you'd be in
pain well but so this is it so [ __ ] okay
so I'm not trying to catch you on a
technicality here but I could actually
prove you wrong with medical science
there are people that are actually born
with the inability to perceive pain it's
a really [ __ ] up disorder because he's
super technical but like no let's say
for sake of argument though that he was
just a super stoic sure I'm sure but I
can never truly know I can't say if he's
if he feels pain or not it's impossible
for me to know that I can make an
assumption but yeah but this is like um
I mean like we could even argue about
degrees of pain like I don't know if we
could even agree that we perceive pain
in the same way right for instance there
are some people that um you know can get
a shot and don't care if they could get
rabies shots and aren't even that
bothered by it right which are which are
horrible and there are other people who
get a shot and it's like excruciating
for them like even adults that kind of
cry when when they get shot now can you
argue that one person is more stoic than
the other or can you argue that one
person doesn't perceive the pain as much
as the other person how could you
possibly know that as an external
observer there's no way we could know
for sure but I mean it does come to a
place where your intuitions take you I
mean and I usually don't form arguments
on intuition and how you feel both
something like so mysterious and complex
is consciousness like you're okay what
people say in that correct that it's
mysterious that it's what like like
sometimes were to look to our intuitions
to see what consciousness it no I hate I
hate all arguments of enjoy your night
yeah
for it took philosophy of mind I was not
like you know intuitions screw that but
it's so hard to prove anything's
conscious like then how did like I'd say
to you how do you know I'm conscious
then if you can't prove it I can't
possibly know that that was what I was
screaming at you and I was just I know
you don't believe anyone's conscious but
yourself that I mean I can make
arguments I can kind of inductively
reason based on our similarities that
you're conscious but that's not a that's
not a full proof that's not a deductive
analysis I can't make factual claims
like maybe this sounds a little
scientifically anti-realist I don't know
this equalities that but like I I can
assume that you're conscious because you
and me share many similarities but that
doesn't but I can't really truly say and
and I and I wouldn't even be comfortable
making statements that like we perceive
things the same either like I that would
be something that there's allies ever
like why do some people like some music
and not like other music I don't know if
we all perceive music the same as well
you know like that's something that's
impossible to say mm-hmm so yeah you so
I agree what you're saying and good if
you said to me right now that you know
uh I only think I'm conscious I don't
think we could have had this
conversation because it'd be ridiculous
right um so then like where does the
line go for you then when you start
saying that's conscious and that's not
I'm just trying to feel out what were
you're coming from so like I don't even
know what conscious means so this is
like my working
I have no engaged zero engagement with
any literature here okay so I'm totally
[ __ ] beyond blaming here okay so my
what I feel like people so I feel like
what we think is conscious is determined
in an intuitive sense I think that we
intuitively feel it out we don't
rationally think about it so what I
perceive to be as conscious is
oftentimes indecision or or time taken
to make decisions and then emotional
responses to things so for instance um
so let me let me think of an example the
first thing typically one thing that I
think quote unquote
feels conscious is when people take time
to make decisions so when I ask you a
question that pause between thinking of
the answer is something that I interpret
is conscious like it sounds like there's
some kind of type of internal thing
going on to extrapolate this to like the
machine world
if our graphing calculators if you could
add a smiley face or a frowny face or
something to like a ti-84 or ti-85 right
and then when you push the problem if
you're like calculating like complicated
like like radials or some sugar or
integrals on armor of you doesn't say 85
I'm not right that if they were to have
like a little face that like put like a
thinking face or something that
intuitively is a human because it's
taking time to think of that answer I
think that you would interpret that in
an intuitive sense as being somewhat
conscious now you would obviously say no
because it's a machine hahahaha but you
would be more likely to empathize with
it in terms of like a conscientious
thing do you agree with that or disagree
with that
yeah I agree that I would definitely
emphasize like I mean it's like um if I
had a robot that like you're yourself
called zombies right I don't but people
keep bringing it up
oh so philosophical zombie is just the
idea that it's possible that there could
be humans like us they function in the
same way they are identical every single
point except there's no consciousness oh
I see yes I understand yeah I see it
yeah there's nothing behind there right
there's nothing like to be philosophical
zombie Tyler there's something like to
be philosophical zombie Steve yeah
you've ever Steven or Steve I don't care
either one is Steven actually okay yeah
so that would be a philosophical zombie
oh do you think those things couldn't
exist or it could exist yeah I would I
would have to say it could exist for
sure cuz it's cuz it's yeah so then if I
lit let's say well I won't use you
because it sounds morbid than if I lit
philosophical zombie Tyler on fire and
he's like freaking out like ah [ __ ] like
I'm in pain because he's a functional
functional duplicate would you say he's
conscious then cuz she seems to be
experiencing pain oh I don't I don't
even know if I necessarily I'm sorry
maybe we should ground this person I
don't know if I necessarily even believe
in consciousness and like that as like
yeah sorry maybe we should have started
there yeah yeah that's right when I use
conscious when I said maybe when I say
when I say the word conscious I'm
referring to like what would our current
like what people mean but but for me I
just view consciousness as kind of like
an emergent property of systems that are
trying to make decisions is all I view
it as that so this okay so if you
understand my working definition there
then you can understand more how I could
view that like machines
have consciousness because of their
nationally complicated I'm making
because I'm coming from the idea that
like consciousness it's like usually
they have like mental states right like
all right what's up oh well this is sort
of a broad sort of question I think
about status of morality and I think it
underpins a lot of your discussions I
mean the last time we talked which was
if you want to go yeah we sort of got
into it a bit but I don't know I have
quite a few arguments in defense of
objective morality because you seemed
pretty passionate about against the
notion of there being like one true
objective morality and maybe you could
elaborate a bit on what you mean by that
okay so you seem to know all of these
words so you can tell me if I butcher
the [ __ ] out of any of this that's how I
think can you tell me if I'm wrong I'm
probably a very strict materialist and
that I believe that the entire world is
related to the existence of physical
things and that that is right entirety
of the universe or at least I would say
whatever we're capable of interacting
with them perceiving so maybe there does
exist some extra supernatural stuff oh
it doesn't impact us we don't interfere
with it and it doesn't interfere with us
right so I would be a materialist right
it sounds like like in the history of
philosophy in like the early 20th
century at the movement known as the
logical positivists that try to rule out
any notion that didn't interact or refer
to anything directly in the physical
world
okay so statements about ethics for
example are meaningless because within
the state that it is good to help others
Oh where's the referring there to the
real world
gotcha so so I would agree that it's
meaningless if you're and I use the
express your frame of reference here
maybe observer would be better I don't
know but if your frame of reference is
the universe or if the universe is an
observer then I would argue that that is
a meaningless statement right that that
any philosophical ought is a meaningless
statement so for instance we ought to
Health children we ought to be good to
our fellow man or whatever that those
are meaningless
it's been in relation to ourselves as
humans I wouldn't say that those are all
meaningless statement so I'm not
advocating for like total applied moral
relativism or like total nihilism or
anything like that I guess okay right
but the actual truth value of a moral
statement isn't it would differ
depending on the individual would you
say kind of yeah or rather that like we
should not murder that statement is true
in a different sense than two particles
will always excerpt some gravitational
attraction on to each other that these
two statements are different types of
truths like the difference between like
a normative and a descriptive claim and
and that these are entirely different
things like the any any moral claim you
make has no basis and in the in the
physical materialistic world it's just
like a human construct
it's what I would say right okay what
well I don't know if I've ever really
heard of like a pluralist because when
you say that there's more than one
notion of truth that to me it doesn't
make a ton of sense okay I know that
what I'm saying isn't I'm not the only
person to say this so maybe I deserve to
find different words so for instance if
I were to say Theodore is black there
are two different types of statements I
could be making I could argue that
Theodore is black in the sense that his
actual physical color is black versus
Theodore is black and that black is some
socially constructed notion of race that
we as humans have that one of those
statements is like a factual descriptive
claim of a physical property something
on the on the electromagnetic spectrum
that can be measured etc and that the
other thing is a is is it more of a
claim that isn't like that is there what
is like a better word to describe this
do you understand what I'm saying all
right well I I don't think there's any
difference in truth there because it the
only thing that makes something true is
if you know it meets the condition of
what we call true so saying that
Theodore is black in the sense of you
know is
skin exhibits like a certain reflects
certain amount of light or whatever then
that is true in virtue if it's if as we
understand the world it meets the
conditions of what we're considering
black in that sense okay black in the
sense of you know a race and you know
beats whatever you want to really define
black it's as long as we are meeting
what we are considering the definition
of black I don't think the notion truth
changes I guess like what I'm getting at
is that when you say what we are
considering so if black is defined as a
certain wavelength I don't know if I
should say this with the color black if
black refers to a specific wavelength on
the e/m spectrum but I don't think it
does I think black is the absence of
color so I'll say I'll say yellow okay
if yellow refers to a wavelength on the
electromagnetic spectrum this is
something that we can define and it is
not relative to an individual's like
personal beliefs but rather it is a it's
like something that we can give like a
rigid definition for whereas if two
people say this this rice dish tastes
good these can be true or or if one
person says it's good and the other
person says it's bad for both people
these can be true statements but they're
making contrary claims about it what so
what am i describing here I guess
well like even can we not make
descriptive claims about you know
societal cultural beliefs like saying
that you know someone is Asian for
example I don't think you need to reduce
that and down to any sort of physical
level it's a statement about you know
what we are considering Asian society
I'm just trying to but I'm saying like
different people could consider it
differently is what I'm saying what
would you call these statements where
people can have disagreements on what
you're calling matters of fact I don't I
don't really know if they're it comes
down to I don't know I'm not really
familiar with any sort of system that
would differentiate between the two
because well like so let's Jennifer
depending of the context so let's let's
use the let's do stick with the food
example then two people eat a rice dish
one guy says this dish tastes bad and
the other one says this dish tastes good
these are things that each person has
personal subjective feel
about how do you how can they both make
and nobody would argue I don't think
that either statement is false so how
can two people make contradictory claims
about the same thing in both statements
be true how is this okay so it comes
down to your view about meaning and what
counts as meaningful and what counts as
meaningless I'd assume from your point
of view you'd consider either claim for
example I think you or someone who holds
your similar position would probably
translate the statement this food tastes
good to something like I have a
emotional feeling that makes me feel
pleasure would I eat this food you'd
want to translate it to something like
that because that's actually referential
to something in the real world as
opposed to some normative claim about
what goodness is so you would deny that
any claim about aesthetics
is probably what this was fall under
have any sort of truth value and so the
claim this dude is good really doesn't
have any objective truth value it's as a
guy named AJ Iyer who I absolutely
detest argued that claims about
aesthetics and moral judgments are
really just emotional reaction yeah that
was gonna be what I that's what I was
gonna ask you next then couldn't I make
that same argument that about moral
claims that these are things that make
me feel good rather than these are
actual objective claims
well the emotivism was born out of
logical positivism and the view that
anything that doesn't refer to something
in the real world isn't meaningless and
you know within the philosophical
community now logical positivism is dead
because it doesn't work it's very much
self refuting and so really lying at
alarm you for the for the listeners that
might not know what that is can you
define electrical positivism well it's a
very hard thing to clearly define but I
can't give my best go at it because it's
basically it's an umbrella term for a
whole bunch of different views that were
born you know out of out of a Bertrand
Russell's and GE Moore's empiricism and
it was against the if anyone knows about
you know idealist on the German idealism
it was revolting against the notion of
you know some omnipotent and a lot of
subjectivism whatever and it was all
reducing it down to empirical concept so
basically but the most common form of
logic laws have been positive the
positivism today I think and one that
actually I think most scientists hold I
would save most scientists are probably
logical positivists is falsification ISM
which is offers view so a idea that if
something can't be falsified it's not
worth consideration or exactly if
something if if hypothesis or any
statement is not falsifiable then it is
not a meaningful statement okay this
sounds like stuff that I might believe
in does that make me a bad person well I
mean do you want me to give you a case
as to why just doesn't work that yeah I
mean I'd love talking about this stuff
so so a few issues with falsification
ISM is the fact that it rules out purely
existential hypotheses like for example
if I say let me think of a good example
because I don't want to give a a
misleading example that's now using
something like there exists at least one
unicorn
for example that becomes a meaningless
statement okay even though is it it
doesn't because you can never falsify a
statement like that right exists at
least one unicorn but is there a reason
why I shouldn't think that's a
meaningless statement or well because if
you extend that to things like let me
think I can I have to think of a good
example that that isn't utterly okay
because the bite if I don't actually
hear I could think of a better way to
put this oh come I'm trying to think
about how it can do you have like a
piece of paper or something maybe
sure alright do it so let's say we have
two sentences okay okay let's call one
sentence s okay and we call one sentence
n okay let s beef the sentence this
Apple is red okay okay
this is by the falsification is
criterion about what it takes for
something to be meaningful this is
clearly a meaningful statement yeah
because if I look at the Apple and it's
blue well it's falsified I can
hypothetically falsify that statement so
it's meaningful okay and let's take the
statement the absolute is beautiful as
my other state okay that's not
falsifiable how would you even begin
trying to falsify something like that so
clearly that's a a meaningless statement
okay and now let's combine those two
sentences together and create a
conjunction of the two s and n okay so
both the Apple is red and the absolute
is beautiful
I think maybe someone in your position
would try to object or something like
that that that really isn't a meaningful
sentence because it contains a
constituent that being that the absolute
is beautiful
and it starts to imply that bad itself
is falsifiable well I mean I would I
would just look at it as to two
statements and if one is false in the
entire statement is falsifiable right
but but in natural language I'm gonna
usually don't do that because when I
tell you now we're talking philosophy
right now right if somebody says like
the officer is taller and stronger than
you if the officer was taller and weaker
than me then I would argue while that
statement is false without any kind of
yeah but both of those things are
meaningful statements that you just made
yeah but it's also but well but those
are also falsifiable statements as well
right that's why they're meaningful it's
cuz they are false sure but I guess like
if I were to tackle these two statements
you would tackle the claims individually
just conjoining the statements doesn't
mean that you all of a sudden are so
like let's say for instance um the the
the man is taller and more handsome than
you right that in that statement I would
grapple with two separate claims well is
he taller yes or no and then is he more
handsome well you can't meaningfully
answer that so you would just answer the
first claim and you would say that the
second one is is meaningless or
undefinable or subjective or in every
right I I suppose but I feel like in
natural language we don't really do that
well what does no I don't understand how
the natural language is used for
anything here this really goes even
further like further down like cuz this
connects to so many different branches
and I don't want to get overly off-topic
but this will actually tie into
something I'll say later on so there's
this guy he's my favorite philosopher
okay his name is Thomas Kuhn whoa no
racial slurs on my channel please oh
right I'm just fighting oh my god
you know age verification and he's a
very famous he leveled the very famous
attack against Carl
in that okay so let's say that we are
falsification astir okay what the
falsification this is ultimately going
to say is that in science we should be
trying to falsify our theories right or
at least positive statements that are
falsifiable but sharing yeah right I'll
see no I feel like I'm going way too off
track here because we're gonna cuz
they're virtually what I was trying to
yeah we might this might be this might
be ultimately relevant like if we find
something that we can again here oh this
might be the reason why but sort of
diverging angle yeah so I got chrome
back based on what you've described so
far it sounds like I would be a hardcore
logical positivist but I would make the
argument that any statement that is
unfalsifiable is just a wholly unworthy
of consideration that is just it's an
uninteresting statement that I would
ever care to dissect or anything okay
okay so let's leave that there for a
second and let me introduce to you sort
of a new line of thinking okay about
it's like big progress cuz this is gonna
tie rate into my view on morality and
why objective morality is a necessity if
we're gonna do anything okay so would we
talk about the scientific progress if
you had the map scientific progress like
on a graph where the x-axis this time
and why is our level of knowledge
how do you think rap time
well are we talking like like it's
really hard to answer this wait so
you're saying we've got time on one axis
and technological process and progress
on another axis
yeah progress scientific progress our
empirical understanding of the way that
the world works I mean you could wrestle
with this in so many different ways icon
on one hand you know I would argue that
this would be something that would um
[ __ ] I forgotten count our names for
like all these types of curves I drew it
on streem but it would be something that
like increases slowly and then over the
past you know whatever it has
exponentially and in this dark ages it
would be a little bit the the slope
would be you know flatter quite a lot
less sleep there steep than in modern
day and right now we probably be unlike
the Highness oh yeah summer I got yeah I
could see one argument for that
but then I could also see some arguments
as people saying that like the discovery
of Agriculture was something that was
monumentally huge more important than
say the discovery of the smartphone but
that wouldn't even like but yeah so but
I'll answer with the exponential curve
because that seems to be the most
reasonable answer but I could see other
answers there but I don't know how
relevant it is I okay okay
I just p.m. do you in this court an
image of the classical pop Aryan view
about a scientific progress and I know
that there's gonna be different it
doesn't really matter how linear that is
it's just your picture would be
something similar to that and let me
show you my personal view of how
scientific progress is looked like and
in general the almost universally
accepted you in the philosophy of
science as well is this kind of image
which might seem really counterintuitive
at first like how's that possible
like 100 percent agree with it and the
kun one yes the kun one and so you could
obviously see the difference there
so what kun describes in his book
scientific revolutions it's essentially
about how whenever we undergo a huge
paradigm shift and that means something
going from like for example agriculture
or the printing press age or cars or
whatever right I wouldn't I wouldn't
think about like technological
advancements in the sense I think about
the actual way we approach science so
something like Telemachus traW astronomy
versus Copernican like the Copernican
revolution Oh actually revolve around
the Sun blah blah blah or the best
example would be going from do tawny
mechanics to something like general
relativity okay
completely it's a completely new theory
about the way that the world works and
kuhn essentially says that every time we
undergo this scientific revolution we
give up all the knowledge that we've
received about the world and we have to
completely start over and the rule I or
you can just for that but I'm very much
in disagree over that but I go ahead
right well if we look at the actual
axioms of these paradigm systems if you
look at the axioms of Newtonian
mechanics they are completely different
than those of general relativity sure
can't absorb the theories that we've
gained from Newtonian mechanics and just
plug it in to general relativity it
doesn't work that way
yes you can adapt them you can adjust
them modify them to make them just as
predictive and accurate as they were
previously but it doesn't just transfer
like that
for example mass in Newtonian mechanics
means something completely different
than mass in general relativity mass is
something that can you know which speeds
up and mass is just a constant in in in
the Newtonian mechanics picture and that
might eat a bit off or whatever but
that's sort of generally the gist of
things and what kuhn wants to argue is
that because of these paradigm shifts
really at the root of everything science
is very much a subjective discipline and
this is also my view I think people like
to say science is objective right it's
it's really just a real representation
of the way that the world
and I sort of got into this last time
but I want a scientific realism whatever
yes and I got a lot of [ __ ] about that
hundreds of bread that I got links to
yeah knowing about having an imaginary
there was this very funny to me because
people work really understanding I when
I mentioned applying some people but to
viewers that are listening I think
people should understand that when I say
that a sentence like you know the
electron or an electron actually exists
why that isn't a completely true
yo pic and the chat is a guy the first
no one wants to debate you
you should drag him in your discord and
chat no thank you
I just want to build pretty planners and
[ __ ] okay do I really need to debate
this guy right now what does he even
want to talk about I wanted to debate
your view of reason itself I think you
can't sustain your presuppositions that
are required for all your other beliefs
what can you give me like an example of
what you mean by that reason on atheism
Christ free will but free will is no
grounding and naturalism I'd also
mention the evolutionary argument
against naturalism and Boltzmann brains
I only know what like half of those
words mean but I don't believe in free
will at all
I don't think free will is required for
you to be an atheist at all either I
don't know how those two things are
connected like I don't think those two
things are connected in any way size
shape or form unless you like explicitly
connected them as a person if you could
say it but I've never heard that we need
to believe in free will to be an atheist
are you perhaps deterministic I don't
like to say deterministic because when I
say deterministic it results in a whole
bunch of autistic like some really
stupid objections but yeah I pretty much
him or if I'm not deterministic I I mean
it because people always bring up some
weird copenhague and quantum [ __ ] if
I say no I'm not deterministic I mean I
would very easily say free will
definitely doesn't exist in any size
shape or form unless you even do like in
a weird compatible list sense but um
yeah I'll say that much the term you're
looking for is probabilistic sure that
doesn't really speak to whether or not
you have freewill enough though I would
say absolutely don't believe in free
well whether or not the universe is
predetermined or not I don't have the
necessary background to say I assume
when destiny said he believed that
things were deterministic that was the
same saying they were predetermined I
could get on board with that I suppose
well even if I say they're not
deterministic
I have zero absolutely zero zero belief
in any form of freewill whatsoever zero
absolutely zero I don't think that you
can possibly believe in it without
entertaining some type of delusion is
what I would say I don't think you can
argue for the validity of reason given
your belief that human beings cannot
choose anything your thoughts are the
result of atomic interactions nothing
or okay how are those two statements
contradictory I mean I believe in the
latter but I don't know why that means
you can't I mean like if you live in a
deterministic system you you just act as
though you're not part of one kind of in
some ways right I mean if you're talking
about my ability to make moral judgments
or something I mean you could argue that
maybe that I'm not capable of doing that
which is a fair criticism but ninis
argue that the concept of objective
reason doesn't work in purely
materialistic system because the reason
is not materialistic what is that huh I
don't know if that's true or not
non-deterministic doesn't mean free will
exist you couldn't you could have two
possible outcomes in a situation in okra
yeah I'm still ago that's why I don't
like it when people think when I when I
concede the non-deterministic think
people think that magically gets them to
free well but it doesn't at all but a
lot of people make that really oh okay
well and I totally agree it's like well
no I don't think you do but people think
is all or nothing absolutes like there
has to be two options and you have to
pick one type reality well kind of it's
I mean yeah I don't know [ __ ] you don't
know it's true I'm just kidding I know
everything I doubt you're a true atheist
given your humanistic moral standpoint
and your dialect dialectical opposition
to discussing the existence of an
absolute cosmic entity due to the
confabulate I'm pretty sure you're
making words up due to the confabulation
induced by your destitute upbringing I
could elucidate my points more clearly
over voice hey nice job did I tip tip
tip to you m'lady Malay he determinism
needs materialism / physicalism a little
to work how do explain determinism if
you apply that reality as a duality to
itself well I mean I'm pretty sure you
would describe me as a materialist right
materialism is the belief that
everything is physical that there's
nothing supernatural is it not that
everything arises from physical
properties hold on I have to look this
up to make sure I'm not talking [ __ ]
Tyrael is bizarre from a philosophical
mono ism which holds that matter is the
fundamental substance of nature and then
all things including mental aspects and
consciousness are results of material
interactions yeah correct so you would
I'm pretty sure every time I say you
would call me that somebody emails me
for I'm wrong but I'm pretty sure I
would be considered a materialist
determinism does not require physical
ISM or materialism whatever non material
ontology someone wants to pause it could
easily be deterministic
yeah that's true - co-ack I just didn't
wanna argue with a guy cause he's using
a lot of big words he was intimidating
me but that seems right as well right
couldn't you posit that God exists that
like for instance well actually this is
a common religious belief right is the
idea of a clockmaker God that the
universe is in a sense determined but
God said everything in motion at the
very beginning so this would be a non
materialistic origin of the universe
that is still deterministic in nature
right medieval Christianity is actually
a big contributor to determinism ah
there was a I believe in early forms of
Puritanism
was the idea I believe it was called the
religious name for it as
predetermination or it might be
predestination and it's the idea that
whether or not you go to heaven is
actually determined at the moment of
birth or conception or ever that nothing
you did will can ever like get you into
heaven if that makes sense now of course
I know that technically nothing you do
can get you to heaven because we only
get to heaven by the grace of God etc
but it was the idea that like whether or
not you would go to heaven I think was
determined at birth Calvinism yeah okay
the argument is God knows the future
therefore there can only be one future
therefore the future is determined I'm
familiar with the syllogism but that the
Christian argument I believe that like a
priest would give you is the idea that
it's still your choice to make
God just knows what choice you'll make
that kind of sounds pretty good
predetermine though right I don't know I
don't know go ask the religious dude how
they rationalize [ __ ] I'm in general
chat I'm gonna talk to a guy for a
second to drag him in here I do you want
I don't care whatever you wanna do okay
all right I just wanted spam or flood
you're alright you're here buddy
what's up oh hey let me turn off I'm
shot so basically this was all related
to the gun control debate cuz he linked
me to your point and my issue is on
determinism you're not able to choose
between options right you you have
atomic interactions energy interactions
and it all essentially determines your
thoughts you don't have reason that
imposes itself on your choices you
simply do
what you are predetermined to do okay
wait wait wait just cuz we're having
shown to be super super super clear on
all the terms so I would disagree when
you say you don't have reason because
it's predetermined so I would argue that
I could program an addition algorithm
into a calculator that takes three plus
three and outputs six now that is a form
of reason and it's using logic to
determine the answer no even though the
answer is predetermined that reason
still exists I don't know how this is
gonna come up later about it so I
wouldn't know I wouldn't say that reason
can't exist in a predetermined system
just that things are arguably
predetermined or whatever okay so what
yeah what you're essentially saying that
I believe is that like if if an atom
interacts with another atom there is a
reason for their interaction that's
that's not the way I'm using reason here
I'm using our sense of the ability to to
just to come to a conclusion given
evidence to choose between options lay
the options and choose rationally which
one is superior like you're hinting at
something that gets into a whole area
philosophy that's kind of cool it's the
Chinese room problem of can you make a
machine that can think yeah I don't like
yeah yeah over that but I don't think
that's actually the core issue I think
the simple fact is do you believe that
when you come to a conclusion you are
able to come to a different conclusion
no I don't believe that okay so well let
me just the really small caveat okay um
I would say I do not believe I could
come to a different conclusion except
possibly if there is some weird quantum
mean that causes an electron or so yeah
but assuming that assuming that we are
excluding all of that kind of [ __ ] I
would argue that yes whatever conclusion
I came to it was the only conclusion I
could have ever come to correct right
and the reason I wouldn't even get to
the quantum state issue is because
that's not actually addressing that the
free war yeah and it's still an external
external cause they you know cadet all
over yeah so so really you you haven't
reasoned to your conclusions you merely
your brain is the result of physical
physical in tracks correct okay so which
which I find interesting I wouldn't
therefore hold reason in high supremacy
in your view right like it doesn't
mean a lot you just what's the
difference between reason and being the
result of you know indoctrination
they're both the result of atomic
interactions Kirino so there is I don't
know how to I don't know how to
verbalize this well mainly cuz I'm not
interested in doing it but I know other
people have done it better than I can
but they're like the idea is that even
if you live from a third party position
we live in a predetermined system you
would you wouldn't have function in that
predetermined system as though you you
would function as though you had free
will right or even if you acknowledge
that things are predetermined you that
still doesn't change the way that you
act I guess so that makes sense yeah but
I don't know if we should we should
found our perspectives on idea that we
should live like this is all illusory
like yes you're predetermined but
pretend you're not like I mean can you
see the issue I kind of understand but
like if you take it to like the next
level then you can live like it's
predetermined but that shouldn't change
anything with how you act really can you
give me an example of something that
changes or I'm sorry I keep ending up in
here point oh I just find it interesting
that you're saying you can choose to do
something but really you can't choose to
do anything you just you're you're even
predetermined in the thought that you
should pretend you're not predetermined
exactly even that itself is predetermine
exactly I would agree with that so what
I mean this also gets to the mind-body
problem which you you looked at the
definition of materialism and one of the
issues with materialism is that it
generally requires you to deny the
existence of the unembodied or the
existence of the mind pretty my mind or
rather I only view it as an extraction
or not an extraction as a as an
abstraction of interacting underlying
physical processes correct oh yeah in
definitely and so the I mean there's a
couple issues I would I would take with
that perspective because I think the
reason I'm kind of going on this tangent
is that you need the mind in order to
have a non-physical entity otherwise
every physical entity as a result of
prior physical interactions like so your
position on atheism I think makes
complete sense I think the issue though
is that you do not have reason as I
don't want to use overly complicate
words because it just obvious fixes or
jesse's amended Lana form and I can I
can learn him it's fine
yeah so ontological like
ontological is the study of what is
really real pistol knowledge is how we
learn something for ontology is what is
really real you don't have an
ontological grounding for reason reason
is just I mean it's the same thing as
delusion it's the same thing as illusion
is the same thing as hallucination is
the same thing as indoctrination
there is no difference because there's
no such thing as a mental state now I
would take issue with this because in
effort for one thing in philosophy you
can distinguish between two things if
they are not identical if what is true
of one is not sure of the other right so
if we can find one thing one thing that
is true of your mental state that is not
true of the physical world we can
distinguish Supino's are specifically
the brain if we can distinguish between
the mind and the brain and even one area
they are not identical and therefore
can't be the likud confused and so so
one is basically the aboutness of your
thoughts so a physical atom is something
it is an ion ER is interacting with a
chemical it is these states and you can
learn about these days but your thoughts
are about things atoms are not about
other things atoms simply so are I think
my argument here would be that I would
take issue with your defining that
mental states are not about things and I
would just argue to be the technology to
sufficiently measure it okay III don't
mean it's right I mean our mental state
states are about things I mean this is
obvious you think about okay about my
argument right now sure but no physical
no physical entity is about something
else in and of itself okay Adam is not
about another Adam okay sure but but but
again I feel like I think you'd know my
response to all of this right I would
argue that all of these things could be
traced to discrete like physical
processes we just don't have the
sufficient technology to do so right
this would be my okay now this does I
feel like an appeal to ignorance right
here you're basically saying your
position you can never be dissuaded from
because you always well okay but my
position is my position is rooted in the
idea that every other thing in the
entire universe that we have ever
explored has always been materialistic
in nature this is the only thing and I
think I have decent grounds to
and on the analyzing the discrete mental
states of people is very very very
complicated I think I can I feel
comfortable in saying that this is
probably also a materialistic thing
because every other non materialistic
thing that we have discovered or or
research has been materialistic I think
I have okay to use I make sense what's
your response to yeah yeah but obviously
I would I would disagree I disagree
I will try to watch a couple of your
videos i watch a lot okay when you say
you when you say you disagree in what
sense
well part of I'm a Christian theist and
I have a lot of my grounding on the
apologetic arguments that take essential
scientific premises or philosophical
premises and reach deductive conclusions
so I don't simply go faith faith faith I
also think we probably would disagree
what faith is
but I would say that on on the evidence
I would say that I would actually reject
the claim that the universe looks
materialistic for a number of reasons
okay can you give me one reason yeah
sure uh so this actually would get to
another I think your given answer would
probably get to another argument against
the issue of reason so this is called
the teleological argument and basically
the fine-tuning of the universe yeah I
know it wasn't a logical argument okay
okay but what happens when I plug what
happens when you plug God into the first
premise of the teleological argument it
doesn't it turn into a wait so the
premise is that this the simple simple
syllogism is the fine-tuning of the
universe is a result of chance design or
necessity it's not the result of chance
or necessity therefore it is design so I
don't know where you're saying plug in
God I'm sorry for well isn't the
teleological argument essentially argues
that the universe is so complicated and
so finely tuned that it must have been
created by someone else right yeah I
mean and on probability we're not
dealing with absolute so I would say
yeah so my question is why can't I say
that God is so is so fine-tuned and so
perfect that wasn't cool but someone
else so I think we're confusing the
ideas of God with the being of God that
God's being is not complicated God is an
unembodied mind he he like a Eduard Fez
or the Philosopher's phaser the
Philosopher's basically said
from a Thomas perspective God is
absolutely simple like he doesn't have
moving parts he doesn't have atoms that
compose him but God being pretty simple
he doesn't have a limitation on his
knowledge it's not like an arbitrary
limitation that's complicated no he
simply has all knowledge he has simply
has all logical power I feel like I feel
like you're trying to win this what
would I say talk tautologically like
you're trying to give a definition to
God that makes it so you win the
argument like you you have a definition
that an all-powerful being that can
manipulate everything in time and space
and matter and every individual person
and read everything and you're arguing
through your redefining of words that
this entity is simple that I feel like I
would take issue with that well well can
you agree that on a Christian theistic
perspective God is not a physical being
by nature what yeah but but that's
that's not very good because again like
you're winning your argument on
definition like you're you're
essentially begging a question it's I
mean how so well because you're
essentially saying that like okay the
universe is so finely tuned and and so
crazy magnificently perfect that it must
have been created by something that had
a hand in designing this and then I go
okay like why can't it why am i
misstating that no no so then I said
then I would say okay well if you want
to claim that that that is not that the
universe can't possibly exist for that
having been pre-designed then I would
argue that all the properties that I
give the universe you give to God so why
can't I say that God must have been
designed by someone else and then it
becomes progressive oh you redefine God
to say well no he's actually really
simple which okay I understand I
understand your critique but I really
don't think historical theology I mean
like go back as far as you want it has
always had the presupposition that God
is not a physical entity so so simply
simple fact if I point out like the the
fine-tuning of the low entropy
conditions of the initial universe like
that's not a property you can assign to
God he's not a physical entity it simply
can't be applied to it he just is a
spiritual a spirit a spiritual being so
how's it gone good good how are you I'm
doing great
so you are writing or no it's it's fine
it's yes I'm waking up okay don't worry
I promise
so really normally kind of a night
person but um so um yeah you wanna
introduce yourself everybody yeah okay
so I'm Anna I'm an ex-muslim that grew
up in Saudi Arabia and lived in Pakistan
for a little bit I'm at nice mangos on
Twitter and I have a podcast called
polite conversations and I'm an
illustrator and blogger cool how long
did you live in Pakistan for in Saudi
Arabia most of my life till I started
University and in Pakistan on and off
like four or five years about you and
then from there you move to Canada okay
cool and you've been in Canada for the
rest of your life since that er yeah
yeah awesome so I lost everything all of
my IDMS on Twitter so I'm not actually
sure what what what was the motivating
reason for you to reach out or what
happened actually some other people
connected us on Twitter if I remember
correctly and they were like oh you guys
should talk and they linked to a chat
where you you had a chat with another ex
Muslim and people were complaining that
you let her get away with a lot of
[ __ ] yeah and I actually listened to
that chat and I mean I don't blame you
cuz this is this is an easy thing for a
lot of ex Muslims to pull with people
that don't know a lot about this slop
right um so you will defer to their
experience and you can't really
challenge too much but it was it was
hard to listen to yeah I had a
conversation I brought on to Muslims
after anyone from Turkey and one who
lived in America uh yeah and I learned a
lot more pretty much everything she said
was wrong right yeah but um yeah we can
go this is the thing though right so I'm
I'm an ex-muslim as well and you know I
had a lot of faith in this movement
I thought it was very a very noble goal
to try and D stigmatize apostasy from
Islam which is which is a big deal you
know and it isn't at all normalized so
that's a great goal to have but they you
know have slowly slowly shifted from
that goal to just being like auntie left
anti-muslim auntie SJW and now we're at
a place where it doesn't really achieve
anything
yeah and well when you when you talk
about this movement what in particular
you're trying to just ransom X Muslim
movement and you know very much
Islam reformist movement and you know
it's kind of overlapping with all to
light and Dave Rubens and Trump stuff
and it's just you know everything that
the the people who wanted to discredit
critics of Islam said a long time ago
that this would turn out to be and it's
disappointing to see that it has indeed
turned out to be you know just an excuse
for pushing right-wing agendas yeah yeah
I think I when I talk about this it's
often the difference a lot of people
seem to think I'm hypocritical the way
that I approach these issues is the
difference between like like I'm very
anti religious so I would send it like I
hate Islam and I hate Christianity but I
don't hate Muslims or Christians a lot
of people have a hard time
distinguishing between those two things
I think yes and it's also the power
balance is right like you've got to be a
bit more careful in how you criticize
Islam in an environment a political
environment that's very very anti Muslim
I think and probably you're more
comfortable criticizing Christianity in
an environment that isn't really
anti-christian yeah so just you've
already lost half the people in the
conversation really because these are
the same people that'll go I don't
understand why I can't say [ __ ] black
people if some people could say [ __ ]
white people it should all be the same
right it's not the same thing yeah yeah
and so this is my problem with a lot of
ex-muslims especially ones with ex
extremist backgrounds they seem to view
everything through the lens of their
extremist upbringing right so they kind
of project that on to every single
Muslim yeah you know how she said stuff
like Muslims lie a lot there's Allah and
at the same time denouncing this sort of
conspiratorial tukya concept like I
don't know how much you know about the
dog whistles of the anti Muslim
community but Turkey is definitely one
of those things yeah and as soon as
somebody tells me that an entire group
of people has an excuse to lie they've
already set themselves up where they can
never be wrong about anything so and
I've actually ran into people that have
done that in the past or I'll point out
like okay you know what Christians do
this thing and Muslims do this thing
like okay well but it's a way different
where Muslims do because Muslims can lie
about everything and it's religiously
justified and it's like okay well that's
really convenient for your argument
isn't it because now you can never be
wrong about anything you're saying right
right and also like Muslims are not
robots right they die of course they lie
like everybody else lies every theists
lies they don't need a religious
justification to be able to lie Takia is
this like obscure concept that I
actually growing up in Saudi Arabia and
never heard of sure until I came to
North America and you know interacted
with anti Muslims who were accusing me
of it yeah I had a I had a conversation
with a lady once who was trying to tell
me it had to do with it was it had to do
with like the woman's March and for some
reason Breitbart thinks that like the
women's March leader was that one X
Muslim woman yeah yeah yeah she's not
she's like I got you and the there was a
claim that um that she supports female
genital mutilation I think and I wasn't
too familiar with her but I you know I
dug around just very briefly and it
didn't look like she did all of the
comments that I had seen her map were
anti female genital mutilation and I
brought this up to her and I was like
okay well you said that she's very proud
female genital mutilation I can't find
any information whether she seems to be
on the
side and that was the first time I heard
of takea where she was like oh well you
see what she's actually doing is she's
gonna build a big following and she's
lying right now and then she'll reveal
the truth later like don't you think it
sounds a little bit like [ __ ]
ridiculous like PG like you're lying to
build a following and you're gonna 180
your position later on and do you expect
that people will still follow the I
don't know I just I mean I'm no fan of
Linda Sarsour and I think there's plenty
of legitimate criticisms of her and she
has said some nasty stuff like yeah I
feel her Twitter's perhaps yeah yeah
about like I don't know removing ayaan
Hirsi Ali is vagina or something like
that yeah so she's not exactly the
progressive that she portrays herself to
be and I see her sort of as very much
the flip of Dave Rubin right so he
pretends to be this liberal you know the
last liberal and he sort of normalizes
and platforms and legitimizes these
shady shady people like Mike son of a
[ __ ] Paul Joseph wasn't and you know he
says there's a necessary place for
Infowars and Milo and just disgusting
stuff so on the other end Linda Sarsour
also legitimizes a bunch of far-right
really gross Imams with horrendous views
and at the same time she's pretending
roundly this aggressive woman right so
she she isn't you know she isn't the
progressive that she claims to be and
there's plenty of legit criticism but
then there's a racist jump on that anti
Linda Sarsour bandwagon and you know try
to apply these weird anti-muslim
conspiracies to her right
yeah so a bunch of things are correct at
the same time like yes there's a bunch
of racist criticism of her but yes also
there's a bunch of legitimate criticism
of her yeah the frustrating thing is
that um this is actually kind of like a
minority phenomenon in general
ironically enough is that for example if
I do something really stupid I don't
know if this is because I'm
not a minority figure but if I do
something stupid it reflects poorly on
me I Stephen banal is an individual I do
something dumb it reflects poorly on me
but if a Muslim does something dumb or
like a minority figure to something dumb
it is reflective of the entire group of
people that that's kind of related to
her so like if she so if if Linda says
something stupid or does something
stupid it's not just her being stupid
it's a reflection of all Muslims have a
temper pensa t-too lied to further an
agenda or something which is another
really bad thing to deal with I run into
the salaat when people talk about um
there's a huge double standard I'm
curious if you agree with this or not
there's a huge double standard in terms
of what's considered in the name of
Islam versus in the name of Christianity
so for instance if anybody ever makes
any sort of vague reference whatsoever
to something related to Islam it seems
like people are very quick to label that
as like Islam extremism or or Islam
terrorism
whereas in if somebody makes a reference
to God or Christianity people are like
well that's just an expression they
don't actually mean that so as an
example of this if any leader in another
country was going to war and they said
something along the lines of like you
know I consulted a lot and he told me to
do this I mean people would be very
quick to say okay well this guy is a
[ __ ] Islam extremist like he's it's a
holy war whereas in the United States
when George Bush says you know while I
talk to God and he told me to do this or
when Trump says the Bible is the most
important book in the world like nobody
ever looks at that as like oh well
that's kind of Christian extremism which
is like no you know well that's he's
just saying that you know yeah I mean I
I agree with that but also that's
probably because of the perception of
Christianity being watered down to an
extent in Islam commanding an orthodoxy
that is still pretty concerning right so
I think that's where that double
standard comes in people just don't view
them as equally dangerous perhaps and
and rightfully so in some ways sure what
it was there like a specific thing you
wanted to talk about or do you want to
just kind of move around different
religious topics sorry
yeah let's I mean I just wanted to talk
about whatever your views on this I
think we agree on a lot of stuff
and like I found myself agreeing with a
lot of the positions that you were
taking with the person that was on your
show before I mean how you were
challenging her but of course I was like
I wish you had said this but yeah I
didn't know anything about like wiggling
because it seemed like she unless I'm
losing some sort of nuance it seems like
she said some things that were wrong to
the core like when she talked about how
there was a singular interpretation yes
and yeah and that was part of thing that
both of the Muslims that I brought in
later grilled me on about the existence
of hadith and how and I should have
known this to some extent because I know
that there are different Islamic groups
in the Middle East right that she is the
Ayatollah the the Sunnis that they they
have to have some sort of release but
yeah I doubt the sex right you would not
have Islam apologetics if there weren't
different interpretations is so
frustrating to deal with apologists of
different scriptures right so I had a
show with a woman who considers herself
a feminist and we discussed the Quran
verse 434 about wife-beating
and you know it says pretty clearly that
you know first you should give her a
chance then forsake her in bed and then
strike her if she's still disobedient
yeah right so I'm like how do you
justify that and you know she went into
so much so much weird stuff saying that
well I don't I don't I don't even know I
can't put myself in the position
justifying that but she wasn't actually
you know taking the literal sense and
saying yes it so it says it's okay to
beat women there's always a denial
involved and always some sort of like
mental gymnastics in saying that it
doesn't actually say what it says clear
yeah so that means it's a different
interpretation right this is how they're
interpreting it to justify it to
themselves so when I talk about you know
the verses that talk about commanding
killing of apostates and slavery to you
know my family which is very very very
progressive
and secular they will of course not
discredit the whole book by hearing
these verses firstly a lot of them don't
even know that these verses exist I
learned a lot about the Koran after
leaving the religion yeah
which isn't surprising to me I'm glad
that I have I was raised Catholic very
Catholic I went to a Jesuit High School
Catholic grade school and I'm
extrapolating a little bit but I'm
willing to bet that a lot of religions
play up similarly in that you know no
two people generally worship in the same
way like you know churches in different
cities are going to be very different in
different regions are going to be
incredibly different even in the same
city two different churches can be quite
different from one another and this idea
that Christianity is the worshipping and
in any even from one Catholic to another
is going to be so radically different
that the idea that every single Muslim
is like this has memorized the Quran and
can recite every single verse and has
the same understanding as every other
you know it is in the same command and I
kind of figured just because just by
virtue of common sense I think there are
around three million Muslims in the
United States and I haven't heard of any
apostasy killings or anything going on
like I figured that people probably have
their own mental gymnastics estephe
occations for [ __ ] up [ __ ] in the
Quran the same way that Christians do
for [ __ ] up Shan the Old Testament you
know yeah so the reason the way I've
heard it justified a lot of times no no
that's not written for this time it was
for a time where people were at war and
things like that
now of course an extremists will take it
in the way that oh well the West is
still at war with Islam so we can
justify it or whoever criticizes Islam
is at war with Islam
so we'll justify killing this person but
the people who are peaceful will be like
no no no no no that's not what it says
at all and it was written for a whole
different values different their
relative yeah exactly I mean for me that
would just like discredit that this
religion stands the test of time and I'd
stop believing but some people you know
dunked and would rather make excuses to
say that there's only one single
interpretation 'silly and to deny Islam
apologetics all
together no I find oftentimes that
people went I think one of the most
frustrating pieces of rhetoric for me
and you might be more familiar with us
because I don't engage at all with like
with Imams or like the leading Islamist
critique or whatever so I'm not even
sure what it what it is in some
virus-like leading figures go
I hear this claim repeated often that
seems really stupid to me that Islam
needs to go through a reform like
Christianity did everything people say
that I'm not really sure what they mean
like because when you look at like the
Christian reformation this was hundreds
of years bloody and well in Christian
Christianity has come a long way in the
past you know 200 years and there wasn't
a major reform unless I missed a big
Vatican meeting or something I think
people mean it differently like you know
they wanted it to be watered down and
defamed like how Christianity was right
sure people seem to not understand that
like for Christianity this didn't
involve like a major reworking of the
Bible or there wasn't a big denounce men
of Christian beliefs like all the shitty
stuff in the Old Testament is still
there yeah technically sex before
marriage is still a sin in every version
of Christianity that I am aware of you
know we just kind of don't really pay
attention to those parts as much anymore
but that's what people want when they
say reform and and then it pisses me off
when people say that it's not possible
when it's happened like I mean there are
gay Muslims somehow they justify both
things to themselves being gay and also
being part of a religion that is very
anti-gay I don't know how and it doesn't
make sense to me and I but I've
interviewed people on my show Krita
Catholics do similar things I remember
the saying that we used to learn growing
up was hate the sin not the sinner would
be right I would say yeah but if you
want to actually water down the faith
and you have to empower voices like that
rather than [ __ ] on and pick on people
like that by saying oh you're not a true
Muslim you're not following the religion
well [ __ ] you you know so I find every
time I have like a nice progressive
Muslim on I get a lot of hate
male directed towards that person saying
they don't really represent Islam well
why are you leaving it up to the
extremists to represent it if you want
to actually water it down if you want to
weaken it then you have to I think prop
up voices that are not obeying it
literally yeah
there's gay mosque gay friendly mosques
now that would have been unheard of and
it's still very very rare don't get me
wrong of course there's so much work to
be done in terms of you know LGBT
tolerance in the Muslim world but there
is change happening to not recognize it
I think is unjust and I think you did a
good job at bringing up that pole where
I think Muslims were more tolerant of
homosexuality than evangelists in the
States so yeah sometimes I don't
understand what the movement the ex
Muslim movement wants because they seem
to be doing very counterproductive
things now there's another meme going
around Islam is worse than Nazism or you
know someone wants to talk about the old
riotous like oh the old you think the
alt-right is bad
Islam is worse it's like you can't have
any other [ __ ] conversation yeah and
everything is so one-dimensional like I
don't know again you're going back to my
own religious ring like I wouldn't even
stereotype Catholics like growing up
there is a huge difference in how
Catholics approached homosexuality where
some Catholic parishes in my little city
are very welcoming of homosexuality when
I say that I mean like if you're gay
they're not gonna kick you out whereas
other more extremist versions are white
anti-homosexuality and these are these
are the same type of this is like the
same denomination of Christianity even
differences in my city but when I talk
to people about Islam especially then
people are anti Islam oftentimes view it
as this monolith where every single
Muslim has like the same opinions it's
so frustrating to deal with that it's
very difficult yeah I'm not sure because
as soon as a conversation starts off
that way I have like a really hard time
like engaging at first
it's very frustrating especially for me
because I actually want to see progress
made on this conversation around Islam
what about you aqua what's the worst
thing that you've ever done to somebody
came up in that in the tiny Jam by the
way when you're in purpose yeah but no
one knew because you know oh my god
that's really bad I'm gonna pretend that
you didn't say that just say it was an
accident oh my god Scotian thank you for
the four dollars in 20 cent donation I
appreciate that thank you I know but
like Jesus like what like put the dog
the poor dog how do you feel about that
girl who said she killed a dog getting
which hundred to [ __ ] and appearing on
small news segments in different color I
did I don't want to get into this I
[ __ ] hate animals and I hate [ __ ]
people and animals it's just cuz it's a
[ __ ] dog people they're so [ __ ]
[ __ ] people [ __ ] kill kids and do
[ __ ] all the time nobody gives a [ __ ]
about anything but Jesus Christ some
chick make an artistic joke about
killing a dog in the whole [ __ ] world
as um adorbs oh my god I [ __ ] hate
people dude I think it's because destiny
lacks empathy so he imagines that humans
what humans should empathetic towards
logically he thinks other humans deserve
more empathy though he doesn't feel
empathy for anything or or maybe I
understand why people think the way they
do but it's still really [ __ ]
frustrating do you maybe that's possible
maybe you start empathizing with me
twenty underscore PhDs underscore what
is that how many times you've claimed to
have a PhD online there is a black lady
an egg a negative attitude person who
got on Twitch and she made a joke I
think or maybe you he's been real I
don't even know but is about killing a
dude's dog it made me so upset it's one
of the worst things I've ever seen on
all twitch I just can't even bear the
thought of a poor dog being killed even
though like 80% of animals you know
given to shelters are murdered all the
time around the United States and I
probably am a [ __ ] meat eater and I
killed tons of cows and chickens and
sheeps and all sorts of other animals
for my everyday substance but this one
dog that maybe possibly was killed maybe
because his girl might have commented on
it and I don't know she was joking or
not her if anything even really happened
oh my god I'm so upset okay dudes you
think nobody should care about it that
doesn't excuse her behavior what
behavior you don't even know she [ __ ]
did anything dude how do you feel about
all the dog stuff have you followed any
other heard about any of that oh the
streamer talks about killing a dog yeah
I didn't get the full details I just
watched like a brief thing on it like
some local news like their recap of
things I don't really know the details
of it but from what I hear she worked at
a shelter and then she claimed correct I
don't know the details so please correct
me on any of this [ __ ] she worked at a
shelter her was a volunteer to shelter
and like someone that she doesn't like
like wanted to adopt a dog so she killed
that dog is that what happened or
something well she her claim is issues
just making an edgy joke or whatever
right but what's the narrative what's
the narrative the joke
Pete well Pete what wait like what was
the connexxus brought up in her no no
like what is the actual joke oh I think
she was saying that somebody asked like
what's the worst thing you've ever done
and she said I killed a dog one time in
my vet office and I had the guy that I
killed it was because he was really mean
or something that's like the narrative
yeah I mean that's obviously not cool
but I mean I don't know if you're asking
me my commentary on the action itself or
the response to it I'm just curious
I think the whole thing is kind of
[ __ ] stupid regardless but I I had
people met Jackie and really really
trigger it because they were trying to
say that I don't know if I should get
into this discussion it's a little bit
heavy basically comparing what she did
which people are like this is horrible
and local news are saying like how it's
unethical and illegal to do this and
blah blah blah and like these same
people probably eat meat okay so you
know we're we're going into it so like
since I ever since I did the vegan
argument with or that with vegan gains
right I pay more attention this although
it already triggered me beforehand I
cannot believe and I already know so let
me print free foot preface this I
already know that everyone in chat is
hardcore trigger right now but literally
nothing triggers me more
nothing oh I can see you guys get mad
yeah I get real mad oh and I got a
real-life vegan here that I can circle
jerk with nothing triggers me more than
a bunch of [ __ ] retards that
literally eat meat for two or three
meals a day acting like the killing of a
random [ __ ] dog is the worst [ __ ]
thing to ever happen in the history of
the world I cannot imagine what kind of
a [ __ ] like smooth brain [ __ ]
[ __ ] you have to be to walk out of a
[ __ ] burger king with your [ __ ]
chicken ten DS and your double [ __ ]
cheeseburger bring up an article on your
phone and [ __ ] cry because a random
[ __ ] dog gets killed
nothing triggers me harder than the [ __ ]
holy [ __ ] autism dude I wasn't sure
where you go with it
I thought that maybe he would be like
like I had people might chapping like oh
you must be a dumbass you must be out of
your mind if you think that that's even
the same thing remotely I'm like a
one-hand she's has a selfish reason for
wanting to kill an animal and she does
it let's say that she's not truly
selfish reason for why you kill an
animal and she does it for her own
pleasure the other hand you have a
selfish reason for wanting kill an
animal you
your own pleasure there's no [ __ ]
necessity there's literally no
difference
yeah there's literally but the only
difference is that we as a society of
deemed puppies as being more worthy of
moral consideration than cows like yes
yeah if I if I were to walk into a
[ __ ] pound and take out a [ __ ]
crossbow and start doming [ __ ]
puppies in the head I would literally be
the worst person where like people on
reddit reposted that they want me to get
raped my child would get raped that
everything about me is destroyed in my
life and tortured and murder but if
people do it if people cut [ __ ] pig
throats that are hanging upside down and
some [ __ ] pen so that they can eat
him for [ __ ] bacon nobody has a
problem with it like holy [ __ ] like I
can't believe it it's infuriating yeah
yeah so like that should piss me off
like when I watch I used to watch like
ASPCA
I forgot what channel was on maybe like
Animal Planet simple [ __ ] basically like
people that are trying to save animals
from like you know animal cruelty
situations puppy mills etc etc which
like I don't want animals to [ __ ]
suffer but these same people often times
are like overweight digging into [ __ ]
meat as they're just talking about how
they're trying so hard to save animals
and then the worst the what the most
like ridiculous part is not the [ __ ]
saving of these pets but when they go
save domesticated farm animals and they
rehome them and like these are animals
you're eating and you're putting all
this money and time to trying to [ __ ]
save these chickens and you're trying to
find a home for these chickens and then
you turn around you eat chicken but the
only reason there's a difference here is
because like this has been a science
here and now you've linked look to the
animal and you're like oh but this is a
nice chicken the whole thing is just
ridiculous and I can't have
conversations with people that don't see
how ridiculous that is because I feel
like at that level of feeling it's such
a [ __ ] fundamental level of hypocrisy
you would have to subscribe to in order
to to be able to agree with that that
I'm like how can I have a conversation
with people that don't see that
hypocrisy i it's mind-blowing to me
here's a comment on reddit you don't
have to experience losing a child to
understand that it's worse than losing a
pet in every single way this has
negative three points like people are
down voting this guy and they're meat
eaters like if I was in a vegan
forum I could understand this but in a
forum full of people that eat meat
multiple times per day are down voting
the comment you don't have to experience
losing a child to understand that it's
worse than losing a pet in every single
way
holy [ __ ] like yeah yes now yes this is
why I tried that I mean like
unfortunately it's a spread up so often
but this is why I would like to not
bring up the vegan thing every single
every single [ __ ] day I've been not
doing it as much because 10 people
always tend to ask me about it and I can
only like avoid it so much yeah but like
this [ __ ] it's because I'm faced with
this hypocrisy every single [ __ ] time
and it just like I go from like really
angry to just like you know what I have
to accept that this is these are this is
humanity trying to protect itself you
want to continue doing the things that
you want to do and you don't want to
face you don't want to think of yourself
as a bad person and you want to lead a
pleasurable life and so therefore now
you're gonna concoct this like doobies
mental acrobatics re mental gymnastics
that gets to where ever you want to be
and they could be upset when anyone ever
like even slightly taps into that
somebody and so but a couple of [ __ ]
retards and shat keep saying destiny
that dog was somebody's property
nobody's gettin mad because the dog was
somebody's property you to see her so it
you're such a dishonest little [ __ ]
[ __ ] [ __ ] off dude
nobody is mad because it's the dog or
somebody's property come on dude girl
the [ __ ] up break somebody's car yeah
yeah like [ __ ] off dude come on
dogs aren't even worth Emma you're gonna
adopt em for literally [ __ ] nothing
at most pounds if you go to a pound
although a lot of you same [ __ ] dudes
they get so [ __ ] mad about dogs being
killed probably the people that go for
like the purebred [ __ ] they breed dogs
into like a life of [ __ ] suffering
and [ __ ] so that they can have a dog
that's mildly [ __ ] cuter that can't
even barely [ __ ] breathe because you
bred them into some horrible [ __ ]
deformed piece of [ __ ] ah dude I hate I
can go on forever about this [ __ ] but
not to me okay I'm not going to I could
[ __ ] add to that whole arguments with
the purebred going to breeder thing was
just uh why don't you talk with someone
who disagrees with you instead of their
circle drinking because everybody that
disagrees with me is a [ __ ] real
every single person that I brought on in
the past to argue with this is a [ __ ]
[ __ ]
I'm sorry but this is like one of those
few topics where it's like an
untouchable argument like the fan less
if you want to come on and argue then
here's what you need to be able to do
okay you need to come on here and you
need to give me a really good reason for
why dogs are so much more worthy of
moral consideration than cows and pigs
none of you in chat can do it I already
know that you can't do it so like that's
what you have to do not some weird it's
my property or some other equally
[ __ ] mundane or stupid argument you
have to be able to come in here and tell
me why it's okay to endorse the massive
slaughter and torture and suffering of
cows and pigs okay but for a dog that's
just an abhorrent [ __ ] idea if you're
prepared to do that a horrible death
we're talking about euthanasia we're
talking about like the nicest way you
can ever have let it like it let it
animal like leave the world like yeah if
you're capably like animals and like in
the like in the food industry leave the
world compared to like this one dog that
was probably it if the troll is not
indeed a troll was put down
what's the dated until they slept or
sedated and then killed this is like not
even the same it's not even the same
harm if you're thinking about like the
actual suffering that went into it the
whole thing is silly dustin has to be
sociopathic was again innocent emotions
people don't think logically when
they're you well that's my complaint dog
i understand why people think the ways
they do because puppies are cute and
nice and cows and pigs you never have to
lay your eyes on so you don't give a
[ __ ] about them but it's a really
[ __ ] stupid point to try to defend
like i would cry hope that you would
feel like somebody's saying that you
don't you you don't understand emotions
this person has clearly never liked
seeing what a [ __ ] animals emotions
are when they're going through [ __ ]
slaughter like you don't understand
emotions I on the other hand have kindly
liked shielding myself from the
realities of what animals go through so
I am a very emotionally aware like what
are you [ __ ] talking about dude your
your remaining ignorant on purpose and
then claiming that other people are
ignorant of the of emotions and not
being emotionally intelligent I don't
[ __ ] get that [ __ ]
anyone who has any emotional
intelligence whatsoever will see that
the [ __ ] that animals go through in
animal agriculture is [ __ ] horrific
so to clarify your semantics is your
scam said anyone who's outraged at the
girl choosing to kill the dog for no
reason should also be outraged enough
that factory farming tonight eat meat
correct because both were done at the
leisure of another person when we kill
animals for food we're doing that for
recreation when we kill dogs for fun if
the lay if the girl actually did do it
which he probably didn't but if she
actually did do it and it's just done
for recreation arguably the dog killing
is a little bit worse because it's the
property of another person but nobody
here is mad because the dog is the
property of another person one
difference is that one person chosen to
eat meat bought a grocery store does not
result in extra killings of any animals
while choosing to limit it for [ __ ]
sake I mean if you astounding why do
they put it in the store dude I don't
know I just it just appeared there and
then like I buy it and then like they
replace it and like I don't know that's
basically how it always has been
well universe started the Big Bang
started picnic sorry this is the big
thing factory farms exist and if demand
for meat is just always existed in the
world and there's never been like any
sort of [ __ ] response to consumer
demand exactly sure those aren't both
recreation farm animals are killed for
food specifically bred and made for that
dog was killed because she was the
[ __ ] [ __ ] okay let's say that I kill
you and then I eat your corpse does that
make it morally acceptable to do it
because I'm killing you to eat your
corpse you just have I seen you I need
you I need to impregnate myself and that
baby is gonna be for us or recreational
is recreational sex object how about
that and that way it's okay you can do
whatever the [ __ ] you want the purpose
of that of that baby in its entire life
is gonna be for X Y & Z and so now it's
okay because I'm a [ __ ] arrogant
human and this is what I decide another
individuals existence is gonna pertain
or it's going to a head up to the
[ __ ] arrogance of people okay now I'm
getting triggered again the [ __ ] dude
[Music]
my face when this pound has probably
killed thousands of abandoned animals
Pepe he didn't say was morally okay
because we then he said it was better
because we do but that but nobody would
accept that argument for a human let's
say that you break into a place and you
find 100 corpses 100 schools right and
you find out that the person captured
and murdered 100 people okay obviously
this is horrible
then let's say you find out that the
person ate all of those people does it
become less horrible because he ate them
but he ate all the menus even the parts
he didn't eat he decided to use for
clothing so that's like it's like you
know when you hand animals it's like you
use the whole animal so it's okay right
because that's an argument that people
[ __ ] we're gonna can man it's just
really ridiculous that we gauged the
value of another individual on how like
the public decides to feel about that
individual not because of any kinda
individual did but because of just like
and their features aren't as cutesy as
the other ones it's really disgusting to
me
it's like if every time a person was
born the public had a like vote on like
how they deemed that person to be like
worthy of being consideration yeah I
guess more consideration like oh this
baby is not it's cute the other baby so
this baby is worthless it's like that it
really is kind of really disgust me
the level of like ownership that humans
have to take over all of the level of
like asserting their own dominion over
other individuals and as anything you
extend to animals people do this to
other people but once other people okay
I can't get this guy cuz that's like not
even my real name is gonna be when we
arm all the teachers and the teachers
start killing kids on accident might get
kicked out of school ducks because
people got triggered over something that
might have happened
whirl is so ridiculous yeah that girl is
like I'm like local right there's been a
couple of international news outlets I
think that even picked up that story
people are real mad about that dog or
maybe that potential dog that might not
even really exist destiny doesn't say
abusing animals is okay and he doesn't
say he hates animals most people are
still like emotionally attached to these
positions that they just go [ __ ]
crazy as soon as you say something that
like slightly contradicts their
worldview it's really easy to tell it to
because like anytime I get into these
conversations people this [ __ ] on my
separate it did it recently do you
believe that killing animals per the
unnecessarily killing animals is immoral
me personally no what about torturing
them though what about torturing the
animal like they like people just get
like so was legitimately curious I just
wanted to know if you thought it was
okay to just run outside the back and
and take a lighter and just set dogs on
fire all [ __ ] day I was just an
intellectual per se like I like retards
like this get like so [ __ ]
emotionally like been into their
positions it's like [ __ ] pure [ __ ]
autism yeah it's just it's a boring
conversation to me I don't like arguing
till they get like that are like crying
when they're trying to like show their
opinions and it happens every single
time like we have these discussions
where like all of the people that want
to think of the contrarian stance are
like so [ __ ] like emotionally [ __ ]
like rooted into their positions of it I
can't even fathom are you saying that
you would rape a dog that you would the
explode it's [ __ ] rectum with your
penis because you okay stupid it's no
kind of [ __ ] to pretend you're on
yes he passed me brittany sees all sorts
of things have you seen the eyes on that
mother you were anti-bullying people
about how they look on your field of
view you slipped all the way up to 180
on the [ __ ] character creation screen
I'm not gonna suicide mines [ __ ]
career to go on some [ __ ] vendetta
against a bunch of [ __ ] video game
guys okay that's not my life all right
Andy can you can Andy can you help me
cuz he's really triggering now can you
ask him if he agrees or disagrees with
you're just dumb Andy when you asked him
if he agree Andy please just ask him if
he agrees or disagrees with the ruling I
just wanna hear what he says he wanted
about whether or not I agree with the
ruling you goofy [ __ ] there's no
hypocrisy there unless you have like the
mental fortitude of like a four-year-old
like well - tenesha
said that sometimes the courts are bad
and this case is good so how can you do
that destiny like are you calling the
Supreme Court [ __ ]
oh you don't how about you pick it up
and talk you don't want to go down this
road because you really do a guy who
lived in South Carolina okay I made it
just fine to the DMV to get my voter
cool that's great for you dude
so basically what the Supreme Court
decided okay yes sir
oh well if you don't care about the
facts then what are we arguing about and
it quotes to target african-americans
with almost surgical precision
if you I can give you like if you want
to go to the actual [ __ ] Court docs
like here's a link to that as well we
can read that if you want to the goal of
the state legislature knows to target
African Americans what'd you say what do
you why are you saying different things
what do you think what do you think I
said he doesn't say what you said it
said that they found it
disproportionately affected effort
that's not that's not the same as wishes
okay here you go you can you can get
this this is the worst argument why are
you sending me another link why this is
this Peter because do you want to read
the court Doc's themselves cuz you too
dumb by the article I what do you think
I said what do I know you said yeah what
do you what do you know I said I think
everybody knows what you said can you
say it again can you say it again I
can't because I don't know what I said
dude I need you to remind me please
sorry buddy you live there and you
didn't even know about this oh that's
the Ikes that's pretty that's pretty sad
my dude you should look out to like your
local politics more I'm looking at the
quote that's not what the quote was you
goofy little [ __ ] where the Supreme
Court said they didn't want to hear
because blacks were targeted with
surgical precision what part of that
quote doesn't support what I just said
oh that that's not what the article said
that you said why don't you what's the
what's the issue there Steve I can't
tell if you're trolling or not anymore
because they didn't hear it doesn't mean
they agree with it the Supreme Court
would have overturned this if they heard
it but when they saw it you laugh is as
fake as you're talking no it's just
funny like you're like you're this
argument is hilarious like well the
Supreme Court they might have our
attorney
they just don't hear enough cases so
they decided to just leave it like no
that's not how that works they didn't
review it because they didn't think it
was worth review because they agreed
with the lower court's decision so
that's not what you said before what do
you think I said okay everybody watched
on cannot answer this question okay
this is you haven't asked me to go can
you tell me why would the General
Assembly request racial information
about voting data why would they destiny
you tell me why don't you tell me
because they wanted to restrict people
of a certain race from voting that's
what the any racial data or talk about
race without all of a sudden it's racist
notice how he didn't answer the question
I'll ask one more time why would you
request a voter breakdown information by
race I returned a question like you do
with me why would you ask for a voter
breakdown by race cares destiny why do
you cry when they do because it was
racist and we try not to be racist in
the United States yeah
everything is right now everything I the
reframing it said since you think this
one hyper specific thing was racist that
the federal courts agreed was racist
that SCOTUS declined to here because
they thought they were right you you're
telling me that now everything is racist
wow that was a great that was a great
reframing though you're very intelligent
my dude do black people up the same
access an opportunity of access to a DMV
as white people the answer to that is no
but that might be too complicated for
you for your little smooth brain to
understand I'm not sure I'm just a
colored guy who's in South Carolina who
America
well I mean you're already done because
this happened in North Carolina not
South Carolina how they also shut down a
shit-ton of DMVs in the black
communities where people would go to
you're so stupid it's not about being a
mother it's not about being allowed you
tell [ __ ]
no it's not it's about opportunity of
access holy [ __ ] you're so [ __ ]
stupid what did you say Eddie you're
such a piece of [ __ ] holy [ __ ] you're
like really [ __ ] dumb you're like
really like I'm talking to like are you
like the black version of no [ __ ]
you guys like [ __ ] two separated at
Birth like holy [ __ ] don't insult Tonka
he's being really [ __ ] stupid like
this is really [ __ ] obtuse to run
away from the show might be literally
quoting the court Doc's at you oh yeah I
know why though I mean I'm what was your
[ __ ] [ __ ] you're legitimately
[ __ ] no I got no [ __ ] little
[ __ ] people and you're probably a
pedophile or whatever okay the problem
is that you're a demagogue you have your
narrative that you and any time thank
you know you're because you don't like
you're at your little world view and
anything that goes against it is world
it's got to come from pedophiles like oh
yeah that's funny dude I'm in South
Carolina I know my bad disagree with me
I disagree with it I don't care but you
have no basis on which to disagree you
just [ __ ] stated at you impotent
little [ __ ] really you want to state
it again buddy oh [ __ ] English your
first language Steve yeah that's why I
know the difference between south and
north you chose your chat right now is
literally spamming and words shouldn't
vote [ __ ] your [ __ ] face yeah you
sound bad right now dude you sound real
an anti-glare you keep treating back to
these chats from [ __ ] 2012 [ __ ] you

[ __ ] prize but if someone can show
where you called someone a [ __ ] and
I'm looking at it right here on my chat
he really can you read me exactly what
it says read me exactly what it says
because I know the bet I made because
people say that I call people n words
and [ __ ] all the time it's like everyone
is like can you show me a picture of me
in a Starcraft 2 game where I'm calling
people n words the only picture that
people posted was when I use the joke
when I used it as a joke in reference to
another guy getting fired like a single
time where I called someone an n-word as
an insult and B W or SC to some other
[ __ ] [ __ ] you play yeah $10,000
reward yeah and here is Steve's quote

I'm sorry I did Starcraft dude the log
with Starcraft 2 in brood war you didn't
produce KidCo go back to your corner go
back to sucking on your thumb though
shut the [ __ ] up little man because
there's nothing you need a dictionary to
come to this conversation stronger do
you need a map do you have to call your
mom you like texting mom what state of
mind again I don't remember nothing
makes nothing makes me more nervous than
being in a conversation like these
intellectual heavyweights good question
all right yeah we have like bipolar you
know thoughts rushing through your head
very like really mad at someone and that
you know you have to say the dumbest
[ __ ] that comes to mind is that what's
going on with you right now because I
mean there's medication for that you
know I'm just I'm just saying I don't
looking out for you here well swing in a
mess buddy trike no question do you have
like I mean you mentally disabled do you
have medicine for that all right what
else do we got guys come on you seem
that snotty bipolar means it's not even
what bipolar means every picture of a 15
year old
pornography I can't imagine what it's
like for these men that are probably
like have more mass than you or above I
mean I've seen I'm like I'm your king
you have to look up to me this is the
staple in here that are shorter than me
[Laughter]
[Applause]
you keep trying you're getting them
Brittany you're hurt and that's that
seat at the adult table you're working
real hard for under my table right now
[Music]
so good I'm so much better than
everybody else that's what I say myself
every night you don't think they're
ready you think that the Red Cross
doesn't test everything anyway do you
really believe that Ian tell me right
now say no Stephen I know I don't
actually think the Red Cross tests
anything they just trust people that
donated can you please tell me that and
please and there are many cases where
people have gotten infected because hey
trust you know you know it takes weeks
to test it's not like you can test it
instantly and detect HIV on the same day
it takes like a [ __ ] nine week
process okay so blood donations are
tested for the following this is why I
don't like you in because you make [ __ ]
up and you don't know what the [ __ ]
you're talking about
you just [ __ ] lies
well you wrote an art you brag to me
that you wrote an article about this you
don't know anything about this topic but
you have such a strong opinion on it
again this is tricking me I'm gonna be
honest dude it does trigger me actually
ignorance of that level you could
approach me being so smug and knowing so
little that I could disprove everything
you're saying with a two-second Google
search that triggers me a little bit in
I'm not gonna lie I'll give you that one
you did trigger my good you did trigger
me a little bit there and I did so yeah
do you realize it's LGBT thing they're
saying that they're like wow that whole
committee is like well we could like
yeah they can spread it they can spread
it now is because it's a higher
percentage for gay people you get that
because of the way that they're having
sex and they tend to be more promiscuous
too like you look at a picture like look
at a guys and they just like tend to
like go to gay bars like I'm not saying
that people straight people don't go to
bars but like there they tend to be
promiscuous and they like spread it
around and that's what happens it like
shows it's it's a it's a major problem
in the LGBT community yeah so you can't
really look at it and say like this is
some kind of a hidden agenda from the
gay community because LGBT can come up
with hashtags all over and you won't
accept it and then you accept it for
like five seconds they please go back to
what you're saying okay
holy [ __ ] your desk you just want to
lean left no matter what you [ __ ]
doing your assumptions will be on the
left this whole conversation even when
you're kid you need to lay down just
like calm down for a minute okay if it
is the open agenda
what would they just told you they can
go and they can go and [ __ ] whoever they
want without any consequences well we do
not want that would you not want less
there are consequences it's still a
misdemeanor and they could still do you
in for
what there was before don't even act
like that well the person that authored
the bill tweeted that he was doing this
to help alleviate discrimination against
its data that's data that shows evidence
that will do that that guarantees me by
them possibly spreading fucking-a what
we were told
yeah Brittany I actually just do
something that supported your argument
but you were so triggered that you
didn't even hear it
yeah you okay buddy Brittany is insanely
brainy answer the [ __ ] question [ __ ]
I've lost at this point I don't know
[Applause]
yes I we can all see that yeah yeah I
mean he did kind of play the [ __ ] health
care in your article wait really just
said that I got totally owned earlier
yeah no before Jim came in you said that
you totally owned me on every topic how
do you come up with that rule where it's
like it's okay if it's in one game but
not in another I didn't say it was it
okay and one given I was refuting a
claim somebody said that I called people
n words all the time and somebody this
is why we can't afford it for this we
need to work on our if this is called
being a compassionate human being I know
this is hard for you okay so for
instance somebody like me knows somebody
like me might be able to afford a
slightly higher tax rate to pay for
somebody like yours children when they
go to school because I know that you
don't have as much money to pay for it
I'm okay with a higher personal tax rate
because I can afford to pay a little bit
more because I make as much
where somebody like people might not
read it's not it feels over reals
no it has to do with Margit it has to do
with marginal utility and income it has
to do with oh there's a ton of different
thing if you want to talk economics we
get into a few one my dude I'm not
talking uh who the [ __ ] are you I
thought you said you're pulling the room
I said Jim first I is your name Jim no
it's not sit down kid so I linked you
the the national average polls okay now
if you want to say that the poll
projections that news companies were
doing those were off yeah that's
definitely the projection you asked for
publication can tell me the difference
god damn son can you shut the [ __ ] up
hole would be based on people actually
answering questions a projection would
base be based on what they think people
are going to answer in those questions
before they know that's not a let's nope
you're wrong wait me then buddy so a
projection is how you project an
election to go based on polling data let
me give you an example let's say that
you were to pull an audience before
people vote in a no pit wouldn't be so
let me give you an example okay let's
say that the poll I'd say that the poll
is 60 to 40 C to 40 sir okay you would
say that one person you would say that
one person has a 20-point lead what's
inside my wife I mean it has a 20-point
lead okay so just because you have a
20-point lead doesn't mean that you only
have a 60 percent chance of winning the
election if you took that equation one
day before the election if you took that
poll one day before the election er
there was a 20-point gap you could
project a 99% chance to win that's the
difference between a poll and a
projection
oh [ __ ] I need to like clean my mind
after that oh my god if you could burn
thousands of calories by being
confronted with people that would really
make you think those calories were
burned right here and right now oh my
god
[Music]
all right hello oh hey what's up buddy
I'm telling much I don't know I'm I'm
feeling really down after all that and
what's going on it like CNN Town Hall I
[Music]
don't know I don't know man like to
think that you know half the people
arguably that share the same ideals as
me communing donations my arms are
rather like what we should do with them
or just that my numbing leotarded
probably on the other end of the
spectrum like people are just so neat
jerk and their reactions and able to get
so far with let's say I don't know just
really impassioned speeches that don't
have a neck spine on you know if that's
true then I'm just losing hope at this
point yeah I mean I know how you feel
again like further record like I'd like
guns and I don't want to like ban guns
I'm usually against like most like
liberal gun reform measures I don't
think banning specific types of firearms
is a good way forward but can you are
you able to turn up your volume at all
I've got you jive to turn up a sentence
no really question do that for you is
this better at all actually wait I'm
sorry don't hold on I think this is my
fault once I got okay try talking again
how's this again never mind you're
better that was my bed okay guys I don't
know man like I mean when we talk about
reforms I think you and I are like
pretty much on like the same page I
guess if we're just being pragmatic
about it all I don't really think any of
the things that even we want can get
passed until like we can have a really
nuanced discussion on like on this issue
like in America I'm in Canada so like a
lot of this doesn't necessarily apply to
me but I feel as if like the firearms
issue that currently you're having is
like a microcosm of just overall
American politics and like the
partisanship that exists there like on
so many issues both parties are willing
to feed each other like ideas and I like
policies that are completely
indigestible to the other one and so I
before you change that I don't know how
you change anything like the only policy
that I could see like maybe getting
through probably not is like let's say
some sort of mandatory education like
revolving around let's say firearm
safety I'm sure you might not want to
own a gun but at one point or another
with as many as you have in America it's
probably just good to know how to disarm
into properly store them just wait for
cops to show up I'm not too sure man
yeah I don't know how I feel about that
like requiring somebody to get educated
on something I like to talk about like
maybe a class in a public school or
something but yes so it'd be I'd
probably be something similar to what we
have like sex ed or maybe even like
driver's ed that's something that we
mandate I'm pretty sure we don't though
at least in America Canada the way I had
organized is it okay you know maybe some
government worker or like somebody from
a charity or something like that walks
into a classroom and for like let's say
a week goes okay you know what here your
rights here's the law according to your
state your news tality these are things
that you may not want to touch you may
never want to be around but at one point
or another in your life you're gonna
have to be around them so it's good to
know about what the function of these
things are what the capable have been
ultimately how to properly store them
put them white and just call cops after
that I can only see this as being like a
net benefit for everybody if you don't
own them now you know how to be safe
around them and if you do own them well
we can avoid like the 5% like the 1,500
people per year that end up dead because
they don't know how to properly store
put their [ __ ] away right sure yeah
maybe yeah yeah I don't know like I
guess like the one thing I'm kind of
iffy about at this point right now is um
I remember like earlier you you in
harked and even today we're having a
conversation about let's say mandating
some sort of like background check
associated with your mental health
records and stuff like that like I don't
know is there really a precedent here
for you know governments to well I mean
if you've been if you've been convicted
not convicted committed to like a mental
health institution depending what you've
been committed for I don't think you're
allowed to purchase a firearm that's the
only type of sort of equivalent thing I
can think of right I guess so I don't
know I'm just I'm only really worried
about like whatever legislation could
draw like abuses and so i if there's not
much room for that there then I'm fine
with it
um I don't how do you feel about
licensing like getting a license to own
a gun or licensing individual guns are
so licensing to like not a lot of people
talk about licensing don't a firearm
right and so like I guess I see the flaw
in that recently another person is
discord that I that I've talked to about
firearms brought up like an interesting
talking point that firearms don't exist
in the same capacity let's say you know
a car or other things that require
licensing to you right these are like
devices that are 100% like within
the public's fear that like you can't
separate from other individuals for your
life and life of others it
I'm like intertwined where's like
Firearms exists in this like very
personal space so I mean a lot of people
been forwarding this and I'm not really
for it I'm for let's say licensing
concealed carry but how do you feel
about that I don't know what the pros
and cons are of it what is the reason to
license a firearm isn't that just the
process of like doing the background
check and everything don't we pay for
the license to kind of pay for the
background check and all that or no I
don't think so I mean like not in Canada
at least it's just we want like in Canon
I think we just wanted to be hard of
people to like get a gun in America I
don't think it would be paying for let's
say the background check that would
apply to the individual I don't I just I
just wanted to ask you where you stood
on it like do you have any other again
I've seen you talk about this before but
mmm do you have any other suggestions
like any other ideals right I mean it's
really hard what I would like to see is
supposedly the CDC was our biggest
source of information related to gun
related crimes and they're not they
haven't been really allowed to dig into
the issue for the past 20 years
so maybe letting them dig into it more
can give us more suggestions the United
States is a really unique culture
surrounding guns so I mean but I would
just I would like to see something tried
like trying and failing and trying and
failing is preferable to what we're
doing now which is essentially nothing
yeah I don't know I guess the NRA is
like a big reason for like a lot of that
not moving forward anymore
I don't know politics in general about
people and yeah yeah it's it's just a
big [ __ ] show for me like on one on one
side of the spectrum you know as an avid
like gun owner and somebody who wants to
see like these rights extended to like
where I live I can see the benefits and
it like okay you know they've defended a
lot of things that I would say are
noteworthy but at the same time it's an
organization that I think is contributed
to like the racializing of the issue
right they're not so much interested in
protecting the rights of firearms owners
as they are protecting the rights of
like you know a certain manufacturers
are specifically like white firearms
owners right let me was Anton Anton
Chigurh er he was like a concealed carry
permit holder and I think he was shot in
cold blood because he made that
information like known to a cop but the
I remember watching that
from two different points of view yeah
it's pretty [ __ ] it's really fat yeah
so I don't know what to do because I
feel as if if these lobbying groups work
I don't think the guys name was was I
don't think the guys name was Anton
Chigurh was it isn't that the guy from
Feldman
oh yeah I remember that guy's name but I
know what you're talking about with his
girlfriend and I don't know if it was
his kid or the girlfriend's kid in the
backseat yeah were the cops shot him
after he said he had a firearm yeah I
don't know but yeah I know I know that
star you're talking about yeah yeah I
guess I don't know what like I don't
know what the state of let's say
American gun laws of steel I think sorry
for Lando Castillo I don't mean to
disrespect I like to shoot at wrong
names I don't know I know that um like
as far as you think or like assert
rather that like most people in America
in firearms a kind of recreational
purposes I don't know if I 100% agree
with that yeah so I'm a little snarky
when I say that when I what I mean by
that is that I think that most firearms
are owned for recreational purposes but
I include and that a lot of people say
they buy it for self-defense I think
that's a little dreamy when people say
that they owned their firearm
self-defense I don't know if that's a
legitimate reason that's backed up by
data like I've never seen data that
points to having firearms making you
safer under any like that's just not
borne out on any data that I'm familiar
with
oh sure no I've heard plenty of
arguments for people who are let's say
like more in favor of gun control or
like are against the idea of let's say
self-defense lark you oh be more
compliant with let's say a burglar or
somebody who's trying to mug you is
going to be safer for you I don't really
care if that makes sense
I'm Orange didn't like one's ability to
self-determine right so like in the same
fashion that you're pretty on board with
the defensive let's say private property
and like say castle law I'm not really
interested in something being safer I'm
more interested in like the ability of
an American citizen or any citizen for
that matter to defend themselves against
an individual or let's say a government
okay
I kind of agree that but it's just like
it's like you have to be careful because
this can turn into like a cyclical arms
race thing so for instance let's say
that somehow in the United States a
batch of bullets got in that were like
baby seeking murderer bullets right or
like like brain seeking bullets where if
you pointed a gun in the air and fired a
gun that like the brain bowler would
seek out
the nearest person to kill them right
that if something like this would happen
it seems like we could go one of two
ways where to say like this is really
[ __ ] that we need to make this stop or
we need to say that everybody should
have the brain seeking bullets because
we want people to be able to protect
themselves you know like I like the idea
of everybody being able to protect
themselves but like in most European
countries people don't feel like they
need to buy a gun to do it because all
of the all of the people that come to
kill you or whatever all the people that
come to commit crimes and you're usually
armed with guns like they're in the
United States
I guess so sure but at the same time I'm
not really like I don't think even even
the NRA is arguing that like we need
like all of these crazy things to defend
ourselves think there's there's pretty
clear-cut limits on what people are
interested in having for the purposes of
that right so you know bumps talks I
think like from the moment that Las
Vegas happened the NRA and all these
other organizations and Republicans
Democrats like we're like you know we
don't really need this it's not a crazy
thing or automatics right like there
there are people who still aren't that
crazy about what's the owning of an
automatic firearm that is sure that's
fine whatever we really don't need it
like this is what we actually need and
this is what we're we understand to be
practical I don't know if like any new
tech would drive people to like I don't
think there could be like much of an
argument made by firearms owners if
there was some crazy new advancement it
was super deadly they I don't think
they'd be jumping on that right because
yeah I feel like they're examples of
this like already right we don't always
ask for let's say stuff that's designed
to be milspec so like recently there is
the modular handgun project that the
united states had between Glock and Sig
right and people aren't asking for the
exact like military version that's like
we don't need that that's fine just give
us the civilian variant that's all we
really need like I don't think people
are jumping up and down yeah yeah maybe
yeah I guess I don't know is I'm not as
familiar with that I was under the
impression the civilian [ __ ] is usually
way colder than milspec yet oh well yeah
milspec I guess to be to be my even
local policeman
like way cooler [ __ ] than like because
military [ __ ] is pretty today so use
Baretta's and it's like m4 is right well
that was what the modular handgun
project was for is because they needed
to replace it like Lisa Rinna Baretta's
now like think three 20s
I don't know man like yeah milspec
overall is a term is just like a
catch-all reference for
like oh this thing needs to be this long
or this water-resistant right but at the
same time it applies to certain
modifications like oh you know this
needs to be fully automatic and needs to
be that you know the civilians aren't
always asking for that I don't know
where do you stand on the whole materon
I guess I'm just not interested in it
much it just doesn't seem like a very
likely scenario I guess it could be but
um I'm not sure yeah I don't know it
just seems so unlikely it's just you
know I don't know it's not as
interesting of a consideration and if I
and if you can show a huge demonstrable
harm by having firearms I don't know if
like a super apocalyptic hypothetical is
a good counter arm or a counter-argument
to a very real you know threat that
exists right now sure I mean I wouldn't
like okay how do i phrase this properly
so it's kind of nerve-wracking to be on
like show it's many people watching um I
suppose it's like the way I see it is
that it's yeah they're these very real
problems that we have to like deal with
and legislate around now but at the same
time I see this is kind of being an
inevitability right like even now we can
have an argument about the state of
let's say American democracy the
American Republic and other democracies
let's say in Western Europe that have
taken way to political dissidents right
and that you know these things these
institutions that we've hailed as being
infallible right oh I don't think we say
we're infallible we just accept some
level of corruption or some level of
[ __ ] Asst and we don't need there to
be firearms all over the country in
order to counter some perceived level of
injustice or whatever that we
acknowledge that sometimes they can
exist but we do our best to counter that
but a reasonable alternative is an arm
every single citizen and have a [ __ ] ton
of gun violence to counter it well but
but I don't think anyone's making that
argument like I'm certainly not making
that argument right people with like any
kind of like mental disability should
probably be barred from owning firearms
with a criminal record depending on that
record and how long it's been since then
probably shouldn't be able to own them
at the same time I'm I don't know I'm
just if things can be as let's say if
we're willing to accept that things can
get to where they are now I don't see
why it's such a crazy leap and logic to
understand that with any kind of extra
socio-economic pressures that political
distance can do way more damage than
what they're doing now
No maybe I don't know I don't know I'm
just trying to think of left off talking
points cuz if you're not interested in
that there's no point in in really
talking about it to be honest Sheriff
yeah it's just yeah I don't know so oh
man I don't know like do you have any
other suggestions any other things that
like you might find kind of off-putting
or I don't know I mean I like I said I'm
pretty pro-gun so I'm like I'm not like
a big like ban all the guns everything
so we probably don't disagree on too
much right I don't know
so goodness me I don't ask me a question
if something man I can't think of
anything I don't I feel like I'll have
wasted your time if I came here for so
little I don't know I can't think of
anything I don't know okay I mean we
could talk about like let's say the
presence of armed security about like
the immediate response should be to
let's say making school safer right I
can't say that I'm really on board with
the idea of arming teachers anything
like that but I don't think it'd be
unreasonable to um well like that there
seems like there would be like a million
different things that would come along
with that like there's so many potential
problems with arming teachers that I
find that very difficult to approach
yeah I know that's what I bet that's not
what I am advocating for I do think that
in spite of the fact that like the
people that you were arguing with
earlier were just a little far from
reasonable right that there's that
there's a little bit of validity to the
argument you know soft targets in
America are probably not worth it just
pragmatically speaking right I remember
earlier you said that oh you know all of
Europe is a soft target because they
don't have the same number of guns in
circulation that we do but yeah that's
the problem so they don't have the same
number of guns so that's why I would
suggest ways to get rid of the guns if
there's a way to do it at least illegal
firearms on the street also soft target
is relative to like imagine we start
arming everybody everything well then
it's gonna be like well who only has
handguns Oh
I mean sure but again like we're just
talking about like let's say armed
security measures so like it would be
arguably a police department or it'd be
like a security
or something like that um I I don't know
god I had something to say um we've been
talking about armed teachers soft spots
you said all of your like all of your
pizza sauce my god yeah sure so like
again like at this point pragmatically
we just have to assert that it's
impolite to let's say a shoot Jesus
Christ man I don't know I've lost my
thought it's hard to rely solely on the
police or yeah yeah I mean killings have
been very [ __ ] fast less than five
minutes you can kill 20 people with
assure the whole like you know lives can
be lost in seconds one like the cops are
minutes away or whatever like at this
point I don't really know if it's if
it's worth it to keep soft targets or
rather like gun-free zones around it's
like hell even army base has been
targeted in the past like for this
reason I remember that you've oh now I
was gonna ask you about like buybacks I
don't really think that buybacks right
or like or any kind of like these
responses are worth it like there have
what's up guys welcome finally to the
Wednesday night blood sports we have an
incredible debate today we have it we
have a great show welcome to the show
the Baked Alaska show of course out here
in Alaska so today's topic most of you
know you know it's a hot-button issue as
we've just had this Florida mass
shooting the school shooting and so I
wanted to get some people together to
talk about gun control so the people I
have today obviously is Joe Biggs and
destiny thank you guys both for being
here and I I think we can I I think this
is gonna be really fun I know Joe is a
huge gun enthusiast from from what I
understand destiny is is I think he owns
a gun but I think he's very much pro
more gun control so I want to hear I
want to hear from them and I'll
interject a couple of my opinions as
well but you know the main thing is is
this is so heated you know I hear people
throwing out terms like you know we need
to ban the bump stock and like like all
these I'm hearing all these buzzwords
that we need to ban all these different
things with guns you know I'm Pro Second
Amendment but I want to hear from the
different sides what's going on I think
there's a lot of emotion being used on
the TV right now so I I just want to
have a little conversation about this so
I'm gonna let Joe Biggs go ahead and
start so Joe why don't you just tell us
you know obviously we have this mass
shooting obviously we don't like to see
people die but what is the proper
response to this tragedy and and what is
it do you think the answer is more gun
control or do you think it's more
freedom and just how will you break that
down an armed society is a polite
society if you were going to carry out
an attack you typically look for soft
targets gun-free zones or kill zones and
we see this time and time again I was at
the pulse nightclub shooting I covered
that I was in San Bernardino I was at
the bottle on theater attack
flew to France and and interviewed
people there you always see these
specific targets are picked and there
and and and these these attacks carried
out areas where they know they can
inflict the most amount of harm because
they know that no one there in that area
is going to be able to defend themselves
thus accomplishing their set out goal to
kill as many people as possible another
thing you have to look at is these
people nine times out of ten have been
prescribed some type of drug it has an
adverse reaction now you can't fully
blame it on the drug at all times but
that is a factor in that and I could
speak from that firsthand we'll get into
that later on down the road but I don't
think we need more gun control I think
we need more trained armed people
I like the father that spoke today at
the the listen session with President
Trump that he held where he had students
from maggiore High School in parkland
Florida and he had the father who had
lost his daughter in that attack and he
made a really good point he goes this is
a time to debate gun control this is a
time to talk about and have a discussion
about how we will protect our students
he says after 9/11 we had the TSA we
started screening people and since then
we haven't had another plane attack like
in 9/11 regardless of what your beliefs
are and all that stuff it still we can
say factually since 9/11 we haven't had
these types of things happen again he
goes why is it that we protect
celebrities with gun politicians with
guns
we protect banks our money with guns but
for some reason we do not protect our
future with guns and I thought that was
a great point because this is a man who
just lost his daughter in a horrible
tragedy and he was able to sit there
with great poise and sift through the BS
it's being pushed out right now and go
you know what this is a common I hate
saying common sense but I guess since
it's such a popular term to use it's
such a common sense way to think about
this I mean yes it's an emotional time
yes he lost his daughter yes it's a
tragedy yes many warning signs were
missed but what can we do now it's
already happened how can we from this
day forward when kids go back to school
tomorrow
how are we going to protect them and I
like with
the Broward County Sheriff said he said
we will put trained competent officers
with guns on school grounds now in
Broward County that just broke on Drudge
Report about 30 minutes ago so that's
gonna happen I think we need that is one
was is one armed Sheriff enough no
because a lot of these high schools are
very big they do active shooter drills
here here and there but they don't do
them enough you don't bring in people
like Tim Kennedy who do a sheepdog
response to come in and actually teach
you the correct ways to react in these
active shooter scenarios implementing
good plans making sure people run
through and they know where the doors
are where the hallways are where did it
where to go are these kids properly
trained on first aid and when I we as
American citizens we we have to put
ourselves in vulnerable situations where
we have to go into a gun-free zone but
you don't have to go unarmed essentially
I always carry with me a tourniquet and
I know how to use it
I always carry with me bandages I always
carry with me first-aid kits and things
like that so when you go to an area
where you're unarmed there are other
things you can do essentially to to help
out and that's right it's not a gun I
are you cleaning guns in the background
there
yeah I'm cleaning guns right now I clean
guns every Wednesday at 7:00 p.m.
Central Standard Time if I need to use
my gun and doesn't work then I'm a
jackass you know that's true I mean do
we do you want to go like point by point
is that okay or I mean so the very first
thing we opened with an armed society is
a polite society America is the most
armed society in the world it doesn't
seem like we're a very polite society if
you're measuring politeness by say a
number of gun homicides okay well I'll
give you that right now
the lefties love pew research center
this was come out January 30th 2018 five
facts
five facts about crime in the u.s.
number one violent crime in the US has
fallen sharply over the past quarter
century the two most common cited
sources of crime statistic in the u.s.
both show a substantial decline in the
violent crime rate since it peaked in
the early nineteen 1990s so that right
there's the bunk now
okay so what you just said is that crime
today in the United States has fallen
sharply relative to previous crime in
the United States which I agree with but
that doesn't debunk the idea that the
United States has more violent gun crime
than any other country in the entire
world right now and more guns than any
other country per capita in the entire
world right now that doesn't speak to
that at all let's look at these other
facts here than buddy because what's
happening across the country across the
world here where's my little chart at
all so I'm talking about violent crime
related to firearms not just violent
crime I think in terms of just violent
crime the United States is pretty
comparable to other countries I think
it's a little bit higher but our gun
crime or our violent crime tends to be
more like lethal because we have so many
firearms in the United States I disagree
but you know it is what it is here's
what you disagree with with what with
cited factors well I disagree with the
fact that this is a more dangerous time
that there's these more violent crimes
with guns we'll say well not to be clear
it's not a more dangerous time crime has
fallen in the United States since the
60s I'm actually pretty substantially
we're living in pretty peaceful time
since we've been recording any type of
violent crime in the United States I'm
not saying saying we live in violent
times I'm saying that we have a very
unique gun homicide problem in the
United States that doesn't exist in any
other country okay I mean but these
other countries also have other things
so looks like it's France let's look at
Paris let's look at all these places
where they don't have guns but they
still have these heinous attacks happen
if you look at did the homicide rate
fall after Britain ban guns in 1997 no
it's spiked yeah you know Germany so
real quick sighting off a one-off terror
event in Paris France doesn't compare it
to the 8,000 9,000 gun homicides that
occur every single year in the United
States but here's my thing why does no
one on the Left go out and have an issue
in 2000 over 2000 crimes murders gun
shootings in Chicago happened no one
calls for gun control then no one goes
out there in the streets and marches no
one way people do all the time Chicago
is one of the toughest gun wasn't in the
country it's actually one of the reasons
that people on the right pointed to my
buddy my buddy Dominick is those
actually running for Cook County Sheriff
I know it if you go to jackass comm it
shows you all the statistics of
everything happening in Chicago right
now day to day
wait so what was your point that people
don't call for stricter gun legislation
Chicago is no no I'm saying no one goes
out and marches on the streets no
there's no country to march about gun
control all the time we go oh my god and
you can see all these kids are marching
here and there they're going here and
there they've got the women's March
people funding them you don't see people
pouring out in the streets when 2,000
people are being murdered in Chicago no
one gives a [ __ ] because we it doesn't
matter to them it doesn't fit a
narrative what's happening we're doing
it right but no one's going out and
doing anything about it
okay we've pivoted like seven times okay
but so let's focus on this one thing so
after every mass shooting event in the
United States there is a huge outcry
from the American public for something
to get done some sort of legislation
will be suggested something will
inevitably die and either the house or
the Senate and then nothing ends up
happening and then the next terror event
happens and then we all get out on the
streets and there's a huge outcry again
but I mean there's definitely a massive
outcry every single time one of these
events happens I don't ever see them
especially in Chicago you don't see a
huge outcry every what about after Vegas
you didn't think there was a huge outcry
after that
oh I said Chicago is what I'm talking
about specifically okay so you don't
think anybody's the Vegas shooting yeah
people people called for the the banning
of the bun stock I remember that
everyone said we should get rid of the
bump stop because we found out that the
bun stock was used in the Vegas shooting
and that's how he was able to imitate
such rapid fire that was happening and
all that so there was a call for that
and then President Donald Trump has
announced that he will try to put it
into all that sure so I'm not even sure
what the point is right now I mean I
think there is an outcry I can't speak
to why there are or aren't enough
marches I guess in Chicago
specifically about gun violence in
Chicago specifically but I don't see
what that has to do with any of this
conversation okay we'll continue well I
mean I guess going back to the point
that we pivoted away from like six or
seven times the the violent crime with
with firearms in the United States seems
to be higher than any other country in
the world our violent crime is a very
lethal in the United States compared to
other countries because we have access
to such powerful weapons to do it that
seems to be a problem it's the unique to
the United States that I think we should
probably work on fixing and how do we do
that
I don't know it's really hard to say
there's a lot of proposed ideas I've
heard things like gun buybacks I've
heard things like maybe people that have
misdemeanors with gun related charges
should be prevented from purchasing
firearms potentially the FBI should be
able to know gun list somebody like they
can no-fly list somebody it's it's a
hard thing to to solve but there has to
be like a conversation or some step in
that direction
one thing that I've heard cited again
and again is that the CDC has a lot of
trouble proposing any sort of gun
related solutions because Republicans
seem to Stonewall them when any type of
research for gun related violence comes
up because the NRA doesn't like the idea
of the CDC study and gun violence yeah
so I things that can be done I think
there's a conversation behind and since
that that there are some steps that
could be taken but we have to understand
that there are a lot of laws already in
place you know and and what we saw
especially with this shooting in
parkland Florida is that the law was
there but there were so many things that
had dropped the ball was dropped so many
time which allowed this individual to
gain access to this weapon you know how
was how how was the ball dropped for
this guy well he was well he was posting
images of himself self-mutilating on
snapchat yet so I just wanna go through
these one at a time so if somebody posts
an image of themself mutilating they
shouldn't be allowed to purchase a
firearm is that something you say I'm
saying if if someone sees that that
should be something that's a red flag
especially when the police have been
called over seven years span 39 times
for abuse for elderly abuse and for
different things like that and okay so
do you think well do you think that if
the police is called to a house 30 times
that nobody in that house should be
allowed to purchase a firearm I'm trying
to figure out what you think should be
different here if the police has been
called to house 30 times that person
shouldn't be allowed to buy a gun now
even if there's no conviction or no
formal charges though there should have
been because it is a felony to torture
animals and things like that they'd been
to his house for that that alone would
have been a felony of us rendering him
from being able to have a firearm wait
so he has a felony conviction no I'm
saying if they would have done their job
he would have gotten one okay why is he
would not we don't quit
real quick to interject I and we're
talking about the Florida shooter right
and I believe the FBI was sent a tip
actually like a youtube comment from him
where he said I'm going to be a
professional school shooter so it in my
opinion I I do believe the FBI was
credible information and they didn't do
anything but but go ahead
but the FBI can't prevent you from
purchasing a firearm they can no-fly
list you but they can't keep you from
getting a gun unless you are like
literally like an imminent threat like
if they have reason to believe that you
were about to go out and kill somebody
immediately the FBI cannot no gun lest
you for instance the Fort Hood shooter
was on an FBI Terror list I believe even
a no-fly list he was on a terror watch
list at least but that guy they weren't
able to prevent him from getting guns
again because Republicans don't want the
FBI to be able to mess with your second
Amendment right to participate on yeah
but after you make a statement like I
want to be a professional mass shooter
at this point in time you start to
question the person sanity and this
person's sanity was questioned they
actually had a mobile Center come by
from the local kuku bin whatever you
want to call it they had psychiatrists
come by and evaluate and they said that
they didn't believe at the time that he
was a threat to society because of two
reasons one he was in school and two he
was with his mother but at one point in
time his mother died and he was out of
school so that was another red flag
these were things that happened prior to
that and and if you pay attention to
these things and you looked at it the
ball was dropped many times well so what
I'm asking what I'm asking you here is
what is the thing like let's let's say
that we can go back in time what is the
law that you would make here that would
prevent this guy from getting a gun I'm
trying to figure what that is like
you're giving me a lot of kind of red
flags but which one of these red flags
are enough for you to say this person's
second Amendment right to own a firearm
needs to be revoked
well animal cruelty is a felony so
therefore felony automatic he doesn't
have a felony conviction but you're not
listening to me that's why the ball was
dropped
if the ball wasn't dropped he would have
a felony we sell this a lot because he
they did not respond to that but we
don't know if that actually happened
this is the United States we have due
process just because we saw a picture or
heard an accusation doesn't mean that
somebody is convicted of a felony or we
just assume they are and they lose one
right okay sure thing we'll go with that
but either way that is felony law that
is a law in Florida so if that would
have happened that would have been the
response he would get if he didn't have
a felony conviction because the ball was
dropped what can you what so what
exactly happened that the ball was
dropped did he did he get an expensive
lawyer and plea it down or was he just
never formally charged with a think if
somebody wasn't formally charged with a
crime we can't both sit here and say
they're a felon that's not how that
works and I said that they didn't do
their job if I start posting pictures
right now on Instagram of me kicking my
dog of me attacking my dog of me killing
animals right there that's gonna get
reported an Instagram as their part
they're supposed to respond to that and
then they would call contact law
enforcement go hey man we got a person
using our platform that is abusing
animals as harming animals and doing
this at that point in time they would
come and go the [ __ ] is going on with
you what are you doing are you [ __ ]
crazy and they would look at the
pictures and go you're clearly out of
[ __ ] control and they would go and go
okay now we have to respond to this we
have to look okay [ __ ] man we've been
called your home how many times you're
abusing elderly people you're this and
that
I think we're getting caught up on the
semantics of this I'd like to move on
it's not a semantics it's because what
I'm looking for is my goal if I was the
person in charge of crafting any type of
legislation or policy is I want to find
out what can I do going forward to make
it so these events don't happen as much
and Joe seems to be saying that while
all of the systems in place are there
for that to be prevented but they just
all failed so I'm trying to figure out
like what in particular failed and why
what would you like use you told me
before the show you said you're for your
pro more gun control can you like
outline quickly outline like what does
that look like to you so this is a
really hard thing to say because I know
that there are some like they think the
who are you what do you want oh hello I
was just sending you some messages there
to talk to you and I saw that your guest
was finished
yeah I just let random [ __ ] people
Skype call me to chat
no I Oh
I mean if you're gonna have me on my as
well well you did it I don't know why
but I accepted all right what do you
wanna talk about buddy okay basically
what I wanted to talk about was I've
been discussing basically political
views with extreme lifts as well as
alright people as well and as well as
people on the center-right are you the
guy on discordant mmm wait no I message
you on skype
oh so many message me or discard with a
very similar message destiny I've been
spending a lot of time speaking to
people on the right and the left all
that sorry yes that is me sorry okay so
what okay yeah no the thing is I wanted
to talk to you with some of these
different political ideas that the right
and the left have as well as sort of
like the centrist thing as well because
I saw you're talking about that and they
think of what I want to do is see if you
can help me understand what the hell is
going on because it seems as if the
right wing is and the left wing is want
similar things yet they're so separate
apart that it's like it's confusing to
me maybe you can help me understand that
sure what do you know where this you
name will do one issue okay that's what
I'll give you today what do you want to
talk about what's your one most
important issue where okay they both
they both want to overthrow the
government because they see the
government as an oppressive force I
don't think that's true well the
alt-right says they want to overthrow
the government they all right might but
that's a very small minority of the
Republican Party I don't even know if
the alt-right would be considered part
of the Republican Party so either that's
good but but also the Communists
they have the same idea right yeah but
again communists are very very very very
very tiny fraction of left-leaning
people in the United States they're very
rare that you come up against actual
communists and um yeah isn't that
basically the alt-right versus at Tifa
well antifa has almost no presence in
the United States and the alt-right even
in the United States is very very very
small
yeah are we only talking about like
super radical people or possibly but I
have had conversations with people who
are a bit more let's say there would be
more leaner I guess but they sort of see
a lot of the same issues like I don't
know if it's like a horseshoe Theory
type thing but it's basically like when
I spend say a couple of days talking to
people to you know on debate communism
and then I have say couple days talking
to people on all right do school service
I basically here they both have the same
problems but they want to tackle it in a
completely different way yeah that's
probably because they're axiomatic
foundations are very different so for
instance like alright people might want
to overthrow the government because they
think the government like does too much
for multicultural [ __ ] and left people
might want to overthrow the government
because I think the government doesn't
help minorities enough I guess like
there's an example of like a similar
issue where they both tackle it in the
same way but they want to go totally
different routes with it yeah I guess
that makes sense yeah you know if you
have you spent much time say talking
with all right people or you've got
beams yeah iid stand out of time
unfortunately yeah yeah I'm sure one of
the things is that I think I think one
of the trying to get my thoughts and I
do struggle with a speech a little bit
but I think things and they don't
connect to my my mouth so okay okay a
lot of our people like yourself you're
one of your main gripes is that you
think that everyone's dog whistling a
lot yeah it's doing right yeah yeah do
you think that maybe a lot of people
are not they're not they think that the
issues might be real for them but
they're not trying to be like full-on
fascist what can you elaborate more on
that what do you mean mmm okay I'll go
with a story there nah I've met a lot of
people in the art right such as
Canadians who are saying that because of
the situation at the plate the baby
boomers put them in okay they now find
themselves in a situation where because
of the bleeding-heart boomers brought in
so much immigration that now they can't
say afford to buy a house okay you know
if things like that so like they talk
about like high immigration and you know
high socialism leading to a situation
where the state is going broke and the
economy's going down the toilet like and
when I hear these things I also live in
a situation which is very similar and so
I kind of think that they right they
correct on this whereas if I talk to
people on the left they just don't give
a [ __ ]
well I think I love to have economic
woes as well they usually complain that
income inequality has grown massively
that schools and housing are very
expensive health care is unaffordable
everybody asks for the economy No yeah
but don't you think that maybe see the
the when the right-wingers are saying
this they're talking directly to what me
and so many of the people like me they
feel that they see this and so a lot of
people sort of go towards the right
because it's speaking to our realities
where the left are busy talking about
ridiculous things like you know gender
pronouns and we need to get more solar
panels on our roofs like these things
just do not melt into reality for us
well the problem is that the problem is
that the left has to work on messaging
because the because the the reality of
things is actually so much different
than
what you'd have just said so like
something like global warming is
probably that could actually be the most
important issue of our time but it's
much harder to grasp so people maybe
don't want to talk about it as much but
then like things like the economy is
totally [ __ ] like that's actually saying
it's probably not true like the economy
for most people is actually doing like
very well at least in the at least in
the United States and probably across
most of the Western world now there are
a lot of people that have problems but
this idea that everybody is getting
[ __ ] ruined in the economy like there
are problems that exist for sure it cost
a stagnation of wages is a very real
thing at least in the United States cost
of health care and education are very
real things housing in some places is
becoming a huge problem in major cities
but this idea that like everything is
[ __ ] and is falling apart and it is
super [ __ ] and the whole world is like
being destroyed I don't know this is a
message that's put out by people on the
right a lot and it's just not true I
don't think it's possible that it might
not be as true as what they wanted to be
like if they're gonna say oh this is
absolutely true it might not be and they
might be like say sixty percent right
but that is still no pun intended but
they're still actually correct in
getting that message across and making
people feel like these are the right
guys to support because they are on the
ball like it's like for example the eats
like unionizing for the unemployed yeah
sure I mean like luckily people have a
really bad time and that they don't
speak to a lot of these people that's a
problem with left messaging I'm not
gonna deny that for sure yeah yeah so
how do you think most people are going
to react to that
like right now populism is pretty
popular I think Bernie had a better
chance of one in the general than
Hillary did I know a lot of Hillary fans
go really mad when I say that but on
Bernie's messaging this was very similar
to Trump's and that he was a very
populist sort of figure he spoke to the
people spoke power to the people and
whatnot against you know he fought
against companies more than government
and whatnot but ya see for example like
like I won't say too much because don't
want to get Doc's at all but the thing
is is like for me I had a really good
career going
and I find myself in the toilet you know
economically because this country has
basically just let the Hitler all the
industry's die we have three car
factories the three main ones wait wait
no I don't want to be too personal where
are you from the United States no I am
from Australia you're from Australia
okay yeah so we've lost all the major
car manufacturers to overseas
construction so like the latest one
would have been Toyota I think or it was
either to go to all four but then they
leave here right they close down they
fire all the stuff and they go build the
factory overseas and they're gonna
import cars here like why would the
government even allow that but the
government should just be like no yes I
promise
close your fact do what you want but
we're not gonna let you import their
cars the problem is that you only see
things from from one side it's hard to
look at the world as it would be if that
hadn't had happened so let me give you
an example of this okay so a car company
a manufacturer shuts down plants in
Australia and then they export that part
of their supply chain to China for
manufacturing let's say I don't know
where their coach Toyota manufactures
its cars but um when they do this your
perception is that jobs are lost from
Australia and that's it
did that that you just get [ __ ] like
that's all that happens but in reality
that's how that's how the workers will
feel well that's how yeah that is and
that's a problem and that should
definitely be addressed however there
could be an alternate reality where that
supply chain is never exported where you
continue to manufacture cars in your
country where the cars are unaffordable
because they're too expensive to
manufacture in your country where people
don't purchase the cars dealerships I
don't know if you've got car dealerships
in Australia imagine you do where people
go to buy cars yeah they're not sold
directly the manufacturer where those
dealerships go out of business because
not as many people can afford the cars
and then people complain because there
are cars that they can't afford there
are people losing jobs because
dealerships got a business and then the
manufacturer ultimately has to scale
down operations like this is something
that could happen if
doesn't if the manufacturing doesn't
happen in China but you never see that
impact right well I'll hand you that
because for example they were aerial
photos taken by drones like people just
having a laugh at the fact that Holden's
yard behind their Factory was just it
was just full of cars like thousands of
cars that went even at the dealerships
yet because the dealerships weren't
selling the cars because people couldn't
afford yeah yes yes so that's like a
thing that yeah often times and this is
again I can you can blame the left in
this a little bit cuz I'm messaging is
really bad oftentimes when you talk
about exporting jobs people just see
that that's all they see and it's a
negative thing and it's in but they
don't put that where they don't perceive
is the fact that they're getting goods
for cheaper prices that complimentary
jobs are being opened so for instance
the more people that drive cars the more
people that can work at car dealerships
the more people that can work at places
that change your oil the more car
related stores that can open up the more
you can sell products to be right all
these other kind of complementary
services and businesses are able to
thrive because more people can afford a
product that they wouldn't have been
able to afford if it would've been
manufactured in your country but that
stuff is really hard to see you can't
like this is why I'm saying it's so much
more complicated to make the pro
argument because it's very easy in the
United States for instance I don't know
if you're familiar with places like
Detroit a little basically we have
cities that were these behemoths cities
of car manufacturing it's easy to look
at those cities and be like well look
they're [ __ ] we should have never
exported these things they totally
[ __ ] but it's a lot harder to see all
of the kind of invisible pros that exist
as a result of exporting those jobs to
another country and I tend to see all
the other jobs that open up you know as
a result of that it's really hard to see
that okay I can see that point he's a
thing right if a country was to keep its
it's circles okay I'll try to get this
out in words okay maybe you will
understand it and then you can like
paraphrase it for your audience because
this is very confusing if a country was
to keep its primary economic cycle
within its own borders and then that
means that the wages and the products
and everything the prices would be
aligned to the GDP or what
how that works would it then not be that
people would be able to afford things
Manufacturing would survive jobs would
be there I guess it's like a nationalism
type argument it doesn't import/export
yeah but it doesn't seem like it works
that way
track manufacturing in China is just
really [ __ ] good it's just something
they're really good at if they're really
really really good at that it just makes
more sense to have them do it than to
try to do it on your own like you can
move your people into different types of
jobs and you can move your people into
things that they're better at so in the
United States we do service related
stuff and in tech related stuff really
well why would we want our workforce to
be invested so much into manufacturing
when another country can do that so much
better make the products cheaper for
everybody else here and then allow our
workers to specialize in the things that
they're better at the I like I
understand assumption is that assumption
well no that's the empirical reality and
and I've seen there are examples of
people that try to [ __ ] what was it
Venezuela who try somebody tried to make
their it might even been a straight it
wasn't Australia somebody tried to make
their own blackberry where yeah yeah I
think so was it Australia was it
I think so yes I mean I think it flopped
yeah why yeah I don't I don't think I
don't remember is not straight out but
I'm but I think I think it was a little
more an example like it I think it was
argent I think was Argentina I think it
was Argentina but basically what they
did was they Argentina said we're not
going to get we're not going to get
something from another country we're
gonna make it ourselves and they did it
they they they set up their own
factories they had their own workers and
they did all of it and at the end of the
day you know they made their own
blackberry and it was awesome and they
were very proud of it and it was cool
and two years later everything shut down
because nobody could afford it was just
too expensive they couldn't do it so it
seems like empirically and I hate to
sound like a big I didn't like a big
globalist or whatever but like globalism
and and and the principles of economics
I mean like these are just all like very
basic economic principles that seem to
have a lot of empirical data and
theoretical data that back up the way
they work right thing things like what
scribing right now is something called
comparative advantage that sometimes
different sectors can specialize in
things better you let them do it instead
of trying to do everything and that
things kind of tend to work better that
way
kind of like an assembly chain well I
know a lot of your points of view
because I've been listening to you since
the factorio days that you are playing
that while talking to people and by the
way I bought that game because of you I
saw you playing it I thought they're
nice ok
yeah it's ok yeah but anyway back onto
the topic so ok the thing is that my
problem with it is that that global is
on the stuff right we're at a point
right now and I don't know if it's going
to get worse or if it'll eventually get
better and things will be fixed right
but for now what we are seeing is
unemployment rates skyrocketing we have
third world countries that are being
exploited for their cheap labor and
these these massive capitalistic
companies have no shits given for what
they're doing to third world countries
by exploiting their labor and the first
of all countries which are just going to
fall apart
because they don't have any jobs for
anybody well I mean it is unemployment
really that bad and right now I see that
what oh okay
because right now when I look at your
numbers it looks like your unemployment
is five point four percent is it yeah
well what they're doing is they take the
unemployment where people add the people
that who don't have jobs at all and they
put that as the 5.4 percent however
people with part-time jobs are not
represented in that category which I can
understand how that might work it's fair
enough but then you have the people who
are on the doll and they have this
program called work for the doll and
they remove them for the unemployment
stats as well they're not getting paid
for the work it's a lie I don't I'm not
kind of like this because I I'm just not
familiar enough with Australia I could I
speak if you're on the dole which is
these unemployment payments so you you
you say you get four yeah I just
I'm uncommon mean to you but I'm
comfortable getting this information
right this is something I would look
into my own that's fine you you could
cook for instance in the United States
we have different ways of keeping track
of unemployment we've got the u3 the u45
u6 did and oftentimes people talk about
unemployment they're always setting the
u3 and I know why people say to you
three but sometimes people say like well
look at the u6 unemployment it's
actually way higher and then they'll
give the reasons why but there's reasons
why we don't talk about the u6
unemployment but I don't I don't know in
Australia I'd have to go and look up
very specifically how you keep track
with you what you're talking about now
yeah yeah yeah so I'm sorry so I'm just
not comfortable um yeah in terms of like
exploiting labor from other countries
it's possible that this is a valid
critique I don't know if I necessarily
believe that but this might be a
fundamental criticism of capitalism more
so than anything else and I don't know
if I'm equipped to deal with that with
that with that fundamental yeah I'm not
a fan of capitalism yeah I mean
capitalism to me is like well it's the
best it's so it's the worst system that
works the best if you're not I mean it's
like that quote but I mean like I see
for example when they privatize that
telecommunication throughout I don't
know if you'll be able to have this
you want my breakdown yet yeah go for it
okay I think that we meet before we get
into the breakdown was this about as
exact as you thought it would be or is
this more precise than you thought it'd
be really yeah it's exactly what I think
this is very precise I think so yes so
okay the the guideline on clothing that
it should be like mall appropriate that
is that's quite precise I think maybe
the basis of why I say that is because
is still entirely subjective what they
quote deemed to be hateful or sexually
oh that's that's not true though I don't
know if you saw the link but they've
they've defined now you could argue that
there's some subjectivity in here but
like here's a very clear list hateful
conduct is any Content that or activity
that promotes encourages or facilitates
discrimination denigration
objectification harassment or violence
based on the following characteristics
race ethnicity national origin religion
sex sexual orientation age disability
mental condition physical
characteristics or veteran status that's
fine I think they just copied the u.s.
protected classes but yeah but it's
still entirely dependent on their
moderators is what I'm saying
so they're allowing themselves the room
to hide over this they're doing what
every corporation should do right
they're allowing themselves the room to
dictate if those things violate their
policy or not and they're using that
very specifically in their wording sure
that's what the wording we deemed to be
hateful means yes that means you could
say something about someone's national
origin religion and sex gender and
they'll pass it because they think it
just for whatever reason they want right
so my opinion on this right so here's so
here's the kind of overall I think the
hateful conduct thing is much more
well-defined but I still think we're
gonna have the same problem with
sexually suggestive stuff because maybe
rules are not at all different from what
they were I mean like they explicitly
mentioned camera angles like but but
they did that before like I don't know
minds before word we don't accept
essentially the suggestive content
yeah but I could be wrong but I don't
think they literally said camera angles
in that definitely but what does it
matter that they like they're they're
saying the end effect is the same the
end of night so I don't I don't want a
like name drop because I don't know if
that's allowed or not but like there are
streamers that have yeah there are
streamers that have camera angles like
we'll have like three cameras set up or
one in the books yeah one on the but one
other like that are very clearly like
but I don't think that's something that
was like called out in the rules before
ever I guess not specifically but so
here's what I would ask you some do you
think that by specifying the camera
angle that that's somehow or by
specifying that we're looking at camera
angles in that sentence or let's look at
the sentence or what they said so this
the sentence said okay we'll be looking
at contextual elements such as stream
title camera angles emotes panels attire
overlays in chat moderation do you think
that by that that sentence in of itself
is going to result in at different yes
so here it's so here's something like
reading that so the vague rules before
you could have some stuff so here's a
picture stuff like this I don't think
will fly now using risk definition I
don't think so but I guess well we'll
find out
but like because like what would you
consider her to be wearing I think she
could wear that outside it's not it's
not a matter of what's being worn it's
the camera angle like I I think I but a
but who knows I mean I guess maybe you
could argue this with some level of
subjectivity but that same streamer has
message twist before and gotten pretty
uncertain result sure but now but now we
have the new Community Guidelines going
for Horan so okay so let's take so okay
what's just like let me do this for chat
I'm not gonna mention the streamer yeah
I'm what we're discussing right now is
like he just linked me Anne
that we can't link it obviously dudes
because like we don't want to like we
don't want to get [ __ ] on Twitch by
veteran streamers but this is a this is
a picture of one of the broadcaster's in
IRL that is like an obviously sexually
suggestive pose right so it when when
this when she messages twitch now do you
think twitch sends her a message back
and says you absolutely can't do this
due to our new Community Guidelines or
or are they still going to likes it and
they like what I'm trying to think about
is like what has changed in the culture
of twitch that the admins and mods are
going to act differently than they have
before well the ideas of the new
Community Guidelines push them towards
acting in a different way but but it's
possible and nothing changes I guess
this is all kind of I just I don't see
like so they can post this stuff and
they can and like I guess the only hope
that they really have would be if the
interpretation by the streamers is such
that they don't do it anymore
mm-hmm but unless it actually has active
moderation yeah oh yeah it has to be
enforced right yeah right so that that
requires a cultural change at a
corporate level which is what I have
real concerns about mmm because I think
twitch is there it's very difficult in
in twitches ecosystem right now to do
that particularly with like the influx
of like Amazon people and like just a
different it's just a very different
culture there this is like a really
different discussion but yeah the
scariest thing for me I think I know
okay is that they are now going to be
enforcing their Terms of Service as a
matter of course off the plan yeah so
this is something that I actually
vehemently disagree with like yeah I am
NOT and like because yeah
so this is this is very interesting okay
and I wouldn't want to rock the boat
here have have you ever heard of you
know how people will pay 1099s to cheat
people out of wheat or I'm not bring up
anything you've done personally but
you're familiar with this right sorry or
that
not outside your for my I'm not trying
to say that you've done this to them
we've that better that I know that
Leggett right now add that sunny
preggers like you're familiar with like
the whole 1099 versus w-2 debacle right
like that if that what I if I that some
people will have employees that if you
have an employee you should have them w2
yeah yeah yeah well it's not yeah it's
not unique to eSports it's a very very
real real-world meme but but yeah
eSports is dealing with it as well right
now if I work for a company okay and I
have branding that you tell me or can I
can I use I've got very specific content
guidelines that I must follow and now
you're starting to tell me how I can or
cannot act off platform I feel like
you're starting to move into areas where
I want you to W to me I need you to
cover half of my FICA if you're gonna
start telling me how I have to conduct
myself off platform I don't feel like a
contractor anymore that should be
getting paid via 1099 I think you need
to w2 me do you think there's an
argument that you could make there
alright so morally yes like we could go
by the IRS the IRS has like a 20-point
guideline for like w2 versus 1099 that
they check to make sure that you're not
like it's because that's counteracted by
the fact that you're you are everything
that twitch does and everything that you
do on twitch is a of them hosting this
platform right yeah but like when it
starts it when it starts to get to a
point where you've got a contract that
says that you can't provide your
services to somebody else simultaneously
right which a lot of people have that
these are really big check points for
like whether that's a really different
discussion because it's my opinion that
that is not enforceable in court
especially in places like California
well but it doesn't matter if it's
enforceable at court it's the idea that
twitch could fire you will twitch will
kick you off the platform if you violate
that contract so if you're trying to get
people to not compete in contract I
think that's I think that is I think if
a broadcaster or a group of broadcasters
really wanted
like an influencer working they could
fight that is that is that good hold on
I'm trying to think is that consejo line
you know more about this you than I do
is it considered a non-compete when it's
an ongoing relationship I thought that
non-competes were things that were like
after our services have ended you have
to wait a period in time to compete
other that's what a non-compete was
considered on the state but but in this
is such a convoluted issue because
you're not exactly an employee of like
this is the whole problem we're
discussing is you're not exactly an
employee of which in fact you're not an
employer sure you're utilizing their
platform and you're making income off of
it but that's not the way that this
could be legally regarded we've had a
lot of problems with this in the past
and gaming the way that this would be
legally regarded is in the same way that
like if you were if Twitter was - or
Facebook was to ban you for something
that you did on another platform it is
it is their right to do that even if you
are making income off of Facebook or or
you can justify that because it's their
platform but but but again the laws on
this are not well updated yeah I'm just
trying to imagine working as like a 1099
contractor because 1099 work is
typically contract work say I say I want
to work for a carpet cleaning company or
a construction company or carpenter
company that if I wanted to work as a
carpenter for some company if you were
to tell me hey by the way like you know
if you go to work for somebody else or
if you're doing something like off-hours
like could you imagine I don't have you
ever done contract work but could you
imagine as a contractor if the if the
company that's contracted you is telling
you how to conduct yourself when you're
not working for them like and you're not
on the side or anything like that's a
very weird relationship that with a 1099
employee you know it is when you word it
that way but let's use another example
where if I contract a consultant yeah -
to do business and and let's say he does
consulting for my my VPS and wants and
wants that and and the idea is it
doesn't matter what he's trying to
accomplish but let's say that person
then goes out on social media and makes
a total fool of themselves right I don't
want that person to represent my company
because of that it's well within my
right to fire
person or to remove that person entirely
order to disavow everything because that
person's conduct outside of my company
or my platform was such and that's what
twitch is saying here is is so the
easiest way to kind of like rewind here
is to try to figure out why twitch is
doing this why like what what benefit do
they have as a company to to be able to
do this and my a my thinking is if I if
I'm thinking like a like like a C or VP
level person mm-hmm I'm thinking that I
want to maximize my enforce ability and
my control over by broadcasters so that
if I have a situation where I'm getting
pressure from sponsors or I'm getting
pressure economically somehow that
because a broadcaster is doing a ton of
crazy [ __ ] but then deliberately making
their twitch PC because it's like the
main source their income or whatever I
would want the ability to remove that
person from my platform to be able to
appease those sponsors that is my
thinking as to why there yes I agree
that's just really [ __ ] cancerous holy
[ __ ] I really don't like that I
understand that it's like we kind of
talked about yesterday like the way
moving forward is through advertiser
pressure but man that sounds real shitty
really [ __ ] it sucks yes because here's
where this goes wrong okay so that's
that's the that interpretation is the
most how it's the word I guess like
business favoring okay here's what
actually happens what actually happens
is that a moderator admin uses that
justification to see a message that you
posted on Facebook
that's about some that they deem as as
racial right and then gives you an
indefinite [ __ ] ban indefinite ban oh
yeah first warning it because of that
right so so we're looking at a situation
where it's not gonna be the VP's of
twitch that are this is what really
worries me it's not the VP's of twitch
that are enforcing this it's not the
high level
that came up with this it's the [ __ ]
moderators that are volunteers they're
gonna be judging broadcasters and if you
get an indefinite ban or here's like
yeah here's like a thing did you see him
I think some editor of a BBC did a small
article about boobie streamers on Twitch
that I was tapped for commentary for did
you ever hear about this on the BBC yeah
I did read that I read that are yeah so
like is that could I get banned for
doing that now because I'm because I'm
pretty sure name dropping that article
so does this mean that like if I let's
say that I have a grievance with a
certain streamer on Twitch I never I
can't I don't know if I can say that on
Twitch anymore because I might be banned
a bowl you can't sit on the Twitter
subreddit so does this mean that if I
post about this am i read it or if I
give an interview with another company
where I air agreements with somebody is
this harassment now yes yes so like if I
give a comment like that in an article
that article released and you know past
February 19th that would be considered
like targeted harassment of another
streamer off platform like this like
that's really weird to me like I can
never have these conversations anymore
you would be grandfathered in this case
right so there's there's no way that
that would act well no no no yeah yeah
but I'm saying like going forward like
if there is a problem that I have with
the type of content of a certain
streamer I can there I can't talk about
this anymore and not I can't talk about
it on Twitch I can't talk about this
anywhere I can't talk about it on
Twitter well obviously I can't talk
about a Facebook I can't talk about it
on youtube I can't bring it up anywhere
anymore because now off platform stuff
is only paid staff can ban accounts that
is incorrect it's factually incorrect I
there are many volunteers that I
personally know who regularly enforce
and banned streamers including large
streamers if it's a large enough
streamer it has to be reviewed by a paid
staff member but volunteers can panic as
it often do um to your point yeah that's
what it means I mean that's literally
what it means I think it's and not so
here's the real thing though right not
only do I think that's the case but I
also think that it's going to be
enforced that way that's the real
problem is like I think like in that
same situation where they catch you
doing an interview with like a BBC
article and it causes them enough grief
or someone gets triggered or whatever
happens right like I think and that is
they do pay on you under that
justification yeah yeah
geez yeah so it's yeah I don't like that
off plot I didn't like it a lot of
people are saying this is the world you
created I've always been against off
platform [ __ ] I don't think so
I could be wrong and maybe people lied
about this but I think when gross score
caught his six or twelve month ban the
two warnings leading up to that were
four off platform harassment because he
was tweeting right yeah I wrote that
actually in my in my notice is that the
it was cut the hate stuff that they have
here they had already been yeah yeah and
I ve disagree with that
I am a contractor of twitch they pay me
via attending it I do not work for the
company like the idea that I don't know
I'm not comfortable with that that they
have control over what I can say off
platform that just if I even if I was an
employee I wouldn't be comfortable with
that I could be a little bit more
understanding but as a contractor oof I
really don't like that idea
uh I don't know the problem is that this
gets to such a weird legal gray area
where what you're you have the twenty
point system up let's let's look at that
does any of that seem to like suggest
that this is these changes maybe I'm not
sure I don't know I mean we can go
through but this is kind of a separate
thing I was kind of reading them I guess
it probably not I guess for most of
these 20 points it wouldn't but yeah so
the first gonna be must the individual
take instructions from your management
staff regarding when where and how work
is to be done I mean where and how is
definitely specified yes where it has to
take place on twitch TV oh they don't
tell you when the stream they don't so
don't tell you when but they may talk
about like yeah I don't know I guess a
lot of these are kind of subjective
intentionally so it where it right the
IRS yes well I mean the IRS was subject
will use news these are if we just go
through these real quick like does this
individual receive training from a
company yes they do do that that can be
justified as the successor continuation
your business depends on type of service
yes must the individual personally
performed
tracted services yep have you hired
supervisor paid individuals to assist
the worker and completing the project
absolutely there's a whole partnership
team is there a continuing relationship
between the company invidual yep must be
an exclusive relationship oftentimes
yeah yeah exclusive bless the angel
we'll set work hours no um is the
individual required to work full-time of
your company no but if you want to be
successful yeah is the work performed on
company premises no I don't know in a
digital world if that counts it getting
that the work has to be performed on
twitch TV or if that matters I don't
know but we'll say no we'll say no to me
but go ahead number 10 is the individual
required to follow a set sequence or
routine in the performance of their work
not necessarily probably not yeah yeah
should the individual give you reports
or in their work no are they paid by the
hour a week or month month you know
because well that that's specifically
refers to hourly work yes yes if you if
you get paid if you get paid hourly I
think you have a stronger argument for
being w2 versus if you pay him like by a
month or by a job right yeah yeah
do you and reimburse the individuals for
business travel expenses many large
broadcasters do get that benefit
directly from twitch did you supply the
individual with needed tools and
materials absolutely have you made a
significant investment of facilities he
had no doubt yeah yeah is the individual
free from suffering a loss or realizing
a profit that can you scroll down
because on your website is the indigo
free from suffering a loss of realizing
probably based on his work individual
free from a suffering a loss or
realizing a profit based on that I don't
understand that so basically what it's
saying is that like do I do you contract
sale of ignorance really wants to come
on and talk to me about stupid people
all right if you want to sure let me go
get a bowl of cereal and you can do it
okay Oh bad bunnies doing stardew valley
oh [ __ ]
we did it boys you better take these
relationships in-game really [ __ ]
seriously because you will be judged
based on who you pair off with is your
waifu I'm just giving you a heads up be
careful good luck oh okay thanks
alright what do you want oh hey I'm
still of ignorance right yeah uh I'm
here me are you wait type in chat right
now ok I did keep that might have been a
coincidence type a 1 7 2 4x capitals
hello
you're a [ __ ] an obvious play go
ahead but I didn't get the capital sorry
a typhoon um yeah so um hi I'm a grad
student at MIT
I'm not to brag but I'm just say I deal
with everyday undergraduates I teach
them you are very ignorant but also very
arrogant right so this is I think the
type of person you deal with every day
yeah I agree
what um meeting Bowles first sorry what
is your uh what was your undergrad and
what are you doing for graduate work
undergrad I was Chemical Engineering
University graduate I was I'm currently
environmental engineering so it's like
that ok gotcha
alright um what do you want to do with
your degree I'm just curious how far you
want to go in school what do you wanna
do for work oh sure I'm probably gonna
work for the government for two years
the government funds most of the like
anti-pollution efforts like they
actually fund cleanups or they need for
more Lego and so my thesis is based
around trying to show that the best way
that to clean up sites right so a way
that both is protects people who are in
danger right so like like local people
or like a lot of times its its Native
Americans and also is cheap right so it
because it's cheap people who are on the
hook people like big industry whatever
will pay for it
willing to at least willing to have the
least amount of like legal liability yes
okay cool yeah cool okay go for it yeah
so I deal with arrogant undergrads every
year and basically a lot of people I see
you talk to you are pretty much arrogant
undergrads that I see right so they
think they're very smart they think
they're they're skeptics but they're
also they're really dumb and what they
don't know right so I think the key is
to expose to them what they don't know
so sorry so sometimes I do this um did
you see my conversation with the guy
last night that when we talked about
some of the trans issues yeah yeah so I
tried to do that with him when I asked I
don't usually like to do this because I
feel like I'm putting people on the spot
but like I asked him like what is gender
dysphoria and he failed to define it
even after I gave him the definition I
feel like doing that doesn't help I feel
like it just makes people more angry or
whatever or like it feels kind of
sending and I don't know what what's
your opinion on that yeah so I think
asking people for their definition is
really good also for the chat um I have
a voice issue my vocal cords got
literally scarred at one point so I'm
sorry if I'm talking fast but you talk
fast you so yeah ignore the job may
ignore the chat okay go ahead hey Dori
yeah so for people like I don't want to
call him a Tuesday night
idiot for like the Tuesday night idiot
you need to like barrel down and what he
is missing right so he'll never probably
admit on stream what he's missing but if
you can box him into a corner and have
him like essentially dodged the question
you you you win right so if you if you
haven't defined gender dysphoria like he
did and then have him define it again
you ask him like can you not see the
difference he will probably talk about
something else so what do you think with
um with the den killer guy what should I
have asked you done differently what do
you think oh sure I'm have dank EULA
defined what free speech means to him so
I feel like weed dank EULA thank you I
just asked you really specific tentacles
you're gonna carry real life examples
about free speech but you never asked
him real life examples right so at one
point dink you said it's totally fine
for companies to fire their workers for
whatever reason and then later on
he was defending James d'amour which is
like obviously contradictory so you need
to have dank EULA defined the difference
to you or at least to the audience and
then grill Danielle on that right so
it's clear dank EULA is not a free
speech absolutist Seanie to like like I
don't know assess out what the bounds of
his free speech and because when that
gives me a platform from which to attack
inconsistencies I can't attack an
inconsistency if I don't know his
primary view like it was trying to do to
me if I would have gotten a specific
definition from him I could have tested
that when he was giving writing examples
as well sure right I feel like he didn't
do that enough in that in that
particular talk right so so dank EULA
was willing to grill you and
occasionally dank you like retreat to
like type stuff or I don't know like
like Lily it was dumb about certain
things so if you turned it around and
said hey dank EULA like like do you
think I'm being sued for defamation do
you think that's a good thing and then
dink you don't have to explain why it is
or isn't right mm-hm
yeah sure I understand yeah
so I guess in general when when talking
to idiots or when talking to people that
you think our obviously contradictory
have them explain the contradiction or
at least have them attempt to explain
the contradiction like basically
anything didn't give us at this one
point like let people hang themselves
gotcha um yeah I guess I don't
necessarily disagree sure yeah yeah this
is a general criticism so when I when I
deal with air in undergrads who think
they know everything it's best to let
them hang themselves so if you ever feel
like you're I don't know like dealing
with an idiot just like let the idiot
explain themselves because because the
idiot will eventually come to something
that's really dumb or like or something
that you find almost disagree on which
is good thing gotcha and since I've
already made him clearly state his view
you can't really retreat from it exactly
yeah and also like in terms of like
social media or clipping or whatever
like the guy has to explain himself
rather than you explaining yourself I
mean I think it's really good that you
take some time to explain your views on
free speech like have these little
tirades where we all all spam godson II
Gosling the chat please but you should
have them explain their views cuz then
they have to defend that in the long
term gotcha I understand okay sure
I think I normally try to do that I'm
not used to talking to people that are
so aggressive in their questioning right
which I feel like that did you ever hear
my original debate with the Sinatra says
guy the guy that moderated this yeah I
did I think I was asking more questions
there but I think every time I asked a
question he would just answer it in a
way that was just so dumb like at the
beginning of this debate when I asked um
oh so for instance at the beginning of
this debate I asked him if he thought I
asked Angela do you think that watching
videos is a good way to gather data and
he legitimately says yes when somebody
says that I feel like I'm so many levels
ahead of them that I have to back up
like would like where do you even start
with something like that like this is
literally like a two-hour discussion on
on human you know like pattern
recognition bias and and I'm seeing
power like how do you even how do you
even do that
how do you how do you do that yeah so um
I think Tau Alpha through up something
um
this is not to say you shouldn't be
condescending I think time ascension
works in a lot of circumstances but um
if you think you have a point that is
like Sinatra or someone could
legitimately accept you so you need to
transition to being like like a teacher
mode right so a teacher is very
accepting of ignorance the teachers very
bla bla bla and obviously like you're
not attempting to influence Sinatra
really I mean kind of are but not really
but it's it's the people who who agree
with Sinatra right now right so you have
that what is it the twenty forty forty
rule this is a way to dip into his forty
um so you say like oh hey Sinatra I kind
of understand what you're saying about
like everyone has a choice right like
that's that's true but my field like
there's a little bit of a difference
with you being a grad student you're
teaching like I feel like this would be
different if you were an undergrad to an
undergrad don't you think maybe because
like if these people were like if I was
having a conversation with somebody who
because like so for instance I hate
saying this for them oh no like so like
did you see my debate with almost see
the pedophile did yeah it was good or my
debate with vegan games
yes these are people where I feel like I
could give them something and they would
engage with it I feel that for people
like
like Tonka saw Tonka trucks or
accountant EULA or Britney I feel like I
just I'm not sure sure sure sure
so so that's that's actually the reason
why I wanted to talk to you right yeah
so um when you're an a graduating
teacher you don't have a choice of who
you teach right so you have you have
like people like I don't know like
asthma Gould who will consider what
you're saying and then people like Tom
kasaa or you know just know consider
it's like you're just speaking into a
wall and then they'll go back and
hammered there whatever rhetoric they
were working on before they'll just read
do it like that's it without any
consideration of what you say Yeah right
right but as a teacher I have to take
both people in and my job is to teach
all of them right so I give some meats
to people like asthma Gold Drive just
say like you know I spit some data
whatever and then people like talk asau
I'm like I see so okay so I remember
Tongass I just progress out oh my god
but but so with a person like Thomas ah
who I see potential and I'll be like
okay hey Thomas ah oh I kind of get
where you're coming from right so but
but I think it's kind of weird okay can
you explain to me why you think X means
Y right and and hopefully as long as
he's not Tom casaya he'll like he'll
have a reason for believing something
right I feel like can we do like a
sample of this about the agency meme I
believe that everybody can just make
better choice this is my view okay I've
secretly my view is that I believe it
everybody can just make the right choice
okay all right so let's do this
conversation we're arguing about you
just told me some statistics that mean
that black people are disadvantaged in
the United States okay now my retort is
or listen I think that black people in
general we should just encourage them to
make better choices okay listen I
understand right so why do you think
black people are making bad choices I
don't know maybe it's their culture okay
what do you have a culture like is it
their music they're listening to yeah
like do you think that they make the way
that they act in gangs and everything I
think that yeah their culture is really
bad and it just they make a lot of bad
choices and they need to stop doing that
okay cool
that could be true right so so they're
listening to bad voices well why do you
why do you think they're attracted to
bad voices um I don't know because
they're you know their parents don't
help them
their parents don't give them good
things because the family unit is broken
because all of them have out of wedlock
birth and everything and yeah they just
they choose to listen to this horrible
music and stuff and it just messes their
whole lives up ha ha do you think like
like no one's redeemable Dee do you
think that like there's no way to reach
this this black person like you know on
the contrary I believe people are
redeemable you're the one that doesn't
you're telling me they can't make these
choices on their own I think black
people can make better choices you're
the one telling me that you don't think
they're capable of doing it you want to
change the environment I think that
black people can make the right choice
to rise above their circumstances like
so many have done in the past okay so
back up for a second do you think I'm
making the deterministic argument that
like they're like the overall trend is
something or do you think I'm trying to
reach these kids I don't know what
you're trying to do I just want black
people to make better choices just like
white people can make good choices they
do already okay I'm trying to reach
these kids right so so I'm trying to
argue how do I reach black people that
that like have bad culture or whatever
like like a new bully but it's not our
job to reach them we don't have outreach
for white people why do we need outreach
for black people why do you think black
people can't make the same good choices
that white people make we do have
outreach for white people not really I
don't remember I don't know any white
kids that needed a inner-city programs
in order to keep them out of gang
violence and stuff white people don't
seem to get involved on't kill there's
not programs telling white people not to
kill each other with gang violence why
do we need that for black people we need
for all people who have this shitty
mentality that I don't know like we
don't have it we don't have it for white
people why do we need it for black we do
we do we do that's dumb we do like what
we have this for any kind of I don't
know what's your stereotype you're
talking about right so you have some
stereotype that's inner-city kids versus
outer city kids rural kids do you think
rural kids don't become doctors because
their music is better what I don't know
why we're all kids because some people
choose to become doctors some people
choose not to become doctors I don't
know why people make the choices they
are I just want all kids aren't shooting
each other like black people are in the
inner cities I don't know like rural
kids I shoot meth and I sit around you
think rural kids are on the same level
as urban black kids I don't know I don't
have a problem with shooting math as
long as not shooting each other like
black people do
[Laughter]
[Music]
holy [ __ ] boys arguing for I don't know
but I think black people can make
choices and you seem to think they can
you're telling me that black people
can't make the right choice even though
white people make it you want to make
all these special programs to target
black people these programs don't target
white people why do you think black
people need all this help that white
people don't need you kind of sound like
the racists to me no no I want to reach
every person who doesn't think they can
make it I don't care about the color of
the skin then why are you advocating for
programs for inner-city blacks why
aren't you advocating for these same
programs for white people and who would
even pay for these programs for white
people they don't kill themselves like
black people do I'm advocating for it
for any kind of like mal mal education
okay I just never see liberals talking
about how white people need this help
it's always targeted towards black
people and minorities know you've been
reading around liberals let's look at
successful this is hard right it's it
like somewhat honestly but these are
hard cut when people like this [ __ ]
stew but it's a really [ __ ] hard
conversation so what I always try to do
is bring it back from the kind of like
compassionate level right so like like
white people have no [ __ ] compassion
these people celebrate Lauren southern
blocking [ __ ] dead immigrants being
like voted in from Germany
these people have no compassion that's
the problem so I'm a man of compassion
you can always bring it back to the
individual level like right so like like
or like why shouldn't my program which
I'm advocating to black people also work
for poor rural White's because poor more
real White's don't kill themselves like
black people dude aren't shooting each
other like they are they're shooting up
right sure but I don't know is that big
of a problem I maybe I'm a libertarian
and I'm okay with drugs so they want to
do methods not killing each other I mean
that's cool but you're also allowing you
to killed so let's not do that okay yeah
I guess if you want to make programs to
solve inner city or if you want to make
we're going to sell real meth things I
guess that's fine but yeah [ __ ] me all
right yeah I mean songs are not hurting
other people this whole this whole
approach I think we kind of reacted
right was exactly yeah it's predicated
on reaching out to their their core
beliefs right so if they're if they're
kind of like they believe that like
agency is a thing you should appeal to
agency right
yeah but the problem is it's not a thing
and if you appeal the agency always lose
this is kind of like this is my problem
when I'm talking about like the I don't
think you can appeal to agency you have
to peel back that you've got to go
really deep if a person legitimately
believes these things you've got to run
so far back like [ __ ] your ability to
make good decisions is compromised even
if you're [ __ ] tired you know like
these things are shown to have that in
psyche and actual experiments are shown
to have detrimental impacts on your
ability to make good decisions you know
like that but like that's you've got to
cover like two hours of ground in order
to deal with these people yeah so I
guess in terms of a rhetorical strategy
it would be like okay like someone
someone proposes that everyone has three
agency and and so you you force them to
explain your hypotheticals right you
essentially force them to assume the
position I just assumed where you just
bring up all these different examples
right and so they are forced to explain
why poor white people are doing things
versus poor black people and they have
to kind of expose themselves for the
like uninformed idiots they are but then
when I tried to do this with Sargon he
just retreats back to the I don't know
you told me you're joined it cuz that's
what I was trying to get Sargon to me
because what I wanted Sargon to admit
was and that was actually my specific
goal I want you to tell me that black
people are inferior to white people when
it comes to making choices that's what I
want cuz that's the only thing that your
position that logically leads to Sargon
but he would never made that he goes or
I don't know what the answer it's cuz
every time I said okay so I would say
like why are black people having someone
cuz they don't get married why don't
black people get married well because
they don't have to trace me okay why do
white people make the choice of black
well hey what's up hey can you hear me
now yeah I sure can
okay is that good enough because my mic
isn't working right now so I just have
to use my laptop microphone um yeah that
should be fine yeah yep my video is
normally like on my stream I'm streaming
is that okay let me yeah I can't really
there's not like an easy way for me to
get it under stream so it's not it's you
can leave it up if you want or not but
it's not nobody much you love him yeah
yeah I was just wondering you need to
like see me when I'm talking because I
guess that's not necessary sure I mean
it's up to you out okay okay how you
doing buddy I'm crazy like two days how
are you I'm doing okay I'm just doing
what I do
yeah I've been really enjoying your
content lately I discovered you failing
recently and I've been enjoying it yeah
well that's cool I'm glad to hear it
yeah I like how you a lot of the
critiques you know like the skeptic
community is like a lot of things I say
so yeah there are more people speaking
on that yeah and that's kind of what um
I guess that's kind of what we're here
to talk about today oh that's more what
I was interested in talking about I'm
not sure have you had anything in
particular no I was just I figured I
might just I would just ask you I would
just let you ask me questions and I
would answer always streaming right now
I do i yeah we're yeah okay um I think I
hear like a motorcycle on your laptop do
you hear that
no I don't
do I don't know what it is it is it like
the fan in the laptop spinning or
something yeah I can still hear it oh
okay what uh for your other microphone
what wasn't working on it or what kind
of microphone is it it's just like a h4
but maybe I should just call you my five
hope it just stopped okay
I'm guessing it's probably the internal
laptop fan and it's maybe good I'll tell
you if it turns on again okay okay all
right sorry no it's fine it's like I
said a huge deal but um um so I guess um
I don't man I don't even know where to
begin I mean everything you said I
mostly agree with I think there's not
much that's disagreeable I guess like my
um my big problem with with the skeptic
view and all of these people that are
tangental to it is that it seems like
people it seems like people are very
surface level and the way that they
engage with things like with very little
critical thought which is ironic given
their the skeptic community but a good
example of that and there's a million
examples but I'll focus on the one that
you kind of talk about in your video is
what is your responsibility in terms of
like the in terms of how people
interpret your messaging and it seems
like that's just something that most
skeptic people just have no desire in
the world whatsoever to deal with like
they've never thought about it they
don't care about it they don't know
anything about it
do you understand what I mean when I say
that in terms of like how people in
general I say yeah like hardline
theoretical kind of approach to politics
which doesn't really work I mean maybe
if they were like in a university
classroom they could talk about things
the way they do without really thinking
about how does this impact the the
broader world and how how will this fall
upon the ears of others ah but I realize
that you know politics doesn't really
work that way and and also like public
speech doesn't work that way either and
so I actually think it's really
dangerous because I think they're
injecting the wrong framework into into
public discourse you know in public
discourse you have to consider how
things will be interpreted by others
even though those other people may not
even interpret it the most charitably
you still have to consider that and be
mindful of that and just denying it is
is in my opinion very irresponsible yeah
I know say I agree with you a trillion
percent there and at the very least like
if somebody were to say you know I
understand that I'm having this impact
and I don't care even if I disagree with
them I could at least respect that point
of view but when I absolutely don't
respect is is what you're is what you're
saying is that people that pretend like
it doesn't happen like that drives me
crazy a really good example of that has
to do with the with the with the Trump
stuff right so somebody will make a
million videos making fun of feminists
making fun of sjw's making fun of
Democrats making fun of Hillary may get
mad at Bernie and then you know you'll
you'll say something I'm like hey like
you're you said you're a liberal right
like that's kind of weird that all you
do is spend all your time criticize and
they'll be like I don't support Trump I
never said that anywhere I don't support
Charles like okay well you understand
that you could like build like an entire
fanbase of like hardcore right-wing
people because of the type of content
you put out right well that's not my
fault if they interpret my message that
way that's not my fault that people see
it that way it was like oh yeah
in our strict sense of things of course
they can be a leftist and a backhaul
channel just criticizing the critics of
Trump like in the very strict sense I
mean they're not saying anything that's
you know against their leftist
principles per se by criticizing critics
of Trump or making fun of them but like
once again that is so technical that it
just ignores a whole body of meaning the
that is that is translated to whatever
audience so it says something when
you're only ever criticizing or making
in front of the critics of Trump rather
than ever like criticizing Trump it's a
there's subtext there and so like I
don't like using this term but there's
almost like an what's the word
monomaniacal technical interpretation of
everything do you know what I mean like
what I technically didn't like say
anything I know I'm not gonna bury the
word but i 100% know exactly what you're
saying yeah it's yeah yeah it's exactly
what I said before where people will
like spend all of their time criticizing
like one point of view and and then
you'll be like okay well it kind of
seems like you're they don't believe in
anything implicit like it sounds like
you're implicitly supporting the other
side ah show me a video where I made it
where I said I absolutely love Donald
Trump I bet you can't show me that
videos like okay well but you don't have
to put that video out to have everybody
think that that's what you feel you know
like when we're in the call with roaming
millennial and Lauren southern and Nick
Fuentes is talking about how he would
like electroshock therapy you know all
trans people it's like okay now you
might not think that but when you don't
say anything against it and when he goes
even further to say that like all women
belong at home women would be women just
wouldn't get sexually assaulted in the
workplace if they didn't go to the
workplace when you sit there silently
about it you know it kind of gives you
it seems I give like this implicit
approval of it but then they'll always
say like well you know like roaming
millennial well I didn't actually come
out and support anything that Nick said
in the conversations like okay well then
I'll then often off to that stream like
critics of how she acted on that stream
told her that you know talk about like
how he was basically telling me to get
electroshock therapy I mean she was like
retweeting those critics criticisms I'm
being like come on guys he never said
electroshock therapy like what do you
think that comes off as are you kidding
me
then I had an iota [ __ ] argument with
Nik Fuentes just the other day and he
retweeted me and basically said because
he talked about how Richard Spencer
should not speak so lightly or so easily
or so recklessly about you know child
pornography and stuff and think about
the impact that that has and i retweeted
them and said well maybe you shouldn't
directly [ __ ] around about the idea of
putting converting putting trans woman
through conversion therapy i Neera
treated me and told me like that's not
me being reckless that's my official
policy position yeah but oh he's just
trolling ride he's just [ __ ] trialing
i eventually deleted that might might my
tweets of him because his disgusting
followers started flooding my mind
notifications and stuff and I was like
okay this was a bad idea never mind but
when says is legitimately Fuentes and
and I pretty sure all sup are
legitimately like white nationalists are
you aware of that yes okay yeah like
full-on yeah yeah like folder yeah it's
it's hard to pick out who isn't who
isn't these days because some people dog
whistle it's so hard it makes it hard to
keep track but um yeah they're full on
like admittedly of it in terms of what
you talkin out there like there's this
like when when grummy Molina is like
well he didn't actually say that and
this is one of the things that drives me
those crazy is it we're addressing the
crazies when you talk about things like
economics or social issues you are
talking about incredibly complicated
nuanced topics and they want to remove
like all of the new ones from everything
and try to boil it down to these really
easy yes to no questions I remember when
I was talking to Sargon about um you
know like the plight of black people in
the United States and in Sargon's entire
solution to the black you know problems
in the US was literally like they just
need to get married and the family will
fix all of our problems and like I'm
trying to explain to him like okay well
marriage is usually something that
happens after you're somewhat successful
you know there are precursors to getting
married and he's like okay show me the
law that keeps them from getting married
and it's like nothing works that way
like nothing is ever going to be that
simple and you run into the same things
with women as well right what people
will say things like I'm like what women
don't experience discrimination today
show me one law that says a woman can't
go
to college for something I get a jobs
I'm just like dude like nothing is it
doesn't work that way
okay no and it's like so frustrating cuz
how can somebody be so stupid like it's
anything with racism or discrimination
like okay like black people
there is no racism against black people
in United States today really how can
you say that
show me the KKK people like hanging
black people off of trees oh well I
guess you got me
yeah you know I'm talking to you in like
two breaks is that directed that's what
I kind of was for for a long time but
then I saw like the rise of like actual
like racists and anti-semites yeah and
also like more like personally in love
with regarding my work I saw like actual
transphobic people under the guise of
like the aunt yes you're W community
this get to community and moreover I saw
the skeptic people it's making excuses
for them like they still do yeah and
then I realized what the [ __ ] is going
on
and then I learn more about like I
became more sensitive to like the
subtleties the implicit stuff because
yeah you know like I think as I said in
my video like I kind of thought of like
this generation of like people who are
politically minded who feel who are
overreacting to I guess like a very PC
culture where everything can be
interpreted as racist or bigoted which
is also obviously not good you know
there's obviously the extreme on the
left as well but it's so over correcting
that now we throw the idea away of like
subtext and implicit unlike and you know
the more subtle interpretations of
things that are just as if not more
important ways of in which meaning is
conveying my I think a lot of these
people are they're are so communicating
a message an intact
an unintended message that they well
that they don't intend to and it's not a
message that they actually stand by I
don't think but they're just too naive
and and narrow-minded I guess to really
see that I don't know yeah it's a lack
of emotional intelligence sometimes I
feel like and that's like that's
probably the thing that hurt
me the most is it like when I look at
are you familiar like some of with
Sargon's work unfortunately yeah okay so
like Sargon is somebody that I hate
Sargon I hate all of his work but I
really don't think that Sargon is racist
and I don't think he hates women I
really don't believe that I don't think
like deepen his core I don't think it
believes that but the problem is that
his messaging is so on point that it
like it would be the exact same coming
from somebody that actually did like hey
minorities wait until he gets like crazy
like like Islamophobic crazy
anti-immigration crazy Pro lepen crazy
Pro brexit like his positions he's like
his is his applied positions become like
indistinguishable from somebody that is
like filled with extreme hatred and it
becomes really difficult I always say
that like like an example I give it's
like if I had ten if I had ten racist
people in the room I would rather deal
with ten racist people than with three
racist people and then seven quote
unquote centrists that are kind of like
making excuses for him because it
becomes like really hard to call out
somebody for being racist when you've
got people that are constantly making
excuses for their behavior and that's
something that I've noticed I'm that you
kind of mentioned earlier is that people
are out like Fuentes talking about
Spencer like I think you should be
really careful about your position on
child privy blah blah blah like people
are very charitable
especially the skeptics are insanely
charitable towards people that they are
like politically aligned with but if
it's somebody that they're against could
you imagine if like a left-leaning
person had made Spencer's argument I'm
not trying to be too self-serving here
but like if a left-leaning person had
made like an argument similar dispensers
they would be jumping all over them
about how this guy loves child porn bla
bla bla bla bla but because it's
somebody that they politically aligned
with to some extent they're gonna make
tons of excuses for why what they said
is okay and you know why yeah isn't that
kind of disturbing that's our holds
interests in effect by their actions
they align themselves with the all right
you know they're so supercritical and
uncharitable they will pick the worst
example of an SJW yeah then they're like
the most charitable towards the yeah
right
so like this that tell me that you're
aligning yourself with the alright and
that's disturbing that in today's day
and age what we call centrist at least
on YouTube are aligning themselves with
fascist yeah and like I mean you saw
sticks recently come out as like the
left is scarier than the ought right so
I'm gonna align myself with the
alt-right I did you see these tweaks by
Stix I think he may get a video about it
yeah he did all right in his debate with
Spencer yeah but I was a little bit like
that I wasn't too sure of him something
didn't seem right and then I sold those
tweets and I was like okay yeah that I
don't know about that guy that one of
the creep actually what I don't really
know sexy that I described to his
channel just like last week and then I
unsubscribe because he was making too
many too much content with really
uninteresting titles so yeah one of the
one of the things that I thought was so
[ __ ] hilarious
you do remember you've seen like the
mouthy Buddha videos unlike the Nazi
Germany [ __ ] or whatever man like mafia
does another guy that I can't really
quiet
ah so I suck yeah so like this was
hilarious to me is that he presents the
most sympathetic view possible to Hitler
and Nazi Germany the most possible the
the highest degree of sympathy you ever
show for Hitler videos have been being
nice to kids and giving all the reasons
why the Jewish Question is valid and you
know all this stuff and then when people
call them out on it people like hey you
know like this is kind of comes off as
literally like Nazi propaganda my dude
and everybody's like in that even Sargon
I remember this this um because they
probably never heard this right so one
person said it they're like oh well
we're just steel Manning the argument
we're just making their argument as
strong as possible we're just stealing
any arguments that's really interesting
so are you telling you them that you
believe in steel Manning arguments if I
go into your YouTube channel and I look
at some feminist critique are you
engaging with actual like feminism in
terms of like in an academic sense are
you engaging with feminist literature
with feminist speakers and actual like
hard to deal with feminist problems or
you literally just copy pasting stupid
quotes from [ __ ] Tumblr and Twitter
or blue haired women screaming in a
youtube video and you're saying that
that represents all of feminism why is
it that the only argument you're
interested in steel Manning is literal
Nazism but you won't steal man feminism
or still man you know anything related
to the LGBT community or still like
anything related to liberal politics oh
my god this new you're speaking the
truth right now but like the things
about the Buddha is like
I have really long time signing or not
he actually deemed me like after I post
my video and he said he actually really
appreciated the video that I made so
like I'm having a hard time too son
summing him up in terms of like where he
is but I do agree with you that his
videos on the alt-right was like a red
flag for me mm-hmm
but yeah so that's the thing is like the
left often I find people on the left
they often have a bit more like I guess
emotional maturity or they're more
sensitive to like the subtle messaging
and the subtext of what think people are
saying and so they often would you know
call people racists or misogynistic
whatever and it it comes across as they
have no evidence because nobody actually
directly said anything sexist but then
like in my experience they were right
about a lot of these people do you know
what I mean and so I found that's the
lift there kind of not that I think I
just realized they're much better at
summing up the character of people than
the right and they're also there are
always right but I just realized they're
more right than I thought they were
about the character of people yeah their
messaging is just really [ __ ]
aggressive sometimes which hurts a lot
one thing that I criticized the left or
or I guess progressive politics a lot
for is that like we need more words to
describe things so for instance like the
and this sounds really bad right it
depending how you clip this out of
context right but you know 20 years ago
if somebody said that they were raped
you know like that's something that
conveys an immediate meaning to me of a
horrible despicable act that is just
absolutely disgusting and you know like
hey buddy how you doing who invited you
in here
you did okay what's up buddy what I'm
gonna talk about - how far have you been
hold on one sec I got a super chat that
says [ __ ] nervosa 6-9 6-9 what a stupid
[ __ ] Wow
you have anything to say to him yeah
sorry okay a farm even push Schwartz d
platforming oh I'm very far down the
only reason I don't is because I'm too
lazy to go and do all this should I need
to do
why because I just I'm amazed like I
don't understand how you kept such high
faith in humanity just it's not Morse
it's not faith it's that I need a
criteria and by which I can deploy from
somebody that I can objectively argue
for which is difficult the big problem
with me for deep platforming is that 2d
platformer somebody it almost feels like
you're saying my philosophy is
objectively superior because like
because I need it because what I need is
I need an argument by which I can deep
lie from another that wouldn't allow me
to get deep platform because I wouldn't
wanna be your platform right right
so like usually what go ahead I I don't
know I guess like mainly how do you keep
any faith in humanity at all I lose
faith every single day every day the
clock ticks and I lose another ounce of
faith in humanity it's only got a lower
as I've grown older so that's that's
very sad yeah oh but how would society
be platform people like if society were
to do it political violence is the term
Irish Letta used which I mean I think is
any way of like censoring a person or
whatever through UX through legal means
so like for example Twitter would be
platform people buy if you share fake
news or something like that leads to be
my equity right like if you post lives
or something like that you video
platforms on Twitter is something they
would band
counts like something like that I don't
know it'd have to be very rigid and very
specific in your set of criteria you
think we should start moving towards
this or I do personally yeah but I mean
you the criteria would have to be like
very strictly to develop Donna it bears
a lot of thought I know that the thing
is that I know that the answer is
complicated but I'm in that arena like I
don't know like how far I would go but I
know I would be passed the line for sure
yeah yeah people posting screenshots of
headlines
that's a ban that's an insta ban I would
invest so much money into [ __ ] extra
testing robots if you posted a tweet of
a headline and then you have over 10,000
followers and you give a strong opinion
about it as soon as you tweet that thing
if the bots had already read the article
it would ask you three basic questions
about the article and if you couldn't
answer in 20 seconds it insta ban to
your account and it stabs you through
your computer every computer would come
with a stabbing device it stabs you with
information right buddy yes that's right
yeah what did you think I meant I
thought you might so so like okay
there's somebody like war ski like how
was he supposed to platform somebody
responsibly like what would he do to
actually that'd be a nuts oh so I'm not
even on that like platforming people
responsibly like I maybe I don't know if
Andy isn't it like if you bring on a
bunch of Nazis you don't challenge their
opinion I don't consider that to be
falling under the purview of what I
would be going after it would be going
after people who are intentionally or
with gross negligence or recklessness
spreading fake news that would be like
my starting ground and that's the only
part that I'm at right now so like I
don't want to deep platform offensive or
horrible ideas I just want to do
platform people that [ __ ] lie that's
my big [ __ ] thing because I can argue
with anybody that wants to have a
fact-based argument but I can't deal
with people that will just [ __ ] lie
or spread fake news I can't deal with
that it's not possible so like if
somebody wants to come on and argue like
listen I want to create an ethnos state
I'm gonna get all the blacks and all the
Mexicans out of here like fine that's
fine that person gets a platform they
can argue
[ __ ] I love free speech it's a goddamn
beautiful thing but if that guy wants to
get up and make that argument by
spreading a bunch of [ __ ] news
around by Lena [ __ ] Breitbart
articles that have [ __ ] sources by
quoting headlines and sniping data and
not really making an honest argument
[ __ ] that guy take him out okay so they
would have to do research into that
field in order to platform that person
sure yeah maybe I mean that's just kind
of what I'm understanding so you'd think
they cuz you wouldn't be able to discern
from fake news from not unless you
understood at least some respective
amount of a certain field yeah probably
I mean it would take effort to do this I
don't even know this is realistic I just
know that I morally I would be okay with
it so like for instance an example of
this would be like Blaire white posting
and she does this a lot she'd be number
one of the chopping block
something like posting an article
headline and then making a snarky tweet
that makes it clear that you haven't
engaged with the article at all people
like Ian Chong would be way past the
chopping block where he brings up an
article that he wrote about a topic to
me without even me provoking it and then
I know more about it than he does and
he's spreading a bunch of [ __ ] and
lies and rumors about it that's an
instant job and he would lose his
[ __ ] job he should lose his job and
should be barred from being a journalist
in United States the next decade at
least that's the type of [ __ ] we're
getting out of here
oh yeah Andy well I mean I'm gonna call
it me I'm gonna call it the IQ no state
okay got it okay sorry go ahead you're
going down a dark path
we're very yeah it's a very dark path
yeah oh yeah my my biggest fear is
people like Ian Chong who write like
articles and then they don't know
anything about the topic to talk about
later really like disheartening yeah I
don't know I don't know there's a
realistic way to implement my show it
probably isn't I'm not sure I just know
I'd be okay with it like if people were
campaigning or some [ __ ] like before if
I see like Sargon's Twitter or like
Ian's Twitter gets shut down like I'll
make a tweet and I'll say something like
I don't think we should ever celebrate
an opposition voice being shut down
platform I think that that's strictly
bad and we should always welcome
diversity of opinions and all of that no
matter how offensive they are today if I
say like Ian's Twitter gets shut down
like I'm gonna start tweeting some mad
[ __ ] and I'm gonna say I'm glad for it
and I hope he never [ __ ] comes back to
any social media platform right right
like I think it would be difficult to
have a bar high enough the people you
know that you wouldn't have a fear of
hitting it yourself
but I think there's a sufficient bar
that people like they room and I think
it's an easy example that shouldn't have
a platform well no I'm not sure I would
have to think about Reuben so again I
want to be really really really careful
here okay so remember primarily my value
system is usually going after what is
true I don't care about political
agendas I have no desire to push a
political agenda whatsoever
I don't care I'm no interest no desire
so I think that all offensive ideas
should be spoken about so pedophilia
incest Ku Klux Klan Nazism ethno states
all of that [ __ ] communism whatever the
[ __ ] all of these ideas should be up for
discussion I'm okay with that and I'm
okay with people providing a platform to
discuss these ideas the ideas don't
bother me it's just engaging in
disinformation or misinformation or
reckless like reckless reporting that is
like horrendously disingenuous like
repeatedly over and over again like
people make mistakes I understand that
but like when you do it over and over
and over again like these are the people
that like I don't think should ever have
a platform it's like Ian Chong is an
easy one he would be on the chopping
block
Blair White would be on the chopping
block Lauren southern would be on the
chopping block yeah yeah I don't have a
I don't have name drop too many people
um but the reason I specifically think
of Ruben instantly is because he really
really interviews a lot of people who
are far to the alt-right uh-huh and even
further so and I feel like platforming
those people and giving them just
basically a softball interview to pitch
their platform I feel like really does a
disservice to everybody that's watching
I don't I don't hear that I mean II it
gets the ideas out there even if you
might find them offensive or horrible I
just get say these I mean do you make
all softball interviews illegal than
their well no not at all but I mean
isn't that isn't that your point though
cuz isn't that sort of fake news on on
steroids no I don't think so the
pinnacle of that
well like so here's a question if you
want to go after people that give
softball interviews to extremists what
about somebody that has a channel where
they interview like contra points or the
interview I'm Sean and genic somebody
and they give them all softball
questions would that be no that I feel
like that's entirely different if your
channel give me some Lauer's pls very
clearly a stilted slant you know you're
just an interview channel but Dave Rubin
I don't feel like is presented as such
it's presented as the marketplace of
ideas which are very clearly isn't yeah
maybe I like to focus on I like to focus
on fake news because I can do a hard
lying objective like this is [ __ ]
you're screenshotting article headlines
you have no [ __ ] idea what you're
talking about
like you're lucky you're lying through
your teeth that's easy to target saying
somebody like dave rubin disingenuously
disingenuously presents his politics i
feel like that line is a lot harder to
walk yeah maybe so maybe so if there was
like a nice easy way to do it maybe but
even on my thing there's not a nice easy
way to do it you know so I'm not sure
well I feel like if you set the bar high
enough I mean obviously your examples
her get too broad of a net but yeah I
feel like a bar could be set high enough
that it's really hard to hit but people
could hit it maybe I don't know if you
if you keep spreading just
disinformation out there but mainly I'm
tree care ease about the platforming
though like why thanks for streaming
their platform to talk to people and
wait what's right show me show buddy
wait can you say thanks oh so okay so
when you say Warsi doesn't or easy
responsibly platform people should heed
not be allowed to carry on that platform
or oh no Andy can Annie comply from
every once I just don't like the didn't
acknowledge the reality of it I mean if
he I don't think she believes any moral
issue yeah true one is divine revelation
one is the revealed truth and one is a
relative social service in your word so
I would say that that whether
inclusion there that I had sure
you're really forward without you mr.
min huh
no I'm just hanging out a good time I'm
having a great time why are you having a
good time oh yeah it's pretty dank buddy
but if there's who like sticks out to
you the most of everybody that you've
debated I can't possibly pick that I
don't know there's a list I can make
like a tier list so like s tier oh yeah
retardation that would be the Brittany
girl that would be talk of trucks that
would be [ __ ]
those Jesus Andy was a [ __ ] huh much
love fam thanks anyways those those guys
are the S tier idiots I consider these
guy may be dank EULA goes up there or
Den Kudo Thank You Allah whatever is
[Music]
yeah those are the guys so these dang
killers up there with Brittany venti and
so these guys are people that I consider
beyond reason they are just so
absolutely stupid that they're incapable
of engaging in conversation about
anything more complicated than like what
do they wanted their cheeseburger like
these guys are way too [ __ ] stupid to
have any of these types of conversations
but not only that the reason why they
make the S tier list is because they're
also smug as [ __ ] about their ignorance
they're really smug Brittany is very
haughty very smug did I put a in on that
list
Ian goes on the list - Ian is very smug
very haughty very stupid talk--i very
smug very stupid did you guys catch when
he was shouting I know the David card
study it was the Borja study like he's
didn't even know these words mean he's
just like throwing random [ __ ] and
seeing like what sticks into a wall
Tonka trucks Britney and then dank EULA
like laughing at me when he's like would
you sue the press if they slandered you
like I'm not the president dude like
that guy those four and then Ian yeah
Ian goes there yeah those guys are STR
retards I think do you think there's any
way you could reach people like that
maybe but yeah but I would it would
require me to change my rhetoric in ways
that I don't want to well no no no I
don't mean you specifically I just mean
in general like you think saying oh yeah
they're retards you communicate with
retards like you would another [ __ ]
sure you tell them stories narratives
you what you would do is you were trying
to sell these you would try to sell
ideas to these people using narratives
because that's like [ __ ]
friendly-like eighty-eight friendly
political you know political tooling or
whatever like manipulation for instance
there was a [ __ ] we read about this
timestream a while ago there was a
psychological there was like a psych
surveyor or super report or whatever or
a study where they what they did was
they polled people about certain values
right certain values that you might have
and people would have negative to
positive reaction to what they would do
is they would create a story i think
they would either read i think they read
a story where the main character
exhibited some of these values anytime
you read this story where the main
character exhibited some of these values
you considered negative you would have
less of a negative idea of these values
when you were surveyed after reading the
story like you could you can use like a
protagonist to sell like morally
unfavorable characteristics to an
audience does that make sense that what
i'm saying yeah something yeah yeah
anecdote yeah sure like there's probably
a lot of people would say well selling
drugs is always wrong but then if they
watch all five seasons of Breaking Bad
maybe they're like well you know I could
definitely see some totally legitimate
scenarios we should sell drugs you know
like they you know because they've got
like a protagonist they can identify
with right this is how dumb people get
foster new ideas somebody tells them a
story um it's kind of like Inception you
plant the idea along with the story they
read they protagonist I understand him
and then that protagonist carries with
them you know some sort of moral or
value that the person might not have
been so keen to consider before but
after this story oh yeah he had that
thing and it wasn't that bad I kind of
liked that yeah it's not as bad as I
thought it was this would be how you
would sell people like Tonka or Britney
Orion or thank you like this is how you
would sell them more complicated or more
nuanced political ideas you would have
to find a way to sell it to them in a
narrative that they can understand right
right so you'd have to you have to root
like the free shoes like um like the
ethical child porn are the ethical CP
yeah is there any way you could
narrative Li frame that yes sure yeah
easily yeah if we wanted to make make
some some we want to make some [ __ ]
our story up sure
what will we do so so one you would have
to present like a clear and present
danger okay so let's say okay well I
knew his psyche I knew a friend okay but
this guy was a PhD psychologist is where
I got the idea from a PhD psychologist
so he was telling this crazes amazing
story okay
so he knew a guy I'm not gonna say his
name obviously because it's bad but
we'll call him John right this guy had
been stalking this kid like every single
day after school and this guy was gonna
[ __ ] rape this kid it was the worst
thing ever he was legitimately pedophile
child abuser it was horrible he had
leave these plans drew up and everything
it was the worst thing ever
however in the city they were in they
put out a bulletin that they were doing
a study on new ways to treat pedophiles
where they were making child porn
available to them in order to treat them
and this pedophile actually caught wind
of that study it was like by total
coincidence don't I remember if he saw
like an ad on in a newspaper or some
[ __ ] but he caught one of the study and
contacted the dude and the guy actually
came in for therapy and as part of the
therapy he actually during his
counseling revealed to the psychologist
that he was like two days away from
raping this kid at the school that [ __ ]
is crazy to me I can't believe he was
about to rape the dude and he came in
they did the study and then supposedly
today because as part of the study
conditions they have to continue to
check in he hasn't abused a kid that
kind of [ __ ] is really cool to me right
this is the way that you would sell this
to a to a [ __ ] [ __ ] right because
if they hear this story well now they're
like oh [ __ ] like well now now that I
know the story like oh well yeah that
kid was gonna get dick kid we couldn't
get raped indica and the guy made him
stop well I you know dekhti maybe that's
a really good idea right now now all of
a sudden it's a lot more palatable
because you've got a narrative that you
can tie the value to right now yeah that
makes sense so you would sort of push
that as like the front line if I was
interested in yeah if I was interested
in political narrative yeah oh yeah in
general yeah if you want to bring people
to your site in general selling it via
narrative is probably the best approach
the best rhetorical approach yeah did
you ever see the debate I had with that
one lady we're halfway through the
debate I realized that we were never
going to agree and I just started making
up stories oh yeah and you always had
one more person in your yeah I had a
girl that was gonna go to the Olympics
that did it yeah and she by the end of
that debate she started to agree with me
like she became much more agreeable
after I told story after story after
story yeah it's it people are really a
bummer sometimes I [ __ ] hate people
yeah yeah I just every one of you you
know you have so much faith in them and
the redemption arcs and all that stuff
and they all just fall I just can't
believe it like I feel like the JAF
stuff really could have been encapsulate
to the hypocrisy perfectly yeah like
my dearest friend oh boy what's up hey
how's it going I'm doing I'm doing it
I'm here oh yeah
this isn't a debate by the way um you
just talked a lot about the EU and I
don't talk about it that much to be fair
I don't claim that's just rude no I was
I was pulling a conversation on Twitter
I think you do a really good job of like
communicating and verbalizing or like
the different wait let me let me throw
you a bump because I hear okay you do a
really good job of like explaining the
objectives of the EU and why exactly and
and why exactly we need greater levels
of like say financial integration and
you do a good job of like defending free
trade and defending immigration but I
think kind of where you fall a little
bit short is of your critique of the
euro skeptic side of the table and to to
preface this real quickly but I abhor
waiting oh yeah go ahead oh I've heard
some critiques that sound like they
could be legitimate
so like the idea that certain countries
might have more weight within the euro
zone that they can use to bully around
other countries or that the way that the
currency is manipulated might like
positively impact some countries and
negatively impact others I do
acknowledge that there are probably good
critiques that I have not engaged with
of the of the EU but I should have said
that unity resign of the EU but those
are never the critiques that people
publicly notes oh yeah I agree
so that's kind of like my goal here is
just to kind of make you aware of the
euro skeptic position and by the way
your euro skeptic has nothing to do with
like to skip the community of you know I
know I know this is kind of like the
position to be kinda so almost I can be
right back okay I think
he comes back Jeff's on the call now
destiny let's talk
hey back yep hear me yeah yeah so
basically I'm talking a bit I'm not
trying like defend something like brexit
specifically but I think the Euroskeptic
position is a lot more rooted yeah has a
lot of ability in it actually I kind of
goes back to the origins of the EU what
I think a lot of people don't really get
is that the EU wasn't the brainchild of
economists saying hey you guys should
like we should all make this huge
political organization and make all
these you know countries come together
yeah it was like something and European
we should all live together [ __ ] or
whatever right yeah it was like
basically the idea was proposed and
pushed by the politicians not really the
economists you know and it's not because
the economists don't like the objectives
like free trade immigration financial
integration is because the Economist's
were skeptical about the ability of the
EU to actually have any sort of
political unification which is why they
weren't sure or they were skeptical many
of them were about the actual like
long-term viability of the project sure
so this would be like liberals that
bleeding-heart liberals that advocate
for open borders and immigration without
responsibly managing like the fiscal
side of things are actually creating
proper incentives to have immigration
work right or a little bit it's actually
kind of like and to bring up a point
you've made and the point you made in
the past and arguing with brexit err
you've said like where would the United
States be if the US had never like
economically and politically integrated
yeah unified but I think the key point
about the the Euroskeptic position is
that the United States was already
financially integrated before the
political unification happened and I
think there's this misconception that
people have when they think about
globalization and as conception is that
people think that the economy is
globalized like globalization is here
but the reality is that like we aren't
even close to globalization I guess
barely just started and if you look at
Europe and you look at the economies of
Europe they aren't even close to the
levels of financial integration that we
had in the United States before we
actually came together and unified
politically so the concern of the Israel
so just a challenge on that is that
really true because I thought that they
had standardized almost everything
within the EU now that if you want to
trade from one country to another in the
EU it's incredibly simple to do so you
using a common currency you you all of
the laws and regulations and everything
are consistent from one state to the
next
it's alright I'll say what you're saying
is that the EU is basically they're
trying to promote financial integration
right yeah
but the idea is that like they're trying
to use sort of this political entity to
promote financial integration whereas
like the US didn't do that the financial
integration happened before the
political unity so there wasn't some
central political authority like forcing
integration in the u.s. it happened
before the states came together sure you
know I'd be fair there's more than just
the political entity - you've got the
European Central Bank as well that does
monetary policies well that's that's
even worse because when you have a
monetary policy where you have a
monetary union especially it's really
important that the economies of that
monetary zone like share some similarity
right yeah monetary policy is super
important because I become that that the
monetary policy doesn't reflect the best
interest of every nation all the time
exactly so then the question kind of
becomes like well this collection of
countries might make a good a good
common currency area if they're similar
economies right they're dissimilar
economies it's probably not a good idea
to have a common currency well there's
this really interesting analysis by JP
Morgan Chase you should look at I put it
in chat right now you should open that
one stream also Skype it to you okay
cool yeah so basically JPMorgan Chase
said okay how can we measure like the
similarity of these theoretical economic
or currency zones and basically what it
did was this analyst analysis takes a
hundred factors that are related to like
labor goods and market efficiency which
are coming with the letter yeah and
basically the idea is that they measure
the similarity of theoretical currency
areas or theoretical monetary zones and
on the left side you have like market
economies of Latin America which are by
this measure like increase I'm yeah yet
similar and therefore arguably by this
measurement more ripe for some sort of
economic unification and then you have
like the reconstitution of the Ottoman
Empire circa 1800 if you kind of just
force those countries and do it into an
economic Union that's their similarity
and they yeah like you said all the way
over there yeah you have countries
beginning with a little utter em are
coincidentally more similar than the
countries of the of the EU so I think
when you kind of like a
something like brexit it's like I don't
necessarily support brexit I don't
really know what the best course of
action is now but I think the idea is
basically that if you try to force a
political integration into a body a
country that doesn't have sufficient
financial integration that these like
problems are predictable exist and they
were they were predicted like this what
the contents were saying was that like
these economies are so different it's
too premature to kind of force them
together into this Union they aren't
gonna be amenable to sharing political
power and it cut when I see your
critique on Twitter to be fair where I
know you kind of like embellish a bit
but I don't think I don't think it's
just like [ __ ] racist nationalism
that's the reason there might be
exhibited reasoning not to vote for it
but I think a lot of the reasoning was
rooted in immigration and post regs and
polling has reflected as much that a lot
of things it I think you're right but
that's kind of my point which is that
like it should be predictable of at the
end to give you kind of like another
here's a hypothetical example like would
it be better for the people of Mexico
and the people of Canada in the long
term if they would just accept like a
North American economic Union and we
like economic union like sought to
sought to diminish trade restrictions
and increased flow of Labor bruss border
it's like that probably wouldn't be
enough - yeah ya know like the EU
equivalent for them for their for North
America right like that really would if
they would but I don't blame I wouldn't
blame Mexicans or Canadians I throw no
we don't want Washington to have any
political give up any of our sovereignty
to Washington kind of but I mean they
already but my argument is usually that
you already do
like Mexico gives up some song you give
up some of your sawed up some of your
sovereignty every time you negotiate
with a country right by by definition
almost I I don't buy that at all because
they have you know you have like a
unilateral authority to slick stock a
negotiation that's different than
forcing a common currency well you have
a unilateral authority to withdraw from
the EU or - right right that's what they
exactly that's what that's what they're
doing and that's kind of where I am it's
like I see brexit leaving the EU and I
don't say like oh that's just a problem
of nationalism it's kind of like well
that's a predictable well but the
problem behind it the problems it was
all rooted in nationalism like the vast
majority of people's opinions were
rooted like it yeah I guess here's where
a difference like I don't think I
wouldn't call it a problem if we're like
thinking just purely logically it makes
sense to me that if you go to a citizen
of a country that they're gonna all
or inherently care more about their own
country than they care about a foreign
country and that's really the essence of
nationalism so it's kind of like even if
you disagree with that I accept the
logic of it I don't think we should
expect that people ought care more or
equally for foreign countries to do
their own so the problem I have with
like the hardline or anti brexit
position it's kind of like well what do
you expect people are going to care more
about the country than they care about
foreign countries and the fact that
Brooks I guess I roll I roll more
Internet like toxic like nationalism as
an idea of just putting your country
above others isn't necessarily bad it's
this it's this kind of exceptionalism
that rolls in with nationalism and this
blatant disregard and the willingness to
even make sacrifices
just for nationalistic purposes that
kind of bothers me and I guess that kind
of segues into another point I might
make sure you is so because this is
actually something that when you talk
about a union between between North
America and like if I was Mexico or
Canada I would always be against that
just because it seems like relegating my
currency to another country be scary how
would you feel about the EU if it
existed as a unified political entity
meaning all of like the laws and the
tariffs and everything were sorted out
but everybody still had their own
individual currency do you think that
would be too much of a [ __ ] or
ineffective or maybe not four or five
currencies and like the more integrated
economies could could have their own
currency or something oh I know I would
think that having not a common currency
is like the big issue show if they had
just maintained that kind of like the
political attempt and even like the
trade like you were saying that would
have been far superior to the eurozone
the euro zone is a death disaster
basically one of two things I'm saying
they should have had their own
currencies or no no they should yeah
they should be allowed to have their own
currency the euro is a terrible idea
basically one of two things is gonna
happen with the euro either Europe is
basically gonna consolidate under a
European federal government and they're
gonna fiscally integrate all of the
economies of EU despite how different
they're they're all gonna fiscally
integrate or else the euro is just gonna
collapse and it came to a head basically
during the European debt crisis and they
just kind of kicked the can down the
road because the ECB basically bailed
out the countries that were really
struggling which were like Greece and
then after Greece it was Portugal Italy
Spain Ireland
so yeah the common currency is a real
disaster
because you look at this graph like
think forcing a common currency among
countries that are just this different
it's just like horrible well so here's a
question why is it in the United States
but we have vastly different types of
economies from state to state why does a
common currency work for us because the
US was already financially integrated
massively before we had the common
currency but like for example the lever
of the level of labor integration that
was in the US and there like the 19th
century is like far far higher than
exists in Europe today because the
economies of Europe have different
languages different cultures I go back
hundreds of thousands of years the the
EU is extremely far off from being as
financially integrated as the US was
when the u.s. adopted a common currency
and that's the problem so you agree with
you when you gotta when you talk about
this and you say we should promote
financial integration but I think kind
of the problem with the EU is that it
puts the cart before the horse or try
and do is that gonna work or isn't gonna
work it's hard to say I don't know
honestly what the best thing to do now
is but that's kind of the danger is that
you're trying to force political unity
on people when the economies are still
so different and kinda if I like this
seems probably impossible but what
you're arguing is that the EU takes a
top-down approach whereas you're
thinking that a bottom-up approach where
you begin to integrate the economies in
ways that make them more similar so
whether by language or removing barriers
for migrating labor or [ __ ] like that
that you would rather see different
types of similarities exist in this way
then it would be slowly built up to a
large entity rather than making it all a
large entity and then hopefully forcing
this integration from the top-down kind
of very yeah that's exactly right so I
favor I would favor theoretically a more
decentralized approach but now we kind
of we haven't taken that route of taking
the EU so am i saying now break up the
EU that's not my position but yeah
theoretically we should have taken a
more decentralized approach to
encouraging financial integration
another point of that is like when we're
talking about free trade you know free
trade is just free trade right like just
don't tax the foreign country [ __ ] don't
appreciate it yeah yeah don't punch free
trade is not like you have to be in our
political club and if you leave our
political club then we're gonna [ __ ] you
over okay so the I do think the EU on
net has promoted free trade but the
entire idea of the EU that is like you
have to be part of
club in order to get the benefits that's
not really free trade that's just kind
of like protectionism in a different way
that's definitely better than like the
past mercantilism right well yeah that
like we want you to join our club
because if you don't then you're going
to arbitrarily tariffs [ __ ] or whatever
but now we have more control over
everybody in the club like in the United
States isn't it illegal I could be
totally wrong on this but in the United
States I imagine it's probably illegal
for one state to tariff another or is it
not yeah exactly like that is part of
the reason but it's also you can see now
with brexit is that the EU is kind of
holding the axe above Great Britain's
head like well we're not gonna promise
you we're gonna give you a trade
conditions as well as you had when you
remember so it's kind of like they're
using that as a bargaining tool to keep
them in the political organization which
it makes sense like I understand why
they're doing it yeah they would do the
RAM in the United States right like if
if we got to a point where some state
was like we are succeeding seceding like
[ __ ] you well I mean we our political
message to them is not gonna be like
okay well California you know like yeah
we'll negotiate with you guys went to
secede like that's my like we would be
very harsh to them as well right right
right but my main point is that like I
was saying that we can promote free
trade without having a centralized
approach like I like you were saying I
would prefer a more decentralized
approach and on the topic of nationalism
because this is kind of where I actually
do disagree with you and I don't
attribute nationalism to like the
reasons people are skeptical of things
like trade and immigration because like
the general public's kind of disposition
towards those ideas seems to kind of
come from a bias that exists when people
think of people who aren't educated on
economics approach these ideas and this
actually been empirically validated
there's a book called myth of the
rational the myth of the rational boater
by Kaplan basically what he did a really
interesting experiment basically he had
a list of question survey questions he
would ask economists who would rape an
agreement rating on a statement an
example of a statement would be like oil
prices are too high so that he would
have a scale from like strongly disagree
to strongly agree ask economists to like
rate he was take the average of that
then you would ask people who have never
taken that econ class in her life the
general public like our oil prices too
high and then you basically see where
the average statements of economists
differ from the average statements of
the public that haven't actually studied
these issues yeah and one of like the
trends is that the general public tends
to underestimate the value of
interaction with foreigners where the
best immigration or trade people who
don't really study economics they just
tend to not really understand the value
of that because you don't know that's
how you directly yeah exactly so I think
that's not limited just nationalism in
an example I give up that it's like
Bernie Sanders Bernie Sanders falls into
the very same pitfalls of this anti
foreign bias and his opposition to trade
which I wouldn't attribute that to like
a nationalism or right-wing national
national ISM especially I think that
falls under the umbrella of like they're
just I thought more just like populist
messaging I don't know if you'd call it
nationalism but a big like for the
people kind of thing exactly so I guess
my point oh right so I guess my point is
that kind of anti foreign biased which
actually wasn't the only bias he found
the other bias as he found was a an anti
market bias economists tended to be more
optimistic about the market you know
providing a solution then the general
public did theirs also make work bias
which is that the general public prefer
hello yeah you can hear me now oh I can
hear you it sounds beautiful okay yeah
sorry about that um I had to fix my
[ __ ] Mike yeah no problem dude
what's that work
so anyways I've never watched you stream
before or anything like that but I
joined it at a particular point in which
was that guy about whether you thought
violence was ever justified yeah and I'm
not untrue it was he saying that he
thinks it is justifiable
yeah probably I'm nya girl I'm probably
to some extent but and and which extent
do you agree with him to if you advocate
for a moral philosophy that allows you
to enact violence against others then
you probably open yourself to be
violently and acted upon okay well I
mean that's one story like I would I
would disagree to the point where I
think that you shouldn't be physically
harming anybody unless you yourself are
in physical danger however what's
happening in all over the United States
and even in Canada is people are
shutting down any type of speakers that
have opposing views to them just like
any time I made a comment in your chat I
would get berated with autism autistic
and etc etc that's very interesting that
you say that do you think that
harassment is a forum of censorship
because nobody ban you from my chat but
you that's crazy because you just made a
left-leaning argument against censorship
people argue that Milo you Nautilus
should be she was he harasses students I
actually was banned from your chat and I
had to use a different account okay cuz
I'm looking at your logs and it seems
like you said a whole bunch of [ __ ] I
just thought it was really cool that you
brought up that argument that you just
brought up is a very classic one that
left-leaning people bring up 2d platform
people like Miley innopolis who used
their free speech to bully others they
consider about a form of censorship so
it's a blessing that you concerned that
a bunch of people in a chatroom calling
you autistic you considered that a form
of censorship so that would be a very
lovely nning point of view that you have
no I didn't say that was censorship at
all what I'm saying a censorship is
absolutely not allowing someone to speak
which was exactly what happened to me
when my other account was bad Oh gotcha
okay I'm not left leftist whatsoever and
I think the eyehole Antipa movement is
absolutely [ __ ] being anti-fascist
is [ __ ] or which part is no the the
actual group itself maybe not what it
quote-unquote stands for and just same
way black lives matter in essence if if
you look at it from what some people
will say yes of course black lives do
matter but when you look at what the
actual the group is doing itself and
going around and just protesting maybe
one case of a plea totality and other
case the LM is protesting a single case
of police brutality I think that they
hand-picked cases and I think in a lot
of cases like I can't remember all these
off the top of my head but the last one
I saw was maybe it was Eric garner and
the one I'm not sure he's the one who
was basically down and they said he was
selling CDs or whatever and they
basically said he was unarmed got shot
whatever and the truth was he had prior
charges he actually had a weapon on him
and they basically paint police officers
these murderous insane violent people
that are coming to get any minority and
okay let's back up let's back up really
really far okay do you think that there
is a disproportionate amount of police
violence against minorities in the
United States or not
no okay not disportionateately large we
can look it up I'm curious let's explore
let's explore all of it together so I
googled minority versus white person
sentencing and I got three articles
right off the bat I'm gonna send each of
you the three of them and we can read
them and go through them together if
you'd like do you like do you want to do
that did you want to move on to a
different topic uh-oh
I'll pull them up and I'll read one of
them chair you can go over the first one
so New York Times that trigger you is
that okay or maybe we will use a
different way okay
[Music]
yeah I know so then what if we tied it
what if we try to read the words and we
actually grapple with the subject matter
rather than the like the title or the or
the URL do you think we can try that I
mean you go ahead or we can go to the
next one you can do an ACLU is that okay
or do you consider them a liberal
organization though which so the ACLU
American Civil Liberties Union they're
the people that protect like free speech
they'll go ahead and go ahead and read
okay I've never seen this before maybe
it'll end up agreeing with you by the
end who knows let's see
racial disparities in sentencing the
American Civil Liberties Union welcomes
this opportunity to submit written
testimony to the inter-american
Commission on Human Rights for its
hearing on racism in the criminal
justice system of the United States
our submission focuses on these
significant racial disparities and
sentencing decisions in the United
States which result from disparate
treatment of blacks at every stage of
the criminal justice system and are
consistent with a larger pattern of
racial disparities that plague the US
criminal justice system the human rights
violations associated with such racial
disparities are particularly egregious
in the United States and we hope that
this commission will take action to
address them so without moving on from
that if you disagree with this can you
tell me on what basis you disagree with
the ACLU I would find it actually hard
to disagree because I haven't done
enough research and it was nice in
myself cool so that's fine I'm really
glad that you admit that can you tell me
why you have such a strong opinion on
the existence of black lives matters if
you're completely unread in this topic
okay well I'd like to jump to another
topic where they talked about how
disproportionate black killings okay I
don't want to move on to a topic where
you're gonna throw numbers at me about
black on black crime because one I
already know the argument you gonna make
on it's bad and two I'd rather focus on
this because this is the thing that
drives me to do these conversations as I
run into people like you who have no
idea what you're talking about but still
have incredibly strong opinions and want
to share them online you felt confident
enough to jump into a call with me to
talk to me about our horrible BLM is and
you don't even know about racial
disparities and so far in this country
they've brought attention to disconcert
Ferguson and killing cops do you think
that's all they've done maybe that's the
only thing that you've paid attention to
let's not pivot ok so I want to know why
did you do
strong evidence to prove that we've
actually made any positive effect the
fact that we're having this conversation
how is evidence that they've had a
positive effect they want the
conversation to take place in United
States politics look at the whole
kneeling during the national anthem [ __ ]
a lot of this is driven by BLM that's
the goal of any political group you can
make that you can make that argument for
anything that you're raising awareness
so if I walk around with my dick out for
prostate cancer and you say hey that's
trying to [ __ ] up and I'm like well my
dicks out for prostate cancer and then
everyone's like oh you bruised where it
is I don't think that's comparable but
I'm not saying that you can commit like
morally offensive actions to raise
awareness or something which is what
you're trying to make the comparison of
oh so sorry what was that can you repeat
that so you I understand what you're
doing you're trying to say that all of
BLM is literally like a couple of Rights
that have resulted in people getting
killed or hurt or something I guess is
what you're trying to say all of the LM
is if you want they'll go that's not
what I'm saying I'm trying to say is
that BLM has been focused predominantly
on police brutality yeah that's a yeah
that's a big thing that they've been
focusing on yeah and what I would when
my point is is that police brutality is
completely like overplayed and sure and
I agree and I agree that that's your
point but now I want you to ask me on
what basis do you base that point you
because earlier you told me that you
weren't lying down at the on the FBI
crime statistics that on the FBI crime
statistics what does that mean the
amount of violent and nonviolent crimes
committed by a certain race and the
amount of it was how is that related to
what we're talking about though cuz
we're talking about police brutality
so because african-americans might
commit more crime that means that it
justifies police brutality or racial
disparities and sentencing or other
levels in the criminal justice system
your arguments are totally disconnected
do you not I do not see that let me give
you an example let's say that I've got
two groups of 100 people talking about
what I'm talking about it's
statistically we can both agree that
cops aren't don't don't use the word
statistically because I don't think well
I don't think you understand it okay we
can both we can both agree okay
the police brutality exists so the more
you are more likely to run into police
brutality the more run-ins you have with
police agree
no that's not how these arguments work
so closely you think it you think so you
think it's strictly based on racial
based on the overwhelming amount of data
yes if you want we can porn through some
of it I mean I'm very confident that I'm
correct here like D like just think for
one moment do you think that you have
solved this massive case like well maybe
the reason why so many blacks experts
please cuz they commit more crime oh
I've got it solved do you think that
you're the only person that's ever
thought of that that you just solved the
entire dilemma of police brutality in
the United States and you're talking
about dumbing things down your argument
is absurd like what you say it's
incredibly stupid you're really working
in a master's in international business
you weren't lying when you said that I'm
not at all I'm just finishing up my
bachelor's right now and we're going on
to the mess up you say you're still an
undergrad okay sure
okay so how do you not see how can you
not understand that these two thoughts
are disconnected it is entirely possible
that a black people commit most crime at
least per capita I agree with that but
it's also possible that be black people
also experience a lot of unfairness in
the criminal justice system those two
things are not mutually theirs pleats
brutality but what I'm saying is that
some of you might be reframing this to
win the argument we're not talking about
police brutality we're talking about
unfair and unequal treatment of
minorities compared to white people not
just police brutality but an unfair
treatment based on color of your skin
you can't prove that this on the [ __ ]
color their skin you can't look at
anything and be like oh I know what that
cop was thinking that day he was today
he was thinking that man is black so I'm
gonna beat the [ __ ] out of him because
of whatever reason what do you what is
your undergrad in international business
do you take any any any classes on
advertising or marketing or any size
classes or anything so if you do a
marketing ad or whatever and you're
trying to measure the efficacy of your
ad you're trying to find out the impact
that you had on consumer behavior based
on some marketing campaign do you ever
point to stats or data like of consumer
behavior and look they go like hey
teacher look and then your teacher looks
at uni says you can't say the ear
marketing campaign was effective you
don't know what that
individual consumer was thinking as a
professor ever said anything like that
to you and your entire educational
background so my market trying to market
a product as someone it's the exact same
as someone being shot or killed from now
so but we can look at data okay and we
can analyze data to try to figure out
but you've want to [ __ ] throw the
data out the window but they're
committing wait oh no no I'm not I'm not
throwing any data out the window dude
all of my arguments are data-driven I am
very firmly rooted in reality right now
and the data tells us that if you give
it if you go into an area which is has a
murder rate higher than anywhere in the
city and you encounter someone that's in
be non-compliant what do you think is
gonna happen that's not what we're gonna
be I don't know what you're talking
about right now if you're in a [ __ ]
high murder rate area yeah I don't know
what is it was proportionate treatment
of minorities and white people I'm
talking about weird little and that's
not what I'm talking about weird oh
that's what I was talking about I'm
looking at an article that says racial
disparities in sentencing how do you
talk agreed we both agreed that we
weren't going over this way no because
it's something that okay so wait what
exactly when you reframe the topic for
me so I understand what we're going over
the topic that we were going over was is
police brutality as bad as it's
portrayed by the black life matter
movement okay I don't even know what
that means now we're arguing my
something totally different this is
boring to me it's police brutality as
bad as some people undefined so as it is
this argument they're basically saying
that no matter what if you are black
you're gonna be in the United States
you're going to be profile that you're
gonna be harassed by police okay I mean
if that's the straw man you want to
attack I would agree that that's really
dumb I don't think that's the central
point of the movement that's wrong I
think that typically the argument goes
that black people generally have more
difficult times with the cops on the
criminal justice system than white
people this is backed up by data yes yes
and that could be true what I'm saying
is a lot deeper than just [ __ ] people
being racist like like I said if you're
going to somewhere where you're in a
more statistically danger more dangerous
like area yeah but that's not what we're
talking about we're not talking about
more black people get killed by white
people we're talking or we're talking
about the fact that if you take a black
person and a white person with the same
amount of priors with the same crime
committed and you put them in front of
the same judge yes but why listen listen
what I'm not talking about the judges
I'm not talking anything about
sentencing I already told you I'm not I
haven't researched any of the same since
that statistics I don't know what if
it's that like that you could be right
on that part of the argument I don't
know okay well that's what black lives
matter is generally complaining about no
it's not just about sentencing it's not
at all just about sentencing okay what
else are we talking about I mean it
seems like we had some pretty
high-profile cases involving black
people and police officers I mean some
of them were probably who is the big
dude that robbed the store some of them
were probably the police officer should
have shot the dude some of them looked
really bad the guy that gets thrown
around in the back of that van and
paralyzed on his way to the jail it's
probably pretty [ __ ] up
the black dude that had the I don't know
there's a ton we could go over but but
what what about this I'm sorry can you
repeat there's a ton of cases like where
people point to the mistreatment of
black people by cops seems to be a
problem that black people experience
more than white people about a pretty
sad amount like black that were being
horrendously mistreated at the hands of
police officers that seems to be part of
what BLM was was fighting for that good
remember the guy that got shot by the
cop who was at his window who said he
had a gun and then the cops are shot in
coulomb cuz he said he smelled weed in
front of his girlfriend and kid or
whatever that seems to be things that
BLM is like fighting against I don't
know what part of that do you think is
wrong know that the part of it I was
wrong is that they're taking one or two
examples and then they're gonna run with
that and they're you do you think it's
[ __ ] liars two examples probably like
dozens you guys you go down I guarantee
there's a lot more cops killing black
people in the United States than there
are Muslims killing people if you go
into a black lives matter movement and
you ask them where they're from and what
the last five homicide cases were on
from a white officer
a black male they won't be able to name
five of them what I'm saying is that
they don't have to do become anything
what I what I'm saying if you see one
head news headline Oh
white male kills unarmed black police
officer yeah that's [ __ ] up and
there's there's definitely times where
then it's completely unjustified and
that they've just completed like
completely hello oh hey your mic cut up
recycle sorry sorry where was whoops
which part did you cut out you were
talking about why they couldn't identify
the last five homicide cases or
something
oh okay so let me sorry let me just
recover my thoughts what what I'm saying
is that if a
but hello
are you okay hi hello I can hear your
microphone
hello hello so I take it I took my
headphones out now can you hear me I'm
just on the phone anybody anyways my
whole point is if you ask these people
what is going on in their communities
they're unaware of what's happening
they're going off of Feud news headlines
and they're basically getting this
rhetoric that police are all bad and
that police are out to hurt minorities
which is I which is totally not the case
this is boring I like this this isn't
the state like if somebody says that
that all police are bad it's an easy
thing to attack if that's what you want
to do I mean we can sit here and pretend
that that's like the main point what's
going on no no I think the issue is
they're trying to bring attention to
disproportionate treatment of black
people if I'm like bacon pigs in a
blanket
yeah and Jews will not replace us you
will not replace us Wow tiki torches
that's the entire right we can play
these games if you want exactly that's
exactly what guys will say is that a
hundred people with tiki torches this is
a [ __ ] whole Republican Party but
when a whole thousands of people go
marching down the streets yelling these
rhetoric horrible chants that
oh those are the outliers this is what
it's about and what I'm trying to say is
there's a massive hypocrisy there yeah
this is a difference the difference is
that you can't name a single politician
or political figure on the left that
says that all cops are racist but I can
point to the President of the United
all right well how you guys doing today
all right mom how's it going
I'm doing great so what do we what are
we talking about in here today move some
bands on Twitter weren't you yeah I lose
track of all the [ __ ] [ __ ] that
people say to me though so I'm not sure
what what are we gone and what are we
going it on this time that was mainly it
was mainly a freedom of speech is the
original argument that we had originally
was a nasty censorship do you remember
the disagreement was about what about it
yeah the tweet that you made it was
something I'm totally against censorship
but okay and then you were sort of
pleasing some guy who got his ear to
account taken don't and it's just
obviously any any statement they enter
the town bot is obviously a lie and then
even today as well when you use super
send a tweet to me saying that you want
proof you speech in your parole doesn't
prefer that then and the next week he
says that even though you used to have
an anti censorship stance you said he'll
actually says there you would want me
and the rest of the skeptic community
apparently I'm a part of as you and your
fans keep saying there you would be
quite happy for the older taking off 12
yeah so I used to be so the reason why I
was surprised what you're saying I'm not
sure what that would tweet you're
originally referring to I may have
laughed at somebody getting their
Twitter thing down I usually don't um I
was pretty anti D platforming of pretty
much everybody when Sargon's Twitter
went down I think I expressed
condolences and Sargon even thanked me
on Twitter but that's generally the
sense that I've had with most people
those views have changed recently so I
was just kind of curious what we were
talking about in the past were
supposedly I was like really anti-free
speech because I'm one of the most or at
least I was one of the most like
stringent like free speech ask guys that
I had ever known on Twitter like even
compared to right leaning people well
most right leaning people are oftentimes
very hypocritical of it because they
launch like anti flagging like a
harassment flag campaigns against
YouTube videos and [ __ ] while
simultaneously decrying the left for
doing it so but I mean is all right to
do that the old way are known for doing
as far as I know people from the example
all they or just don't stand up
conservatives there
really known for that yeah maybe but
there ought they all run in the same
crowds and everything especially these
days so really though okay all I know is
that I see like Richard Spencer and Andy
wear ski all hanging together Andy were
ski going up like the daily show and
[ __ ] so it kind of makes me wonder and
then people like Lawrence other--and who
I wouldn't consider alright
or at least I don't think so our friends
with people kind of like Nick Fuentes
and James all sup so it all kind of it
all it gets a little jumbled for me I
guess but I think I think it's because
like a on the rate side of politics
people are still friends with each other
even if they have a different you know
definitely opinions whereas they on the
Left those the most and fate and regards
to politics happens on the left peg time
because they like to purely test each
other a hell of a lot people people
aren't allowed to do that and that's a
problem with people in the left but I'm
not talking about being friends with I'm
talking about not calling out the views
of so for instance if I take a skeptical
centrist and I look at their YouTube
channel and the entirety of their body
of work is just laughing at pink-haired
tumblr arenas and sjw's it kind of
leaves me wondering what their political
alignment is maybe it's just being
people like the funny and ridiculous
I mean I guess there's plenty of people
on the right that you could find funny
and ridiculous but for some reason
they'll know they'll know quake is
ridiculous is the fall a trump is pretty
[ __ ] hilarious my dude I mean unless
you're like so concerned with finding
people on Twitter or or crying in
YouTube videos if that's like the
entirety of your content I mean oh no I
think there's a lot of right leaning
people that are pretty funny but the
whole Roy Marsh it was really funny too
but I don't see anybody anybody in the
skeptics fear you know making fun of the
fact that the DNC through their support
again behind a guy that was backed by
Bannen and not even the Republican Party
but I mean that's a lot of limo it does
get made fun of there was a whole entire
stream just last night well literally
every single person was wrapped in an
ill like I mean you know everyone late
lot of limo obviously is rainy season on
conservative and even Andy Wolski and
the middle of the stream was screamin
are literally Colin are a raging [ __ ]
over and over again but personally I
thought was [ __ ] fantastic but like
there are people on the right who all
does agree with each other as well it's
just on the right they're always a lot
more subtle
the voter right is more civilized
because the rate don't turn up to
valleys and you know throw petrol bombs
and bricks and smash buildings and stuff
like that oh that's strange I thought
all this all the data and stats that I'd
seen it had made it seem like there was
more extremist violence on the right
than the left in the u.s. right now I
could look up similar numbers for Europe
I'm not sure what it's like in Europe
but you've obviously seen the footage of
rallies then you trying to say that the
right-wing are far more violent than
antiva or the black bloc as a whole so
when I try to draw my opinions about
which side is more violent I don't look
at footage of a rally I try to look at
numbers and data when you try to
evaluate which side is more violent you
just look at YouTube videos or do you
actually look at numbers I look at the
actual footage of how they conduct
themselves in public yeah I think actual
footage of the way they truly do act and
reality itself is a very good indication
of how the act and reality itself so you
think that watching a couple videos of a
few rallies is more replicable you've
seen every single route you've watched
every single rally that's in multiple
points of footage of in multiple points
of view of every type of rally of all
the right-wing ones of all I don't
recall saying that student okay if
you've obviously looked at every piece
of the earth then you know I can't look
at every said that's why you I usually
look at like data numbers to draw
conclusions because I don't have the
time pieces so basically then that would
mean that you're poor if you try see my
point isn't valid then also so juice if
you've not looked at every single piece
of data by yourself but you're trying to
use that against me as well you can
laugh if you want and [ __ ] today you
know you're [ __ ] stupid I can't even
I knew I should have no I mean like I'm
sorry my mind is blown so you're telling
me that if two people walk into a room
and one guy goes hey so you know I was
looking at some facts and figures about
you know the amount of extremist
violence that has been occurring you
know on the left and right in the United
States let's talk about it and the other
guy goes oh well I've watched a lot of
YouTube videos about rallies you think
that north of their opinions are equally
valid
the boat rallies Steven have seen
footage of the actual rallies YouTube
videos yeah so you think that that is
you do doesn't matter if there's a video
on the news if you're watching an actual
little video I don't think the place is
being hosted and mouse if you're
watching actual videos of events that
happened in real life I don't think well
the video is hosted is even a fact all
and its validity deeply sorry like see
see how up seen footage of the rallies
like a follow people that film
everything at the rallies I do see the
rate fighting back
and I have seen some instances of the
rate instigator they see the vast
majority of the time most of the
violence by far as an Tifa and the black
bloc they are the ones that cause the
violence the other ones that antagonize
the other ones that come up when our
faces come up and [ __ ] [ __ ] dressed
for walnut rate they're the ones that
actually caused the [ __ ] violence
look at Berkeley there was a few rape my
girls that went to go there to like see
my law and see how to talk and stuff
like that and like what happened with
the files
I had was a woman getting hit by the car
and there's been plenty rightly there's
more right-leaning extremist violence of
united states over the past few years
then two wrongs don't make a right
Steven two wrongs don't make a right
yes people on the right way who said the
two wrongs make them right I never said
two wrongs make a right seat nuts he
just touched on that around a good or
well they do this bad thing - no I'm
saying that they do it in return know
the original thing we're talking about
it more in the United States and the
United States no they don't do it more
they definitely don't do it more than
Europe either see if you think anti find
the black box and in the States
I'll but the Panthera and black bulk in
the states are [ __ ] [ __ ] can peel
to the Europeans they are [ __ ]
hardcore they like the Mafia over there
almost do you do you I mean do you want
to go over some data points or do you
not care because you watched YouTube
videos or no it's famously care of
obviously I actually provided you with
you know actual physical evidence
Kisuke then no matter it doesn't matter
no they don't your individual ideas and
individual videos you've watched don't
matter their store
an individual or even it doesn't matter
if you've watched a hundred videos
that's not how data collection works
it's not how intelligent people form
opinions then obviously obviously yeah
Steven banal as an extraordinary
unfathomably intelligent man's no I just
have a basic understanding of why data
collection is important and why
statistics matter and what cognitive
biases are via collection obviously is
important by the way I'm agreeing with
you that the rate does do violent things
the absolute we do what I'm claiming is
nowhere near on the scale of the far
left and we were literally supposed to
be talking about free speech but
obviously that's as well the bantha just
say office away a flight through the
tabs that you already had the open mail
before they came under the streaming
I'll wait till if you're gonna give data
I'm gonna pound through some super Ches
if you need a second yeah knock it knock

destiny sources it's not the ad Allah
right wing watch and Bert Bo bane
observation is how we obtain data nice
who just wait what observation is how we
obtain data that's not true it's not how
we obtain data sorry row thank you
it does seem as if looking up all these
data points and observing the
differences that happen on YouTube
videos are still it still counts no it
does because no it doesn't that's a
negative it doesn't it's it counts
against you for reasons that I can
explain if you want to get into it but
yes it counts against you look at the
actual footage of an event doesn't
verify the event okay yeah if if it's an
event that's happening and it's on lying
and you can see it happening does I not
count does it mean you lied would you
actually be present there for it to
carry I I'm just trying to decide if I
want to run through like the high school
level explanations needed to explain why
firsthand collection of data is prone to
like all sorts of biases I don't know if
I'm like up to the task or not just go
ahead dominate dominate down for me
their destiny don't rate things that you
knew well I do but like I already know
that I'm wasting my breath let's say
that I collected let's say that I have a
hundred videos of white people beating
up black people in United States and I
show you a hundred videos of that does
that prove like some trend does that
prove that all white people are beating
up black people or what I've been sure
that it was a serious problem yeah how
would you know it's a serious problem
you don't know the cars just you've just
showed me a hundred videos of it in a
country of three hundred and thirty
million people in a country of three
hundred thirty million people how do you
know that a hundred videos is a serious
problem that's one way you guys beating
up one black gayness a single event I
would still classed as a problem on a
national level well you were talking
about problems they'll be through that
little national and now
[Music]
yeah let me do the honey I know that
you're quite a smoke guy if there's the
name EDD the hunt left in that goalposts
around I can help you if you want yeah
like if it's to baby I want to kill
myself I five minutes in okay all right
I'm sorry because I target people in the
middle I'm sorry I target people in the
middle so let me back up and explain
this fully I guess so that people can
understand so as a human being you are
prone to all sorts of cognitive biases
as a human being the whole goal of your
evolution are part of the big part of
evolving you as a person and being
successful is your ability to quickly
recognize patterns and then act on set
patterns if you were a person in the
wilderness and something made a strange
noise and a bush the person that walks
open investigates probably gets killed
the person that assumes it's a predator
probably survives etc set our
evolutionary biology memes nice stuff so
typically what we do is we recognize
patterns very quickly now in today's
society we don't need that in in terms
of being able to survive so that pattern
recognition actually manifests itself in
a lot of really disgusting cognitive
biases so here's an example of that
let's say as a child I try to pet a dog
the dog bites me there's a high
probability that I would go through the
rest of my life being very afraid of
dogs because one dog bit me okay this is
an example of a singular event occurring
that radically shapes my opinion about
all dogs because I'm making an
extrapolation that my human mind has
been evolved to make that doesn't suit
me well when it comes to interpreting
lots of data so let's talk specifically
about this example if I go online and I
search for right-wing extremist violence
or left-wing extremist violence I can
probably find hundreds of videos of both
sides of these now depending upon what
my political affiliation is I will
probably be more prone to finding videos
that agree with my particular point of
view this is called confirmation bias
it's very well studied in psychology
nobody disagrees with it if I am a very
right leaning person I'm probably gonna
go online and look more for left-leaning
violent videos while I'm going to follow
right-leaning youtubers that show me
left-leaning violent videos if that's
the only type of media that I consume
and psychology has shown us that people
are more likely to consume media that
agrees with them you're probably going
to come away with the opinion thinking
oh wow look all the lefties are super
violent I don't really see that much
right-leaning violence but I've seen
hundreds of videos of left-leaning
people being violent so this is why when
you enter a conversation with which side
is more vile
it's really silly to go while I've seen
a lot of videos of this because one the
type of videos that you're seeking out
could be prone to individual biases and
- you haven't seen footage of every
single political rally or political
event that has happened all across the
globe such that you could create an
accurate database to assess who's being
more violent this is why this is why
your point of I've watched a lot of
videos is a really silly point that's
unfounded in any type of reality based
conversation applies to use of course
which is why I look for data points
rather than looking at videos what if
how many videos would it take for no
amount of videos I would ever trust
myself to watch individual videos to try
to draw conclusions so I show evidence
watching an event actually happen
you feel that you wouldn't be able to
perceive what that video is truly trying
to show and you basically feel that an
actual evidence of an event happening
isn't enough to prove that that event is
happening the problem isn't that the
event is happening I don't disagree that
events have happened at things like
Charlottesville have happened that
things like an Tifa rallies at the heart
of g20 summit ever have happened these
things have happened that's not the
problem the problem is that the
statements aren't that these events
happen the problem is that you
extrapolate it into statements that
generalize saying things like the left
is more violent than the right because
of these individual data points that
I've collected okay move for example
well have there have been at examples of
right-wing terror attacks I would say it
probably the most modeled famous one is
Timothy McVeigh he's probably the most
famous by far the Oklahoma bombing rate
and there was also a few things done by
the KKK and a few new Nazi groups and
stuff like that as well
those can I picked say probably el
enemies the KKK themselves were classed
as a terrorist group that they are on
the way [ __ ] oh I think in the last
census they were less than 8,000 members
and in a population of seen from fairly
marine that's Jack ship and I would
probably say about a thousand of those
members of FBI informants but I'm
digressing anyway right now as far as
actual rate when terror attacks they do
happen with the election
rather nearly real new a for example we
had one here in the UK our first one the
[ __ ] are very long time I gave more
than people who say the mosque and
killed one guy but when it comes to
actual investigations an actual dia of
right-wing terror attacks most of them
are usually foiled and I don't even not
many I'm not seeing a lot of violence is
coming from I'm seen attempted sometimes
planned but even those that get foiled
le are not on anywhere near as large a
scale as literally hundreds and hundreds
of people showing up and [ __ ] ski
masks putting fire box and say bottles
do you believe that um uh uh politics is
inherently violent
it depends on your definition of
violence but depending on how you define
it sure
because i feel like a lot of people a
lot of centrists
idealize this notion of political
dysphor of course
being able to um be hashed out in this
sort of neutral
arena where only uh rhetoric matters
but in reality and i can say this very
authoritatively because
right sorry i thought i had to i ate an
enormous amount of beans before coming
here it was a um
another power play on my part i thought
it would give me confidence
um and i can say this with a degree of
authority because all sociological and
political science evidence backs this
assertion up
politics is already a game of violence
when like like political organization
is based around who has the ability to
force whom else to do what
um even acts of violence which are
engaged in legally
um if facilitated through the political
system
could already argue to be argued to be
unjust because they are engaged in
through a mode of um
uh um organization which many people
consider to be illegitimate
i don't think there's any way to engage
in advocacy for a movement in a
non-violent way
but i feel like the myth that you can do
so
inherently hampers the left because the
right has never
operated under such a delusion nobody on
the alt-right
believes that they can achieve their
glorious ethnic state in a way which
truly complies with the ethics of a free
society
yeah they're all across the finally
they're starting to abandon that
thank god they were more honest it's
actually one of the most refreshing
things i would rather deal with a
literal neo-nazi today than a
conservative from 10 [ __ ] years ago
like it's refreshing when somebody says
like i don't care about democracy
or i'm not going to pretend that i want
equal rights or minorities like and like
the the the lack of dog whistling and
the
and the upfrontness of other beliefs is
a little refreshing to me but yeah i
know i know
i agree completely at what point do we
just get to shoot them and i'm not being
facetious there
when a person and you believe in and uh
what do you call it reciprocatory
the the social contract the way that my
moral system works is that i will
reciprocate values with people who will
reciprocate with me this is where my
my my tenuous uh justification for
eating meat comes from
right that animals will not and cannot
reciprocate values with me so i can
slaughter and eat them right this is how
all my whole moral system is built and
so this would be the idea between like
if somebody
you know threatens violence against me
then i can threaten violence or kill
them right because
they're not reciprocating my value
system um so if i'm
encountering somebody that won't
reciprocate i guess some but it would
have to be part of my value system
that's important enough not to
to to warrant that response so for
instance like i wouldn't appreciate a
stranger coming up to me and hugging me
but if one came up and hugged me that
would be not reciprocating my value
system but i wouldn't i don't think i
would be
morally um able to like you could
probably come back
yeah but like i wouldn't be able to kill
that person so like i don't know what
the i don't know where the line is i
have to think about it more i'm not sure
okay like until the problem is hey yeah
well until a few weeks ago like there
there are certain fundamental core
beliefs that i have about people in
general
um god maybe this sounds a little anne
frankish but like i believe that every
person
them has the potential to do almost
anything to be like the 99th percentile
and anything if they put their mind to
it
um i think that most people are capable
of achieving
or aspiring to much higher things than
most people are even aware of
and that includes like logical rational
thought but over the past month when
i've engaged with people like jf
or andy warski not even as much but
people like the ian chang guy
right there the tonka guy like these are
people that are so
[ __ ] far gone that like if they got
if something bad happened to them for
like politically related [ __ ]
i don't even know if i would give a [ __ ]
like i don't even know if i would call
that out if
like it would just be like these are the
representatives of their movement too
yeah
people that are posting about me on pole
or kiwi farms or any of that [ __ ] so
yeah i don't know i'm not sure these
people are scarcely human
in your debate with vegan gains you said
that because you believe and i'm gonna
keep using social construct
contract real quick just because we're
bringing this up and because we're
bringing his name up in the vein of
everybody else i thought the vegan gains
guy i don't know much about him but he
seemed
reasonably intelligent i feel like i
could have a conversation with him about
anything even though i think he's like a
huge anti-sjw
i've never talked to him about those
views but i feel like we could have like
an intelligent conversation about him
being an anti-sjw
i just wanted to make a reasonable
person yeah no he seemed quite
reasonable in this discussion with you
and i feel like you took a pretty hard
argument to defend because
in the um in the uh at least in the
philosophical communities which with
which i am familiar
online and on my campus veganism is
almost accepted as axiomatically of
course morally correct well to be honest
you necessitate virtue yeah to be to be
a meat eater you have to reject some
very basic parts of your humanity
because we're hardwired for empathy
including
animal empathy it's just something we're
hardwired for you know if you show like
a four or five year old a cat or a dog
being tortured
and you can hear it screaming and crying
like you have like natural human
responses to that
and if you want to take like the
meat-eating argument you have to be like
a beacon of rationality that has no
emotion
and it makes a lot of people really
uncomfortable so yeah that's not
surprising to me
and i'm sure i'm sure you understood
that in that debate your actual
practical real-life world uh
views divorced somewhat from the hyper
intellectual robot position you had to
take
consistently for me no no for me not at
all
but i understand that that's something
that i've had to come to terms with over
the past few years
um well i won't hold you to it sure but
in your discussion with him in your
social contract memes
he posed to you the question that if you
discovered an undiscovered indigenous
people
living right we're right and they were
absolutely incapable of respecting the
social
contract you would be okay with gunning
them all down
yes correct because i would consider
that to be something different than
human
in terms i guess insofar as how i define
humanity right and to an
extent i agree with that i think that uh
and now obviously that's an extreme
hypothetical i don't think things have
ever played out that way in real life
though
and let me be clear the reason why this
is an extreme hypothetical is because i
don't believe there are groups of humans
that are incapable of reciprocating some
sort of value system i don't think that
those types of groups of humans have
ever existed in the history of all of
mankind
what about people who have um uh cast
aside the belief
in fundamental human equality in
treating drugs
and treating those justly and free
speech in in um
in a free trial under the law i'm
talking about nazis
i'm talking about people who and yeah
you know what couple of them could be
uh could be convinced otherwise a lot of
them could given enough time and effort
but they pose a very real political
threat to our country and to our planet
now
and i feel like they have very willingly
cast aside many of the axiomatic
principles
that we base our social values yeah sure
and i'm sorry
i was speaking i was speaking i was
speaking specifically in terms of like
encountering people in the past
sorry that's like encountering tribes of
people i don't want somebody to take
that statement and be like oh so you
think the aboriginals should have been
slaughtered in australia or the native
americans should have been or the
you know the aztecs or the you know i'm
not saying that no no no i understand
also
also you know historically for the most
part aboriginal groups have actually
been extremely friendly and welcoming
to um to to like westerners who
uh approach them for the most part there
are exceptions but i mean you know
curiosity beckons these folks tend to be
dark skinned you see some
pale folk come on curiosity i think
overwhelms the um uh tribesmen desire to
fire arrows at
unfamiliar things walking towards them
for the most part
anyway so nazis
we've got people who have willingly cast
aside the axioms upon which we base a
free society
ones that you and i both hold extremely
dear fundamental belief in human
equality
um uh an equal treatment free speech
fair treatment under the law
these people have done so willingly and
they were born with the tools
to make better decisions with their
political ideology growing up though
of course you know nobody really makes
choices on but yeah because
i'm not that hard-line determinism but
yeah but we can speak about it
i understand what you're saying go ahead
right but i mean
at what point do you recognize the
decisions these people have made and the
political threat that they pose to the
nation to the world to their neighbors
at what point does it become severe
enough that you have to
accept the necessity of extra
extra legal forms of violence i'm
stepping and i think you and i agree
at least to some extent on the legal
[ __ ] here but really
punching nazis where what's
discuss i'm not sure i need to talk to
richard spencer i feel like if i tweeted
him he'd do it i don't know i mean
probably
uh it's you know today is the uh one
year anniversary of him getting punched
it's the puncheversary some [ __ ]
[ __ ] tweeted at me and they were
sent me a dm and they wanted me to
moderate a discussion between
her and spencer uh i don't know why
would you why would anyone call you in
as a moderator i don't
i mean i could moderate really well i
think i can moderate very well yeah of
course it's just
getting people to clarify their points i
think i understand people's arguments
generally better than other people do
because i'm not like too busy trying to
scream down the other person um
i think i could make a pretty good
moderator but i don't know this person
got like hardcore triggered i guess
because i didn't know who she was so i
don't know
can we get you to moderate the next um
uh set of primary debates
in um in 2020 i would really appreciate
never be allowed to do that
that'd be fun though yeah that would be
fun the
uh okay i feel like you kind of ducked
out of that though i feel like we're on
the cusp of a revelation
punching nazis oh yeah i'm not sure i
have to
i guess i have to think about it more i
don't know i feel like
um what i say in this regard might be
delegitimized slightly because you know
that i'm a political radical but i've
shifted a fair degree away from
authoritarianism
over the past couple of years i try to
think of
political violence in a more practical
sense now in regards to what kind of
societal behaviors are being encouraged
when you engage in those forms of
political violence
the the nazis in this country um
excluding those which are embedded in
the government and in the police force
of which there are many
the ones who are just your rank and file
citizens the people who
have the exact same legal rights as me
these people are for the most part
uneducated confused and scared um
that like oh yeah my the
the problem that i have with everything
is the it's the lack of an objective
morality this is just where i become
uncomfortable
making all of this so like so like let's
like i can give a few hypotheticals
where i'm okay with punching richard
spencer okay
if everybody shared my moral system
um i would be so much quicker to jump on
board with political violence
i would i would do it in a heartbeat if
i knew that most people or all people in
the united states shared my
moral system then i would endorse
political violence and extra legal
violence 100
because i would know for sure that the
only people they would be targeting
would be people that i would
morally deem unworthy of moral
consideration i was i used moral twice
there but like people that i would deem
unworthy of moral consideration
um and in that case i would say
fine go for it because because the
people that are that the violence is
being enacted on don't aren't worthy of
moral consideration
however um the problem is that when i
come out if i say something like i'm
okay with richard spencer being punched
i would have to add that caveat because
there are a lot of people that would
want to punch him
who would want to punch a whole bunch of
other people were that i wouldn't be
okay with punching does that make sense
no i agree completely and that's what i
mean by what kind of behaviors you'd be
encouraged
if you start punching people you
disagree with and for and and for
all of the things richard spencer has
done and said and for all the arguments
i could make against
his uh political views at the end of the
day
i disagree with him is about all i can
say in regards to justification for
punching him on like a one-on-one
in a vacuum context wait can you wait
i'm sorry can you repeat that
oh i mean to say that at the end of the
day
regardless of the reasons for why i
punched richard spencer and regardless
of how odious his political beliefs are
it would be seen as an act of me
punching somebody i disagree with
and that would implicitly encourage the
punching of people other people don't
disagree with oh sure i'm one of those
people
people don't disagree yeah i agree i
agree okay
i haven't gotten punched in the face
since like eighth grade i don't know if
i could take the hit that well to be
perfectly honest
right getting punched kind of kind of
hurts it's not like in the movies right
no you got punched recently not recently
but if you get hit in the face you're
out pretty quick yeah
yeah it kind of hurts i mean i'm a
pretty big guy i feel like i just could
knock the [ __ ] over though i don't want
to get punched in the face
but i want other people to get punched
in the face so
i've had to develop a and you know
pardon me for sound of pretentious
i've had to develop a um
a set of principles and of
ways in which those principles could be
practically enacted
um which allow for the punching of nazis
and don't allow for the punching of me
and my soft jaw and i feel like these
are reconcilable concepts i feel like
even in the absence of a system with
objective morality
it's still very possible to
collectively agree upon certain criteria
against which
um you're more justified
in engaging in political violence or do
you disagree with that do you think that
there's
no way to hammer out a set of like
informal rules like yes these are the
people that should be targeted these are
the people who should not
i mean you can't we've already done it
to some extent with our legal system
right when you talk about things like
murder or stealing or espionage or
something right
what if well that's yeah and i i think
that's actually kind of the point i was
going to get to
uh i consider it uh simply a matter of
self defense and i feel like this is a
justifiable
stance to take because it fits in line
with a set of legal uh concepts that we
already have in place now
if a nazi goes out and advocates for
xenophobia
advocates for racism advocates for white
nationalism advocates for the
deportation of people they disagree with
that is an expression of political
violence i notice you give mob
status to
actually relatives women they don't
deserve to go in these bathrooms and if
you go in the bathroom that you believe
isn't the one in which they belong
you're free to beat them up these people
are engaging in political violence
and violence can be defended against
acts of violence against those people
aren't retaliatory they're defensive uh
i saw you shake your head on stream oh
all right you're here what do you want
all right I just want to talk to you
about your perspective on basically the
castle doctrine okay go for it all right
so you believe that if somebody breaks
into your house you are morally right
and absolutely murdering them
assuming yes if as long as they're not
like if there's any chance that they can
like present a danger to you yeah so
like if somebody like breaks into your
house but it's like a four year old you
probably should murder a four year old
if somebody breaks into your house and
they're like they're asleep on your
couch you probably shouldn't walk down
and shoot them on your couch so yeah so
like whatever the reasonable
interpretation on that is but yeah okay
so you do believe that you should have
to justify the level of threat mm-hmm
yeah but I'm very very very generous on
that if that makes sense you can give me
hypotheticals if you want to go from
there so that we can be sure we're
talking about the same thing I don't
have necessarily a specific hypothetical
but my problem is if you're generous
with that that encourages people to kill
the person that is breaking into their
house sure because the problem is
murdering them obviously you know takes
away their testimony yeah oh
yeah I guess it does well rip better not
break into people's houses then I guess
no I mean I I think it's it's crazy that
you find it like your social contracting
means right yeah but like somebody
breaks into your house and immediately
the entire social contract name is
revoked I mean I consider breaking into
somebody's house to be like one of the
largest of fronts that you can do it to
another person's autonomy I mean you're
invading their personal space you could
be doing it with lethal force they don't
know if you know that or not they don't
know what your intentions are and you
could oftentimes have a family at stake
as well so yeah I consider breaking into
somebody's house to be like a really
really really big deal like one that
would make like lethal force too easily
justified on the flip side of that if I
were to break into somebody's house I
would totally accept that if they'd kill
me for it I mean I would I would be
expecting that like if I was breaking
into somebody's house I would be
expecting to die if I got caught doing
it right okay so what do you extend that
to so let's say you have a property
right with grass and then you have a
fence up with a sign on it that says
trespassers will be shot somebody jumped
that fence do they lose their right to
life I guess it like this would probably
be different if you're talking about if
you're why it is twitch keep [ __ ] up
today holy [ __ ] it just really hates you
man I think just wait a minute refresh
my I'm not having any problems on my own
guys nothing is wrong on my own
everything looks perfectly fine no I'm
just saying that I'm not coming so like
I like
I consider there to be differences in
like I mean like I guess like all
personal property isn't necessarily the
same so for instance like if somebody is
like breaking into your farm like if you
go down and you hear somebody's like in
the stables or they're like in your
cornfield or like they're in your
backyard shed I mean something like that
you probably shouldn't be killing
somebody because they don't really
represent like a danger to you such that
they can kill you or your family I guess
I would probably be a little bit less
likely there to say you should be
allowed to kill somebody could to me
from my perspective at least it seems
like you're drawing arbitrary lines well
not really I guess the line is more like
could this person represent like a
physical threat to you or your family
and as soon as you like break in they do
if they're not a 4 year old person or if
they're not unconscious they could post
yeah so like if they're like an
able-bodied person
I don't consider those to be arbitrary
lines if a four-year-old walks up to me
in real life I think I can pretty
resolutely say this guy doesn't really
represent a threat to me or like if I
hear like a window break downstairs and
I go downstairs and there's like a
four-year-old or I'm sorry let's say
like a nine-year-old came in because he
threw a baseball through the one who's
trying to get it back I don't think it's
arbitrary to say that well this guy
isn't representing a threat versus I see
like a full-sized adult in my basement
and it's like okay well what the [ __ ]
like I say right but I feel like there's
a huge distinction between four-year-old
full-sized adult right there's a lot of
gray area in there so there's a
difference okay so let's say twenty
four-year-old are okay let's say a 64
year old woman breaks into your house is
it more are you morally justified in
shooting that person right yeah I would
say so
when I say house I just want to be clear
like breaking into like the area where
you and your family sleeps or lives yes
not like breaking into like a shed in
the backyard or breaking into like your
farm or your stables outsiders
thing yeah right so the reason that
seems so problematic and arbitrary to me
is okay so let's say you know like I'm
sure do you like many others live in a
house right or your bedrooms where you
sleep and your family sleeps are very
spread out from the entrance to your
home so why do you not have an
obligation to you know as I was taught
my CCW class to hunker down to get into
a room with your family and then have
your door shut and locked and then once
they get through that door then you're
morally justified in shooting them but
why should you be able to seek them out
in your house um I guess um so if I'm
like a moral or ethical point of view I
guess it's just like the way that I view
it is it like if you're breaking into
somebody's house what if you stumbled
onto like a family member that was like
in another room or what if you are an
all sleeping or what if your rooms are
separated what if somebody sleeps in the
upstairs and somebody sleeps in the
basement or something like that or how
do you know if they're not going to like
wander upstairs and then come in through
I guess like personally I probably
wouldn't go through my house looking for
the person that seems like a bad idea
just from a survival point of view I'm
asking you you know just just morally
because you said if they break in your
house it's okay to kill them so you know
you know let's say it's just you and
your wife you're both in your room
sleeping you hear if somebody break in
you know they've broken in two you know
and they're in the house do you have are
you morally right and ending their life
if they make no attempt to come into
your bedroom or even upstairs for that
matter yeah I would yeah I'd probably
still say yeah yeah you're breaking into
their [ __ ] that's like I consider that
to be like a really really really big
crime breaking into somebody's house
don't disagree with you but you're
saying that Scott crime is so
significant that it takes away their
right to life um yeah yeah I think so
yeah I would say so I I would say so I
think like that's one of like the worst
things like this this would be like a
notch or two under like physical assault
or rape like it would be like on that
level to me in my opinion yes yes or
like head
physical assault yeah breaking into
somebody's house to steal their [ __ ] and
while being there being a totally miss
like unknowable factor of is this person
going to come and kill me yeah I would
put it on that level or not not on that
level but like very close you're like a
step or two away from being on that
level like if I was upstairs most people
most people breaking into a house intend
to just steal some things yeah but the
problem is that like generally when I'm
in my house if I'm in my house okay and
I'm not trying to appeal to emotion I
just being reasonable if I'm in my house
and I'm with my child there is no chance
that somebody in my house is going to
come and kill my child if somebody has
shown that they approved the propensity
to break into my house and they're in my
house I don't know if that person is
going to try to kill me any loved ones
or my kit I don't know it's impossible
for me to know I do know that whoever is
in my house has already shown that they
have absolutely no regard for me or my
property so whether or not they're
willing to come a little bit further or
something could happen that would cause
them to kill somebody I don't know it's
like the problem is that they're putting
me in a position where I can't possibly
know the answer to that question which
kind of makes it like permissible to
sleep in different parts of the house if
your family's you know like if your kid
sleeps downstairs then obviously I see
your point of view but obviously you're
morally justified in shooting the person
don't risk you know having your son's
like guilt just because you know this
person's breaking into your house but on
the flipside why don't you have any duty
to retreat and make sure your family is
safe I mean I was like dude duty to
retreat from your own stuff that
somebody's broken into to steal man I'm
dude I might just be like really [ __ ]
salty but so like I cry against other
people are things that I hold like in
the people that do these crimes are the
lowest [ __ ] scum of the earth to me
like if somebody wants to break in and
steal your [ __ ] I don't know if you have
a moral obligation to just hand it over
to them maybe they don't you well know
your [ __ ] is gone your police are never
getting to your house in time to stop a
live burglary no but they'll steal some
of your [ __ ] what do they took like my
[ __ ] saxophone or anything anything
of my house that I've worked for
my life that I've stored it in my place
that I've worked to build or or to
purchase and they're in my house
stealing my [ __ ] with no regard myself
like I'm just supposed to let that
person walk away I mean like I guess I
could argue that like if you purchase
you're placing a value of your stuff
over their life that's the problem yeah
but but but it's not well hold on cuz
that's not really true I'm not saying
that like if somebody were to say that I
could sacrifice my saxophone to like
save the life of an innocent person like
I would probably do that 10 out of 10
times like okay well here you go here's
my sax save the person's life but more
that they forfeit their right to life
when they come into my property to steal
my [ __ ] I think that there's a
distinction there I mean you probably
really kind of I'm sorry that's my
promise I absolutely see the distinction
right there obviously committing a crime
and obviously an egregious one right so
one that violates your privacy makes you
feel very vulnerable right I've had my
house broken into but the problem is
that you're saying that they forfeit
their right to life because they're
stealing your saxophone and to me that
just sounds ludicrous I mean it's my
[ __ ] what is the alternative the
alternative is to let them steal your
saxophone dude I don't understand how
how you say that okay my saxophone is
worth their life now it's the worth the
life is somebody that wants to come in
and try and steal it not the life it's
not like if I again like I'm trying to
draw this thing here there was a scale
my my stuff isn't worth more than the
life of another human but if that human
wants to come and steal that [ __ ] well
yeah now it kind of is because because
you you okay they're committing a crime
that's different than you know you
trading it for somebody's life that's
different but the thing is you're saying
that that that crime in itself forfeits
their rights of life them coming into
your house immediately forfeits that
right it and I'm trying to ask you how
do you morally justify that they don't
pose a threat to you they pose a threat
to what you've worked for right I don't
see how you know you can be the executor
if you will you're the judge during
literally an executioner in this case I
mean I guess like if there was some like
magical weight
determine if you so like and under your
hypothetical you're talking about like
knowing that somebody could break into
your house and knowing that they aren't
going to foot pose like a physical
threat to anybody in your house like if
you could know those things for sure
again when I got my CCW in the state of
Missouri and we were taught the duty to
retreat right well but Duty did a treat
that's it that's in public places though
that's not always in your that's not in
your house no you're right it it well it
actually applies to states without the
castle doctor sure you cannot do it
anyway I'm arguing morality Weiss yeah
well because you are you're bringing up
CCW training I'm just saying it yeah but
good well that's good because that's
where I learned about the duty to
retreat right oh yeah just you're just
supposed to go get your family and bring
them like that's just the safest way to
do it right like you said before it's
the safest way you don't go hunting yeah
of course yeah but so why don't you see
like that it's a better alternative and
then losing some of your stuff because I
think that there's a philosophical
difference between this is kind of like
I want to say that this is kind of like
what the spirit of the castle doctrine
is about like my your house is your
domain in the United States private
property is one of the most important
rights that's endowed to us while given
to us by God or whatever that the
government allows us to keep right that
the private property is a really big
deal when somebody has made the decision
to violate your personal private
property come on to your property and
then start arbitrarily removing [ __ ]
from it against your will this is a
violation of your autonomy of like the
highest kind this is why I say I put
this like on a notch or two like if
somebody is raping you they're abusing
your body and they're taking from it
what they want without respect for your
autonomy oftentimes causing pain in the
process same thing with physical assault
or battery right but like breaking into
somebody's private property which is an
extension of yourself to steal things
that you've worked for I consider this
to be somewhat similar in those regards
like I think it's a really really really
big deal I I don't consider it as just
like like a like a yard sale like you've
just got a collection of things and
somebody walks up and steals it I think
violating the private property of
another person is a really really really
big deal it's not just taking something
again it seems like you're drying it
you're going back to the argument I was
trying to make before which was okay so
somebody hops
you have a large property somebody hops
the fence you have you know various
things in your on your property just not
inside your house they steal some of
those things do you have a right to take
their life are you morally righteous
like their I would probably still sit on
like the on the gun the executioner side
of that but like but but then like I
said really like I guess when I speak of
this I speak to this and when I say
private personal property I generally
mean like where you and your family
reside I like I said like if you owned
like a farm and somebody is out like
taking something like in a shed like ten
miles away or not ten miles away but
like you know 100 yards away from your
actual house or you sleep maybe it would
feel slightly differently about that but
even that I'm not I'm not sure it's just
like if there are two options available
to you and one is to let somebody break
into your stuff steal your stuff and
leave versus killing them it's like I
lean on the side of like you should have
the right to defend your property using
lethal force
I don't think disagree with you
absolutely I have a right to defend
yourself the problem is when they're
injured strand stealing things right I
don't believe that you have a right to
defend your property the Ilia lethal
force which is what you're proposing
yeah I guess it's just like if I had to
choose between two worlds in one world
you just have to sit there and watch
them steal your [ __ ] police force the
police is not relevant in this
discussion if somebody is on your
property stealing some the police are
never getting there in time to give a
[ __ ] you got like what I just I don't
it's happening in other countries where
they don't have guns everywhere right
and in Japan where somebody breaks into
your house you're not gonna get all your
[ __ ] stolen right so I'm just curious
how you make this moral leap right
because you're super hard on the social
contract memes so it's really surprising
to hear you say if somebody comes in
onto your property especially in a shed
that's not even attached to your house
so it's not even about personal safety
at this point you just care about that
saxophone well but but I mean I would
view this the same way if I'm breaking
into somebody's place I fully expect to
be murdered for what I'm doing like I
would fully expect that to be a possible
consequence of what I'm doing I consider
this to be a crime like this is like
when you say this like you're big on the
social contract stuff so I'm really
surprised that you think that like
somebody should be able to stab you in
the neck just because you try to rape
somebody like I would say that well if
I'm
the process of raping somebody I fully
expect them to use lethal force to try
to get me to stop like much the same way
that if I were to break your your you're
attributing personal property into
personhood I'm self defending my
property I'm self defending my saxophone
I guess like maybe I just maybe I have
like a really really high regard for
personal property like I would view
those as almost like an extension of
your person like if somebody is like
breaking onto your private property and
stealing your private property that
that's like a violation of your autonomy
to some extent no I would agree with
that
I think you must concede then though
it's it's not about your family's
personal safety anymore it's it's now
about your private property yeah sure
maybe those are different arguments sure
but yeah but I but I think I would still
maintain the same for defending your
property - yeah okay so so again back to
the jumping the fence example but yeah
i'm wishy-washy but i'd say I would lean
on the side of the executioner I mean
like I don't like killing people or
advocating for people to be killed so I
mean like if it's avoidable but what and
it really related you is of course it's
avoidable you're saying between these
two choices should I lose some things
that are material value right uh-huh
I'm not trying to trivialize that of
course it's it's it's an egregious crime
and of course why it's a felony but the
problem is you're saying that leap makes
loot they lose their right to life at
that point yeah because they broke into
your farmhouse yeah how do you morally
justify that cuz they're they're
breaking into my [ __ ] [ __ ] them listen
you're from Missouri you know this [ __ ]
hello am i dude what's up hey how's it
going I'm doing great how are you doing
alright alright before we start you want
introduce yourself who you are what you
do what your background is sure I guess
uh I just sent my kids away um
like some time away forever what does
that mean yeah right now
they went over to go have some turkeys
that was it was kind of nice that they
yeah got to do that um but yeah so I'm
I'm a I'm a at convert well I'm not a
convert I was born into a Mormon family
with I have Libyan family as well that
were Muslim so I was raised with them I
was raised as Mormon Muslim kind of as a
Sunni but I married a Dale Bondi which
is an extreme like a revivalist kind of
cult the sect of Sydney Islam so I
married a man that was damn Gandhi and
had some kids and moved to Pakistan and
India and Afghanistan and Qatar and
Saudi and you kind of looked everywhere
in the UK and I became very extreme so I
have a nursing background as far as my
career and stuff um but right now I'm
off for the year writing a book because
um I don't know I decided to do it I'm
boots about ten or terrors and stuff
that has been really nice I really feel
like I've been able to give back to the
country because the country has given so
much to me when I didn't have any help
so good nice are you um I said you live
in the United Kingdom a deal in the
United States right now no I'm in the
United States right now got you okay
well I guess we can just without digging
through the twenty trillion tweets yeah
what I guess um do you have a specific
topic that you wanted to talk about her
no I just um the the idea that Islam
isn't a threat to the west
I think it is yes and no I agree with
that but I also disagree with that and
that for various reasons so I think
that's kind of something good and I want
to have people like I like I had
mentioned you know be wary of Islam but
at the same time not demonize all
Muslims and it's really important
especially with the differences in sex
because you've got the majority cities
and you have Shias and Sufis and muddies
and then you have the break offs from
the individual sex as well so like when
you talk about female genital mutilation
you're not talking about every Muslim in
every sect and every so when people talk
about it they tend to generalize and I
really have made the point the last
several years to separate like Sunnis
from Shias and and it's hard for people
who must understand that but for me it's
very easy because obviously it's my
culture but and I would get into that as
well because Islam as a culture as well
as a religion as well as a political
entity sure is a lot of religious
systems are right does accent I think
Islam you sound like you're very much
more familiar with it than I do Islam
sounds like it has a little bit of a
deeper political aspect to it then say
Christianity where it seems like the
political systems are somewhat baked
into Islam but Christianity manifests
itself politically in a lot of ways as
well I think they're both horrible I
mean as far as you know freedom and and
things for but live in it so from what
you said so far it doesn't really sound
like we disagree on anything and I don't
expect you to be familiar with any of my
belkin at all but was there anything
that I said on Twitter I'm curious that
you found extremely disagreeable no I it
was um somebody a friend of mine I've
seen the tweets about you had she was
having faith about Rashmi oh yeah oh
yeah so there's a giant issue with with
you and talking about Islam and how you
do what's only talk about Islam in the
West all right just just to just to
illustrate that point really quickly
basically um in America in the United
States how long have you lived here for
if you don't mind me asking well then
ten years ten year okay so in the United
States a lot of people will make this
claim that Islam or people used to say
Isis or al-qaeda is like it represents a
massive
threat to the United States and I think
we would both agree that that claim is
pretty absurd that Islam is not in any
way size shape or form a threat to the
United States right now maybe you could
argue with some European countries with
immigration related issues it might be
but in the United States not as much and
I usually when I when I speak I usually
speak out against like really alarmist
or hyperbolic rhetoric like that so I
was speaking specifically to the United
States and that's why I got irritated
that people tried to reframe that into
like Islam is totally fine all over the
world which wasn't really my original
statement I'm sorry I'm just clarifying
that sorry
so my concern is because I do I can't
there's things I can't and I can't talk
about because of what I do and because I
work with government agencies so because
of the counter terrorism that I do I'm
aware of a lot more threats to our
safety than been on the layperson so
even I am I don't know how to
communicate this with people without
sounding overly alarmist because it's
terrifying if you really get deep into
it it's absolutely terrifying lives
you you can't again I don't want to feed
the beast so that is hate all Muslims so
again I I don't want to be overly
alarmist but I want people to IIE I
don't want it to be fun of as it's not a
threat it is absolutely a threat but I
don't know that when it comes to
Christianity that it's very different I
think that they could team up and and
become a superpower if they really want
it to they really really thought about
it and then the rest of us would be
[ __ ] but so I guess there are a couple
different issues that that we can talk
about the first one I guess and it
sounds like you agree based on what you
said with most of us but the first thing
that really irritates me is the simple
topic is I find that Christians are
insanely hypocritical when it comes to
criticizing other religions do you mind
telling me what is your personal
religious belief right now or you don't
have to share it if you're not
comfortable well I'm an atheist now okay
sir
sure so I'm an atheist as well right so
if you would have a discussion with me
about the philosophy of religion
whatever I will gladly lambaste every
religion I think that Islam and
Christianity pretty much anything that
has any kind of deity or whatever is
deity died dee-dee-dee-dee-dee one of
those rights thank God godlike figures
deity yeah are pretty dumb that the
prescribing ethics our morals from old
books and usually the treatment of women
and there's a whole bunch of issues with
a lot of these religions that I just
think are horrible
and I feel that way about most religions
and the big problem that I have is
especially in the United States and I'll
speak mainly about the US because that's
what I'm comfortable with we can talk
about some European countries I know a
little bit about the issues but mainly
the u.s. then a lot of Christians will
advocate for things that I think would
be advocated for by extremist Islam or
by extremist Muslims absolutely yeah
so this is my big problem with figures
like I don't know how many youtubers you
follow but people like Lauren southern
or roaming millennial will say things
like Islam is disgusting because it does
this and this and this and then on the
next tweet they'll say by the way women
that wear this type of clothing are
[ __ ] disgusting [ __ ] and it's like
okay well you're trying to tell women
that because they wear something they're
less than human this is essentially what
most fundamentalist religious people
advocate or so that kind of hypocrisy
really bothers me when Christians will
get up on on a platform and then
hardcore call out other religious
beliefs
it's the purity culture had a lot to say
about I don't think we're gonna argue
very much I think it actually might be
really good
hey well careful this is the easy point
the next one I'll get into we can get
into more geopolitical Muslim really
despair but but this is the easy one
sure but I think I think that it
anything you know even if we do disagree
and I argue a little bit which is fine I
don't take anything personally so don't
worry about it okay but I just think it
but even when we agree I think it's it's
interesting and it helps humanize
Muslims and then that's really my end
goal is to humanize Islam and humanize
Muslims if that makes sense
sure which I and I'm okay with that I'm
okay with that the same thing with them
you know I shed a lot on Christians just
because of their hypocrisy but I would
never advocate for like you know like I
hate Christian people but more just
recognize that a lot of bad stuff comes
from religion and we all need to be
cognizant I mean yeah yeah so the second
part okay so this is the more
complicated topic and it's if you you
might know so much more about this to me
so maybe you'll talk circles or me
here for the little bit that I know when
it comes to being critical of things
that are going on around the world we
can speak to terrorism directly and and
you can talk on this for a bit and tell
me of your greater disagreement when I
look into situations like what's going
on in the Middle East the more that I
read and research about it especially
with everything going on with the Syrian
conflict in Iraq over the past 10 or 15
years there's never been a point where
like I read something and it's like this
group of people was sitting here and
they were totally happy and then a
radical religion came in and it
indoctrinated them and now they all want
to kill people that never seems to be
the story but rather you have groups of
people that are oppressed by other
groups of people that then get funded by
other groups of people right like Sunni
oppression in Iraq that's funded and
then Sunni terrorism is funded by the
Gulf states and that all of these things
play out as like these geopolitical
narratives where religion is a factor
sure but I and and I feel like you could
swap out religions here and with these
same prerequisite conditions you would
still more or less get like a similar
thing that if you had if you had like
Protestants and Iraq that were being
oppressed by by Mormons and that the if
the Gulf states were all Protestants
that they would be shipping money to
Protestant extremists in Iraq in order
to fight against the Mormon you know
majority government and whatnot that I
feel like when people focus on religion
it feels really lazy to me where you
just want to blame everything on the
religious beliefs instead of taking some
instead of taking responsibility for the
horrible geopolitical nightmare that's
been created in the Middle East by all
these other countries I disagree and I
agree with ya so I think that will be an
interesting discussion ok yeah so I'm
curious with you what do you what do you
disagree with there well the its it has
a lot to do with the differences the
different cultures the within the
different cultures you have say I know
Pakistan very well that's that's the
country that I made babies with
Pakistani I lived in Pakistan the
longest time I became radicalized in
Pakistan that's my specialty
and a I with
Pakistani culture and the park sign is
an Islamic state you have different
different castes say right so you have
the different in there's many different
sects
in Islam too majority Sunni of course
and you're gonna have this in you that
are generally the ones that are that are
the most extreme um and and I have
argued with other X Muslims that I think
it is a matter of economics and people
being taken care of and having things
provided for them if they have no life
and no future then they're going to give
their life for an extremist cause um but
I argue that the religion has a lot more
to do with it than a Christian religion
would because of the holy books
themselves and because of the way they
have to be taken not that and I think
it's it's that people that tend to be
like me I was very lost and I I tended
towards the extreme because I was so
lost I was so messed up ahead
and I looked for the the bad things that
I wanted to focus on so I think that
instead of the text causes it but the
same it's a make sense like it's it's
also yeah to support your belief a lot
of the so a lot of people would argue
that it's the economically [ __ ] that
turned to extremism however people that
are recruited out of Europe to join Isis
a lot of those people were actually like
middle class people that were lost in
life sure yeah that's what the X Muslims
would argue with me about and I still
yes that's a small percentage but or no
I know I'm agreeing with you and that a
lot of the people that come over weren't
actually economically disadvantaged
today were people that were lost if you
look at the ISIS propaganda videos a lot
of them were just like hey you know like
you've got nothing going on in your life
nobody likes you come fight for us we
can give you a gun and a purpose and
something to really believe in right
these weren't all just economically
[ __ ] people sure yeah so and but it's
just it's the way the texts have to be
taken and it's the fact that they have
to be taken so literally again it
depends on the sect but it lends itself
to extremism and it lends itself to
violent acts obviously it's not every
single Muslim is going to take that even
though it has to be take it literally
with me this is how it works
you have I believed that apostates
needed to be killed right
I believe so you could not curse
Mohammed or Allah
that was it but it wasn't up to me to
kill that person it was up to the people
in charge in in so I would turn them in
and then the police and then he
eventually you know one of the Imams and
the judges they would have to all the
mold these they they would rule on all
these things and then sentence that
person I wouldn't feel bad about that
because that apostate needed to die but
I didn't do it so when I supported
terrorist acts it wasn't that I was like
I would be a terrorist but I believed
that Allah willed it he never would have
happened if Allah had willed it sure
Allah would have stopped it so that
makes perfect sense in my Muslim brain
that makes thanks to me have you ever
heard of the Milgram experiment I'm
sorry no oh it's basically there's an
experiment where somebody's in a room
and they have to shock somebody as
punishment for getting a test answer
wrong and a lot of people that do this
go through with the experiment the
entire way up to lethal levels because
they have a proctor in the room or like
a professor that's telling them to do it
and it's that that diffusion of
responsibility onto an authority figure
is a big driving factor in people in
otherwise good people doing pretty
horrible stuff that's kind of what
you're describing now it's just kind of
interesting to me I think I didn't know
that's what it was called sure I've seen
otherwise wonderful people do horrify I
have thought and done like I said I told
my my dear brother that I wanted him to
die sure because he was gay and while
he's sobbing and as a Mormon I hated
gays too so it was kind of something
that I needed a it was very important
that gay people were here I have a gay
cutter now I always joke that it's I
learned I just I learned compassion and
empathy and and things I didn't have I
didn't even know that I was lacking but
I've seen otherwise wonderful people
just stink to the levels of depravity
especially in in a mob when someone's
being killed and my ex-husband for wine
I mean he wasn't a terrible person all
the time he did terrible things but it
was especially
the whipped into that frenzy there's an
electricity in the air
things it I mentioned the smell but you
can you can smell death
you can smell like the mob frenzy you
can I I don't know how else to explain
it and it's just it's the strangest
phenomena I have not ever seen it I
don't ever want to see it again because
it's terrifying but um it's um it's it's
really weird it's just and these are
normal doctors nurses lawyers normal
people and then they turn into these
monsters and then they're back to be
normal again and it's like it never
happened and I do believe it's crazy I
think it's just it's quite a thing if I
had money and time I would probably
study more about psychology sure now I
have children but through the university
so that's not gonna happen
sure the so typically when I have
discussions I try to have my discussions
as policy oriented or basically my
conversation is how can we make the
world a better place
what are the problems that we need to
talk about and what can we do to make
the world a better place so when I look
at things like Islam or Christianity one
thing that's really frustrating to me
and it was hard to tell on your tweets
and I know that everybody on Twitter can
be a little bit misconstrued I have this
problem sometimes that a lot of people
they get on Twitter and want to rile
against Islam are basically saying what
amounts in my opinion to really stupid
things like Islam needs a reform we need
to perform Islam you know stuff like
this or like we need to fix Islam you
know and it just it seems to me like
there are so many things that we can do
in the world and so many examples of
Muslims who live under Islam today that
aren't crazy radically extremist people
right like for instance there are over
three million Muslims that live in the
United States that aren't killing
apostates or beheading women for you
know getting raped or or other you know
similarly horrible things and then it
seems like there are so many problems in
the Middle East right now that have
nothing to do with religion like all of
the geopolitical vying for influence
that other countries are doing in our
area it seems like it makes so much more
sense to focus on these issues rather
than just levy all of the blame on Islam
and say well Islam needs to fix itself
while Russia and NATO continue to [ __ ]
around in the Middle East and Muslims
around the world that aren't in you know
these really fought countries tend to do
a lot better I just
like a really disingenuous position to
take where nothing good can come from
that conversation you know and as
another point to that real quick like
people always point like well
Christianity had a Reformation that
Reformation was hundreds of years ago
I don't want Christians from the 1800's
or 1900s here today you know like
Christianity didn't really undergo a
Reformation that made the voting for gay
marriage legal it's just that people
became a little bit less Christian but
really I think in the West all right
sorry guys I think that's what it is I
don't think that I don't think this one
can't be reformed and I don't mean a
it's maybe generations from now there
might be a kinder gentler yeah again you
don't know this there's some differences
in sex you never know how that's gonna
go but I think that the reason my reason
what's up buddy oh [ __ ] what's up dude
so so that's your debate with your
college people yeah yeah that was kind
of a [ __ ] show
but um you know I noticed I don't maybe
you don't want to talk about CPI I
wanted to bring up one point during that
which no one was talking about I mean if
you're like a reasonable human being
yeah sure what do you want to talk about
it okay um regarding CP just something I
really quickly wanted to say mm-hmm
is that do you like I can I totally kind
of can see where you're going with this
and I pretty much disagree with Brittany
venti and all those people what they're
just extremist views against it but so
if you follow your think to its logical
conclusion though and your reasonable
points which is you know use old CP CP
that the actors have full consent of and
all that one thing to consider though is
it's not just so easy to get consent as
I'm sure you're aware because it's like
you know you need an ethics committee
you need to make sure that it's all not
gonna have some unintended consequences
and all that [ __ ] and so at the end of
the day you might have very very few
scenarios in which this is actually
gonna go pass through such a committee
right okay okay and then so from there
it's like you're you're there's so many
what-ifs that it's at that point you're
not even because people like to frame it
as oh you're an advocate of CP as long
as it helps solve this problem but it's
not even it's like such a narrow range
of cases that it's really that's really
such a bad way to frame it number one
and then number two something that I
don't think it's considered a lot is we
don't know I don't how recent are these
studies they're like not super long
going right they're not really studies
they're just like or I don't know if
it's considered a sin you know but it's
just like collecting data and saying
that like in countries where a point has
been legalized and even even child porn
or ever they're like certain sexual
attacks and whatnot like all of these
things tend to drop when that happens
well I mean like that there could be a
lot of reasons for that
maybe I mean that you can find a lot of
correlated things it's not necessarily
causal I mean like but basically my
whole point for this Glink is that like
my ultimate goal is to have less
children raped so I would just follow
the research wherever the research goes
like that's it it's like when you say
like a lot of these objections are just
like really dumb
sink down but like what do you say like
well maybe they can't get the consent
from anybody to do like the child porn
stuff but it's like well okay well if
they can't then we just wouldn't do it
like what do you think my response would
have been to that do you think that I
would say well they should force him
against their will to do it
no obviously no I'm just trying to see
where this no I'm saying that's not it's
not like you would just follow like the
research or the procedure so they can't
find anybody to do that yeah they just
wouldn't do it obviously and then what
do you think about about lowly like
virtual porn oh yeah that's a really
hard one for me from from me I would
have to think a lot about this for me
personally I don't like that [ __ ] in my
community I I think I have all that [ __ ]
banned across my discord and everything
just cuz I feel like if you're into
lolly [ __ ] that's like it's like you're
kind of into child Lauren but what what
like what do you think about that being
used as therapy instead of CP oh yeah I
mean if they could be used instead then
that would be highly preferable of
course yeah for sure cuz that's not a
person actually so I said this earlier
and of course everybody freaked the [ __ ]
out but like if we're if we're being
rational right child porn the
consumption of child porn in and of
itself isn't the moral wrong it's the
fact that somebody is hurt in the in the
creation of it that's the [ __ ] up right
so like if you could consume you know
like like lollies Khan or 3d porn or
some [ __ ] that's like children oh yeah
they'd probably be a lot better assuming
other things are in place like if that's
so then you don't you lowly as morally
wrong in and of itself then right
because no one's being harmed in moly it
would know you if you wanted to view a
lot like honest like morally harmful you
would have to make you would have to
make arguments about him about long-term
effect so like for instance like here's
a way that you could argue against it
now I don't know if this is true or not
but somebody could say that like well
we've looked at data and people that
look at lolicon after a while begin to
develop a taste for normal child porn
and then after well began to develop the
desire to abuse a child if you could
show those connections then you would
argue that by proxy well Lalique on the
[ __ ] the consumption of it is kind of
immoral because this is the row that it
leads down you might be able to argue
that you know ma'am
okay fair enough okay something else I
don't know if you you're willing to
entertain this but you were talking
about universities and about students
and how you don't think
and I think you said small tipple times
how you don't view that it's a big issue
yeah what's going on in universities
with I guess you could say social
justice or just left ism in general do
you say so you stand by that obviously
right I mean I think it's some stuff
worth talking about but I don't think
it's like a massive deal like the end of
the world or anything right yeah I mean
I agree but like you were saying that
students have always been yeah I've
always been radicalized yeah students
are always radically on college campuses
yeah but don't you agree that in this
day and age that professors are
certainly playing a role in this
radicalization at least in steering it
not really because it doesn't seem to be
demonstrated a lot of these times has
actually been like a professor fighting
a student like I'm what was that one
College where all the students were
rebelling against the professor even
though he was like somewhat reasonable
dude the guy went on joe rogan evergreen
yeah yeah yeah so like I I don't know if
I agree that like I mean like I hate the
poll like I like is there data to back
that like I don't know is this actually
like a thing where they're like all
these radical professors and [ __ ] well
if I if I may actually in that exact
scenario
Brett Weinstein as many times cited the
fact that the problem actually wasn't
the students it's because the faculty
and the staff and the way the whole
system was run was in such a way that it
actually further radicalized these
students and that the staff was
capitulating to this is just insane
demands that were probably he was he was
theorizing that they were essentially
radicalized and told to do these things
like they were actually told to protest
him for being white essentially by
another professor like he has gone on
record saying that and and so the point
is like yes you're right obviously these
students they're very you know
impressionable they're they vote you
know they're somewhat radical and
energetic but at the end of the day I
think a lot of this sort of censorship
and far-left ISM social justice going on
is hugely due to the professor's which
are very liberal of course
overwhelmingly liberal and not
conservative yeah I mean I would expect
anybody in academia to be overwhelmingly
liberal because it's very very hard in
the United States to be intelligent and
be conservative that's a very difficult
position to take
the Conservative Party the Republicans
are literally like denying climate
change and denying that contraception
works and like denying like all of these
like like previous pretty heavily
science to positions it's really hard to
exist in an academic environment and be
a Republican that's really difficult to
do you could do it for market-based
arguments for like economics and whatnot
that's probably why so many like MBAs
and like business-related people tend to
be more conservative and in academia but
if you're like in any of the social
sciences or any of that we're pretty
much your entire profession is denied as
existing by a lot of people on the right
yeah I can understand why would have a
liberal bias I don't know an entirely I
have to look in more like if you've got
whatever you just uh whatever you just
talk to me about if you could send me
that I'll read it later I'm to see if
it's a thing usually what I hear is um I
just shot your link somebody somebody
this is usually way here's the opposite
that when students engage more with
professors it tends to moderate their
views and that the most extreme students
you get are the ones that form these
unions are formed these student people
like body unless a student bodies but
they form like these student groups that
are on their own independent of the
professors that those are usually the
most radicalized groups of people but
what you're saying could be entirely
right the thing that I just think is
from 2014 so it might even be outdated
in the current political climate so for
whatever you were talking about earlier
if you want to shoot me that link and
I'll look over it sometime okay on
discord finds that more students engage
with faculty members and academics to
more on their political views moderate
student activities or what appear to
encourage those already leaning left or
right to tilt further yeah but I'm not
sure it could be I mean there could be
some professors playing into it but
again like do you think that like in the
60s do you think all the the professor's
were like Pro Vietnam Warren [ __ ] and it
was the students that were no no well
actually no back then they were more way
more conservative than they are now they
were probably still overwhelmingly
liberal but wait back in the college
days you think that the professor
students not the students the the
professors either they were more
conservative than the idea but the but
colleges played a huge role in
protesting the Vietnam War like they
like apparently like we're helping
students find ways to like avoid the
draft and [ __ ] like they were very very
liberal like there are there's a huge I
don't want a huge conservative Russians
have but there are a lot of
conservatives that blame on the entire
loss of Vietnam if you think that we
lost I blame that whole loss on
literally college kids protesting that
liberals are the ones and all the
protest from our made us lose the
well okay but that's a little bit
different because I mean even
conservatives - did many conservatives
or people on the right or whatever the
[ __ ] you want to call it of which I
don't even consider myself but even many
of them today would agree that the
Vietnam War was completely corrupt and
all that so no the argument would be
that I don't left back then I wasn't
it's just that they've gone too crazy
with the recipes I don't think that's
true I don't have appeal anecdote and
talk about my mom or dad but like I
would I would be interested to see
polling dedo and how many people thought
America was in the wrong for Vietnam I
would be interested to know if there's
like a Gallup poll or some [ __ ] maybe
somebody in chat will have a link to it
I'd be interested in saying do you think
any of these like skeptics that you
argued with all the time do you think
any of them would defend the Vietnam War
like any of the newer generation the
younger generation newer generation
maybe not I'm not sure it's really hard
because there's such a there's a huge
diversity of point of view right now on
the right in terms of like what they
believe in you know like I would be hard
- I don't want to generalize any of it
right like there's a group of them that
think that like Jewish people are
literally trying to destroy the world
and other people that don't think Jews
are a huge problem like I don't know
it's really hard to pin down like
Kwantung quote though right on a
particular viewpoint okay and then so
but do you think that free speech is an
issue on college at all or no um I
generally would lean yes but I'm pretty
extreme on what I consider free speech
and there are people that would argue it
less than me so like like personally I
think that even Nazis should be allowed
to go to colleges and speak I think that
being able to entertain any point of
view and then being able to dismiss it
with a good argument I think is really
important there are people that aren't
as Extreme as me on that but I would
argue in that case yeah for me
personally I would say colleges have a
problem with that it seems like people
purchase the fun kind of speakers and
they don't like which I don't
is a good thing right okay that's good
this is just another like generality do
you think that people do use the term
should prevail um in facts or what drive
at our elastic perception of reality
yeah it's called skepticism leprechaun
sorry something I've done in ask
question um do i [ __ ] well I'm sorry
that guy done it right when you read you
know it's fine do you use the term
Albright and do you think it's a
legitimate term oh um it's probably a
legitimate term but I try not to use it
I I actually like all my stream I tried
to abandon all of all political terms I
try not to use political labels because
I said earlier that every that oh that
there's such a huge diversity of you on
the right and then that if I label
somebody with a political label all
they'll do is say like oh well I don't
believe in this or that or that and it's
like okay well what do you and then we
have to go down every issue anyway so
it's like really hard you know yeah okay
like an example this would be like
there's a lot of people that feel that
they're right-leaning you know like in a
lot of their political views now but if
you go to somebody like in the in the
United Kingdom that's right leaning
versus somebody in the United States
that's right leaning right so many you
know they might agree on a whole handful
of issues and then when you get up to
socialized healthcare you know the
person the United States says well the
free market get the government out of my
[ __ ] healthcare and a Brit bomber
would be like what the [ __ ] you're
talking about mate get the [ __ ] away
from my NHS don't touch my health care
you know like so so it's really hard to
finally like a one political label that
can describe a large swath of people
right right okay exactly well I'm glad
you said that because even in and I
don't mean to like head you down for the
sins of your hackneyed okay I'll I'll
come out like I don't I'm not trying to
do guilt by association but I've noticed
like I brought your reddit and you know
I'm on your discord decently and it's
just it's not obviously exclusive to
there but a lot of people like who
consider themselves on the left we'll
just broadly use the term like contra
points does this a lot right on YouTube
and people like her um I think country
where it's just a pretty good job at
being somewhat specific in her speech
I've seen like seven or eight of her
videos at this point if you think
there's a spot where she says something
that's really inappropriate I would be
I'm talking about it on a trend like
thing you know but maybe in the future
if you want to point on an example on
Twitter and I'll go over it or something
but I'm getting there use the term
because right is actually a political
party started by Richard Spencer which
is indeed white supremacist and
nationalistic and they're like well when
you call someone like a Lauren sub well
I don't maybe learn something stuffed
the best example I don't know but when
you call someone like a I don't [ __ ]
know like okay like a sargon of akkad
alt right well is he really white
supremacist no but then when you're
allowed to use that term so broadly it
becomes a completely tainted term that
is now interchangeable with white
supremacy and it's like oh well yeah
it's not some weighted term it's kind of
like the word racist you just kind of
use it to discredit your adversary right
right yeah yeah and then it's a mistake
and like I said that's why I trying to
like I describe ben shapiro at one point
is all right and I didn't realize that
there's a lodge I don't want to see
everybody because it but there's a lot
of alt right people that believe in the
Jewish Question
the Jews are trying to take over the
world so you can't call Ben Shapiro all
right because he's [ __ ] he's just
like I don't know if you call me a
neoconservative and I'm not even sure if
that's appropriate but like that you
know you can't call it you and alt right
person because half the outright or or a
large portion of the law right thinks
that like Jews are trying to destroy
Western civilization you know right and
well with contra points the thing when
maybe this isn't the time to bring it up
but I was just gonna say there was a
actual particular clip where she called
Lauren southern fascists and it's like
well that's kind of what I mean like
she's just using it like that's another
term that gets thrown around very
broadly and loosely like fascist and
it's it's just so absurd because fascist
is not even close like Lauren southern
who just has may be very bright leaning
views is not even close to in a fascist
or authoritarian I'm sure I think Lauren
southern hits in terms of like so like
the big [ __ ] dude my government
knowledge is so bad so fascism has to do
with being very nationalistic and being
like I want to say like authoritarian
like yeah
and I think that Lauren southern is like
past that even Nash like Lauren southern
is somebody that I would call blatantly
white nationalists and I think I can
support that pretty easily so like and
then her motive discourse like seems to
play into that like authoritarian
mindset to some extent like I you know
pushing traditional values the family
you know like all of that [ __ ] like ah I
don't know if I have a big problem
calling Lauren southern I'm like
blatantly fascist especially with the
way that her messaging everything works
like going overseas to it to another
country to like jump on boats and like
drive away like the brown people and
[ __ ] like oh I don't know a dude that
soon do you okay this is very this is
related and this also has to do with
some of the streams you were involved in
I'm wondering if you've noticed this
phenomenon too or if you even recognize
this this phenomenon is like it started
from the fact that I think this is when
you were talking with Nick Fuentes and
northern southern and some other [ __ ]
and either you or someone pointed out
that Lauren southern is advocating for
these traditional family values and
having kids and yet like she's you know
she's single I think and she doesn't as
Roman millennial yeah right and so what
that kind of tells to me is and kind of
Brittany venti especially tonight kind
of lent me to believe this is that a lot
of these girls are kind of taking these
positions and maybe they really believe
okay hey buddy so I'm here to kind of
talk about ethno-nationalism because I
don't know I don't really follow these
all right kind of people not in tow the
whole LA I know that the online personas
not really into them so and I don't
really follow the more race realist idea
of it I believe in it more
philosophically rather than basing it on
IQ and all of these very not like you
said there are terms that really mean
nothing how do you choose how to run
society based on them even if it was
true okay like how do you make decisions
on it so I don't really believe it on
that I believe it more on the sense of
and also just on point on that big
problem with that is if you're saying oh
like you is a determining factor crime
is a determining factor then they have
to give up the fact of okay what if
Japanese because a lot of the talks are
about da you know Middle Easterners or
sub-saharan Africans coming into the
countries but what if you have a mass
migration hypothetically of Japanese or
all these kind of people who want to
come in with higher IQs who do less
crime there's no real defense against
that at that point even though they're
not of the same ethnicity but they fit
all your criteria of being high are cute
and lower crime rates so philosophically
it's more based on I believe in the
cultural aspect and I think that a
people and having its own country is a
good way to protect that because
otherwise you get things like Tibet or
like in America Native American Indians
where there's such a small unity they
only really exist and are still alive
because they have their own small
regions if they didn't exist a Fanta
assembly they'd probably be gone within
America right now wait why would that
matter well because I it's all based on
most of the stuff I think people try to
be true factual a lot of it is based on
what you find this important do you find
culture important do you
find just people in general as an
individual being happy it it's all based
on that I find culture because important
because I think it's a way that can
really unify people I think I really say
that you find that's important why not
just go and find someone have like the
same race or ethnicity and then just
breed with them well what I'm saying is
if you don't have a country to call your
own if you don't have a safe place you
you as a people and as a culture don't
really have any strong ways to protect
your future well like so let's say that
I really lean let's say that I really
like white people so I go on I find
another white person to have a kid if
they really like white people can't they
just go find another white person and
have a kid like what danger is there to
them but once you're saved minority in
your own country that culture really
I'll put it like this one thing that I
usually say a lot and mostly because
leftist say this lot is oh why don't you
I want to be minority what are you
saying that you're treating minorities
improperly I would say it's bad to view
minorities not because of how they're
treated but I think this is true no
matter where you are throughout all of
history no matter what region is if
you're minority you really have no
protection you might be fine right now
but if the majority later on decides to
screw you over for whatever reason they
can do that and you really have no
protection against it because you're a
minority well but that's all me today I
can't are you I'm only guessing because
your accent you're Canadian no no I'm
actually American but I do get that a
lot okay no what are you like really far
north or something or none
oh damn sober Brazil Illinois oh [ __ ]
okay weird I'm sorry I'd like an accent
I guess so looking at minorities in the
United States like we have protections
built into our Constitution to protect
minorities like if you're a black person
in the US and you only wanted like
further the black race like you could
just find a black person and have a kid
or like if you are Hispanic and want to
find a spinor you can do that it seems
like nobody's keeping you from doing
these things right now like do you think
that's gonna change in the future well
I'm saying that good change because
humanity's not going to be
for the next hundred years and then it
ends or America and its rules is not
going to last for all of eternity but
also I would say I would want to stick
maybe on the topic mortal ethnic like
directly ethnic places like say Germany
China place like that rather than
America this is one problem I have with
the basis a lot of it has to do based in
America which that is less about the
talk of ethnicity and ethno-nationalism
it's more of okay what's the legitimacy
of ethno-nationalism within America
because of the history and what's white
this is another thing I don't like to
talk about it's white because it's very
fate I do ethnically European and you
know it's very basic it goes back to
indo-european you know it's very easy to
save someone's ethnicity or ethnically
German wherever you want I don't even
know why that's necessarily true but but
so like so it's moving off from that
I'll assume it is I don't think that
like I don't know if everybody in
Germany is like purely like ethnically
German or if Germanic is even an
ethnicity I'd have to go look it up I'm
not entirely sure well I'm not saying
bully like that uh-huh
maybe ethnic regionalism I should say as
well because this also can include
Tibetans let's say cuz I believe they
should be protect their own culture and
I think that it shouldn't be wiped out
from Han Chinese moving in or whatever
so maybe could even be regional okay so
like so then do you accept that like in
the United States it would probably
never be relevant to like advocate for
an ethnos state we probably could never
do that
oh so the most part yeah but I think
that's something that has to be talked
about more so I would say what would
probably be beneficial is instead of
increasing you know immigration try to
keep the ethnicities even though this is
unrealistic not going to happen you're
nobody's gonna stand up and say
realistically that this is going to
happen but possible sell me this idea so
let's say that I'm somebody and I look
at immigration and I go wow immigration
has had a ton of positive impacts on the
US economy and by virtue of having good
impact on the US economy can positively
impact the crush in other ways so let's
say that I see this and I'm gonna go
vote on policy right now
okay identify as a white person or
whatever and I'm going to the polls and
you're outside and you've got to
convince me to say immigration is bad
stop it and then what is your argument
then when I say well I mean I think it's
an objective good economically how can
you turn me away from voting in favor of
it well if your only basis is Amex I
would say I'm not sure what I really say
against it what other basis should I use
it could be happiness cohesiveness
within a society culture let's just go
one at a time so let's say happiness
right nobody forces me to live next to a
brown or a black person like I could
just move into a why guess a white
neighborhood if I want or I could just
only associate with white people nobody
forces me to be friends with brown or
black people know if that's what makes
me happy no but that was just more of a
statement again it's like not that this
is the reason for us not actually I'm
more saying that if you fight it's what
you find important like say I find
cultural important I find people
important so if you find economics
important then I'd have to look into
that more to try to convince well I
guess my thing is just like I just don't
see what we could get that we don't
already have like if you find culture
important if you're you know like you
can live in areas that are mainly people
that like that kind of culture I guess
if you want to or you could have that
culture within your family like what are
some things that again like you're
standing up side the poem oh you're
trying to say hey this is a reason why
you should vote in favor of decreased
immigration why would what what's the
thing like just one reason like what's a
good reason what's like your killer
argument like this is why you need to
vote for it like your best argument for
why you would vote for a decreased
immigration everything this is why I
don't like American talking about an
American sense because it becomes very
muddied right ah but I would say
maintaining a majority helps protect
cultures and this is why I like speak
you take into place like Germany or
things like this kind of where you think
in Indians like Native Americans would
survive as people if they never had
reservations in America maybe maybe or
maybe not but like I wouldn't care like
when I think of like as a people I guess
make my my ethnicity as an important
thing like they would still have family
and they would have children and their
family names and their families would be
passed on maybe the their gene pool
would ever get diluted as they Nate with
Hispanics or white people or black
people or whatever but okay yeah
watching you I've you don't realize that
I'm just talking this about this just to
talk about my beliefs and stuff I know
that you don't really care about culture
right so we'll make the argument for why
anybody should I guess like because when
you say culture you I noticed this pivot
a lot that we jump from race to culture
like people of different races can share
a similar culture yeah I don't think
they can share similar culture but I
don't think it's a culture that has any
real protection like say if anyway my
protection what's attacking the culture
not attacking it's just that it has no
real secure future right no but no
secure future culture exchange all the
time it's like the nature they change
but they change but they kind of still
have its base culture like you can find
roots very you know heavily connected of
Western cultures into indo-european
cultures from thousands of years so you
know like you're not gonna confuse
German culture nowadays from German
cultures you know you can kind of
they're still but like but you know but
still happen even if you're like let's
say for instance there is a group of
Native Americans and they completely
bread out and whites or whatever and
their culture changes result those white
people would probably trace back
culturally like maybe they eat a
particular type of food I don't know
Buffalo I don't know what the [ __ ]
Native American cultures but maybe they
do something that they could trace like
oh yeah we got this from our Native
American culture I don't think families
ever get together and like totally just
wipe away the the all of the family
traditions of like half the family no
but over time it's not going to be 1/2
because cultures change but like you
said you'd still be able to trace back
roots of that culture know what American
culture doesn't have that much Native
American culture in it it's pretty much
dominated by a Western culture so if
Native Americans didn't have
reservations there that's a regeneration
sure but I'm just talking about like on
reservations like it's a little
different to say Native American culture
because this was actually like a violent
invasion
destruction of a people like that's I
think that's a little bit different than
like immigration and people choosing to
have children versus like militaries
coming in and wiping out you know 95%
plus of the inhabitants yeah but the
same effect happens right they get bred
out or they become a minority so once
the majority takes over they can and
this is why like say for Germany if they
be if Germans become a minority right
the people who come in I fully admit
like they can't integrate but you don't
know if one generation from now or two
or how many generations from well they
can start to connect with their own
roots like oh yeah we're we're from
North Africa let's like what you're
seeing nowadays where more people are
you know like African Americans are
connected to their African culture they
can go back to that and nobody's there
to stop them because there's no majority
culture of Germans why would you back
and really say why would you want to
stop them I guess I'm like I'm trying to
figure how this plays out in real life
like how is this let's say that I'm
somebody that loves white culture how
does this a negative impact negatively
impact me right now let's say I love
white culture and I love white people
and now some Hispanics moved in my
country how am i negatively impacted you
may not be impacted right now but I'm a
long term if they become a majority that
culture that you love and if you love it
and you want to pass it on you know
possibly it all depends if you want to
pass it on if you care about the future
well so like do you think that the other
people would like come into my house and
tell me no you can't pass your culture
on or how do I lose the ability to pass
it on to my children you can pass it on
but over time if they become a minority
they'd be dominated and possibly
integrated and possibly integrate it so
it sounds like the children would then
make the decision to take on another
culture isn't that ultimately their
choice in a way but most people who
integrate don't even great because
they're mostly integrating so that they
can fit in with the society so that they
can work you know kind of cohesively and
actually be productive I know if you're
a minority
you only stick to your own kind and only
stick to your own culture it's gonna be
a lot harder than if you integrate into
that society I mean I think you can
still maintain there people that are
bilingual there are people that have
different traditions at home versus out
in public versus in the workplace like I
guess I just have like a really hard
time seeing that like let's say that I
had like some tradition where like we
kill a turkey every year and then we
like I don't know pin it to a tree and
hit it with a bat or something that like
I could pass this down to my children
they could pass it down to their
children like this is a tradition that
would survive as long as my what's the
opposite of ancestors as long as my
children my future generations wanted to
keep it with them I don't see how even
if my culture became a minority in my
country I don't see how that would be
threatened in any way it might not be
threatened right now you might not see
threatened in future generations like I
mean all culture changes generationally
like even if you have like one
monolithic hetero heterogeneous culture
like there's it everywhere where all the
culture is like the same largest
homogenous yeah even that culture will
change like in the future like like such
that it might even be unrecognizable in
in a thousand years not even a thousand
in a few hundred years even without
necessarily people invading and like out
breeding the people like culture and all
that stuff changes over time no yeah
changes but being replaced is different
right
so like replaced it's just people come
in and cultures intermingle and like
there's a lot of Hispanic people that
come over to the United States that
probably absorb a lot of white culture
as well as bringing over their Hispanic
culture and I'm sure there are a lot of
people in the US that have taken on a
decent amount of Hispanic culture now as
well right I mean like this is kind of
the evolution of culture throughout the
whole history of mankind no right but
there's also been in many cultures that
have completely died out and you
wouldn't really say that like you
probably not sure but maybe those
cultures just suck I mean if they die
out they die like let's say I have a
tradition where I
I don't know chop off my son's foreskin
or some shell like maybe in the future
people just sound like oh well [ __ ] it
you know like I but I mean like that's
the decision of your of your progeny
like they get to make those decisions
don't get to make the decision that I
want all of my all of my children and
children's children I want all of them
to follow culture the exact same way
that I did you know people change over
time I don't see what the big deal is
with your future gentle with your quote
unquote culture dining out because your
future generations have made different
sessions about what culture they want to
embrace
I think the point I'm getting to is that
not that they wouldn't be able to
because you can of course within other
countries that you can you know continue
your cultural traditions but it's a lot
harder and if the majority ruling people
decide that they don't want you to do
that culture start implementing rules
that limit it or try to get you
integrated more into it there's not much
you can really do right like if today we
decided you know a Native Americans
we're getting rid of your reservations
you all have to split up and move into
the cities and have to be separated
right there's not much they can really
do sure no like black people can go or
white people can still live whatever
they want nobody's telling like you're
the one or not maybe not you
particularly but ethnos day people the
ones saying you have to leave these
lands like you can sick again like
that's my whole issue like if you want
to do whatever you want with your
culture in the US nobody's stopping you
from doing anything even if you become a
minority like you can still have your
same culture and do whatever you want
right right but that's the current
political climate right what if you
could change that nobody's pressuring
you it can change what you need your
minority can this is wiping minorities
bed it can change and there's nothing
you can really do it by the way can you
give an example of like a pressure that
you feel like white culture could face
that would irrevocably damaged like
white culture like what's it what's a
pressure that could happen let's say a
European nation were to become you know
the Europeans were minority within their
country oh wait wait let's say Germany
or France or wherever it doesn't really
matter okay whatever specific country
they can become a minority in this
generation next generation it could be
totally fine
they could you know they could practice
their culture but over time if the
majority culture decides that you know
they don't really like this German
culture they want to practice their
original cultures and they put rules
against or not maybe rules against but
more rules pushing people into
integrating into the new culture or
their old culture there's not really
much that the Germans are French can
really do about right look like or say
it doesn't have to be European but what
I'm talking about ethnic nationalism
it's not just for Europeans if say the
Chinese - were to get really physical
and say Tibetans you can never you
cannot practice your culture right now
we're gonna send on Chinese into there
to breed you out
hello so sadly it's [ __ ] rubbish
this is me without headphones but it
might be even worse than it was
with I don't know why my skype doesn't
seem to be sort of connecting to the
internet it hasn't updated since the
19th of December from the looks of it so
yeah it's kind of is kind of a weird guy
sometimes and I don't have discord so I
mean this isn't horrible it's a good day
I've talked too much where itself this
is okay all right well okay is it is
this any can I pop in my headphones is
that okay yes or was that considerably
worse all right I'll do that
so before we start I have to say that
I've pretty much only seen your content
when been debating idiots and so I might
have a really skewed perception of the
conversations you have so like when you
were on with no [ __ ] and jontron I
think and also recently with the kumite
this is obviously gonna be a very kind
of different conversation salty fruity
or go back to points we've already moved
on from sure what was there what
specific did you want to talk about
I only saw like that small clip of the
video I've seen so much stuff over the
past few days of having had time to
watch my long form no it's it's funny
well I I was really more that people had
brought up whether or not we should talk
because I was doing a chat with Kevin
Logan and we were talking about just
some of the drama and that included the
complete
dump dumpster fire that was you battling
like four people at once in an ongoing
stream and someone said it would be
interesting for you to talk to destiny
and I said yeah that would be fantastic
but really beyond that and then you're
like hey you want to chat and I said
yeah that sounds cool so I can we can
come up with a topic or we can find a
topic for a different day I'm totally
flexible about what you went on how you
undo it
I'm normally on the it's normally the
other people that has a traffic whatever
did you did you have anything in mind I
guess in regards to I guess the easiest
Isis out is there any do you know
anything about any of that conversation
like parts you disagreed with or
anything or well I think one thing that
actually I'm sorry actually back up let
me back up one quick second do and
introduce yourself so that people know
who you are sure yeah sorry idea yeah
I'm so hi everyone I'm Kristy I have a
youtube channel i am a while I started
off in politics and then did my PhD and
it's I do research but my channel is a
lot of sort of what's topical what's
going on in recent weeks because there's
been so much drama I've been sort of
following that on the other side of
YouTube sort of political spectrum from
myself yeah but I am sort of met
professionally I guess you'd say a
political scientist but on YouTube I'm
I'm a youtuber thanks me when you say
political scientists what exactly does
that imply do you do like polling data
or do you do like campaign staffer all I
do well I started off with my PhD during
quantitative survey data analysis and
that's where I I did my doctoral
research using survey data but after I
did my postdoctoral fellowship with the
British Academy I found it a qualitative
election study where it's more like a
frank luntz even though I did don't like
the way he runs his focus groups sort of
approach to understanding elections and
that is we do focus groups with you know
anywhere between 11 and 17 groups around
the UK we'll actually around Britain the
British election is studying out the UK
election study because Northern Ireland
is like its whole other thing so in the
British election study and then we go
back and we talk to them after the
election to see what their reactions
were and what they think about things
going huh going ahead nuts been my sort
of my main research focus since about
2010 yeah okay cool okay yeah and on
that sort of because one of the topics
that came up was this discussion about a
a thought experiment for people who have
who are
attracted to children the that study yes
but I wanted to come at it no actually
more from why I think it would be very
difficult to implement that study yeah
million reasons why it would be
difficult yeah that my yeah my problem
with these are never that it would be
difficult it's the it's when people
question the difficulty and assume that
I would take an extremely irrational
approach to it so someone will pose like
well what if you couldn't get anybody to
consent to doing this which is a very
real like that's a very real thing so
it's like but what do you think my
answer is going to be I will just force
them to do it to relive the trauma like
obviously at that point you would kill
it you know yeah well you must have felt
a little bit like you were starring in
The Wizard of Oz because everyone was
treating you like a straw man yes hey
cuz I have history with so many of these
people there so my background is
basically I did video games and I was I
do video games half and half I do video
games and I do politics and the thing
that kind of pushes me towards the
political side of it is that I don't
know if you familiar with this with a
stereotype of a gamer bro I don't know
if you follow the gamergate stuff and
all that yeah there's a lot of there's a
lot of that stuff that goes on in this
community so I kind of got interested in
politics but I'm also really interested
in I say this somewhat pretentiously
philosophy is very interesting to me and
that I grapple with it in a very kind of
like surface level way so I don't engage
with like academics as much although I'd
liked it to get like some understanding
of some literature at some point but so
so I engage with that stuff as best I
can as part of doing that there have
been interesting questions that we've
discussed on my stream because I think
they're really interesting topics so
like a question like this is a very this
is a very big one that a lot of people
have me over is like is incest like a
like a morally wrong thing and it's an
interesting question because it's a
position that people typically have a
revulsion to intrinsically but then upon
introspection you find that you have a
very hard time justifying that revulsion
unlike any type of like verbal level you
know so these are just kinds of like
interesting questions we have and people
start to hammer me over these like also
you'll love incest Kannur just because
we talk about these topics on stream but
I'm very interested in grappling with
the philosophical side of a lot of
arguments there was a guy called you
know who I'm OC is or whatever oh yeah
yeah so there's like yeah so he pushes
for
he pushes for a position where he
believes that the age of consent should
be eliminated completely he thinks that
sexual relationships between even a
child as young as zero or like one or
two years old within a fully grown adult
that these can be consensual
relationships this is something that
philosophically I find quite easy to
attack because the concept of informed
consent is very much rooted in my
Phyllis in my ethical background that
it's a very important thing to
understand especially with children
because children can't really protect
themselves and I noticed that almost was
kind of making his rounds in the in the
skeptic community and usually he would
go on a show and then people could start
screaming at him and they'd be like
really angry and that was it and that
kind of bothered me I was like okay well
let's actually try it so I brought him
on I had a discussion with him and in
the purview of that I think like child
porn came up once and I think he asked a
question about like well what about this
or this or this and at some point I'd
mentioned like this research and I was
like you know there might be some slim
cases where child porn is acceptable but
only if the goal is to reduce the amount
of children being abuse or something
and then there are like three people
that hyper hopped on to that comment and
tried to push it as though like I'm a
huge child porn supporter and one of
those people was that a Britney girl and
yes when she hopped into that debate it
was literally just for her to smite me
with that one-liner even though we'd
like hash this out on like a three-hour
discussion before so there's a lot of
backstory that's that's where that um if
that if that question seemed like really
random that's why that happened it's
because that's like her personal
vendetta against me for whatever reason
there was a lot of gotcha moments a lot
of sort of really trying to set up a yes
or no dichotomy and when you tried to
provide context you were just completely
like just thrown back into this corner
saying now you have to pick a side we're
either way I've got you yeah and that's
kind of the that's the story though of
the that I've noticed I can't speak to
your country as much although I followed
a little bit of brexit related stuff but
like this right versus left argument is
very difficult to have because on the
right side you know like if it let's
look at like black people in United
States right the right will tell you you
know like well what's up with black
people they just need to make better
choices everybody can make better
choices well okay I guess like yeah that
sounds good but then if you look to the
left like well why are black people not
making good choices well there's no
simple answer to that it's like you need
like paragraphs and paragraphs to
explain you know like well Jim Crow laws
okay that was 60 years ago it's like
okay yeah but generational wealth is a
real thing okay well what about this
poor guy that's rich it's like Jesus you
know you have to go through
anecdote you gotta go to a pill
tradition you got to go to appeal to
it's like a million different things
that you have to like get through in
order to like present your case and then
the person on the right is just going
okay well I think people should just
make better choices you know I had a
friend and he made better choices and he
was poor and now he's rich and it's like
okay we'll [ __ ] like how do I you know
just really frustrating to deal with
that kind of stuff believe me dealing
with the feminist critique on YouTube
I'm familiar with these straw Manning
concepts and taking an argument that you
know rape culture it's it's a word that
doesn't really convey the concept very
well but they stop at the word and then
they sort of create the straw man of
what they think it means exactly like oh
the survey data shows that people don't
approve of rape doesn't prove you're a
rape culture or not it's like you're
like no desire to like actually grapple
like do you really think that somebody
made up a term for the idea that like
everybody is in favor of rape you know
like and then these same people will go
on Twitter being like I don't understand
what the big deal about the Harvey
Weinstein stuff is like if your boss
asked you for sex just saying no and
it's like ah [ __ ] does not that easy
kind of just wish you could live in a
world that was just so simplistic don't
you think where there weren't power
relations and people didn't have to
worry about punitive measures or losing
their job or not being given a reference
and you know sort of driven from their
industry because they spoke out against
a powerful man no no no let's not
consider that and just go hey you have
agency no one's stopping you from
walking over to Human Resources which is
already designed to protect people at
the top and all their top stars and to
keep code of silence and have you signed
a nondisclosure agreement yeah just walk
up to them and tell them the problem and
they'll fix it I feels like our progress
sometimes shoots us in the foot like
like to be honest like relationships or
relationships or status of like women
and minorities has increased
dramatically over in the Western world
it has improved markedly but it seems
like when you knock out all of the easy
problems the difficult ones become
really hard to tackle you know and
people act like if there aren't like
this if it isn't blatant then it's not
real so like I mean my debate with
Sargon for instance you know like and I
and I heard that you had one of these as
why I didn't have a chance to watch
Warren but um we talked a long time
about like black people in the United
State
and he's like well you know there's a
lot of problems that come from broken
families and it's like yeah of course I
agree that he's like well if black
people just got married it would fix
their problems and like sargon it
doesn't really work that way like
there's prerequisites to getting married
like get marriage is a symptom not like
a condition you know like marriage is
typically a symptom of being successful
being somewhat wealthy and he's like
okay why can't they just get married
marry black people do better than single
black people or broken family like that
looks like okay yeah but the getting
married is really hard there okay but
why can't they just do it and it's like
and then it'll go up to the inevitable
where Sargon literally asks where is the
law preventing black people from getting
married and it's like okay dude or where
is the law preventing women from
choosing engineering degrees all right
and they're trapped in this sort of
almost like first wave feminism which
was focused mostly on the laws and
changing things like giving women legal
personhood and the ability to own
property and have access to their kids
or even custody upon divorce and and
they think that that's once you have a
law in the books then somehow the
problem is solved which is really no
that's just a resetting of the society's
values on legal footing but nothing in
the society has automatically changed
overnight you know people who are on one
side of the other don't suddenly you
know have their minds change because the
Supreme Court says that now a marriage
equality is the law of the land and it's
those informal relationships it's the
being discriminated against when you go
to a baker and having to take it to
court in order to get your equality yeah
that's the fight that they don't really
want to recognize and it's kind of with
the the me2 thing as well the idea that
if you're harassed in the workplace it's
it's an easy situation to just not to
have that taken care of or that when you
say something you know people are going
to believe you and not really taking
into account like we're talking about
the power dynamics the punitive measures
that might be taken and as we saw with
quite a lot of the me2 cases there was a
real power imbalance there it wasn't
like people were going men weren't
hitting on women who were above them in
power they were hitting on you much
junior women knew who had much less
ability to speak up for themselves like
gretchen carlson did at fox
uh-huh and even that
do you have talk radio in the United
Kingdom well I'm actually living in
Germany now I know why half years that's
okay because I talked about my PhD
having done that in the UK gotcha are
you four are you British no I'm actually
you know the states but then I lived
long enough in the UK to sort of have
this pick up when I talk about British
things I tend to get more of a British
accent when I talk about things back
from America like baseball and brats and
going to the mall then my American
accent gets stronger so it's a little
bit situational and then when I'm in
Germany occasionally I speak German God
shadow okay are there like this talk
rate is talk radio in other countries
dominated by right leading figures like
it is in the United States I have to say
that my because my my German isn't as
fluent I don't listen to a lot of talk
radio in the UK most of the radio that I
listen to didn't really ever go over to
AM radio but in the UK you've got like
six stations of the BBC Plus then you
have commercial stations and so I don't
really think that there's that kind of
would they have more in the newspapers
you know the Daily Mail and the
Telegraph the Tory graph and they have
the Sun and so it's primarily more of a
a print dominated conservative voice
online now as well whereas in the
state's media tries to pretend it's
neutral you get more sort of commentary
on the radio so it's a slightly
different dynamic but that whole that
culture is there just where they get
their news from is slightly different
I'd say in the UK from the US I don't
know about gotcha
but I mean you can definitely see that
talk radio is moving over to YouTube
yeah yeah in the United States a talk
radio is mainly right-leaning or at
least it feels though I'm pretty sure
that's true I'm positive instruction the
talk radio is overwhelmingly
right-leaning but my guess would be just
because talk radio probably appeals to
older people more whereas the YouTube
stuff appeals to younger people and I
don't think they're picking up really on
the metrics of people like on the
alt-right who are getting pretty big
audiences and also people who aren't
openly alright on YouTube but certainly
are willing to platform those people and
entertain their ideas and give them a
much wider audience without act
engaging in a strong critique and
pushback of their claims sure yeah
definitely the Dave Rubenstein
yeah the something that's been really
frustrating to me recently is that is
I'm actually I'm actually excited that
like the ethnos State people are
becoming more vocal now like I don't
there's got to be a name for this maybe
in political theory you have like a
better way to describe this but like I
would rather have you know ten racists
like 10 like avowed racists in a room
that are openly like I hate black people
I hate Hispanics I would rather have ten
of those people in a room then three of
them in a room and seven people that
claim to be neutral but like are totally
okay with the other three people because
it makes it so much harder to attack all
of them when they can always say well at
least I'm not that guy does that make
sense no it does yeah we would call it
sort of like the difference between
people harm in measurement terms a
manifest variable and a latent variable
for instance there are people who
identify as being on the sort of
neo-fascist all right they would be in
favor of a white ethno state they they
would hold all the positions and then
you'd have a you do there is polling
data that shows that quite a lot of
white people in America although they
won't necessarily go as far as saying a
white ethno state but they think that
whites are discriminated against more
than any other group and they have they
will agree with a lot of the same
grievances you have that too with
measures of feminism you have people
like myself who will say yes I'm a
feminist and then there are other people
how although they don't claim the title
of feminists will basically agree with
all the feminist positions that you put
on a survey for them to answer those
people under the surface sort of not
being out and identifying by being
sympathetic I think and that is the the
part of the population that's hardest to
yep and we are live
what's going on fam what is good
happy uh 2018. it is uh january 5th
we have a uh very special guest today
on the baked alaska show it's uh a
person probably a lot of you know
uh he likes to debate right wing people
i guess that that's sort of how i know
him but i'm gonna ask him some more
questions
uh and get to know him so the way i
found out
uh about destiny was actually uh when i
was
hanging out with ice poseidon on a
stream and one of his guys came up he's
like oh you gotta
debate destiny and all that stuff so um
and he and he tweeted from my phone so
i'm not at like a huge debater so
i the topic i chose is that we debate
star wars because it because i
i'm not i'm not some like super serious
guy here i'm a comedian i'm funny you
know
i have my views i like to play video
games but
so we're going to make we're going to
debate star wars so but before that i
just wanted to
get to know destiny a little bit because
i haven't talked to him before
and asked him some questions and and he
also there's a video if you guys haven't
seen
he gave ice poseidon uh advice about his
streaming community when he was sort of
[ __ ] up
and i will never forget that video is
just really solid good advice so this
dude
you know whether you like him or not has
experience in the streaming community
and so
i look up to that for sure so uh welcome
destiny to the show
hey welcome me thank you welcome you to
my show and yeah what's up
just chilling just chilling man so uh
what have you been playing these days
uh mainly a horrible game called league
of legends and then a couple of solo
player games
every single oh dude league of legends
is not a terrible game i love league of
legends
then it's horrible what do you mean i
don't know
that that's pretty much my favorite game
right now i mean the meta the met is
kind of shitty right now
i will admit that but what do you like
do you play ranked or whatever
yeah what like rank are you um
i'm like a challenger
so does that mean gold or silver or what
plat oh okay that's not too bad no no no
i'm uh i'm silver for
oh i'm in here well you're trying i'm
trying i'm not that good but i'm like
i don't know i enjoy i play i like
jungle a lot
i've been playing um the [ __ ] out of
warwick warwick jungle is pretty op
right now
and um and then a lot of adc so gin i've
been playing gin
jinx ash there's a ton of adc but
mainly i do adc and jungle but my best
character right now
is definitely warwick the warwick jungle
it's just
just crazy what about you um yeah i
normally play 80k
um who do you play uh right now i'm
doing tristana
um tris is super op i always i usually
ban tris
it's it's ridiculous the i thought the
worlds were really good this year
they haven't been good for the last
couple years but i i enjoyed the world
so that's cool though i'm glad you play
league i uh we should play sometime i'll
put my uh
here's my league name
you sure you do you share your league
name publicly or is that private
um yeah i mean i kind of have to right
because i'm streaming so people can
always see it
punish destiny okay cool yeah i'll add
you after this that's cool man
so um yeah more about you so
i just want to ask you like so who
exactly are you i mean the way i
described you
is i i i know you've debated some of my
friends you like to debate right wingers
you obviously don't like trump like
where
when did you start streaming and how did
like video games turn into politics i
guess i
i'm pretty curious about that um
i guess i've always been i've been
screaming for a long time i was one of
the first professional streamers i've
been doing it for
probably over seven years now um
the um i've always always kind of talked
about other stuff
on my stream like philosophy or psych or
ethics or politics or whatever
and then during the 2016 election season
um that thing during that whole ordeal
the political talk really picked up
and i noticed a lot of other people
doing politics on youtube and i felt
like a lot of it was kind of dumb
so i decided to jump into it so now i
split my time up between gaming and
politics kind of 50 50.
okay that's cool so what like what is
your
w would it be correct to say that you
hate trump or
or what is your feelings on trump um
yeah i guess you could probably say that
i think that everything he's done is
pretty bad i don't well
i don't know if i would say i hate trump
i think trump is really stupid um and
pretty ineffective as a leader and then
obviously ideologically we're opposed on
a lot of different grounds as well so
whatever you want to take from that you
think he's pretty stupid you think he
eats too much mcdonald's drinks too much
diet coke i don't
know about any of that i just think that
his answer to every question related to
anything more complicated than
like somebody how do you know he's not
playing 4d chess buddy how do you know
he's not
taking you for a whirl there well
because there's been no indication that
he has
i guess i mean i think 4d chess would
have had you know like
i feel like it would have been less
disastrous in office by now if that was
true but
i mean some raspberries dude i'm on this
like all fruit diet
all fruit isn't that like a ton of sugar
i'm doing like it's like all fruit
during the day until like 6 p.m
and then you can like eat a bomb meal
you can eat whatever you want but i'm
during like the fruit
only portion and so
it's hard i'm struggling here i'm like
eating this thing raspberries
um gotcha yeah so
so you think trump is not smart so you
think
what you're telling me is you think
someone who isn't smart can become
the president of the united states yeah
i mean it's not like you have to take an
iq test to become president i mean
people like ben carson and
jeb bush well i don't know if jeb bush
is an idiot but people like ben carson
and whatnot we're running
um carson is super smart dude what are
you talking about i mean he's smart when
it comes to
probably like neurosurgery but outside
of that he said some pretty dumb things
do you think he's not smart because he's
black why is that i
i mean i don't think i said that i
listed jeb bush as well and i don't
think
that sounds a little racist destiny i
mean i'm trying to keep things
i'm trying to keep an open playing field
and just you know consider everyone's
feelings and not just like look at the
race i think ben carson is a
very intelligent man okay i mean i guess
i would disagree i haven't really seen
outside of his neurosurgery practice i
haven't really seen any evidence of that
seems like he's pretty lost in his whole
uh hud position and yeah
during the nomination he said a lot of
really dumb things so
i yeah he he has said some dumb things
i'll give you that i'm just messing with
you but um
we got a super chat here uh james laurie
thank you he said
destiny could be part of your daytime
diet ooh
looks like that's a dig so how tall are
you i've i've heard rumors you were five
one yeah i mean what what what are the
official stats
i'm not actually even sure anymore um
so if i stand next to a wall and i put
like a ruler on there
it says that i'm five eight but so many
people online say so many different
things i kind of
start to wonder i'm not sure if maybe my
measurement devices are a little bit
messed up i might be five two i might be
four six i might be a dwarf i'm not
actually even sure
well 5 8 is not bad that's not i don't
even think you're in manlet status but
for some reason
everyone kept saying you were like 5-1
yeah i don't i'm not sure i guess when
you run out of real arguments you kind
of go to the
go to the random things maybe go to the
ad hominems yeah that's true
so real quick i wanted to ask some
advice i i know you guys uh you know
want me to go at it with destiny
um and we'll get there we'll get there
to the star wars bit but
what i want to get some advice from you
because i i do
look up to you as a streamer we might
not agree politically but um
what advice could you give me sort of
lately
i feel like i don't know if you can uh
relate to this but
i've had a lot a lot of my community it
seems like it's almost like
weekly now it's just like there's a lot
of discord drama
there's a lot of people that don't like
certain people that are like
i'm not going to be in the community if
these people are there and there seems
to be a lot of
stuff like that that goes on kind of
frequently as
seems to happen online and trying to
make
peace with everyone like i've sort of
just i don't know i i always feel like
i'm always disappointing
some people and i'm trying to keep rules
and keep like standards because you know
i don't want
people in my community that are complete
[ __ ] and are just going to be toxic
and all that so what advice could you
give me as far as how to
like sort out the toxic people from your
community but without being
like a dick about because i do like free
speech and i do like to allow
people with different opinions in my
community i
i mean i don't know too much about your
stuff but but i know a little bit about
it
don't you do like um and i don't mean
like an install by this don't you do
like a lot of like really edgy
like racial related kind of
charlottesville stuff
didn't you weren't you involved in a lot
of this kind of stuff i'm not i'm not
super edgy no
not at all not even a little edgy
the only reason i bring it up is not to
like not to insult you whatever but like
i mean if you build a community around
like really edgy content like that like
if you
if you draw a lot of viewers from like
like pole esque places or like the
donald esque places
like then you would expect that to
manifest in your community in dramatic
ways right
you think the donald is edgy yeah
i'd say a little edgy yeah a little edgy
a little edgy okay
or maybe very edgy yeah i get i guess
i'm edgy i guess i'm edgy
uh but yes no no i was i was at
charlottesville for sure i think i think
the public perception of me
definitely is that i'm edgy but i think
when you sit down and talk to me or get
to know me i'm really not that edgy
so you know i i believe in free speech i
believe
being able to talk on a stage with
people you
don't fully agree with and i think
that's totally fine
and i think you know if you know what
happened to me at charlottesville i got
attacked by antifa
so i showed up i showed up to speak at a
free speech rally they had a
permit for the rally and i was invited
and there was
various types of people it wasn't some
scary kkk rally like
the media reported and uh you know there
were some stupid people there of course
i would agree with that
uh but there was also some good people
there wait wasn't charlottesville
the literal like nazis that
you're are you joking i i can't tell if
you're being serious wait i thought that
i'm pretty sure charlottesville had
literal
self-described you know it was not no
it's not a nazi rally no wait are you
sure about this positive yeah i was
there were you there
i i wasn't there but every article that
i read on this described it and i think
the organizers were
yes you you read fake news destiny
that's what happened that's what
happened
so that's the big misunderstanding there
were people
sure about this i'm positive yes i was
invited and other people were invited
that are definitely not nazis i'm not a
nazi
and well not every single person there
might have been a nazi but it
but it's not a nazi rally it was not a
kkk rally it was a it was a free speech
rally
is the point were there people there
that are national socialists that showed
up
yes there were some people that showed
up their national socialist
there were apparently some kkk people
aren't they literally
chanting like blood and soil and jews
will not replace us
i was at the i was at the torchlit rally
i never heard wait the
tiki torch rally oh i was i was at the
famous tiki torch
rally baby yes okay i never heard
i never heard that i never i heard you
will not replace us
which is a demographic uh immigration
debate uh for another day but
i don't think there's anything wrong
with saying you will not replace us
which to me means
uh we want to keep the demographics
majority whites
and because that's how our country was
founded just like in japan
they want to keep it majority japanese
and i don't think there's anything
wrong with that it doesn't mean i hate
other people or don't want other people
to be here i just want to keep the
majority
okay well so like if we're talking about
like keeping the demographics majority
white and stuff
aren't we aren't we getting kind of
close to nazism there
like a certain race of people should be
you know upheld
in terms of like our you know not at all
not even a little bit not even just a
little itty bitty
nope not at all you're stretching okay
because when somebody
takes a country that's pretty that would
be destiny that would be like saying
uh japan are nazis they have 98.4
ethnic japanese there so i think the
japanese are nazi's destiny
kind of yeah japan is one of the
israelites
well japan has some of like the worst
like treatment of like other people
in in the world it's actually like a
really well documented thing like
destiny take it back you just
you just said a thing that is gonna be
this is a meme right now
anna the anime fans are never gonna uh
forgive you for this man
okay you better think about what you're
saying i mean i'm thinking about it but
i'm pretty sure that japan is like one
of the most racist countries on the
planet or at least it was five or ten
years ago i don't know how they've made
progress
so okay so japan is nazis okay so
israel they also have a high pretty high
ethnic
uh jewish population so are they not i
mean i am
you're i'm you're not going to find a
defender of israel here i'm not a big
fan of the way israel conducts itself so
are you what what does that mean that so
you're anti-semitic
no i just i think the whole israel
palestine thing is really [ __ ] up
you're not a fan of israel not not
really no
so you're not a fan of the semitic
israel that would be anti-semitic
correct am i am i reading you correctly
to be anti-semitic i would have to not
like israel because they're jewish
i don't really care that they're jewish
i just don't know why don't you like
israel i don't know it seems like they
bully those poor little palestinian
dudes around quite a bit
i'll tell you why i you know i i have a
love hate relationship there you know
like
as far as making jerusalem the capital i
have no problem with that
as far as them existing i have no
problem with that um but
us giving them boatloads of money
constantly
when we get nothing in return i i think
that's a shitty deal and i think that's
a shitty deal with
um any country sure well i mean we we
we're interested in
like um geographic influence right it's
like probably one of the big reasons why
we're fans of israel
unless you believe that the jews are
secretly controlling us to be big fans
of israel i'm not sure how
far down that route you are or road you
are but
i mean everything is a jewish conspiracy
i mean that's
just obvious you know ice beside and
he's not
trolling he's like 27 and he's pretty
greedy
it's impossible to tell if you're being
serious because there are a lot of
people that really believe this
well okay wait so i i don't i don't
think the jews control everything
um quite a bit of stuff i think they
have an over
proportionate uh amount of influence in
our media i would agree with that
okay well hey so if you thought what do
you think about that
i'm serious i'm just curious if you if
somebody told you that they were
marching with
tiki torches and they were chanting you
will not replace us and they were really
concerned with the demographics and they
also thought that jews had a
I think it's very cute right here notice
how notice how palpable palatable
notice how palatable he's packaged the
idea of separate races here notice how
the only traits that he lists are in
arguable traits and traits that aren't
controversial listen there is six
including but not limited to skin colour
and facial features notice how those are
the only two of the D lists right
nothing controversial but just oh yeah
different people have different skin
color and facial features
therefore yeah that's funny that's cute
I like that nice gem be more or less
frequent in subpopulations depending on
whether your ancestors came from one
continent or another in this case why
you stood at the characteristics would
make it possible to try someone's
ancestry back to a continent or to a
specific population as can sisters in
the past this is what we call a cluster
a genetic distribution as opposed to a
random one such clusters are present in
human populations which confirms the
exit yeah he said they're not limited to
that so he leaves it open-ended enough
for racists to agree with right oh yeah
and other characteristics such as IQ
cognitive ability he of course of course
he doesn't actually like name enough for
anybody to District four he doesn't name
enough word to be offensive but he
leaves it open-ended for like racist
people to cling on to right it's good
distance of races however finding these
clusters merely allowed scientists to
reaffirm our conclusion that races are
real in humans indeed the obvious
observation that the fish right now oh
wow this is really interesting he used a
lot of the rhetoric against me this
video must have been recorded before
last night most of the dialogue because
this read a lot of these same talking
points were used against me this is also
not true hold on
I think these clusters merely allowed
scientists to reaffirm our conclusion
that races are real in you humans he
brought this up yesterday against me or
yesterday two days ago where he said
that um scientists have reaffirmed what
we once thought to be true about race
that's absolutely not true
phrenology I'm sorry phrenology as a
science is completely like debunked this
idea of the racial divisions that we
once believed existed that there are
segments on the skull that are unique to
the Negra reign or some [ __ ] has
absolutely not been verified and if
anything genetic sequencing has given us
like a lot more insight into what we
consider to be races or how
geographic origin works then than what
was ever once thought on that there are
a vast difference between types of black
people types of even Africa and
sub-saharan versus northern Africans
different groups of white people and
whatnot so no that statement is totally
incorrect that we but but again this is
another cute way of ok races however
finding these clusters merely allowed
scientists to reaffirm oh yeah so again
this is something that is packaged very
disingenuously
I love this I love how dishonest the
statement is it's a it's like this is
like such a great lie ok so what we have
is hold on like I think you could do so
much I wish I had better tools to do
this with so what we have is we have a
word okay hold on a meeting all these
and say we have a word okay that means
something okay Tara McCarthy does this
as well with the word right white right
so we have this word that means race
okay so we had all of these ideas about
what what did what were different races
of people you know like black people
were subservient they had the Negro
brain the Negros skull you know we had
all of these traits about black people
and now coming into the future now that
we can sequence genes and what not now
that we have debunked things like
phrenology we actually don't have this
understanding at all you know with this
idea that black people's skulls were
shaped differently or all of this like
this isn't true at all right so but but
we've held on to this one word we've
held on to the word race here so as
we've moved into the fold into the
future using our better understanding of
human biology and human behavior in all
this right we have confirmed that there
are genetic clusters that can be traced
back to geographic origin so you know
these are definitely thing that exists
jf pins this word race and says that
because we believe in races now to some
extent or at least we can verify genetic
clusters biologically that means that we
used to believe that race was a real
thing well all of this is true so he
does two things here is one okay he
makes the message digestible for a new
audience somebody that's not racist
because okay while he said that people
used to believe in a separation of the
races and we do now
so yeah that must be true but he also
makes the message simultaneously
digestible to an audience that is racist
like ah when the past we knew black
people were less than white people we
knew that Asians weren't created we knew
that Jews were very smart and jf is
affirming that we have affirmed our
previous superstar our previous beliefs
with our current research right that
this kind of like intellectual
dishonesty is so dangerous because it's
so effective the way that this is
packaged is really well done I'm in
terms of selling you like a
propagandized message that's total
[ __ ] [ __ ] right it's just this is
a total [ __ ] lie the idea that
modern-day gin modern-day gene
sequencing has reaffirmed like
phrenology or racist thoughts from a
hundred years ago is absolutely
ridiculous
but because he's packaged it in this way
it sounds sellable because of that word
race right yeah that's really
interesting it does it confirms the
existence of races however finding these
clusters merely allowed scientists to
reaffirm our conclusion that races are
real in humans indeed the obvious
observation that the facial features of
Asians whites and black people can be
easily identified and that these
features are irritable is sufficient to
conclude that race realism is true so
again this is such a complicated topic
but he's so good at like selling it in
one word phrases so we can see that
there are differences we can see so if I
make an analogy then this seems absurd
right but so we see that there are
differences in people's faces and skin
right there for races must be true but
the thing is that he's making an
argument for something different and
then and then because he's made an
argument for that difference he
instantly applies it to something else
so what jf is arguing for is that there
are observable differences in people
that's true of course they're observable
differences in people but then he takes
that argument and he somehow applies it
as though it's a justification for the
separation of people into races which is
depending on how you want to approach
that argument isn't necessarily true so
here's an example of this let's say that
I have let's say that I have ten
different pencils okay let's say that
I've got a red pencil a blue pencil a
green pencil you know different types of
colored pencils what I can do is I can
say here i have you know i've got i've
got i want to subdivide these into
different things that that are more
specific than pencil rather than just
color right so what a purse
ago they would say well look look you
can observe you know this is very
different than this you know the green
pencil in the red paths are very
different you like well how they're all
pencils I don't think you know look at
all the observable differences between
these pencils you know these are totally
different things it's like well hold on
that's not necessarily true right just
because the pencil is a different color
doesn't make it not a pencil or a
different subdivision of pencil it's
just a pencil with a different color the
argument that there is something
intrinsically different about these
things like what race realists say and
so far as cognitive function and IQ has
to run a lot deeper than observable
differences on for another really great
example of this so this is one way to
debunk the argument and that he's not
actually making the argument for the
separation of races there's a second way
that we can debunk this argument though
is that we can take the syllogism that
he's created and we can plug different
things into the premises and we can
actually generate conclusions that we
don't agree with so let's listen to the
syllogism moment time the syllogism is
essentially observable differences means
that race is real humans have observable
differences
therefore race is real right hold on so
it's a black people to be easily
identified and that these features are
irritable it's official to conclude that
race realism let me let me we'll listen
to it at our source speed here so that
we can really think about it okay indeed
the obvious observation that the facial
features of Asians whites and black
people can be easily identified and that
these features are irritable is
sufficient to conclude that race reality
is true so just because people have
different identifiable features that in
and of itself according to jf is
sufficient to claim that race realism is
real but race realism doesn't just mean
people look different it implies a whole
lower set of cognitive functions now let
me instead
let me instead take I wish I could use
my own family I don't have pictures of
my family but I could instead take
pictures of a group of people who are
all related to one another okay now of
these people that are related to one
another I could find a lot of shared
features but I could find very different
features as well if we have a great
grandma and a great grandpa you might
see something like a different nose show
up in different family members or a
different pattern of male pattern
baldness or a different height right
that how tall people are the color
blindness from from a grandfather could
be passed down to some children I could
take a family of people who are all
of the same race but I could show you
different observable and irritable
characteristics and then I could plug
that into the same syllogism ago well
look at this group of white people this
white family who all came from the same
grand great grandmother and grandfather
and then all other white people on
breeding with them right well look
there's observable differences in
characteristics some of them are
colorblind some of different patterns of
baldness some of them at different
heights some of them at different colors
of eyes therefore race is real right but
when I plug in but when I plug in family
members there well now all of a sudden
that argument sounds ridiculous we'll
hold on that's actually not true
observable differences in
characteristics isn't and the fact that
those observable differences are
heritable isn't really sufficient
evidence that race is real in the way
that we mean race when we say race
realism does that make sense so this
argument is actually not only it is it
not sound because he's talking about
racial characteristics that run much
deeper than observable differences it's
also internally inconsistent as well
it's not a valid argument it's very sad
that somebody would construct an
argument that a simultaneously unsound
an invalid and then prides himself on
their philosophy you lost me wait what
did I just say that didn't make sense
I'm sorry
wait somebody tell me what I just said
that didn't make sense you lost me at
black people are people okay I'm gonna
assume that most people followed along
you're using words but not providing any
real point my point is that this
argument here is aphasia allowed
scientists to reappear in u.s. observe a
shoe that the facial features of Asians
whites and black people can be easily
identified and that these features are
irritable is sufficient to come fact
that you can identify features that are
heritable that are different between two
people doesn't necessarily prove race
realism because you can take everybody
in the same race and you can identify
features that are heritable but you
wouldn't use that to justify different
races so for instance if I take a
collection of white people and I show
that they have different colors of eyes
or different hair colors you wouldn't
argue oh well these people are different
races even though you've observed
features that are both heritable like
hair color and eye color and height and
you've observed features that are
observable like their hair color their
eye color height you wouldn't therefore
say well we should separate these people
into races
right that's that's what I'm saying I'm
saying that this own argument is
internally inconsistent that it's not
valid the syllogism falls apart when you
plug other things into the premise the
conclusion doesn't logically follow that
okay sorry who that race realism is true
race realism is the statement that races
exist and it should not become funded
with racism the belief in the
superiority of one race over others
because I love this - that their go-to
example of racism is black people
hitting beating up a white person I love
that example what it what an amazing way
to sell this video but black people am I
right or am i right great example that
in the in the history of the United
States the video that we go to is black
people beating up a white person this is
a what it what a well-put-together video
I'm sorry
all right well continue on what it was
because two things can be said to be
different from one another does not mean
that one must be superior to the other
this one goes for human races Westway
let's do not claim that the individuals
within the race are all perfect copies
of each other indeed recipe ends and
recognizes that there are genetic and
behavioral variations within races to
people so when we talk about these
variations right this is where we
pretend that race realists just
acknowledge that everybody is different
but that's not really the claim is it
when we see race real is talking about
the support of an ethnos state usually
they're taught what are the things that
we're talking about we're talking about
the warrior gene from black people we're
talking about the intrinsic stupidity
the low IQ that is heritable amongst all
brown people African American Hispanic
whatever people that aren't white above
European origin right this is what
people like Tara McCarthy you know
explicitly say this is what people like
Lauren whistle dog whistle Lauren
whistle this is what people like Lauren
southern dog whistle when people say
civic nationalism fails and they talk
about needing to create a peer Society
of intelligent high IQ people they're
not usually sick because if the claim
was true that people were just varied
right well then why would we have an
ethnos state we would want different
types of people in a society because we
can all complement one another's
weaknesses right maybe some people excel
at other things some people excel at
other things right well we have these
people in society to complement one
another's differences race realists and
people that use race realism the
descriptive race realism to build the
normative claims that society should be
locked off that races should have their
own place to stay aren't doing this on
the assumption that everybody is
different they're doing an
the assumption that they want to look
out for their own group because they
believe that their own group is
intrinsically superior to another in
some way usually IQ is what people will
talk about here well of a given race can
be quite different on a number of
physical psychological measures race
realism does not specify the number of
races that exist when it is recognized
the categories such as black Asian or
wife can be useful proxies for bloody
pointing to groups of humans with
certain characteristics realism also
recognizes that in principle the own
species could be divided in many more
races up to arbitrarily high numbers
such as fifty or even six hundred
depending on the level of precision that
one is interested in in terms of racing
back specific ancestry to specific
geographical locations west realism does
not claim that any of it was of two
races cannot reproduce together the fact
that mixed race couples exist and can
produce fertile offspring does not mean
that races do not exist contrary to
popular belief rice we also does not
require all features of a race to be
innovated through DNA transmission
between parents and offspring while it
is believed that most characteristics
not an individual including skin color
hair color and like you are even
influenced by DNA it is possible that
other features that distinguish races
may be passed down through generations
the other mechanism such as epigenetics
and differences in the way parents
dedicate their children well it is
possible that many compacts shall be
yours such as parenting abilities are
controlled by the only genes it should
be noted that the rest may disposition
is agnostic concerning the molecular
underpinnings of heritability and
affirming race realism does not require
finding the molecular origins of the
differences between races in summary
race realism is a statement about how
genetic variants are spread through a
population it is not the amoral position
but if actual well it merely states that
the Jessica nice and another another
nice thing that Jeff does here
this has always been my primary concern
my primary condemnation of the way Jeff
conducts himself where he says that race
realism is not a moral position but a
factual one right is firstly we already
presuppose that we've actually proven
race realism which we obviously haven't
in a [ __ ] four minute five minute
video but it's the idea that I'm just
you're telling you just objective facts
you know black people are just kind of
dumb compared to white people's just a
genetic fact now I'm not gonna build any
normative claims off of that I'm not
gonna tell you what we should how we
should treat black people in society I'm
just gonna go here and I'm gonna back up
these claims that are built on shaky
grounds and then I'm gonna let the
actual ethno state people I'll go ahead
and talk about these things ironically
enough while jf himself has come out in
favor of like a québécois ethno state
which I believe there were videos of him
talking about how he wishes there was
one you know we'll ignore the fact that
those videos even exist it's just that
he jumps out and he will comment on this
descriptive knowing that people always
build these philosophical odds off of
this position this foundation that we
should have ethnic eights he'll just
ignore all that um pretend it doesn't
exist
what's wrong with what he's saying if
he's not making any claims about what to
how is Shapiro not full of [ __ ] here no
gender is not disconnected from sex so
okay no it is not in the mind okay
you're not a man if you think you're a
man and I didn't say pretending or if I
did I shouldn't have said pretending let
me amend right okay I said a boy who
thinks he's a girl let's see the usual
phraseology I use not playing I usually
say a boy who thinks he's a growler grow
that thinks is a boy which is
technically what we're talking about
here as far as the actual psychological
issues at play it used to be called
gender dysphoria or gender identity
disorder another college gender
dysphoria the idea that that sex or
gender are malleable is not true okay
and I'm not denying your humanity if you
are a transgender person I am saying let
me make sure that we're not getting
anything correct so gender dysphoria
okay he's wrong on this I'm gonna this
is gonna be painful to watch isn't it so
transgenderism or being the state of
being a transgender was never referred
to as gender dysphoria gender dysphoria
specifically refers to the emotional
distress you feel when there is a
mismatch between your body and what you
think and you are in your mind that is
gender dysphoria so if a man believes
that he's a woman but he's like whatever
well I have a dick this sucks
whatever right you wouldn't call that
gender dysphoria it's when a person
suffers severe emotional distress when
they're like I can't live I'm depressed
I have severe problems I'm experiencing
anxiety because what I see in the mirror
is not what I feel I should be that is
gender dysphoria okay being trans and
the state of experiencing gender
dysphoria are not one in the same these
are two different things this is really
really basic this is really basic stuff
I don't know why ship era would ever
talk about trans issues if he doesn't
know this incredibly basic concept I
don't know should I listen all this
before starting to talking on this most
people will make this
sanctioned between gender and sex sex is
probably a thing where like you have an
ex white pair of chromosomes or you have
an X X you have certain organs such as a
uterus a vagina a penis that make you
belong to a certain sex these are things
that there is a there is biological
truth to this right necessarily because
it's how we come together reproduce
genetic mutation kids evolution all that
great [ __ ] comes about as a result of
sex in most creatures there are some a
sect or not asexual creatures there are
some hermaphrodite II hammer
hermaphroditic I don't know they're for
the most feathers how it works right I
know that one person is gonna say well
what about that one creature that can
reproduce that way okay the idea of
gender gender is a much more difficult
thing to narrow down and this is what
most of the debate is about is over the
idea of gender and gender expression I
kind of tweeted about this earlier today
the thing about gender is um is that
it's really hard to say like if I were
to get here here so that here's the game
that we could play okay well let's
pretend that you and me are having a
debate you I'm talking to you let's
pretend that you and me are having a
debate okay I say gender is pretty
arbitrary you're our idea of gender is
pretty arbitrary and you go well that's
ridiculous it's not arbitrary at all
it's actually we understand with your
nose and then I go okay well can you get
up so my argument is gender gender is
more like on it on a kind of a continuum
than like a hard line like male versus
female when we're talking about the
experience of being like a particular
gender right and then you go no that's
absurd actually men and women there are
hard lines okay and then I would say to
you okay well without talking about
their sex organs can you give me the
difference between a man and a woman can
you give me some set of features that
you can ascribe to manliness and then
some set of features that you can
ascribe to femme females or whatever
right that are like exclusive features
okay and then you would think for a
minute and you would go okay what are
some of the fundamental I mean I'm gonna
crush him here what are some of the
fundamental differences remember I know
there are differences okay well here's
one Steven
skeletal structure and muscle density
okay men are larger than women men tend
to be larger than women and men are
stronger than women that's just a
biological fact okay and then there we
go sure that's true in general men tend
to be stronger than women have thicker
bones larger skeletal systems than than
women that is very true however can you
not find women that are stronger and
larger than some men who are smaller and
weaker right and of course you would go
oh sure yeah I guess that's true and
then I would say okay well then would
you consider those men to be women or
would you consider the weakest men to be
women or would you consider the
strongest women to be men and then you
would go well no I guess not
so then I would ask again okay so then
what is what is it that makes a man a
man or a woman or a woman a woman right
so after that right we could go back and
forth on things that we generally
believed to be masculine versus feminine
but the issue we're going to run into is
that for every trait you give me that is
masculine I can find a decent number of
women that probably ascribed to it
shaving your legs that's a cultural
thing being strong or fast there are
athletic women you know like there there
are things that a lot of women a decent
number of women will fall under and
there are things at eighty seminar what
a decent number of men are will followed
it right so at the end of the day are
our exact definition of like what is the
gender of man versus what is the gender
of woman is a little bit arbitrary and
kind of mushy there is no like hard line
you can draw between one or the other
without going into like sex organs you
know that's um so that's kind of the
problem if you want to approach like if
you want autism abuse I don't care I
don't know why you've licked me this
thread like a million times the random
people are talking about likes me files
I don't care I don't know why how many
times have you messaged me about this
thread I do you want drama or what I
don't understand why you've messaged
you've put this in chat like 15 times
yeah anyway so that's what we that's
what we typically talk about but when
we're talking about gender and the
difficulty in saying like what is a man
versus what is a woman so now some
people in chat are saying this is stupid
you literally said ignoring their sex
organs when their sex organs are the
crux of
their arguments but are they do you feel
comfortable
so maybe I'm appealing a little bit to
emotion here but we can explore this we
can explore why I know you're going to
answer the way you are
would you oh my god I just want mr.
Blair if I were to show you a video of
somebody like this would you feel
comfortable going oh this is definitely
a missed video when I go into the male
restroom I want to see this person in
this restroom if I'm you know if I'm in
a male area I want to see this person in
the male area like I 100% agree in feel
this way right when you look at these
types of people right do you really feel
like the answer is oh yeah for sure well
no because that's not really true when
you talk about what a man or a woman is
you're not really talking about sex
organs at all because we know women that
have smaller breasts right so it's not
immediately apparent that they've got
huge knockers as soon as you see them
and you very very very rarely do you
identify somebody as a certain gender
based on their sex organ in fact I would
say a fraction of a fraction of a time
because when you meet somebody publicly
you don't know what type of sex organ
they have but you're oftentimes making a
judgement of is it a man or a woman
based on some other set of
characteristics and all I'm saying is
that that other set of characteristics
is somewhat arbitrary right
maybe you point to rugged faces Matt you
know facial hair shaving legs but these
are all cultural things Asian people
don't have very much facial hair right
if you go to South Korea or all of them
and they're women to you you know not
all women shave their legs you know
there's like a lot it just gets like
really blurry that's all I'm saying so
anyway I'm not trying to say that this
is like right or wrong or that you need
to feel you know a certain way I'm just
saying these are things to think about
so that so and they kind of I think they
make bent argument here seem like a
little bit silly and how absolutely
simplistic he's going to approach a
topic about well listen to him true okay
and I'm not denying your humanity if you
are a transgender person I am saying
that you are not the sex to which you
claim to be you're still a human being
and you're a human being with an issue
that I'm you know I wish you Godspeed in
in dealing with in whatever way you see
fit but if you are going to dictate to
me that I'm supposed to pretend I'm
supposed to pretend that men are women
and women are men no my answer is no I'm
not going to I'm not going to modify
basic biology because it threatens your
subjective sense of what you are
so like the problem with this is this
whole argument is built off of this
absurd notion that as a person you need
to figure out like what sex like how
does this matter at all to you somebody
on Twitter posed this question earlier
like so you think that you should be
able to demand that somebody refers to a
certain way you know when they meet you
whatever well yeah we do it all the time
if somebody comes up to me like let's
say for instance you approached me
publicly and you come up to me like hey
what's your name writer oh hey what's up
you know I'm John you know how you doing
and then like later on you find out that
like my middle name is John and my first
name is Luke it's like you're Luke John
would you come up to me later be like
I'm not gonna call you John
I'm gonna call you Luke because I know
your real name I know who you really are
right well I say no [ __ ] you like I go
my middle name or maybe I go by another
name that I don't even you know that's
not listed on my birth certificate at
all right but for most most of the time
you never think about this you don't
care about this you don't know now you
can inductively reason that if a person
tells me their name is Katherine their
name is probably Katherine on their
birth certificate but you don't actually
know that but it's not that you don't
know that it's also that you don't care
if somebody presents themselves to you
is like hello I'm a woman my name is
Katherine right you might say the like
okay well what's up Katherine and that's
like what you call them and then that's
it you don't really think like show me
your [ __ ] birth certificate like you
don't go like hard into like the truth
and digging out like because it's not
really relevant to your doesn't matter
we referred to each other as it was a
polite formality it's a cultural thing
we address each other names that we want
to be addressed that's just how society
works
um this weird idea that you need to be
like the div inator of truth or some
[ __ ] like are you actually like somebody
comes up you're like hey I'm you know
I'm Julian you're like oh cool what's up
Julian she's like oh nothing much um you
know like oh you know and I'm a woman or
whatever like are you and then you bring
out the fingers and you grab them by the
puss like let me check if you're
actually a woman like damn like yo chill
out that's not how anything works that's
not how we do this dude do I'm not going
to show me your regime out of five basic
biology because it threatens your
subjective sense of what you are
I'm saying that the Boy Scouts have a
standard you must be a biological boy to
be a Boy Scout you have to be a boy to
be a Boy Scout in the name Boy Scouts
not really though because Ben is using
the word boy to mean like X Y chromosome
when not necessarily everybody agrees
with it but I mean we can appeal to
tautology here I guess like well boy
means what I think it means therefore
Boy Scouts you know satisfies merit but
I mean I guess we can do that if we want
sure because it because it because this
is because this is a very because for
all of human history boy meant boy and
girl meant girl boy did not mean girl
for a lot of human history black men
slave and white men master race you know
for some of human history been you would
be locked in a [ __ ] concentration
camp working to your death which judging
by your physique would happen pretty
quickly
wait I mean like what is the appeal trip
visit I don't think that Ben is very
smart this is really irritating to me
he's a very good speaker and he's very
quick on his on his feet but he engages
in fallacies so quickly he will point to
fallacy like instantly to win an
argument and it's not a valid argument
what is this appeal true to tradition
like this like this satisfies your
argument or like it justifies your
position like well at one point in time
we believe this and at another point in
time we believe that it's like dude but
come on this this is this doesn't help
your argument and if I call you a moose
are you suddenly a moose okay if I
redefine our slippery slope
oh so if you identify as a four year old
does that mean that suddenly you're our
four year old how many documented
instances are there of people being born
feeling like they're a [ __ ] moose
this doesn't really happen Ben now let's
look at how many people experience
gender dysphoria to such an extreme
extent that they actually [ __ ] kill
themselves this does happen and it's
well documented and there's a decent
amount of academic engagement with the
subject how much academic engagement is
there with the idea of trans-species ism
like nothing okay this is a horrible
equivalency rolled into a slippery slope
like all-in-one this is a stupid
argument like no it's a yes that's right
men and women are a completely different
thing this is true have you ever met a
man or a woman they're completely
different so this is where I would
challenge been like really been without
describing sex without describing sex
organs can you list to me some of these
completely different traits between men
and a woman because the thing is that if
we were to describe everybody like on a
continuum it would probably look I can't
draw bell curves at all it would
probably look something like this right
I'm so bad I can't drop it would
probably look um look something like
this right where you know there might be
some things like you know like if we go
to the far end of like the [ __ ] and you
got like 800 900 T you've got like
massive bulging [ __ ] muscles and [ __ ]
and tons of [ __ ] facial hair and
stuff like okay yeah like this is a
manly [ __ ] man and if we go to this
end maybe you have very small bodies
very large accentuated breasts or
something you like sure like you can get
here but in terms of like similarities
like men and women have a ton of
similarities far more similarities than
differences we're all humans right and a
lot of these ideas of like what is it to
be a man in terms of gender and what is
it to be a woman in terms of gender are
going to exist on a continuum there are
women that have to peel you know
mustache [ __ ] off their face every woman
when she's past 25 has probably done
something with their facial hair at some
point or another whether or not you as a
guy realize it or not plenty of women do
things like this you know like button
you know tons of men you know don't
build you know massive [ __ ] muscular
bodies you like all of it exists on a
continuum to some extent you know okay
let me ask you this hell okay I won't
ask you how old I will ask you how old
you are
okay because you're young enough that
it's probably not insulting to ask you
so know why aren't you 60
why aren't you 60
this doesn't prove his point yeah it
doesn't prove his point
what because because age is a passage of
time time is something that we can very
clearly point to as if as an exact
concept right something that exists for
ten years is much different than
something that exists for 20 years this
doesn't mean that there's a difference
between two things because we can talk
about the existence of time as a concept
this is such a stupid point [ __ ] and
while why can't you identify a 60 why
would what what is the problem with you
identifying a 60 you're right age is
significantly less important than gender
that's not what what do you mean that's
not true at all why would you say age is
less important than gender wait did he
say that hold on I have to listen again
why can't you identify a 60 why would
what what is the problem with you
identifying a 60 you're right age is
significantly less important than gender
you can't magically change your gender
you can't magically change your sex so
it's a it's um would you call this a
false dichotomy so he's talking about
changing gender in the way that you
would change your age but but nobody's
arguing that you can change your gender
what they're arguing is that your idea
of your gender is something that always
has been and doesn't necessarily line up
with how society views gender they're
not saying that one day you went maybe
this maybe this is actually a reveal of
what goes on in Ben's mind maybe Ben
thinks that a trans person at some point
just decides I want to be a woman so I'm
gonna change my gender
maybe that's what maybe that's actually
what Ben thinks but but that's not
generally how from what I've read and
from what I've spoken to and from what
I've seen said trans people don't
generally wake up and go like oh or
never I don't think wake up and go um
you know what I actually want to change
my gender no right you can't change your
gender you identify as something
different because society's prescribed
norms for a certain gender something you
don't feel like you line up with right
there's a difference between that versus
like well I just want to be a different
gender today right
you can't magically change your age oh
and now he's got her defending a straw
men uh he did it you're so sly you're so
crafty Ben woo you're so crafty what it
what a slime it and now he's got it
right where he wants her because now
she's stuck defending this fucked-up
straw man because she's probably really
[ __ ] nervous right now right she's
getting up to speak in front of people
so she's not really even equipped to do
this not not like in an intellectual
sense but like Anna does she have
experience public's because I imagine
she's really [ __ ] nervous right now
and now Ben's got her Ben got her right
where he she's right where he wants her
now she's trying to defend the idea of
trans ageism which is indefensible and
she knows it's indefensible and I bet
she went back and watched this the next
day and realized god damn it what was I
except destiny what's up man what's up
buddy chillin all right we're gonna
start here in just a second and I'll
just do a quick intro just wanna say
something about yesterday's show and
then we'll move on from there all right
let me just set this okay let's do this
little bit late as usual what up
everyone welcome to yet another war ski
live how're you all doing
we've got some a very interesting
episode today we have geek who helped me
out moderate what's up geek lion chillin
we have jf how you doin brother
hello I'm glad to be here yeah and we
got destiny with some man hey what's up
buddy
chillin chillin there's been a lot of
things happening this week and a lot of
[ __ ] happening on Twitter and we're
gonna be talking about that right now I
just want to say to everyone who's
watching right now truly apologize about
last night's stream you know I wanted
this open-door policy but obviously
there's some people who I have to vet
before coming in here so I'm gonna
definitely be a little bit more harder
and if people are doing this muting
other people [ __ ]
I will be banning them from ever being
on the show again so truly apologize
about that
that was you were there right oh yeah I
was sort of half watching I was
traveling from New Jersey but yeah I I
think it was in Atlanta Airport and I
was listening in yeah it was pretty bad
[ __ ] but uh yeah so we're gonna
definitely be be moderating everything a
little bit more better to keep
everything in order now the reason we're
all meeting up here today is cuz
throughout this week we have been on a
topic that's pretty touchy
it's called race realism I'm sure you've
all seen us talking about this we've had
many discussions with many people and
destiny I saw you on Twitter you were I
think you quote tweeted amazing atheist
TJ Kirk because he was talking about the
race realism thing and you were sort of
just talking about like oh [ __ ] this is
now what the skeptics are gonna be
talking about and you ain't really happy
about it are ya I'm not so much talking
about it but seeing everybody get
flipped over to the race realist side
because one person comes on and says
something that seems kind of agreeable
yeah mmm so what do you think by the way
just before we talk about that what do
you think about all the [ __ ] that's been
happening with the skeptic community
anyway it's pretty funny I guess it was
really funny because I'm Jeff Holliday
one guy so I'm I'm I am pretty big
unlike the nandi platforming thing like
I like everybody if Sargon's Twitter
account could spanned I usually you know
I make it to be like good saw that is a
cow got banned I don't like seeing
people get banned from platforms where
they can talk to people there was one
guy on one post on my subreddit where he
posted something like hey like if you
don't like these guys they're violating
the patreon tos or whatever you should
report him and Jeff like started
bombarding me with messages on Twitter
like oh destiny you're supporting this
horrible behavior ball and I like didn't
even know this post existed so I think
it's kind of funny now that Jeff was
like literally or not discord server
like daxing people because he didn't
like their political beliefs but um yeah
I mean I don't know I was always kind of
dumb I guess and watching the whole
discord server blow up was pretty funny
I don't know what he thought would
happen I mean if you guys have been on
the internet for any appreciable amount
of time you know that that you if you
tell the secrets like to people like
that shit's gonna be leaked at like you
know three days [ __ ] tops so the idea
that he had have a whole discord
together like Doc seeing people behind
the scenes and he thought that would
never leak is like hilariously naive i
don't know how old crowd is maybe he's a
younger guy so he doesn't have as much
time on the internet or something but
yeah I don't know that's pretty funny to
me there were people in it knew like
this is eventually gonna get out and it
was leave is just a a you know this is
gonna get out it's gonna happen it's
just a matter of win did he was like me
change it from targets to people of
interest is that cool like no so like I
don't follow it too much because it was
kind of boring but like what was the
point of the targets of interest why
were they even collecting that
information do they ever say was there
reason what was their given reason for
collecting the information
well from what I saw there was a few
more things leaked to me and I actually
spoke to a few people who are on the
server last night or this morning
because I was up all night but from what
I gather is they just look at the kid
the one dude I talked to last night kara
member his name in particular but he was
actually proud of what they were doing
and I was just I was so it was like 7:00
in the morning I was like up all night
and so I was too tired to yell at him
but he he said he had nothing to do with
boxing but he found it funny he just was
he's like a communist
you know anarchist and he he wants to
watch the world burn so he was he found
it pretty [ __ ] funny but so I was
asking him information like I was just
like why were they doing this and he was
like it was just to destroy their lives
it was - it was to pretty much just get
them to not talk about what they are
talking about um like any means
necessary it was pretty much we don't
have a debate here we're gonna just
[ __ ] just ruin everyone he found it
hilarious and I was just like dude
you're like you're making your side look
bad right because he's extreme left
beyond extreme left and I'm like like
don't you see that that this actually
hurts you in the long run and he's like
yeah I don't care
but yeah it was pretty much to dismantle
people and their lives in fact one thing
that was leaked to me that I haven't
leaked out cuz the person asked me not
to was crowd saying something along the
lines of all these guys are gonna be on
the side of the road selling magic beans
and they're gonna be begging everyone
for mercy and all this [ __ ] so she's it
was definitely yeah it was a malicious
intent I was reading out this to someone
privately last night the entire thing
and there's a because it's just crowd
pretty much and the person was actually
the person who was arguing with them who
was in the servers that guys we should
hit their arguments like this is not
gonna be good in the long run I saw and
then he sent me a video of Jeff who was
on his cell phone in the car and he's
just like you don't know what you're
talking about we have to do this this is
how we have to do it because they're
like dirty people
it was it's from what I've seen all the
stuff even behind this
it's [ __ ] it's worse but I think
Geoff's got enough [ __ ] hammering
this week that you know like there's
it's just beating him while he's down at
this point shot oh yeah I'm sort of like
well the thing that bothers me is like
um it and I mean I really don't care
that much but like if I did care a lot I
think that would bother me was more that
Jeff didn't just kind of like own it
like all right like listen dude like we
had a [ __ ] server we docked some
dudes it was a really stupid idea I
admit that it was done but it was [ __ ]
because I watched a little bit of it and
it seemed like he was hardcore doing the
trickle truth thing where he was like
while I didn't really do any of this to
that and then like something would get
leaked and it's like well Jeff you were
kind of involved in that he's like okay
well we did a little bit of that but I
didn't do any of that and then something
else it was kind of like that kind of
[ __ ]
yeah he lied to me why some ice cream
yeah and then everyday Zef would just
leak something out and then his apology
pretty much when medica released his
video
Jeff's apology was like it was just an
obvious lie yeah it was just like you're
like dude yeah like I would have
respected Jeff a lot more if he'd made a
five-minute thing this is what I did I'm
gonna step back for a bit do some
self-reflection and I'm gonna learn from
this mistake everything would have been
fine
and now it's just his subs are [ __ ]
bleeding and his respect is tarnished
you know it was just trying to soften he
was just trying to soften the whole
event in order to just minimize you know
people's concerns about it and he should
have had like a five six minute apology
video not this hour-long let's make
excuses and and try to justify what you
did and and then at the end just just
gotta admit to what we know cuz who
knows more [ __ ] might come out and we
might see Jeff have have more of a more
of an involvement in him from our
experience with him I mean he's
continued to switches footing his new
information comes out so like why should
we believe what he's admitted to right
now you know yeah that was a problem
with trickle truth right is that after
you get caught two or three times people
will just assume the absolute worst
about you because it's like okay well
what else have you not told us yeah yeah
it's it's [ __ ]
have you seen the one thing we were
talking about the other
we were and jf I'm not sure if you saw
this as well but did you see the new
guest lineup of of Kilroy no I stare a
guest lineup left
yeah they released it's literally down
to 11 people pretty much everyone
dropped out and I think so roaming
millennial and christina hoff sommers
are the biggest speakers there and then
everyone else is like people who have
like 2000 followers on Twitter it's like
the it's like the Remember the Titans of
I can guess it's like the [ __ ] plane
crash and now we've got these guys geez
that was a [ __ ] [ __ ] show but of
course it's all all led into the topic
of of race realism because that was
essentially what the server was about so
then we started digging deeper into this
and then like got Jay off a jf on a few
times and then and then we started
talking about this subject and now a
destiny you don't see him none too
pleased about this yeah I guess if we
want to hop into that so my main problem
with this kind of stuff is you have so
you've got normative claims and you've
got descriptive claims right so on the
descriptive side of things you describe
scientific fact right like the house is
blue right and then on the normative
side of things you have what we ought to
do with the house right so let's say the
house is blue so we should destroy it
right the normative claim that we should
destroy it is a claim of what we ought
to do with it and then the descriptive
claim is that the house is blue the
problem that I have with people
especially jf is that it seems like what
happens is is we get a whole bunch of
really toxic normative claims that are
built off of descriptive claims so for
instance there are people that believe
that race is real there is a huge
difference in IQ between black people
and white people therefore people like
Terry McCarthy or the alt hype will say
things like we need in a white ethnic
state of the US we need to get rid of
all of the brown people and then when
people challenge these kinds of
assertions these normative assertions
people like Jeff will show up and
they'll defend the descriptive claim
without really commenting on the
normative you know Jeff will show up and
I'll say oh well the science is kind of
correct or you know in some ways he's
kind of correct that race is real but
then they never like make any
comment on the normative side of things
it's my that's my pretty big problem
with it I am yeah you were saying that
the like the main issue you have is now
now people are starting to say race is
real therefore and then the extreme
right will start saying things like
maybe we should you know remove a
certain race out of certain areas to you
know better the society that we're
living in and that's something you
obviously have a problem with it I I
want to say right now like for people
who are watching who may be alt-right or
whatever i while i believe race is real
i am saying in no way that we should
judge someone based on averages based on
what we think their IQ might be we
should treat everyone as an individual
because it's just inhumane in my opinion
to to take an average and then [ __ ]
you know banish people because of so and
so and I just think that's [ __ ] up in
my opinion so I'm kind of curious just
when you say that just based on your
conversations when you say race is real
can you elaborate on that well yeah well
looking at all the different races there
are a lot of differences within all the
races such as you know bone structure
you know a certain races being more
intelligent that's our key what with
black people I mean they they have a
higher increased chance of having sickle
cell anemia so that's not Bo but so even
that's not necessary that's a genetic
difference in a race that's not I'm so
well firstly that's not necessarily true
so the sickle cell so that particularly
thing that you're talking about is
really only impactful to blacks that
lived in the sub-saharan region it was
like a response to I looked to malaria
so there are plenty of black people that
don't have that innate defense or or I'm
sorry that any common yeah sure but this
is the problem right is that I could
show you a white person that would have
this trait and I could show you a black
person that doesn't have this trait so
what is the usefulness and saying black
people have this thing and white people
don't well I think we're talking about
averages and and
probability you know what I mean yeah I
mean there's always an exception to to
some sort of rule I mean the-they you
know some some of those developments are
are environmental but they're you know
yes there are genetic difference yeah so
that you can we find some genetic
differences I guess my only question is
like what is the value in recognizing
this difference right like in a hospital
you would never say like oh well he's
black therefore this you would all you
would do like some sort of sequencing or
you would take a test to find out you
know what what the exact answer is you
would never classify people in this way
right and then there are differences we
have like for instance like blood type
do you think that people have blood type
a should be a different race than people
of blood type B or people a B or people
Oh like you would you classify these
peoples different races like sure there
could be differences but is there any
value in grouping them isn't is entirely
different subspecies or races of people
well the answer to whether there is
value in grouping people the answer is
quite simple is if my prediction is
better than random following my grouping
then my grouping provides some
information I don't think that geek to
Lu was presenting a case where every
black people has sickle cell anemia is
just saying if you divide people into
the group black people versus white
versus Asia you will end up with the
group of black people being more likely
to have sickle cell anemia that's
information that can be useful to a
doctor that can be useful to people in
general I mean some of the examples of
the use because err Steven started with
the question of normative claims and
it's true I will admit this I don't
often comment on normative claims but
there's a reason for this it's that my
opponents and the rest realest debate
are so stupid that they try to fight me
on the factual ground they are so bad at
what they do that they come on the
public space and they start claiming
foul stuff such as race does not exist
now I'm happy to go on that ground today
with destiny and I think that's why
we're here so let's dig deep into this I
do believe that there are some things
and handy seem to to totally reject the
use of phrase in personal choice and
discrimination
I do believe that there are instances of
correct personal choice that you can do
based on race which is not something
that I would personally reproach I'll
give you one example and I'd like to
hear you guys on this is it fine for you
guys to have racial preferences in your
sexual preferences to have certain races
of people that you prefer having sex
with yes I'd say so
however of a natural thing of who you're
attracted to a guest right like people
who have like yellow fever you know you
know are down for only Asians I have a
few friends like that and no one finds
that racist I mean I'm sure there are
people out there like oh my god your
fetishizing Asians but it's just they
they prefer Asians or something right
yeah I'm a white dude and you know I I
love olive-skinned women okay before we
get too far down on this topic so
earlier you said if my grouping is
better than random it can give me some
information so I don't disagree with
that but if your grouping is better than
random that doesn't give you a reason to
create a separate race of people so for
instance if I were to group people based
on height I could probably make some
predictions about these people or by
weight even actually there would be a
better one by group people by BMI I
could make predictions pretty accurate
predictions about the health of said
people especially in regards to things
like diabetes or hypertension but just
because I would have a group of people
that are above a certain BMI I wouldn't
by extension of that say well here is a
different race of people right no it's
it's true and it's not based on the
information that we can obtain on
certain diseases like sickle cell that
we classify races races they were first
classified really from observations from
visual observation and then later in
fact within the last two decades we've
begun having genetic data that seems to
confirm that the general group that we
characterize as blacks whites Asians
they do refer to some genetic reality
and in fact when we place all the
genetic information that we get on
humanity into a computer and we ask the
computer to separate these groups as
best as you can
of course the races
come as a natural division that the
computer finds quite easily so some are
the recent that on genetics in human
simply confirms the old idea phrase that
we add of course it's not they what it's
not a 100% clean boundary of course
there is race mixing of course there are
people who are white who do have genes
that come from black ancestry that's all
fine because we recognize that we have
millions of ancestors India and so we're
all a mix of genes but that doesn't mean
that the categories are meaningless in
fact from a genetic standpoint we can
tell with pretty high certainty where
your ancestors come from based on your
genes today okay so firstly the claim
that this is something that you have to
elaborate on because I don't think even
you believe this you say that genetic
information today confirms old ideas of
race so old ideas of race what do you
my dear what's up there we go sorry I
have to change my settings I just bought
a brand new microphone setup so what
kind of microphone uh actually Chris my
buddy bought it he got what does he have
here Audio Technica money yep that's it
it's good Mike cool
yeah yeah the mixer and everything so
it's pretty sweet what's going on dude
nothing much I just wanted to uh I just
wanted to talk about some skeptic things
I caught a little bit of the end of that
other stream it seemed interesting that
Martin guy seemed pretty cool yeah yeah
just like Adam and I started that show
to have opposing point of views he
brings on someone I bring on someone we
walk in with a few discussions and we
just decide I talk it out and the only
rule is no swearing at each other oh
that's nice
yeah just just to keep it a little civil
trial going um okay um are you screaming
right now you're not are you all right
yeah no no no I'm done okay gotcha I'm
streaming you know that right yeah yep
just make sure you're sure okay cool I
just wanted to talk about oh I guess it
feels kind of rude to slight comments
but just some stuff I encourage you to
look into on your own that in
description of left and right brain like
that separation causing PTSD I've never
heard that description for causing PTSD
in my entire life there is like a
lateralization that occurs down there's
a name for that it's like post medial
fissure or something in the center the
brain unremembered it's called but like
it when you talk about like PTSD I've
never heard that before so that might be
something want to look into and then
also the idea that like your left or
right brain have to do with like storing
memory like codifying short term into
long term memory are things that are
handled by different parts of the brain
but I've never heard somebody say like
the left brain does this versus the
right brain just be careful what you
hear sometimes make sure you're
verifying your stuff ya know for sure I
mean I mean at that point I was just
listening sure yeah yeah yeah just I was
just listening I was even asked her I
might wait so that causes like your left
brain to turn off when you feel fear and
then she just went off on her tangent
there yeah but yeah I'd like to you know
see those studies I am very
and one causes people to think wad and
react to what so yeah and then just like
another quick thing do you understand
how the property tax school thing works
and why that's a little kind of [ __ ]
up and that's what Aiden was saying
right
is that what well that you guys are kind
of talking about it basically the way
that public schools are funded is
they're funded by the property taxes of
the of the houses that are near the
schools that's one of the big complaints
that people have about schools so in the
United States we spend a little bit more
than most countries per capita of GDP
than other countries spent on education
but a disproportionate amount of our
spending goes to rich schools so let me
give you an example I live in a city
called Omaha and I decided to send my
kid to public school over private school
I didn't want my kid to go to a shitty
public school and I lived in kind of a
shitty neighborhood so I wanted I bought
a house and one of the nicer
neighborhoods in the city so that I
could be in the best school district
because the only way to get him into a
better school was to move to a richer
neighborhood and a richer neighborhood
has more property taxes going to the
school which will make this school
better does that make sense yeah it
makes sense but how about the thing I
brought up at the end there I don't know
if you which one caught the end where I
I was I was just asking you know there
are more poor white you know students
than poor black people so the economic
you know factor it doesn't really make
sense you know what I mean well I mean
I'm willing to bet that if you look up
the educational outcomes of the poor
white kids too it's probably on par with
poor black people I would imagine if you
went under okay yeah if this isn't just
a race thing this is more a class thing
but the problem is that a large number
of black people per of all the black
people in the black race in the United
States tend to be poor but yes it's a
class issue not just a race issue for
sure interesting cool I'm gonna look a
lot more into this and and and
definitely make more comments about that
I was just asking questions yeah it was
it was cool though that other stream by
the way that was awesome that on what
was a Tuesday that was that was
interesting the MOC thing oh yeah that
was holy [ __ ] with the foot after that
four hours dude I was just I didn't even
know what it feel I just felt empty
after our talk by the end because it's
like four hours
screaming yeah so good though one thing
that I was really critical of I don't
remember we talked about as much in that
conversation to the one before but
something that like kind of really
rustles my Jim Jim's is when it's
something and this is what I'm like
really critical the skeptic community
for is I noticed that there's a lot of
um are you coming here with Rush
Limbaugh hmm do you know who Rush
Limbaugh's yes yeah I still a turn from
him see he calls it the drive-by media
so what I notice is that sometimes
skeptics do these drive-bys or what
they'll do is they'll show up and
they'll rip a headline and then they
like caused some outrage on Twitter over
it okay I just wanted to bring up I just
have like two quick examples of this
maybe free stuff for you to consider in
the future okay so here's a Blair White
tweet okay mmm all right let me chew oh
shoot sorry
I hate the way Skype set this up oh yeah
the picture appears and everything so
all right I'm opening it now okay so she
posted a headline and well her quote is
you can never please these people so
stop goddamn trying and the article is
from like babe it's called babe Ursa
Major and says sorry white people but
trying too hard
not to be racist is Loki trying to be
racist now I'd say that that headline is
ridiculous but tell me why it's it's not
what it seems
sure so um hold on let me um I gotta
type in so there are a couple problems
here firstly before we even start okay
so they are the title does sound
ridiculous right but you see the
subtitle right what does it say
uh yeah before before you're mad sorry
it's just oh my god I just lost it
before you're mad let me explain or
something yeah so so it kind of makes
you wonder right off the bat so I just
wanna this article is pretty short can I
just read this to you real quick and
then you can tell me if you think that
this is like it's like four so no this
is I feel like this is a really really
good example of an article guy I won't I
try not to share your opinion too much
okay mmm don't get me wrong it's great
that white people care about racism now
that's nice for them and it's totally
sick to hear white guys tell me that
they're into brown girls too when they
want to try to get into my pants
and even though ending racism can seem
like an impossible dream in a world
where Nazis are a thing again and ever
one expects me to care about anything
related to bella thorne at least
diversity is a stated goal now progress
but sometimes when white people try to
be allies the pendulum swings back into
the wrong direction and should get
straight-up offensive the reduct risk
Edline I don't see color says white guy
who exclusively dates Asian women is a
textbook example of this phenomenon this
is another one do you see anything wrong
with this picture and then it's a white
girl standing next to a bunch of black
rappers and then some other memes so
adopting blacks plain um okay so
adopting hold on sir adopting black
slang when trying to appeal to a black
audience is unfortunately kind of racist
and definitely appropriative even if
you're doing it because you think it's
cool or even likes trying to make
someone else feel more comfortable then
there are white women who appreciate
yoga a little bit too much the kind you
devote entire Instagram feeds to their
practice and flub the chakra hashtag or
white students who take a spring break
trip to Thailand and come back to school
two weeks later rocking elephant pants
and a big old Buddha tattoo because
Eastern religion is so much more chill
but we kind of know that stuff is bad
right because white people are into
busting racism now and they're ready to
point it out anywhere they see it
especially online even when the people
of color who they're supposedly
defending don't really see anything when
white people bent over backwards to
expose riverdale star Lily Reinhardt for
loving blackface when she really just
wanted to dress up like a demon or get
mad that lena Dunham's baby on girls was
an actually pakistani even though he was
on air for literally 30 seconds and is
also a [ __ ] baby it's not woke it's
stupid and you look stupid doing it if
you have to cite your sources in a
bibliography to explain why a Selena
Gomez music video is damaging to New
Zealand's indigenous population even
though you didn't know it was a part of
Australia until like two months ago you
need to calm down because here's the
thing people are kind of [ __ ] stupid
and racism is particularly [ __ ]
stupid and if white people over saturate
the racism market nobody's going to care
what an actual person of color asks not
to be caricatured for a Halloween
costume or you know not to get shot at
by the cops
repeat after me sweet white Ally less is
more
amplify the actual concerns of people of
color instead of getting mad about
something irrelevant online for for some
of your non-white friends oh so that so
that some of your non-white friends know
that you're one of the good ones and
while we're at it we can actually stop
using woke understanding that people of
color experience
every single days moment it's like in
reading this article yeah that sounds
like a decent article actually yeah not
only it sounds like what all the
skeptics actually say right it sounds
like they just say like hey like stop
focusing on every little stupid
perceived racist thing and focus on the
important stuff right yeah yeah no
you're right you're a hundred percent
right there I'll definitely tell Blair
about that one you know you're right and
look ever since like we had our talk and
after our debate and some people you
know had messaged me you know I I really
hated the destiny before but you had a
good talk with him and some people are
actually angry that I didn't debate you
even though you said we were having
conversation but yeah I've been stepping
back a little bit more and looking at
these headlines and you know the did I
do the the show with Tim he he's like
technically whatever sjw or whatever but
even he was talking about those
headlines before - in a video and when
he sort of broke them down what they
they actually were they weren't I mean
there are obviously some headlines where
you're like alright this person is
ridiculous but then a lot of them that
people do pull up share around you read
them and go now that's not well well in
this case it's not only is it not bad
but it's about what we talked about
yeah but I think the the the writer and
what a lot of people are now used to is
just reading the headline like an
incinerator headline but you're right
dude and this is kind of where the
responsibility of like a Content like I
can understand people will get sucked
into the headline but I think you have a
responsibility if you're gonna be
retweeting stuff like that like you're
kind of misleading people you know so
like this tweet that I like to Blair
white that had over 3,000 retweets and
over 12,000 500 likes that's a lot of
people now that are coming away thinking
like oh man you know like all the
[ __ ] you know these people are
[ __ ] crazy you know yeah I know it
seems disingenuous yeah well I I would
even say that a lot of skeptics and
myself included in the past have have
looked at you know certain headlines I
mean I remember I did one in particular
where literally I basked what I thought
it was because the headline
and like the first part but then when
you really read ahead of it it was
actually the opposite
yeah she's cutting you to read it yeah
and it was sort of the title was the the
the stupid thing that they were actually
debunking so I made myself look like an
idiot but yeah I wouldn't say she's
doing it you know to be a dick or you
know disingenuous I just think she saw
that title that headline and you know
what the [ __ ] is this and then tweeted
it out and is it is it wrong to do that
yeah I agree with you on that I'm not
gonna like I love her she's my friend
like sure and even if we don't say that
like she was being evil while doing it
or whatever we can agree that like that
kind of stuff is like really harmful
right that's like a really bad thing
like a bad precedent to say that you
just tweet out a headline Tuttle and
ascribe these beliefs to people that
might actually be on your side you know
well and also and also when we have
talks like this what we're talking about
right now the problem is now you know
you know someone keeps tweeting out
these headlines that aren't I won't say
not real but you know just like look
different than what the content actually
is if we keep doing that do you know the
boy who cried wolf situation where it's
like you're gonna post a headline now do
I
you know believe your headline at this
point and and the thing is I love Blair
and I I know a lot of what she's done
and tweeted mm-hmm I agree with but the
headline stuff in particular I'm very
skeptical about everyone who posts a
headlines now without me reading the
articles yeah which is good that's good
yeah when you see people this is like
another thing have you've ever seen
things article headlines posted where
people talk about eliminating white
people or eliminating the white race
usually when you read into those
articles it's usually a lot more nuanced
as well I've had Lauren southern link me
a picture and it had that headline like
we need to get rid of the white race and
when you read into the article what they
were actually talking about was like the
concept of whiteness has usually only
been used to [ __ ] with people and what
we even considered to be white has
changed you know over time so the entire
idea that there is like a white thing
seems to just be totally redundant like
we don't need that concept it wasn't
about actually like killing or getting
rid of white people but it was more
how ridiculous the concept of white like
there are like ethno white nationalist
now like Nick Fuentes or James allsup
puentez is like 25 percent Hispanic and
he believes that he's pure enough for
his white ethnic state so it's like the
entire idea of whiteness has gotten like
I'm half Cuban you know and I might
qualify for some of the ethno states
that these people want so it's like a a
spectrum of white and if you're in the
right part of the spectrum then you pass
for your white everybody it's just the
idea that like the whole concept of
whiteness is just kind of silly or maybe
we should just do away with that as like
like it just doesn't make sense to use
any more like jontron who's Iranian or
half Iranian considers himself to be
white you know and 200 years ago I don't
think anybody any Middle Eastern person
would have been considered white you
know I'm glad that you brought up the
the wolf thing before I so here is a
here's another thing just a video does
these are like random things that I
stumble across in it just to keep in
mind um I don't know this is the exact
timestamp but I linked to you and then
let me know when you've got it up and
then we can start listening okay sure
and also someone asked me in your chat
why I still support her cuz i i i love
all a lot of her videos and what she
says she's nice funny and not everyone's
perfect and if i ii disliked people or
didn't support people because they
messed up once or twice then i wouldn't
be fair cuz i I [ __ ] up all the time so
anyway yeah so this is I actually
watched a bit of this video today I
watched just only the first two minutes
Kristopher guns video men are rapists
sharing is the hottest of take so we're
gonna watch a particular part I suppose
yeah I just have like this past like
last two minutes or whatever I mean we
could go over the whole video but we'll
discover the past you just just just as
like a fan actually at a certain point I
don't know if you're gonna be streaming
for longer I have to pick up my group a
girlfriend in about 15 minutes okay yeah
and we can talk later if you want but we
don't even need that much to just go
over this real quick okay let me know
you got the link up okay it's over three
two one go been the subject of myth and
fairy tale from the beginning of
literature what else were the stories of
Little Red Riding Hood or Bluebeard's
Castle about okay first of all I don't
know what the hell Bluebeard's Castle is
but I'm British
I'm pretty sure a little bit riding hood
is about a wolf eating people do you
want to go to sexuality right with
vampires
be my guest that's entirely accurate but
to suggest that Little Red Riding Hood
is about the male libido what kind of
glasses are you wearing what kind of
herbs are you smoking what kind of
chemicals are you ingesting what kind of
horrible horrible things are you doing
to yourself a vampire is an ancient and
powerful okay so pause the video okay
okay yeah so that he goes hard on that
statement right so firstly the article
that he's quoting here in a lot of this
article it isn't even the views of the
author he's just sharing what is like
well except like other literary views of
things so something that I find
interesting here and I heard him say
this and I was kind of curious so I
looked this up this took me two seconds
to Google okay so the earliest written
version of Little Red Riding Hood was
written by a guy called I think it's
Charles Perrault there there might be
different pronounce Alice or Perrault it
is this French dude and if you read the
origins of this tale it was actually
like an allegory for a well-dressed
young man seducing a woman in the
streets and then taking her back and
then devouring her or you know
unflattering her so it's actually
exactly what the early tale was about oh
so he just [ __ ] that whole thing
lately yeah and this is actually
something that and this is really
surprising because I don't think Chris
is stupid but if you take any early
literature class and I'm sure you've
taken some basic English you learn this
a lot that a lot of early stories
whether it's The Scarlet Letter or
[ __ ] any of those or early fairy
tales a lot of these are are based on
you know like sexual myths or allegories
of societies yeah yeah so that was like
okay I'm just gonna go over like some
general and specific things and I'll
bring you to an for discussion okay but
I'm going to see you can hear I'm
talking about okay so I'm going to open
this up as spoiler free and then I'll
get into spoilers later
so in general okay so typically I like
to sit on a movie for a night before I
think like to deeper look into it
because I feel like just taking a night
to let things like settle I think helps
me get a better idea of it I don't know
how I feel about anything the next day
those feelings can change overnight so
I'll preface that with this so again
with no spoilers I'm gonna try very hard
to do no spoilers for this opening but
okay this is something I'm not used to
doing I feel like it was when I saw it I
think that if you don't think about it I
think I said this in Twitter if you
don't really think about it too deeply I
think it was a really good pretty good
movie really good movie I think I think
that um
the way the movie looks is actually
really really cool
not even just like there's like there
are like really cool shots in this um
and this might be one of them it's like
one of the coolest shots I've ever seen
ever at any space like related movie
which was really cool and then yeah I
don't know that just the the camera
stuff it seems really cool I wish I
could go into more detail but um that's
really cool that's really cool the music
was fine it's kind of funny in some
places kind of sad and deep in other
places it seems like the the general
like framework is pretty good but man
when you take a deeper look at it and
then when you take a more comprehensive
look at it I think there are very very
serious flaws I would see the movie
though if you're thinking about seeing
it I would definitely see it I mean it's
like a it's a Star Wars movie you can't
you should if you're part of like
Western civilization you should see the
movie yeah and that's kind of all I
think that's kind of what I have for
like the general is that okay is there
any other questions like generally
before I can get into like spoiler
related [ __ ] I don't like doing this
non-spoiler it feels stupid do you want
to talk about it I mean
you know or is anything more to say like
generally I don't know I felt like I
said no spoilers right now yeah yeah I
was surprised by like how light-hearted
some of that [ __ ] was yeah I kinda like
there's me you know then I was expecting
yeah there was a decent bit of like
snarky comedy related things in this
almost almost too much in my opinion
I don't know I think it's like a newer
age it's just like a newer era of movies
and series movies in the past the
guardians of the galaxy yeah well no
well I don't know if it was quite a
comedy there was but I don't know
guardians of the galaxy but but I would
say more comparable to like any Marvel
movie maybe like even compared to the
last Star Wars movie like force awakens
like I watched that like two months ago
there was not that much comedy in that I
was really surprised by how they just
kept going back it's like every 10
minutes we need to joke know which I
mean I guess I don't know I don't know
how I feel about that more than anything
else I don't know that's a good thing or
a bad thing I mean it's supposed to be a
movie for young people so I mean I think
that's okay
I don't know how sure but um yeah yeah
overall yeah I'm gonna agree with what
you said though overall I thought I
probably hired probably say maybe at 7
but I have to get one lower I'd say of
five because I just like expect I just
expect a movie like of that budget and
of that like prowess like just to be
visually amazing so I don't know I don't
really give them much credit for that
sure and that's the thing is I go one of
these things with no expectations oh
yeah like I have I did this is the first
time I went to a movie theater since
inner sexiest lighting or so I wish
Steven so I like no expectations for
movies so that makes sense to Kyle
didn't feel like you couldn't have like
a moment where like you couldn't have
like a real moment with that like a joke
being had that's kind of how I was like
I don't know it's kind of how I was
feeling I don't think there was a single
moment where there wasn't a joke said oh
yeah yeah that was my issue there's like
no quiet movements in that entire movie
- it felt like I mean well I guess the
first movie felt like that - or it's
just very much the high pace a lot of
[ __ ] going on not a lot of quiet moments
yeah I don't know how I feel about that
in general at the end I came out like
enjoying it yeah I agree
okay can you start getting into spoilers
huh okay we're moving past this and now
we're getting into spoilers you have
been warned this is now a spoiler zone
okay Deborah said the most iconic scene
is silent wait what you seen is that
that's a slicing ship yes oh yeah that
was probably my favorite space-related I
was a long time
yeah that's actually the coolest thing
I've ever seen done like in space like
an all-time but um
seem like the same thing kind of
happened in interstellar yeah but yeah
but I would expect that from
interstellar because that's his style I
wouldn't expect that in a Star Wars
movie Star Wars movies are always about
loud explosions and all sorts of [ __ ] in
space whereas interstellar was
thematically consistent and not having
any sounds in space I thought it that
shot was really really really cool that
was like one of the cooler sounds in the
leia one and which she was out there in
the very start of the movie when leia
was out there after she li got blown out
in space I mean there's always like
music and [ __ ] but that's literally like
what Dover is talking about that was
literally like a 15-second [ __ ] thing
like there's not very much silence in
this movie like yeah yeah yeah so okay
so okay so just like minor plot things
because I'm not really big I'm like
pointing out plot holes but man there
are a couple plot things that could make
this movie so much more enjoyable I wish
that thin wait no not Finn who's the
what's name of the resistance fighter
guy Poe I wish that there was like just
like a really quick quip about his about
how his light about his x-wing was like
really specially outfit or something
there was some reason why it was so cool
I wish there was a quip about that
because he seems like really
unreasonably [ __ ] strong and like
really it's hard to get a scope of like
how powerful the first order is when
like a single like x-wing is like
closing in on these dreadnaughts and
like just blowing up all their turrets
and [ __ ] with like no reason given other
than I guess he's a pretty good pilot I
guess and this the first ones didn't
they go into Anakin being like an
amazing pilot and everything so I don't
know if there's ever a point where Luke
is literally like single-handedly taking
on a massive ship like that and like
fighting and killing every I don't know
I mean I guess
like his little Death Star run but even
though they needed a han Solo for that
right yeah and then he had like other
fighters around him and whatnot like
yeah I'm sorry because I'm just trying
to oh yeah anything else on that well
their justification for that was the
comedy bit which currents like oh he's
you know oh I'm on hold
oh yeah cuz I was their justification
it's like oh then he got too close for
the ships he got too close for the
ship's cannons to fire on him now we
gotta let the TIE fighters out to kill
ya also I didn't hate that part this is
like a thing like I'm pretty sure this
applies in real life I know this applies
in like video games like Eve it kind of
bothers me that you have these like
quadrillion dollar planet-sized [ __ ]
ships and then like you have like twelve
Taif iters to defense them I feel like a
ship like this should be outfitted with
hundreds and hundreds of like
accompanying fighters it feels really
weird that like this massive [ __ ]
thing has literally like eight time
fighters protecting it that seems really
really stupid yeah I don't know I mean
like this is just like minor yeah plot
things also like a single bomber made it
and blew up the entire ship
I mean yes I guess just it's a minor
meme there's a lot of I'm trying to just
handle like the main ones moving forward
a little bit
I don't know I'm skipping anything Leia
like flying through space that was like
what I was just like didn't my head know
what the point I never came back right
yeah I've never I mean sands can survive
in space I don't know if that was a
callback to the super safe super sands
can survive in space you have to be a
Super Saiyan Trevor space so I don't
know that was supposed to be like a
callback to like Dragon Ball Z but like
that was really weird it was also like
totally unnecessary
just injured or something like that you
know you can get her injured in the ship
you know getting in destroy and I are
using the reports like he lists moment
yeah I just thought that they could not
have that scene at all either yeah
moving forward I the the whole side plot
on that planet just seemed it was like
Game of Thrones you know where it's like
it's like so like we're in little
actually honestly and like your writers
I feel like they could have contrived a
better plot device for this ship than
like we're like so this massive [ __ ]
fleet is approaching however we can't
get in range of the cruiser that's
barely out of range and so we're just
gonna chase it for like 24 hours I I
don't know that just seems kind of and
they've lied a little bit you can't like
any kind of firepower that has farther
range you notice stronger ships like
cruisers that could come out that are
around the same size like it just seems
like you've got so much force that to
sit there like on the edge of the range
and never and for 24 hours like it felt
like it felt like the first order wasn't
like powerful at all I don't know they
fell yeah that was always the same level
of the oppression that I had was it like
the first order just kind of [ __ ] I
guess but then you're supposed to get
this impression that they're all
powerful but like look when they go down
to where they on Hoth was at the planet
or is it a different okay when they go
down to the snow planet and then you're
like oh [ __ ] like it's gonna be some big
ice [ __ ] they've got like eight of those
big walkers and like that's it I thought
they were gonna have like a massive
[ __ ] like Lord of the Rings to your
[ __ ] army or something not literally
like eight Walker day I guess that's I
guess that's fine I don't know I guess
what was the point of the planet having
salt on it was it just to set up the
nice red shot sorry
it's probably just a mean I don't know
another camera beams I thought the red
shots looked really well yeah they look
the shots on the bay it looked like what
was yeah why
of it having salt like they're just okay
say something in chat you need to
justify it with lines from the movie so
proto Bank said the first order is a
small remnant force leftover from the
Empire I'm pretty sure that literally
within this film they said that the
first order was on the verge of taking
over like within didn't leia say that
are not leia didn't rice say that within
a week they would take over all the rest
of the galaxy that they were like close
to having every major system I don't
remember that I I'm pretty she says
something I feel like she literally said
that to Luke that like within a week or
two that that the first order would own
like every major system I'm pretty sure
they said that so I don't think so
I don't think the first order is like
some small little remnants or whatever I
think they're a massive space force it's
not I would think it's it seems like
it's not well-defined yeah because
you're bringing up points that are at
odds this is the [ __ ] leaders fleet
and there's like six of these Star
Destroyers yeah so that whole contrived
scene I felt like they could have
contrived a way better to give them some
time I did we talked about going to the
planet at all well that such a thing
yeah like that whole side me miss my
felt like it was a big waste of time and
a photo went to the bathroom I would've
probably felt better about the movie
yeah you know just don't know how I felt
like that whole side plot that's
something I think they could have
contrived something better for Rose the
little Chinese chick or whatever yeah I
didn't like that character at all I
think it should she didn't like I'm kind
of okay with their like slow-moving
vehicles just out of range but it's like
we need to go down to this casino planet
to find a hacker and then go back to the
Star Destroyer
yeah that's not anyone I say like could
arrive that's not that how could that
cannot be the best thing you guys could
have any mob or whatever couldn't come
to help because she was doing some like
random [ __ ] they had to like do that
Anna might mob who is that remember the
girl that they talked to and know like
could you do this she was like yeah but
I'm busy like settling a dispute or
whatever
oh yeah they just kind of like me Mele
brought her into the movie for some
reason there is and then ma this is
something I didn't like mob is supposed
to be a very intelligent character full
of wisdom that knows a lot
she was pretty confident that there was
literally a single person in the galaxy
that was capable of doing this hack and
it seems like they easily by chance ran
into a random criminal that was able to
do the hack like so was mom just wrong
or did the people get exceptionally
lucky or yeah yeah and then the whole
bb-8 remembers [ __ ] name the robot
did yeah he like was killing like waves
and waves of soldiers like I don't know
how yeah I think he was probably a
little bit too powerful yeah like they
go around they gets locked in the jail
and like the hacker just like goes
around the corner and finds two people
like knocked out and it was the droid
that did it yeah no it was like three or
four like soldiers and [ __ ] yeah I don't
know yeah well the guy just in there
like in like a drunk tank or whatever
just like chilling his drunk out before
we want to be like to leave you just
kind of laid there until yeah they're
discovering the whole poor thing I think
all of that was like really dumb that
part of the plot was really dumb moving
on to more serious plot things I don't
know anything about that since enoki guy
and then he knows yeah and then he nope
so yeah and then and then snake he just
died like in two seconds and that seemed
like really dumb seems like really
powerful too I don't I guess he was
supposed to be he fell okay I kind of
like the subversion of your expectations
there but like this character being so
important and being completely
undeveloped
like yeah you don't know anything about
him at all yeah and his existence
doesn't make any sense either there's
this all powerful Jedi that's just been
that just came around well I don't think
that's so bad as long as he serves a
purpose but like because for instance I
don't think I could be wrong but I don't
think you know anything about the
Emperor and Star Wars right well yeah
but he's Emperor Palpatine you know bit
I think no no I don't think you know
he's served under
and then you know wait did whoever Yoda
didn't know no he was he was Chancellor
Palpatine in the first three movies no
no no no yeah yeah but I'm talking about
four five and six before we see him in
the first three movies in just four or
five and six you don't really learn
anything oh no I was I was talking about
learning things and uhm in the prequels
yeah no no yeah I'm just saying about it
in the four five and six you don't
really learn anything and then he dies
again but I think his death serves an
important purpose for the development of
Darth Vader so I think that's sure well
where is Snoke during four five and six
are you telling me in the 20 years
between between six and seven this guy
just appeared
I mean like again like I'm okay with
that just because like yeah I like
somebody brought up like you literally
don't even know he's Palpatine in
Episode four bottom six he's just the
Emperor I'm okay with him being there as
snow being a really powerful dude as
long as he served some purpose but it's
just his death didn't really mean
anything I was really uneventful sure I
like the subversion of expectation
they're like you don't expect that like
that's not a good reason to do anything
that's like a Death Grips argument like
if you're gonna subvert expectations you
have to have a specific reason for doing
so otherwise you're just being edgy
I think sure like in Game of Thrones
when your expectation is subverted about
main characters the purpose is to show
consequence for your actions which makes
sense it's not like people just randomly
die in Game of Thrones
I do the meme is that like well any
character can die not really they
generally have to earn their death
usually I'm trying to think I don't know
if there were any undeserved deaths in
Game of Thrones it seems like most of
the characters through there out throw
their own actions and imperfections
aren't they're duds sure I guess my
point is I'm okay with it happening I
just wish there was some development to
that character yeah so like the big
problem and this is like my huge problem
with the where the Star Wars memes are
at right now is that it seems like all
conventional character arcing or
character development has just been
totally abandoned we just don't care
about that anymore characters just do
things and they become really strong and
they finish arcs that were never started
and just have no purpose or anything and
that's like I think that's actually the
biggest detracting thing from the film
like the Rilo Kiley's oh dude like
turning on the on the [ __ ] Snookie for
like no [ __ ] reason like we don't
really get any of that
that's actually really disappointing to
me really for us
reading because it seems like there's a
lot of development between those two
characters but that we just don't get it
like this was a two-and-a-half-hour
movie and we didn't get any real
development of Ray or Rilo Kiley's why
kylo Ren a little bit a little bit but
like like when she showed up on the ship
and he was like right there was like oh
okay I guess we're climaxing on this
like encounter real [ __ ] quick you
know like do some like option and like
go find him and yeah that's what I sent
her they would have an encounter or
something but like um something that
really irritated me that actually made
the first of this trilogy make a lot of
sense is when you got the impression
that Rilo is actually really torn on
kill on killing han that made the later
part of the last movie make a lot of
sense why he was unable to defeat Rey
and the Finn guy in combat and whatnot
hey what's up buddy good evening how are
you sir I'm doing great how are you yeah
not too bad cold raining typical Irish
weather awesome
yeah how about you um more or less the
same except no Rangers called we're
about to yeah I'm assuming you're in
America yeah I live in the middle part
of it pretty much well ok so I know
little or nothing about you you only
came to my attention when I saw a tweet
by somebody complaining that you had
issued a copyright notice against a
video that she posted mm-hmm and the
video clip I think she had mirrored
somewhere else I saw I saw that that
video clip and I was quite incensed I
tweeted out what I tweeted out which is
still there on my I had many people who
came at me I think is there the term and
they said you have taken this clip out
of context you need to watch the full 2
hour debate
that's right there I think you could
have just watched like a minute of it
but ok well no I did I certainly didn't
want to be seen to be ill informed so I
did watch the 2 hour debate and it was
10 times worse than I thought it could
have been from my point of view from
from a number of points of view that I'm
sure we can discuss what it was I guess
I want to be nothing if not courteous
you're the one who invited me to speak
with you was there something that you
had in particular you wanted to speak
with me about first of all oh well I
just I don't really appreciate it when
people take what I say out of context
and then spread it around online to try
to defame me is really irritating for me
okay that wasn't the intention to the
same well there was the intention of the
original poster and then you hopped on
that bandwagon so you assumed
responsibility for that when you retweet
InDesign video yes I did I took I took
that video I listened to the clip I was
I won't say offended but I I think the
the correct word was I was incensed that
somebody would say what you said I'm
hold the view that you hold or that you
seemed to hold or that at the very least
at the time you held and and then
apparently look to silence a somebody
who was so I'm not silencing anybody I
don't understand what you mean by that
the content is freely available on my
YouTube and on my twitch people can link
to it as much as they want though
they're nothing as being silenced so why
would you then issue copyright I I don't
know what the American terminology would
be but we would simply call it a
copyright takedown sure because my video
was being Rijo stood on another platform
without my permission or authorization
and it was being hosted in a way to
intentionally reframe what I said to
defend me okay but I mean do you think
that it was you that the intention was
to defame you yeah of course absolutely
yeah okay
well then perhaps if it's okay with you
do you have any questions for me I don't
want this to be a one-way barrage or
one-way onslaught no I mean I think I've
already expressed my issue was theory
hosting video stuff in order to okay
misrepresent my opinion on something
yeah well then maybe if we establish I
guess if you basics are you speaking to
me in the belief that I am a troll and
that's your word not mine oh I'm not I
don't really know yet I guess usually
when I engage in these conversations I'm
not really concerned if the person is
trolling or not I'm more concerned with
grappling with the actual argument okay
yeah
but in the back of your mind I I did do
you still believe in some way even
though I'm not clear myself and what
mm-hmm the definition of a troll is yes
I have openly admitted that yes my
twitter account is used for satire it's
used for comedy but anybody with a
modicum of intelligence can tell when
I'm being serious about an issue and
when I'm just poking fun or poke he's
posting silly memes or you know things
of that nature I guess it's hard to tell
when your profile picture is literally a
fat black woman doing the sassy thing
and then your name is Shaniqua O'Toole
like it's hard to tell what should be
taken seriously but I understand that
and what I would say to you on that is
you are in America you are American you
are viewing that as somebody we're not
quite sure I understand the reason why
you are all so racially sensitive over
there it is so insane to us here that me
using that I have family and friends who
follow me on Twitter as well and all of
the abuse that I get for that picture is
from Americans and I specifically state
in my bio inspired by the model in the
picture so when it seems that when
Americans see that picture
what are they the word they straightaway
go for is a racist has to be racist
right sure
so why can I be attracted to that person
in the picture I guess it's not about
being attractive it's just that when I
look at it it reminds me of like a like
a and this isn't necessarily you but it
reminds me of like a teenager trying to
be edgy like okay well I'm gonna find a
picture of like a fat black woman doing
a sassy thing and I'm gonna get myself
the last name O'Toole like I'm a big
tool and then I'm gonna pick a song oh
my first name should be like that's just
what it comes off as I'm not that could
be like a legitimate Irish last name and
it's you don't know what tool is oh is
an Irish last name I know I'm saying it
could be but I mean it also very
conveniently works you know in terms of
like like there are real-life like
I want to say American last name so like
English last names are German last names
that also can look like another word
that would fit I'm just saying that like
if it's not attending racism like
perfectly fits as racist is to a an
insult in America yeah it's a pretty it
can be yeah like you're like you're a
tool you know like you're an idiot
you're just use for something oh okay
look you're a tool right yeah huh well
we would call each other handbags Jack
maybe sure Shaniqua would be like the
name of like if you're trying to make
fun of somebody you komak Tyrone or
Shaniqua Jamal like you'd pick like a
stereotypical black name I had never
heard of that name and you know what I
don't mind if you record this or if you
want to publish this because nothing
that I will say to you is confidential
information if you will oh sure that's
right no I'm sorry um I'm sorry let me
back up for a second just to be clear
I'm live-streaming
is that okay yeah I don't mind that at
all okay I don't mind at all okay sure
sure that the name Shaniqua was a new
name to me it was given to me by my
friend who is a crazy left-wing SJW
there's there's a whole backstory to it
that you know we can we can unpack at
another time what I was more interested
in your your your position that this
person is a troll because of this
picture because of this name and without
looking at the substance of my tweets
would that be well yeah combined with
the personal attack the baseless attack
on me and then with everything else yeah
I just figure I mean unfortunately I
engage with thousands of these people on
a weekly basis so I have to make kind of
snap calls and that's that this is I
guess your job what you do is you debate
um I don't like to say that but yeah
that's a part of it now yeah okay how
did this person come into your
consciousness this famous person a MOS a
lot of the issues that I deal with on my
channel are philosophical because it's I
think that it's a very important part of
politics and ethics obviously ethics and
then by extension of that politics and
policy so the I'm currently feuding with
the skeptic community on YouTube I have
a lot of issues with a lot of them and
we kind of go back and forth and almost
was a guy that was kind of making his
way
through the skeptic community doing this
pedophilia debate and I thought that
it's an interesting debate because I
think there are a lot of kind of core
ethical things that we take for granted
and I think it's fun to justify those
ethics that we have when you say debate
that you debated this person does this
mean that you were in any way open to
having your mind changed always in every
debate yeah I would be open has changed
of course yeah I see so this person
stated aim and I'll quote this I'm
trying to eliminate the age of consent
laws for sex
legalizing child pornography and ending
discrimination for pedophiles you're
open to having your mind change on that
if they're in the correct if they're on
the right then young and how would you
decide if they're in the right through
discourse through argumentation I guess
find out if their rationale is more
reasonable than get read if this
person's rationale was more reasonable
than yours then you would I guess end up
agreeing with them that the age of
consent law should be eliminated yeah of
course would you not no of course not
why because of what the person said he
wanted to do to two and three year olds
and then later on when they reached the
age of seven he deemed them worthy
enough for penetrative sex so if you had
well if you had a musician and somebody
has argued that position against you and
they had a better argument than yours
you would hold on to your position
understanding that it was inferior
reasonably to the other person the the
very the the very matter that this is on
the table for discussion is quite
shocking to me why I am because you're
talking about the most vulnerable people
in our society and you are talking about
engaging them in sexual activity where
their bodies have not reached the age of
sexual maturity and where they are
completely unable to understand what it
is they have been recruited to be
involved in sure well of course I Green
that those are all the arguments that I
made that's why
I'm not in favor of getting rid of the
consent laws Yeah right
but you were open to having your mind
changed on that
of course I'm open to having my mind
changed on any topic everyone should be
on every topic yeah right so under what
circumstances then if you're open to
having your mind change there must be
circumstances where you would in some
way
there must be circumstances where you
would agree that two and three-year-olds
may be involved in such activities with
a dolt if you're overly not know of
court thinks oh right now I haven't
heard a convincing argument for it now
you haven't heard a convincing argument
so did the analogy then that comes to my
head is that your like seaweed if you
hear something well then you'll go one
way and then if you hear something else
you'll look another way and like a tide
going in and out the way it moves
seaweed back and forth you wouldn't be
willing to put your sword in the ground
so to speak and say no this is an
absolutely repugnant act that this
person is looking to enact I think that
the analogy is very loaded but if that's
the one you want to use sure okay I mean
I mean Deana I mean you could construct
any number of analogies to make your
position look equally ridiculous where
please do I I'm not too sure how to
communicate with you this is a pretty
important thing so you're telling me
that if you believe that 2+2 is 5 and
you really believe that that you would
never be open to somebody changing your
mind on that like the consequences of 2
plus 2 equal in 5 don't have the same
ramifications for a 2 or 3 year old
being involved in something that can an
impact negatively on them like the rest
of their lives I understand that that's
all part of my argument okay
so do you have another kind of question
that's closer related to rather than 2
plus 2 we can equally 5 do you have
another example that we can steer this
back into the same sheriff's knew yours
so
not to make this personal but you are a
trans person right yeah okay if somebody
were to tell you that being a trans
person is just naturally disgusting or
unnatural and that was their natural
position and they weren't open to
hearing any arguments about it because
they were so convinced of that that not
be troublesome to you not at all don't
care I do what I do I do whatever I do
and improve in the privacy of my own
home or in private don't particularly
care what anyone has to say okay then if
you believe that like all knowledge and
all truth is just nihilistic and nothing
that matters then why why I thought that
that's me that's my own personal view
that one very small issue okay well I
guess so for me personally I cuz I have
no idea what your platform is for me
personally I consider the pursuit of
truth to be very very very important
which means I'm always open to my mind
check well you don't seem to agree with
that meaning that my mind should always
be open to being changed if a better
argument is presented towards me if I
believe in any particular thing if
somebody has a better argument then I
either use it to strengthen my own by
countering their argument or I would
assume their position of their argument
is better to make sure that I'm holding
the most truthful position at all points
in time even even if there was a cost
well the cost would have to be they
would have to argue against that cost I
mean that would be part of the argument
like it's you're making it sound like um
let's say that I firmly believe that I
don't want to put a gun to my head and
kill myself but I would argue that if
somebody could make a convincing
argument than then sure I would you make
it sound like somebody could just stroll
along and say well you're dumb and now
I'll kill myself or something like well
what if somebody made the argument that
in five years my DNA mutates and
destroys all of mankind I guess like in
that circumstance I could kill myself
sure I mean just because you're open to
and hearing another argument doesn't
mean that you're going to change with
the wind that there like a piece of
seaweed you're gonna blow to the other
side so it would be fair if we go to the
very very extremes look just so I'm
clear in my own mind I I go to the very
extremes and let's pretend just for the
sake of discussion mm-hmm let's pretend
that Hitler was still alive mmm-hmm okay
having done what he did in the past
let's pretend he then decided you know
what I want to do I want to
another six million Jews okay and he was
then going around looking for people to
hear him out okay would you would you be
willing to hear him out and give him
that opportunity sure yeah I would hear
any argument I don't think he would sway
me but yeah I would always hear any
argument sure so that there is no in
pinyin then there is no topic that would
be just too radioactive for you to say
well yeah let's hear him out absolutely
yes I think that everything should
always be justified yeah I think that a
big problem we're having right now in
the West is that we took for granted a
lot of things that weren't justified so
yeah I would engage in any topic how do
you buy it so it's not I'm not
necessarily coming at this from a and
this is for any listener out there who
may think that I was attempting to
stifle free speech or shut down free
speech that wasn't the the message
behind my tweet and I did get a lot of
feedback from people saying oh well
you're just anti-free speech and that's
not the case
I'm concerned because I understand that
there are there is a difference between
free speech and between having the
intellectual pride if you like to say
there is no topic that we shouldn't
discuss and then having the wisdom to go
well yes we can discuss that but is it
wise to discuss that you can see there's
a difference between the two yes of
course discuss whatever you like but I
would put it to you that this has not
done you any favors shall we say I mean
I disagree but okay okay I would put it
to you that you spent 90 minutes there
or there abouts discussing eliminating
the age of consent laws for sex with
somebody who wanted to achieve that aim
and if he had convinced you as you said
your mind was open if he had convinced
you then it wasn't your first debate but
there were 4,000 people listening in so
he may well have convinced other people
in just that one stream do you think you
would hold any accountability for that I
don't know I don't think so I think that
I put up a more than adequate argument
against what he was arguing for and I
think that going down that road I mean
you could draw lines on the other side
too and argue that sure of those 4,000
people listening they might have heard
an almost video in the past and they
were going to be in favor of his view
until they listened to me or maybe
somebody in my in my audience heard
would hear something in the future of
his and because I never engaged with him
they decided to take up you know his
cause because they hadn't heard somebody
put up a good argument hmm and even if
there was one would you not say that
would it be one two men how can i
quantify what if there were ten that
were swayed otherwise well they would be
swayed to the good versus well 9 what if
what if there were 10 people that were
listening to him in the future and had
never heard a compelling argument
against his and then they were like well
[ __ ] it I mean I've never really heard a
reason you know to keep the age of
consent laws you know so I will jump
over but maybe because there's a yeah
I'm sorry I don't know how to address
you how would you like me to address you
on you can call me Steven Steven Steven
so let's pretend then that there were
100 people who said you know what I like
Stevens argument better I'm going to
side with him on this okay and there was
one who said well I like a mosque a
mosque
I like Amos better my question to you is
would you not feel that you would have
some degree of responsibility for that
one person going over and siding with a
mosque
I mean I I guess has it happened on your
it happened in your I guess on your
watch if you want to provide that sure I
mean I mean I guess to some extent yeah
but then do I get to assume
responsibility for the people then that
won't be swayed because they heard a
better argument or well yeah sure you
can take the credit for that
okay well then yeah then sure I guess
yeah I mean I'll understand that anytime
you plot
somebody invariably there will be some
even if it's incredibly small percentage
of people that will be swayed over to
that side sure that's an inevitability I
accept yeah and so therefore it's
inevitable that if we could tip the
balance in the other direction we could
say that one person sided with you and
100 people sided with Amos it's all
we're doing is spitballing here we're
just saying this could have happened
it's possible yeah she ossible okay so
what we have to then excuse me we have
to then go and say and question whether
it was responsible for you to have this
discussion in the first place okay if
that could have happened and you just
admitted it so do you not feel that it
maybe in hindsight and this is I'm not
looking to score points with you I'm
looking to you know what we're having a
banana Steve are we winning today is
that whatever you decided cuter oh wait
I might be nice no wait I need to play
ranked games why the [ __ ] are you

never queue with him again after one
game of this and how many times has he

are raging in-game do they know that the
legendary Lilly Picchu is in their game
okay good Reena what do you think the
outcome of the game is irrelevant as
long as I get to spend it laning with
you Lily like I can you do I'm gonna do
the song in this case I have the
opportunity to play with somebody that I
considered to be one of the best people
in the planet and one of the most
talented artists you laughs you laughs
you can stop now I think you can stop
because you don't want the photo shoot
stop who's singing oh we definitely
don't trust him to do anything he's just
probably was gonna die again actually
who is voting no there should be like
you should get permabanned for voting no
in certain situations because it's
clearly a troll okay I'm not saying if
you report the TFR intentionally fading
but let's talk about like something deep
and philosophical when you think do you
normally think in sentences or do you
just think in images and feelings I
think in sentences where it's like I
hear a voice in my head if you didn't
have any language let's say that you
were abandoned as a child or you grew up
in a forest or something with animals
assumption and you weren't able to talk
at all how would you think would you be
able to visually alright would you I
don't know would you be able to could
you imagine constructing a thought
without any kind of words or sentences
behind it I can't because I don't know
what it's like
it's freewill real or just an illusion I
don't know buddy what do you think real
why do you say that because of a
solution that's implying that feet and
destiny exist right yep and I don't
think I don't believe in that why not
there's something there's proof for it
you can literally say like oh my gosh it
was fake that we played leave together
like it couldn't be explained for
everything right also I just don't like
the way destiny because it reminds me of
you my next question well wait do you
want to talk about that more that's
actually like you're actually completely
and totally wrong there do you want to
talk about it not really sure you know
that every decision you make is
predicated on things that have happened
to you right yes yeah so if every
decision is influenced by things that
ever that have happened to you right in
your personal biology how could you ever
say that you've made a unique decision
that wasn't predicated on something
that's already happened can we get back
to you on this okay just think of it
this way if I were to ask you to make a
decision how could you make that
decision free of all previous influences
how could you draw an idea that doesn't
come from something that you've already
seen or alternative is saying like
everything is predetermined right
correct
so you think like whether or not I
choose to let's say like bash my head
against the wall or not right now is
predetermined okay let's say that I have
a let's say that I have a drop of water
and I drop that water from the sky and
it hits the ground if we could measure
everything perfectly do you think we
could 100% predict where that drop of
water will land if we could measure
everything perfectly yeah say we had a
tool of sufficient complexity okay let's
say that you would have put up well sure
but I'm saying obviously of sufficient
complexity we could theoretically
predict where that water is going to
fall because it's predetermined by the
can happen right no no because if you
drop the water that the laws of physics
will dictate where that water droplet
lands right
Simon yes raise your left paw if three
fingers is better to plant it and four
fingers what are you laughing at oh [ __ ]
okay no never good luck wait what how's
that guy certainly ocean
passive-aggressive we should talk to

doing all the heavy lifting here
unbelievable
let's just end this game right here just
end it just end the game just end my
life I'm pretty good thing about suicide
I pushes a ban worthy I'm gonna be
reporting that stream just a prank bro
Lily you are the lamp to Japan
smashing stomping thank you poking a
compliment from you means the world to
me
you mean the world to me you want the
hair off your face
I feel really nauseous right now
[Music]
hey what's up buddy hi oh my god I'm so
nervous oh god you're British no not
actually I don't like to tell people
from okay that's okay I'm just gonna
assume you're British then all right
okay
I just follow like Internet politics so
mostly United States and UK in
english-speaking countries okay um first
I want to clarify that you said that you
thought I wasn't a fan
I am absolutely a fan oh well thanks
wait when did I say this when you read
my tweet on stream when you thought that
I was actually taking your bio seriously
I was actually just trolling to get your
attention oh I can't tell it's actually
really hard to tell these days there's a
big there's a Twitter account with like
eleven thousand followers like screencap
my bio earlier and everybody was like
making fun of it because I thought I was
being serious so I can't tell I really
can't tell anymore yeah fine anyway yeah
you absolutely saved me like I used to
be a Saigon fan and now I'm like ashamed
of how dumb I used to be I'm just happy
that like I'm just gonna turn 21 next
week so at least I'm not like Saigon
who's in his late thirties and still
doesn't know anything
Wow well I'm flattered but here you are
coming to me today as an an cap yeah so
it's like it's mostly a problem that I
have with your views on morality like I
don't really understand it because you
say you evaluate personal personal
autonomy and social well-being and
property rights and taxes so how does
that work I don't know I guess I have to
start this out better I'll talk to my
one philosophy friend and unite this a
little bit more but I guess like
basically bodily autonomy and autonomy
of the self which I guess extends to
your property and your all that is very
very very important to me however social
well-being is also really important to
me as well and I guess to some extent I
like to maximize social well-being as
much as possible while still respecting
the autonomy of an individual that makes
sense yeah but like that's just you and
then you say that you would convince
most people because like most people
value those things as well but I don't
think that's a very good way of going
about things like just because people
agree doesn't mean it's right
well of course I mean I don't know if
any philosophy is necessarily right I
think how you get most people to agree
with mine because I believe that a
philosophy like mine would point you
towards an objectively better world for
everybody when I say objectively I mean
that most people would be wealthier and
happier by most ways that we measure it
yeah so like I actually agree with most
of your ideas on what would make a
better world but I disagree when you say
that we should force people who disagree
to like support those ideas well so are
you talking about specifically in
regards to taxation yeah like government
in general because government is
essentially forcing people to do things
right so when you say like that rich
people should support welfare because
that like that's better for everyone I
agree with that I think that's a good
argument but I don't think that's that
gives you the right to take that money
because you know what's best for them I
guess it like the way that I kind of
view this is that if you want to go out
and live like on your own I guess in the
wilderness or something would be like a
totally self-sustained person you can do
that but I don't see how you exist in a
society where you're reaping all the
benefits of being in a society and then
turn around and say you don't want to
contribute at all to that society that
seems like a hard like it seems like we
kind of have an agreement with the
government where we let you do things to
us right this is I think this is
actually the social contract but like um
yeah but that doesn't exist the social
contract isn't real well I mean by
definition I mean the government exists
and it only exists because we the people
allow it to exist right and we let the
government do things to us that we
wouldn't let individuals do things to us
right like the status the power to tax
us or to enforce law on us and whatnot
right yeah no but we don't let them do
it they just do it because they can but
like we don't necessarily allow it well
don't we
isn't the government liked by the people
for the people like we don't have a
monarchy or any or at least in the
United States I'm not I don't know
exactly if you're arbor bond right you
do have a lawn okay I don't think it's I
but I'm in the United States we have a
democracy so it's citizens that run for
government positions we elect those
citizens we all participate in the
government it's not established by like
divine right or divine order or anything
so I mean yeah I would say in the United
States we give the government the power
to do what it does if we wanted to I
guess we could do like a large
or we could vote for people that would
destroy the government but it doesn't
seem like that's what the will of the
people is at the moment no but there's
no well of the people there's only like
your will and like when did you give up
your eyes to the government so that they
can take your property and [ __ ] well I
mean at the inception of the country we
kind of gave the government the ability
to regulate that stuff and then we kind
of do it actively as we vote on
politicians and everything throughout
all of our elections yeah so like the
inception of the country was completely
illegitimate I guess everyone can agree
with that unless you're like super
conservative and you're actually in
favor of seizing the land of the natives
wait what well I'm only talking I'm not
talking about taking the land from the
native people talking about the
inception of the government to establish
the land for the people that would be
American I guess and I'm saying that
taking land from the Native Americans or
whatever it was right or wrong as yeah
no but but the way that they established
the land to like govern that land was by
taking it from the natives sure yeah so
that's not legitimate well but we're
talking about two different things here
on whether or not stealing land from
somebody is legitimate versus whether or
not the people gave the government the
power to rule over them I think these
are two different topics I I mean I
don't think you should probably genocide
people and take their land that's
probably not a good thing so I mean I
would agree with you that that's
probably not legitimate but that's not
answering the question of did people
legitimately give up their rights to the
government in order for them to be like
a federal in order for there to be a
federal government that rolls over us
right these are two different questions
I think yeah yeah okay but people didn't
give up their rights to the government
well but they did there's no contract
but there's no contract well but we
really did that was the point of the
whole like the Federalist Papers and
everything right was riding around
because it initially we had it was like
13 colonies initially that we're all
kind of Massachusetts we knew that all
kind of did their own things or whatever
and then you know John Jay and a couple
other dudes you know was writing all
that [ __ ] to get everybody to come
together and give up their 100% like
sovereignty in order to form a federal
government to kind of unify the country
I think and the people voted on that at
least back in that day everybody voted
on that scene or not everybody but the
majority voted on that and seems to be
agreeable to that idea forming a more
progressive right so the majority voted
not everyone so there's B who didn't
vote for that they didn't give up their
rights and they didn't even agree to
like
for something vote on something and if
the majority wins I'm gonna do what the
majority wants like did they even agree
with that I mean I guess you could are
okay so then this is an argument where
like if 80% of the people vote on like a
thing to do the 20% have to go along
with it yeah I mean I kind of think you
have to in any functional society I mean
I guess you could argue that you don't
but I feel like that opens you up to
like a really weird bag of worms like
let's say that in a society we decide
let's say that 95 percent of people
decide that like murder or rape or theft
is bad does that mean that the other 5%
has to go along with it I mean they kind
of do too exist in the society right no
I mean I would agree that like rape
theft and murder are bad but not because
the majority agreed that it is well why
because of self-ownership and you can
like prove that logically well
self-ownership is just an individual
philosophical position that's not like
an objective like fact and I don't think
you can logically prove that murdering
or raping or stealing is bad these are
all just philosophical opinions
positions right okay it's not like an
objective fact that we own ourselves but
like there's no alternative so like I
mean like it's an objective fact you own
yourself but it's not like an objective
fact about ownership of yourself has to
be respected by another person
especially 5% disagree and say well I
want to be free to rape and murder and
kill whoever I want I think the
strongest should rule I think that's a
position you could take so you think the
majority can violate the minority self
ownership I guess in the purposes of
yeah forming like a society yeah I guess
they would I don't know a lot of like
government theory so like I'm probably
butchering the [ __ ] out of this
conversation I'm kind of spitballing
this as I go along sorry so but like
what you're saying is that if a majority
vote still I kill you then they can do
that I don't think killing somebody is
the same as taxing somebody or
installing some sort of rules to exist
like in a society but you agree that
property ownership like stems from self
ownership so a violation of property
rights would be a violation of self
ownership so stealing is like kinda the
same as murder because they're both
violations are self ownership yeah but I
think they're I don't think I don't
think you can equivalent all violations
on the same level for instance me
walking up to somebody and poking them
in the back with my
finger is a violation of their body and
then me walking up and stabbing somebody
with my katana that's folded over a
thousand times of Japanese steel would
also be violent enemy I don't think
those are necessarily the same thing
so like I don't know if like if you
argue that like taxing somebody in a way
that they don't want because the
majority of society has decided that
attacks would make the entire society
better off I don't know if that's the
same type of autonomy violation as like
literally murdering somebody I think
there are different levels of it and you
might be able to justify one over the
other based on outcome and intent no not
really like you could argue that there
would be different punishments for
poking someone in the back and like
killing them but that both rights
violations so what you're saying is that
like you can violate rights in a way or
you can violate certain rights but you
can't violate others like why I don't
know maybe I'm like what did that one
guy say a virtue consequentialist I
guess I just don't see like I just don't
see like an alternative to anything else
working out like any type of society
we're like 20% of people could just be
like well [ __ ] all of this we're gonna
go do our own thing but we still want to
exist in the society and reap all the
benefits of it and then you guys do
whatever like what's the alternative
that every single person should be
allowed to like secede and make their
own sovereign state or yeah basically
like everyone should be able to do
whatever they want with the body and the
property huh I guess I guess I just see
that making like society like so much
worse off that I I guess I would reject
that notion I don't know especially
while they're stuck especially while
they're still benefiting from everything
that you benefit from right by being in
a society
okay so benefiting in what way cuz if
you're talking about like public
utilities then you'd be charged for that
like you can't use that without paying
but if you're talking about like just I
don't know like benefiting from a from
safety because other people are paying
for the police like you can't call the
police if you don't pay for the police
but if your neighborhood is safer as a
result of other people paying for the
police like there's not much you can do
to stop people benefiting from that and
I don't think it'd be justified in
making them pay for the police if they
can't call the police if they're
personally like victimized in some way I
mean I guess if like you really want to
like I said earlier like if you really
want to let go off into the wilderness
and like go and do your own thing I
think I would be ok with that but like
if you want to like secede as your own
sovereign body inside of a neighborhood
I feel like I mean like you're
benefiting from the roads I would you
pay a fee for that I guess and you're
benefitting yeah I mean like at the end
of the day wouldn't you just be paying
all the same fees that you are paying
under taxes yeah but I wouldn't be
forced to pay for it like if I don't
want to use the roads for whatever
reason or if I don't want to use I don't
know like an arts program that's tax
funded like I wouldn't have to do that
well but wouldn't they still be charging
you for it anyway like in order to exist
here and not be conquered by us like
we're going to charge you some amount of
money and then that money would just be
put towards that program anyway no I
guess you can only charge I mean you can
only like you you have you'd have to pay
for a security company to protect your
property if you want like otherwise you
can just like have your weapons and
defend your property yourself so like
what happens if you have like two
sovereign nations on the same street and
like one what if we wanted to just
invade those sovereign nations and take
over you would say that well that's
wrong or yeah that's wrong because like
you don't really need to secede and form
your own servant sovereign nation like
your property is already like your
sovereign nation because on your
property whatever rules you want to
apply would apply as long as it doesn't
violate anyone's rights well but not
really I mean like your property is
zoned by state or local governments in
order to be approved for housing like
there were probably some subsidies that
went into constructing your housing
you've got access to a lot of subsidized
things like electricity and water that
were built by public subsidies and then
it connects to a public road that's paid
for by public taxes like you're I think
your property is hardly like a sovereign
state I don't think I know because you
don't necessarily have to use all those
public things well but whether you want
to or not if you didn't like go out and
like pay for somebody to build that
house yourself you're kind of have
always been benefiting from those things
no I don't know I guess like some people
argue actually Elizabeth Warren
apparently said that deburr should pay
taxes because they benefit from public
utilities
the whole thing is that we shouldn't pay
taxes for the public utilities well but
then how would we pay for them or how
rapidly privately I don't know I guess I
just haven't seen I guess like I feels
like the argument with socialists like I
just haven't seen like a mechanism
through which this seems like it could
create like a functioning world like the
idea of having a whole bunch of
sovereign people living next to each
other with no type of social construct
at all - like unify everything or
integrate everything just seems like it
would be a total [ __ ] disaster
yeah now you could actually unify your
property with someone else someone
else's property actually you could have
a world that looks like exactly like the
world we have now with government and
everything but it would have to be
voluntary and like if we could prove
that current governments are legitimate
which we can't then it would be fine to
have things the way they are now because
that would mean that the social contract
is indeed voluntary that's not the case
that we'd have to like start over and
have people form their own state and if
somebody doesn't want to join any state
and then you do that I guess I would so
not to be like super pushy here but like
has this ever worked anywhere before
like in any extended way yeah no but
like I know that you care a lot about
like how come and data and all that
stuff but I don't think you can really
use that to justify morality because you
admit yourself that utilitarianism is
really problematic yeah sure um I don't
know I guess I'll think about it more oh
no I guess I'm not really like hardcore
dug-in on government positions I haven't
really thought about like um I think
this would be a meta this wouldn't be a
minute I think this would be like an
applied ethics question I think and I
haven't really gotten to applying ethics
to like governments yet so maybe I guess
I'll have to think out that position a
little bit more I guess I just when I
look at this in kind of a
consequentialist point of view I just
don't see it reasonably working in the
real world at all yeah but you say that
you're not a consequentialist well but
I'm but I might be I don't know I try to
say I'm not anything because every time
I say I'm one thing somebody emails me
and says that I'm wrong so I'm not sure
yeah I remember one time when you said
something about utilitarianism like
being bad because of the trolley
problems and like enslaving a bunch of
people to benefit more people and all
that stuff and then someone in the chat
said that no serious utilitarian would
say that like it would be more complex
or something but I looked up like all
possible types of utilitarianism and I
didn't find anything I agreed with so
maybe we're missing something I don't
know well so for utilitarianism hold on
hold on a second okay yeah so okay so
sorry so many sent me an email
describing the distinction this so
apparently there's something known as a
queue Tillet arianism versus rural
utilitarianism and in one of these like
you can bacon consequences to your kind
of thinking so for instance like there
could be a utilitarian estat enslaving
500,000 people to please the entire
population would still be a wrong act
even though the utilities increased
their because as part of that as part of
that action you also make it permissible
to enslave people in society which could
lead to a decrease in utility whatever
that you would actually take into
account what would happen as a result of
doing that that would be taken into
account select for the trolley problem
like it might be possible if you're
trying to be very careful it might be
possible that a utilitarian Ascan argue
for a trolley problem that like let's
say a trolley was gonna hit four but you
let me guess this is a game that's gonna
that's gonna challenge me intellectually
so you can judge me yep of course it is
okay you got it
why has everything for you it's just a
[ __ ] a [ __ ] dick measuring contest
because I love huge dicks
don't tell anybody we have so much in
common
oh uh you I knew you loved huge dicks ah
ha ha I gotcha
you said earlier you didn't but I know
it why do you know it because every time
I whip out my 10 girls look at it
they're like I've always wanted
something that [ __ ] huge destroying
my [ __ ] vagina that's what they say
every single time Wow how many times
does it happen I don't know I lost track
after like 2530 wow you're just like
sland vaginas left and right yep can you
please bring up the puzzle on the screen
you still uncertain about her hair color
naturally brown it is a debate you know
like there's a quite a controversy if my
hair color of regular brown hair as a
Greek girl is actually indeed what's it
like being Greek do you feel like and
like do you feel anger about like the
Romans or anything or
do you have an antipathy towards okay
pick the cup do you want to plate would
door what do you want it what do you do
on your scrim is it time for you to
leave I don't to like keep you up if
it's like too late or what about Turkish
people what about turkey for
Thanksgiving
do you like Turkey or do you not
celebrate Thanksgiving do you know the
difference to make recons and the Roman
gods why are you leaving me hanging here
this is really awkward okay fine I'm
just kidding actually I'm totally
comfortable with silence so what do you
want to know about I'll give you one
thing ok ask me one thing and I'll be
I'll be real as [ __ ] alright
ok ok
when you brought up that hold men don't
have relationships thing what were you
doing what are you doing with that oh I
was legitimately just asking because I
was curious if you had like if you had
ever heard of like mgtow or red pill or
a pickup artist community or whatever
because getting the opinions of people
that kind of like just a little bit read
it it's just kind of interesting there
wasn't like a deeper meme that I was
legitimately just fishing for a
conversation topic okay fair enough I'm
not going over in the chat I'm not gonna
ask him questions solicit din loves to
knew I don't know if that means things
dug this the $2 min weight that I am or
somebody said that to you in chat no you
are I'm telling you
oh well I mean obviously I'm interesting
that's why people follow me I imagine
right we're in real life okay I'll be
real with you a second time okay are you
ready this is you're getting like three
times moments are prefaced by that no I
can't okay I have a very big ego okay
I'm actually incredibly narcissistic
some people say that like just meaning
but I'm actually like I'm pretty serious
about that so when you say that like oh
well you're interesting well I mean
obviously I consider myself to be very
interesting yeah of course but I all but
I guess you could say it is like a
compliment so I appreciate okay here's
the third real thing okay I do have a
hard time getting compliments sometimes
okay so thank you for saying I'm
interesting you're welcome all right but
why do you have to acknowledge that you
indeed know that I feel like that's a
sign of insecurity lesson narcissism
you're just trying to reassert how know
you are okay what am i walking up to you
somebody and be like I have a few and
you're like all right dude just chill
yeah no I admit I like I kind of
understand what you're saying but no I'm
actually like I'm very secure like in a
really boring way so there's not like
anything fun there why don't you just
accept it
wait what was the original question why
don't I just accept it as a compliment
yeah oh oh I don't know it's just really
weird when I have a really hard time
accepting a compliment so I usually
deflect with some type of joke mm-hmm
that's just like a thing I don't know
why I try to be because I have to
balance out like my ego [ __ ] with like a
good dose of like humility because if I
don't then I think my personnel would be
very under
active right people confidence is a
really good trait but being like really
full of yourself a really ecosystem
humorous manner is perceived as really
negative so I think balancing it out
with humor is good but then there's a
negative thing where I have a trouble
sometime accepting compliments so I get
to humorous there which is really rude
you shouldn't do that right if somebody
compliments you you should say thank you
and accept it but yeah let's just like a
minor or a [ __ ] on my right I guess
having silence you have five or six the
my mom and dad divorced a couple times
so they had siblings before my marriage
and there's like one where I'm not even
sure if she's my dad's daughter or not I
don't really know and then I have my
younger sister who was born to the same
parents that I was but um push it yeah
but I know I do you land in like the the
pecking order to second youngest but my
family moved away when I was like 14 and
15 I'm not like really close with a my
family I wasn't lying when I said that
either I don't have like a close
relationship with my family I just kind
of do my own thing holy [ __ ] what no
that's really interesting that they had
a lot of kids you know that's just it's
just a lot of this is not a very stable
like family life it sounds like a lot of
things well I have my own life now I
don't have to worry about that [ __ ]
right
yep the city you know tell me that you
just say yeah it was weird and um I'm
okay now but am I making you
uncomfortable nothing makes me
uncomfortable okay that's not even true
no it is that actually is true yeah
that's one of the reasons why I do so
well on internet it's really impossible
to like make me uncomfortable
because I have a really high self-esteem
when I say that it sounds like I mean
but it's not I'm really comfortable
myself so I don't really get
uncomfortable about anything that sounds
really Mimi but when I'm lying it's
because I sound like the same when I'm
not lying actually lying what I say that
but I don't know how to convince you
that I'm not lying when I say that I'm
sorry no I believe that you believe it I
know well no I really I I'm really not
there's like nothing you can say that
makes me uncomfortable I don't think or
if there is I've never heard it before
thank you blood suni for the two dollars
sure a while for the stuff
miss Holloway one from sub tassel s2 for
the sub sorry guys I've been like not
doing my normal thing but I really
appreciate the support thanks guys
well thanks guys see you like Rick and
Morty huh yeah hmm okay I told a little
lie this this is the only thing that's
ever made me uncomfortable for here holy
[ __ ]
choose DME or something yeah this is
really painful to watch you might want
to watch this no stream of your viewers
are looking Morty clips for the record I
got into it because my son but now my
band you wobble of a dub dub
what those people keeps like spamming
shits for me to ask you I'm not gonna
ask
I just wanna have a normal conversation
with you instead of like this wiki user
reviewer just you know okay what do you
wanna have a normal conversation about I
love conversation I don't know just it's
it's difficult to have a conversation
with somebody who who says they have
there's nothing that makes them
uncomfortable like nothing makes you
does anything make you sad
not really no so if somebody somebody
close to you dies this is Mickey sad I
mean if my son died that would make me
really sad he's probably like the only
one where I would say definitely huh how
old is he six years old I wouldn't meant
I would comment on the aid like that's a
great age but it'sit's an age sounds
like a little kid yeah I don't really
know much about kids yeah I mean he's
just like every other kid he's healthy
has arms and legs and goes to school and
stuff yeah what's his name Nathaniel
James first middle mm-hmm what's your
middle name
I'm not gonna give that on stream Wow
okay wait can you type it to me on
discord yeah I won't read it
gotcha okay awesome
now I have blackmail material shits dz2
it's really gonna narrow down the
population normally I can crack a person
much easier than this well there's not
much to crack I'm pretty straightforward
like I'm very blunt on everything a lot
of people not to say that you do this or
other people but like people like to act
like maybe mysterious or like there's
some like really deep [ __ ] or something
there's not really I'm a pretty
straightforward person which is kind of
boring but yeah I guess you are pretty
boring then yeah well but I mean born in
an awesome way
like I can't there's not like like if
you bring up like like wizards then I'm
gonna start crying because I actually
wanted to be like a magician growing up
and like my childhood dreams were all
for naught and then you know as a way to
channel those frustrations I started to
get into other forms of entertainment
and then took up streaming as a way to
fill that hole like you want to be a
magician well no I just made that all
huh but I'm saying like there's not like
a story like that wait a minute what
that was that was that was you just
making up a story for fun yeah well but
I'm telling you I'm just saying like
there's not like I don't have like a
story like that where that I can fits
like the key to unlock everything I'm a
pretty straight white person yeah mm-hmm
Southern's not is that why you talk to
so many people
I'll show you people because I like
people interesting you know do you not
think so what do you feel like you're a
boring person so you have to supplement
your life with interesting people I
think I'm a pretty interesting person I
have a really cool job I was one of the
first people in the world to have this
job I travel to a lot of places I think
I'm a pretty unique individual not like
things about you as a person those are
things that you external things you've
attached to you I those are
accomplishments or you know oh well I
like music
does that count is that like a thing
about me I like music a lot so if you
just you self-identify as a boring
person and now you're trying to tell me
that you know you're actually
interesting then myself identifies an
important person wait what no I didn't
say that isn't a boring person oh I'm
sorry
um let me clarify so I don't think I'm
necessarily boring I think I'm fairly
interesting one
said boring what I meant was like
sometimes like if you watch a lot of
dramas or if you talk to people in your
life there always seems like there's
some like really dark edgy underlining
story that it can explain a great deal
more so does something for me I don't
really have that at all I'm pretty open
about everything and everything in my
life is pretty straightforward I'm a
very busy person nothing weird happened
your childhood everyone has some well
I'm not saying that weird stuff didn't
happen it's just that I've spoken about
most of it and there's not like I don't
I'm not like I don't repress anything or
have like some deep you realize you're
talking to me right you're not talking
to your yeah whoa
so what you're like oh yeah I've talked
about this I don't know anything about
you know oh yeah I just mean in general
it's not like so like people know about
it like in my audience and whatnot yeah
maybe you personally might not yeah I'm
sorry that's um yeah I can understand
that
yeah no I can understand that there's a
lot of times I'm talking to people and I
get couth yeah I know obviously I mean I
wouldn't expect you to know everything
I'm just saying the end yeah that I have
like spoken about most of my stuff
pretty openly in the past there's not
like a deep thing yeah sorry
do you think you're an interesting
person I think I'm a weird person I
don't know if and I think that people I
think interesting is how people react to
the weirdness why do you think you're
weird because I just don't feel like I'm
a normal person what's a weird thing
about you when you say you're not
normally looks like one way that you
feel like you really don't fit him I
just talked about this earlier in the
stream when I was online dating I used
to kept a spreadsheet of all the guys
ever dated track of my progress as a
person in the dating world when you say
cat I like categorize all my [ __ ]
dating like exploits and I like kept
them in chronological order so I can
just keep track of like my my progress
make sure I'm not doing any cyclical
patterns of just dating the same type of
idiot what type of way do you sell it
out this yes oh actually no I don't
think I have mmm I don't think I have
anymore
why would you delete that I didn't mean
to act and I'm just remembering now I I
could where can i think they wiped the
old hard drive so appreciate lost it
what am what kind of data did you keep
on people I'm curious so there's a
column for a username there's a column
for actual name there's a column for a
quick like tidbit on who they are like
something an identifying unique
identifying feature so I can just
quickly jog my memory like Oh covered in
tattoos a guy and the guy that looks
something like yeah sure and then I had
like a more in-depth description as to
like what the who they were their
personality what their relationship
entailed and then I have a confer might
and it and I would keep this in
chronological order so I can keep track
of like if there's any sort of trends to
you know just try to create a more
efficient dating experience did you try
to model like behavior or like we were
you trying to find like optimal behavior
for you like after like five or six or
seven dates were you like okay well I
should look for this or I should change
this yes I would like try to be like
okay I like this straight so look for
this but I don't like this Trey so don't
so make sure you avoid that well we were
an example can you give us two like
qualitative examples of that like what
was a trait that you looked for them
what was it true that you didn't like
well here's a here's a trait that I
liked it's not straight it was kind of
like a variable you know personality
traits sometimes not all the times but
it correlates pretty highly with it I
would typically date a lot of
programmers guys are involved with pure
science stuff and I've noticed that was
a really good type for me to date
because of whatever personality traits
did that lets you which a lot of times
and leads to like more analytical you
know rational less less um emotional
that's like I'm oh yeah less emotional I
don't like emotional guys I also just
really like the computer he thinks it's
just fun for me to like peek over and be
like what you doing see all the cool
[ __ ] they're doing I really admire that
um that's a lot I don't know it kind of
encompasses a lot of traits that I like
sure and so I was kind of like okay this
guy's a programmer that I like all but
[ __ ] to happen with that and so yeah
okay what's an example of a trait you
didn't like that you tried to avoid
other than what I just described you
know the opposite of that
she's emotional guess I'll think of like
I guess I'm one oh I go on in a date
with this artist I normally would never
but they went pretty well and so like I
asked him for follow-up real quick when
you say artist what do you mean by that
like an actual painting musician like
like a sculptor dude okay
like he was an artist and I really took
a walk and after we had drinks or
something and he was pointing out some
like local art thing and got all into it
I'm like oh that's cool oh he's
interested in art and we went back to
his apartment and we're looking at his
slides of all these like things like
sculptures he's made and [ __ ] like that
and then um like I left his apartment
went home like I'll have a good night
whatever and then I followed up with him
I'm like oh we should hang out again
sometime and then he gave me like a
basically broke up with me he's like
listen I would have to talk after one
day after one date about how like he
knows better than to be he's like I know
that I like you but I think that I know
this is gonna end badly excuse I was
like all right well this is like I know
it's a quite the generalization but it
seems like maybe the artist type I know
it's like a sample size of one but um
that was the whatever the [ __ ] happened
there doesn't seem like a really great
good thing I don't want the repeat that
[ __ ] damn did he say why oh god honestly
I could probably logon okay you're gonna
find the message again how do we know my
password okay how about you could do the
reset on your email oh my god
you know if they're of it doesn't make
you like reset that password you think
going to email and get it log in and
find out what he said you don't have to
have I like makes me uncomfortable
though it's all good no it doesn't make
you uncomfortable I just I don't know if
I'm like gonna go through all the [ __ ]
um because I have all my all my
passwords are just a random a string of
[ __ ] they use a password manager for us
I feel like type it in manually okay I
don't have it you use LastPass or key
pass I use one password wait that's the
name of the program or that's your
password
that's the name of the program [ __ ] I
don't know I've never heard of it I've
only heard to keep asking so
conveniently until one password well I
don't know I thought you might like you
very that's very complicated Jesus [ __ ]
anyways so whatever that was about I'm
trying to think of any other trades um
what's your how long is your longest
relationship lasted six years
damn yeah I know I was um I should have
ended it sooner if I was really smart
about it but I'm glad I don't really
regret anything in my life because every
experience I've gone through allow me to
really [ __ ] and learn a lesson like I
really learned a lesson from that one
interesting lessons from that one yeah
so I did for six years it's actually why
I'm in Seattle moved here too - he was
caught he got accepted to law school
here and so I moved out here with him
and I was with him throughout his law
school gosh a yes-no thing I don't like
what I remember one thing I didn't like
about guys I mean the artist thing which
is kind of vague um was just like
there's a lot of guys think is is a
quote unquote nice guy they think it's
nice but it's actually it's not being
nice I love nice people I don't want to
associate myself with mean people it's
just not a thing that I'm interested in
it's the spineless people that I [ __ ]
okay Mike I love you okay I could call
you a lot of names right now I I'm not
gonna call you mean names I genuinely I
genuinely just want to get inside your
head okay so help me help me understand
this okay sure
Mike do you really think that I think
that child Point is a good thing well I
was just looking at the stream
okay watched it you were talking about
how viewing child porn doesn't make like
some therapeutic for children I'm
paraphrasing horribly
I mean therapeutic for a child will had
to feel pedophiles that make them not
want to molest children or the help them
get over it
I botched what you said very terribly
but that was the gist I got didn't I
qualify that with a few other things
like didn't I say unlike what the
research would say like that would
determine how I would feel about that do
you really think that I would be okay
with just like passing out child porn to
everybody do you really think this Mike
no that's not that's not the question I
posed I posed that even giving it to
convicted paedophiles in the hopes of
helping them is still wrong and it
creates a hole I didn't say this in the
tweets because there's the character
limit but it creates a whole slew of
problems because it's just opening up a
can of worms okay Mike let me let me
pose a question to you okay let's say
that a researcher goes up to you and he
says hey we've done some studies and
what we found is that if we bring a
pedophile in and we're giving them
treatment via therapy to control their
urges if we make child pornography
available to them what we find is that
they have half the likelihood of abusing
a child would you tell that researcher
well okay if that's 100 percent what the
research says then you should
incorporate that as part of your
treatment or would you say no you still
shouldn't do that that's assuming yes
making some assertions sure yeah
and I can't answer that question of is
just an assumption ascetical because
it's a hypothetical I mean I could
answer it yeah well what would you have
to be I would have to see the research
okay let me saw the research and the
research agreed with the person would
you then be okay with it no I still
would not so you would say no I actually
want more children to get raped that
would be what you would say no I would
say that we need to have harsher
restrictions on okay it's already let
rape a child Mike what I would say is we
need to find ways to figure out who
these people are we we need to figure
out other ways of resolving the problem
other than just I'm not I'm not the
government I'm not the policymakers but
we need to have a better method than
giving them legal I shoud form because
then the problem exists that it's child
form reviewing a video of a child being
raped okay what that Internet's of
itself is a problem there that that that
that video of a child being raped exists
yeah of course but part of the
qualifications of this was that the
researcher would confront people who'd
already been through this with a child
porn was already made they wouldn't be
commissioning new child porn they would
just be using material that's already
out there so we wouldn't be making new
child porn we would be using stuff
that's already out there I don't
understand how you can think that this
is worse than more caving rope yeah of
course it doesn't necessarily mean that
kids aren't gonna be raped no but if the
guy could tell you that the likelihood
of this pedophile raping a child is
going to be 50% if we expose him to this
material that's already been made why
would you say no I would rather there be
a greater risk of more children being
raped than by doing this type of therapy
if if it did come down to the researcher
saying that I would say let's do
research to find other methods of this
so you would say no I
criminal so you would say no so you
would want more children to be raped
rather than to use previously existing
child porn well this is a hypothetical
situation so we can't say that more
children regrets is what the
hypothetical entails that more children
would be raped so would you be okay with
it so if you had to choose between it's
a very very narrow hypothetical yeah
sure because I'm trying to figure out
what your values are so if the
researcher says we could have them watch
Boldt child porn or we could increase
the likelihood that they go and rape
kids which one would you choose I would
say just give them the needle kill them
I don't believe pedophiles even does if
they're a convicted pedophile I don't
believe in their right to be free or
anything I would say either keep them in
prison or so we're not talking about a
child abuser we're talking about a
pedophile not somebody that's already
raped a child just somebody that has the
tendency towards being sexually aroused
by children now somebody that's actually
raped a child just just somebody that
has that attraction so would you say I
would say they need to get their [ __ ]
together or else they're gonna go to
prison or that would be your treatment
you would say researchers just tell
pedophiles to get their [ __ ] together
that's yours
yes that would I mean I'm not I'm not
the person to makes up all these
policies and stuff I'm just a guy who
does a nine-to-five job so I can't have
the responsibility thrust it onto my
shoulder figure out how to stop a
pedophile from raping a child all I can
say is why is rape a child no one is
talking about watching a pedophile
trying to rape a child even if this
research was true you would still
disagree with it but not but now you're
telling me you don't want that
responsibility I don't understand no
because this is a hypothetical research
okay let me get to my I actually have a
source that talks about it's a time calm
source times is okay there but I trust
this article because this article
you can't politicize this article and it
talks about okay how child pornography
despite the banning and production of
the despite man the production and
distribution of child pornography in
1999 Japan is the last organization and
blah blah blah basically it's saying I
don't want to read off the whole article
uh-huh but it's saying that okay here we
go
Japan is known as an international hub
for the production and trafficking of
child pornography according to a 2013
u.s. Department of State humans right
report in 2012 the police reported
investigations involving 1264 child
victims featured in pornography a 98
percent increase from the previous year
so Japan lets people view child
pornography now the child pornography
well this is saying that there is actual
child pornography but I do know that
Japan has a low age of statutory rape
and many in some areas but they do allow
Wiley porn which is basically an a
fictional child porn depictions of
children having sex and stuff and
according to this article there is an
uptick in child victims okay so that
would mean that having legalized shallow
porn would not resolve the issue for all
you don't know that that's not what this
article says yeah saying that right here
there is an an increase in child victims
a 98 percent increase but you don't know
if getting rid of child porn would cause
that increase to happen even faster you
don't have the counterfactual to that
you're just making well it doesn't
matter doesn't matter what happies them
it's like it's like saying if that's
like saying oh well we shouldn't
criticize terrorists because the
terrorists might want to attack us more
I mean you shouldn't have to worry about
criticizing terrorists we shouldn't have
to worry
about having child porn out there
because there's a very very very small
minority of sick people who want to
molest children we should we are a
modern society we should be able to find
ways to we either prevent them from
doing it or helping them if they desire
the help what if what if there was a
rehabilitation program for terrorists
were part of that rehabilitation was
shooting guns at posters of civilians
and we found that by doing that that
food therapy and through getting them to
not want to kill civilians anymore
that if we got them to shoot at some
posters the chances of actually going
out and shooting civilians would be
slightly would be incredibly decreased
who do you think I'd be okay or not okay
that's a hypothetical that's correct
yeah it is I don't like arguing
hypotheticals wiping this Center I have
to fall because the high it's kind of a
leading thing if a leading question you
know the purpose of a hypothetical
results it results and results in me
giving you the answer you like no don't
necessarily I'm just trying to figure
out what your values are that my irie
told you my values my math is right now
your values are your pro child rape if
it means less child porn that's so I'm
trying to ask hypothet
that's that's in your very narrow
hypothetic no that's in real world that
you're telling me that if a researcher
told you that making child porn
accessible to pedophiles decrease the
number of children being raped you would
be against that so you are for children
getting raped if it means less child
porn being consumed by panels how is
that not exactly what you're telling me
okay
first two things first mmm-hmm question
the situation you posed I'm repeating
discs at this moment but it's a
hypothetical so it has no basis in
reality he only has a basis in the
reality of this question so the second
so that we are a modern society I don't
know we are modern society it's to do
with anything means we are we are a
thousand we are thousands of years old
as humans and we shouldn't
we shouldn't handhold and pander to sick
criminals nor nay he's talking about
fetishes okay very sick there you go
little better well that that that
answers the question we shouldn't have
to pander to sick fetish people with
sick fetishes solely because it might in
a hypothetical world prevent them from
touching a child the facts should be you
shouldn't touch a child because if you
do it's already illegal to catch a child
you can't make it go exactly exactly
it's already illegal so the goal should
be to find out how to make people do it
less right because clearly just making
it illegal doesn't stop people from
doing it okay well you could you could
ask you could have that two different
ways there's two different ways to do
that I mean you could say how to make
them touch less children or be less
attracted to children or how to give
them a good enough deterrent
I think the deterrent method is a lot
better what did you oh I would say if
you got if if you got caught if you got
convicted of touching a child and it's I
mean stone-cold proof castration and I
believe that is a very good to turn I
believe after the first few crash
durations pedophiles are gonna be like
huh
I better not touch a child so what about
people who are gay who were castrated
you know a hundred years ago for being
gay did that stop all the people from
being gay or we didn't live a thousand
years ago a hundred years ago I'm sorry
there were people somewhat recently that
were chemically castrated for being
homosexual oh there's a really famous
science dude I can't remember the [ __ ]
was it that oh god he worked on code
computer [ __ ] enigma [ __ ] I think oh my
god who am i think i've fallen someone
will tell me Alan Turing yeah like
somewhat recently um this guy was
chemically castrated for I'm pretty sure
for being gay like this isn't thousands
of years ago and I didn't keep people
from being gay so why he's gay is is not
wrong
cuz you're not touching a child it's not
about whether it's right other I know
it's about whether or not we can make
people does not be something that they
are well it is that in a son it's not
can it be a person is okay okay no it
wasn't in depending on what you lived
being gay wasn't okay people would hate
you for it or condemn you for okay you
know what I mean is with our current
view of view of being gay it's okay to
be gay now and there is nothing there
but there back then there was they
believed it yeah and they tried to
chemically castrate people and it didn't
work well there's a lot more gay people
than there are pedophile any what's the
percentage of the population that are
pedophile
man I have no clue it's a while it's
very low percentage how many percent
okay if that doesn't matter cos being
gay is okay you you just said that there
are more gay people than pedophiles but
you don't know it oh yeah there's
definitely I don't need the numbers to
say that so that there's definitely more
gay we do though because when you say
more that's a comparison between two
numbers if you don't know what either
number is happiness or more if there's
more pedophiles than gay people in
America then we have a lot of problems
in this country okay
back to my original point when they told
gay people they would chemically
castrate them for being gay who didn't
make gay people stop being gay why do
you think so why do you think
threatening pedophiles with chemical
castration would make them stop being
pedophiles because you're equating two
different types of people no they're
just both side little attractions why
would yeah and one sexual attraction is
a hundred percent mad okay but that's
not this person is sexual gay people
aren't attracted to gay people because
it's okay like they think I know I know
that but I'm talking society views gay
people nowadays is being okay Society
does not view pedophiles as being okay
so we shouldn't pander
the pedophile and yes if they did
chemically castrate gay people back then
that's what society viewed
of course it in stop them then why would
it stop files it would be a good enough
deterrent because there's not I would
say that there's way less pedophiles and
there are okay people
all right well it's it's a crime let's
just take them right just let's just
take a minute and think about this for a
second okay
gay people have an attraction towards
other men right if you're gay in a man
right that's correct okay and that's
like an intrinsic thing they don't ask
society if it's okay that's just
something they personally are born with
right and it's definitely insurance if
you are a pedophile that's definitely
well let's do it we're not gonna jump
ahead yeah intrinsic too so gay people
have an intrinsic desire to be attracted
towards other men that's not given to
them by society right that's correct a
pedophiles have an intrinsic desire
towards children prepubescent children
that's not given to them by society
correct that's correct
okay so if threatening gay people with
chemical castration didn't get rid of
their intrinsic desires
why would threatening pedophiles with
castration get rid of their intrinsic
desires okay well there's another thing
here
chemically castrating gay people back
then stop working because we stopped
doing it now assuming so now you're
saying it did work it would have worked
if we kept doing it and we're much more
forceful about it nobody hate it's okay
we already had an uncle castration
though and there were still twice it out
of people but there were till still gay
people even when we did chemical
castration that's well being gay is a
lot more common whatever it doesn't
let's just focus on the kidding if you
went through high school do you realize
how many people you talk to that we're
gay like I could I could go talk to like
I could go message one of my random
friends that I've known for this is a
ram baby and you'd be like I'm gay this
is irrelevant it doesn't matter it's
irrelevant all I'm saying is that we
tried chemically castrating gay people
there were still plenty of gay people
who didn't get rid of them at all or
make them stop being gay because people
fought for them people fought for the
right to know it's not it's because they
were gay it's just who they were and yes
yeah there's and yeah you can just get
rid of me so they went on ahead no no
you keep saying it was okay to be gay
that we didn't agree on that gay people
are intrinsically game not because they
get permission from society to be gay
yeah I never said that well you just
said that they were gay because Society
said it was okay for them to be gay
well so yeah Society said it was okay
for them to be gay but they were
chemically Casper they were still gay or
to being open about there were still
gays when they were being chemically
castrated yeah exactly they were still
game on the beer in chemically castrate
so they're still gonna be nullified so
there's still gonna be pedophiles with
chemical castration yeah but it's going
to make people not want to go loss a
child when they go see that Jimbo who
touched a child got chemically castrated
and is in prison it's gonna be a
deterrent so even though that is files
already go to prison and get raped and
murdered that's not a deterrent but
chemical castration is not enough
returned I don't know I think we should
go farther in a chemical castration I
was thinking actual cutting off their
dick and balls do you think that's a
real human way to approach the the legal
system and that up there if they're
convicted pedophile I really don't care
do you think that people that steal
things should have their hands cut off
no because that's stealing things that's
different than touching a child are you
I notice that you've got Trump 2020 in
your profile are you auntie Sharia law I
am definitely not for sure okay because
what you're describing kind of sounds
like that you're talking about literally
chopping people's dicks off as
punishment for a crime do you think
maybe you might see what it is sure do
you think you might be a little Pro
Sharia law then if you're into that kind
of stuff
why not because I I disagree with a lot
of things which your law I mean just
because you have similarities as I mean
it's the same thing yeah but this idea
of retribution of cutting somebody's
dick off Alliance far more closely with
a fundamentalist like Muslims person's
view of the law than like the United
States legal system you could you could
have a couple right ideas and not
believe with the general it's not about
right ideas in the United States we have
laws against cruel and unusual
punishment castration or cutting
somebody's dick off would easily fall
under that so it sounds the average of
the US legal system
I'm just curious then if you
moral pariah that I'm not like some
person in a powerful position
I'm not somehow I'm not a politician I'm
not some person that I'm saying you
should look up to that's just my opinion
my opinion is we should cut off the
I'm gonna take a quick break because
I've always wanted the chance to talk to
this dude oh my god I'm just I'm I'm so
excited right now
[ __ ] I'm gonna set this like god damn
[ __ ] barge [ __ ] goddamn stream
player all right that's what's gonna
happen we're not gonna do any more this
weird [ __ ] all right I'll see you in a
bit Craig wait what's going on wait is
crappy leaving Craig yeah we just
settled our shitty I'm trying to get it
through his head that I'm not gay and he
won't believe me so it's just like okay
wait hold on cuz I can't tell what's the
toilet at Craig you understand that what
you do is like insanely [ __ ] creepy
right that you have like a mental
disorder that you need to get like
therapy they're like what you do is like
totally not cool to debates you think I
send pictures of myself masturbating on
a pic on till like videos at people and
[ __ ] you think I'd do that great it's
incredibly unfair that you told him to I
mean you said free letters to him over
Twitter did you not then I said what I
mean you literally told him to end his
life over Twitter yeah I might oh that's
how I'd overkill ourselves but I mean
like that's rude don't tell anybody I
just seems like really creepy - okay
well then wait weather-wise everybody in
this call is [ __ ] [ __ ] like this
guy listen let me speak Craig suffers
from Asperger's and you suffer from old
man short nice that is really good job
thank you make it like recording videos
of yourself like [ __ ] shouting under
people's pictures and then posting it
online while like pretending that you're
engaged is some sort of like
long-distance relationship when I was
like really [ __ ] right I I just think
it's really weird that like everybody
enables his favor I don't really [ __ ]
creepy - he's like a guy were to do this
to any girl streamer like everybody
would be talking about how disgusting it
is what I go since much is a guy it's
okay I don't know I just always like
starts with Landon
what's wrong with it Mitch doesn't have
any interest in being your boyfriend no
Mitch wanted the video did he really
yes he did yeah not gonna enable you
guys to make people believe that I told
this guy to masturbate somebody posed as
me it was probably somebody posed as me
could have been someone be honest to you
I have literally like I never spoke to
you in my goddamn life okay the only
time I talked to you was at PAX East and
the time that I messaged you to tell you
to relax and you still didn't relax okay
so that is that that's where we're at
also can we Claire can we clarify for a
second this has nothing to do with
having Asperger's I know plenty of
people with ASD that would never go to
the links that vampire has gone to to
sexually harass Mitch so it's really
insulting that you would say well I
guess it's all just a big name I never
meant carry on I guess like jerking off
and then posting on you to me it's
become um it's become so like I'm like
I'm not okay with it but I can't I can't
do anything about it like put to be
serious like you should tell people not
to joke about it like because this
vampire dude obviously has like a mental
disability and like he's gonna feel like
he's being empowered by people like
Greek laughing at like it's just really
[ __ ] crazy theater like Mitch this is
the type of guy that walks up behind you
in an event Pat's you on the back and
walks away and then you realize that he
left like a massive water [ __ ] [ __ ] in
your hair is something like it's that
disgusting just by tiredness it eru if
you don't mind me asking I'm Irish and
Italian Italian so base that's basically
like being a minority so he's not you
understand just as you said use yourself
he is not privileged so you have to be
understanding that he's in a really
rough place and that you don't know it
that's like to be in that rough place as
a cyst white male wow that's not some
real [ __ ] some real [ __ ]
wait you have a stream on in the
background - holy [ __ ] that's me if he
made a video of coming to you what would
you do well I would call him a wreath
out of a block come on every platform
and I would never encourage it okay well
well baffi still does it then well you
ignore it report it I don't know then
move on
I sure smoke wouldn't be dragging him
into discs or to have conversations with
him so people like you could empower the
behavior the only thing is like all the
people around me if you messages them
and they replied to him content I said
this dream is destiny and then like
somebody said oh Ram like Craig's near I
wanted to get Craig in here to tell him
that he knows I don't want to be his boy
ok so maybe this is where like this is
where you would get like somebody like I
I would hope from what I've seen if them
train wrecks would like have your back
here you'd need like an actual friend to
have your back not somebody that's
trying to like get and like make fun of
like destiny he knows what is right and
what is wrong to jerk off to you just
like when you talked about pragmatic CP
if it's pragmatic it's fine Mitch I
think you need to find all the way into
the brain and check in a second I just
want to focus on the vampire shots at me
wait a second
well no it's kind of its kind of shitty
like what you're doing you don't think
so okay all right yeah Craig you need to
get you need to go I'm just being
serious Greek like really dude like
don't you think that's like really need
to stop stopping mate to the match is
kind of weird I'll be on it and like
recording videos and putting it online
and I'm like constantly harassing
Brittany I know you're losing subs but
please for like two seconds just shut
the [ __ ] up yeah it's also kind of like
weird because oh you're not relevant
afraid you're pulling a keen started
saying relevancy but you had that guy on
talking about CP and I'd even know who
he was I had a Google hem so it's
clearly not that you're petty
okay she done so Greek like this guy was
literally throwing messages to Mitch
like when Mitch was like dealing with
like all the mirrors [ __ ] and everything
too
I'm pretty sure this guy's message mirus
well although I'm not entirely sure but
he's like contributed to a lot of the
really toxic [ __ ] that's going on in
Mitch's subreddit to like making those
huge pokes about how evil mirror isn't
[ __ ] like this guy's into it just as
much as anybody else
dude I read the posts that you were
making on reddit don't sit here and lie
to me and tell me that you didn't make
them you've made very detailed posts
about how Mira was evil for Mitch and a
bad influence because he just wants to
be with you and like crazy stupid [ __ ]
like oh listen Craig you need to stop
you need to stop faffing to Mitch well
it's not too Mitch we can't record it
anymore I haven't recorded any more I
only filmed you've already got a side
chick what's going on we should talk to
Brian already knows you're my boyfriend
too he actually drove me to the police
station when we were dealing with what
the [ __ ] happened oh Jesus how far has
this gone like this needs to stop yeah
yeah don't worry we dealt with the
police my best friend anymore
[ __ ] yeah I mean there's a very fine
line between where we lived and started
sending me stuff all because I'm your
boyfriend right listen Craig you are not
his boyfriend stop saying that okay
you're his partner
I literally don't even know how to
handle this everyone enables this [ __ ]
and I just I don't know what to do
anymore like I just like I don't know
look I don't mind being her friend dude
but like this needs to you this Ellen
it's getting weird understanding we're
just now getting weird when he was
dropping loads on picture poin that
wasn't weird try I tried to [ __ ] just
ignore it though and like that's the
last year's birthday present for him
going on for over a year like this is
ridiculous dude like you need to go find
some other dude to be [ __ ] you know
boyfriend's with and then we'll be
[ __ ] dude like not like a person
that's like an [ __ ] like I'm not I'm
not mean like I don't have the ball
tired I didn't say no I said yeah like
listen like yeah sorry [ __ ] stroke in
my own dick there's no what's happening
but I mean if you want to stroke my dick
go ahead Greek but anyway listen um
Oracle II my ego dude we're not talking
about physical penises here okay listen
like I just need to understand that I'm
not gay and we're not gonna be together
and how are are you from a chance I
forget I don't remember who how you guys
are all [ __ ] I am chant I am friends
with did you see how he handled his like
stalker thing like the one dude did you
ever hear about Craig he's not a stalker
he's just like some he's on that level
no he's like on that level
I don't think you realize how [ __ ]
weird his behavior is like the guy's
problem
snitch just let him wait night you
thought I'm doing listen it's not about
okay like I agree I agree that it's it's
not stalkers they're like he's not gonna
like I don't think he's harmful to my
uuly are you here are you doing are you
dating Mary I remember back when you
were dating Mayer how would you feel if
there was a guy while you were dating
that was like sending her videos and
should have saying that she was it was
her boyfriend and that he was like
people saying that he wants to babysit
was a girl then it would be [ __ ] hot
dude you really wouldn't care even if it
was a girl what if mirror was bisexual
you wouldn't care if there was some girl
like some weird hippie girl yes it would
be weird I'd be like the [ __ ] is that
and but the thing is you have to
understand this thing I've tried told
Craig himself I said hey man could you
stop doing this [ __ ] didn't stop so I
don't know even then I feel it so then
at that point you block them from
everything and then you just don't talk
about them or like
serious conversations have serious
conversations with your friends like
behind the scenes like talk to Greek and
tell them I almost all of my friends to
not respond and they always do like
that's the thing I guess but like I'm in
here in this room now and there's like
five people like laughing at him and
like encouraging him like this guy's got
enough fuel to run for like another two
I agree I think they got to be like his
feelings get hurt or some [ __ ] I mean I
guess not what I'm looking for no but
his feelings aren't your responsibility
dude like he's the composer Mitch is a
very caring person regardless of what I
might think like it that's why I'm noe
what you are enabling and like I John
slow I is coming I just don't want to
hurt his feelings man that's it like I
know you don't know it's not your
responsibility to care about his
feelings if somebody's imposing on you
stalking you harassing you you don't
worry about their feelings that's not
your job that's your job does that make
sense like if somebody were to walk up
to me let's say somebody walks up to me
at a bar and slaps her ass and he's like
yo like let's go home and [ __ ] like it
Mira's like well I don't want to and
you're like dude would you tell Mira
like that's really mean like when you
reject that dude like that like you
might like heard of self-esteem would
you say that like of course not right if
he's the one that's initiating and
harassing sexually assaulting someone
else you heard it here first folks no
that's why it's called a comparison
Brittany you compare two things that
aren't the exact same comparison issue
maybe next year in school you'll get to
that what did you say snipe tweets and
[ __ ] on Twitter because she's losing
[ __ ] like twitch really with you she
like tries desperately to like hang on
here you invite me on for a debate and
then I tell you because you invite me on
took message my manager which is not
angry why do you have a manager you have
like 300 viewers you don't leverage any
sponsors you don't have any way then you
know the rules are not speaking over
someone yes someone but you're no one
like you're literally nobody why the
[ __ ] would I contact the manager to go
through you Britney Britney I'm not
gonna contact the manager to talk to a
dying streamer like Britney that wasn't
my manager that was a 19 year old kid
that I play games with we were making
fun of you guys the same [ __ ] time
your manager and then what happens
destiny I'm sure you could tell us you
told them that
oh I'm not relevant enough because
that's clearly why destiny that's why
you've had people that have less there
are less known than me and have less
followers than me on your stream Britney
I'll talk to anybody who wants to chat
but I don't schedule a meeting out a
week in advance with somebody that means
it was a week in advance it was like a
day or two it no they asked so debate
you an 11 a.m. not everyone wakes up for
a hard-on to debate with people have a
massive hard-on for me because you'll
sit here and say I don't want to talk to
you and then you'll tweet about me for
like 12 hours dude are you serious I
tweet all the time but I'll also talk to
people all the time too you see the
difference there is no difference
parties you tweeted I tweeted except I
didn't block you to create an echo
chamber you block everyone like your
became the new keemstar Tioga you block
so many people to make it look like
everyone likes you in the replies and
it's [ __ ] crazy that you claim the
via centrist it is [ __ ] insert I
don't claim to be a centrist that's
hilarious secondly I'm pretty sure I
engage with more like opposition and
literally everybody else on YouTube and
twitch right now which is so it's kind
of fun of you
ah position your [ __ ] social justice
warrior destiny if everybody was my
opposition then how can I be an sjw
wouldn't the sjw's be my Ally then do
you know what opposition means yes calm
the sign of Destiny I know what
opposition okay try to think through
your sentences okay I know it's a little
bit hard listen before we get into this
whole Brittany just anything can we just
end the Craig thing and just say that I
just want to not be an [ __ ] in just
by Craig like I need you to just relax
that's it that's all I'm not a message
anymore telling you don't want you don't
want to see him ever again ever in your
Twitter mentions on your subreddit or in
your twitch chat on the [ __ ] off forever
say image please don't [ __ ] message
me anymore please thank you that's it
that's all I've said like that's yeah I
don't want to be mean about it like at
all cuz like I think they have work good
job I don't I just want to be an [ __ ]
but you know we can talk about it off
stream if you want Craig I don't care
but it's like I just want to like be
like I think it's okay you agree can you
just chill for a sec please
okay listen like I just wanna check
where I'm at I feel bad yes I don't feel
bad
he's the harasser hey deal bet oh my god
dude he just sent me a message and said
I'm really sorry for disturbing and I'm
crying now well good that's good tell
him to cry it out all my [ __ ] off good
job I'm proud of you did I feel bad I
don't want to be I try to I try to be
like I try to be real with him I'm like
dude I'm not gay and he's like yes or
you are Gayle and I'm like no I'm not
and he's I guess you are and it's just
like I just can't win I can't wait I'm
trying to be nice and be like look I'll
even be friends with the guy just so he
doesn't feel bad understand like but no
no it's not like that's part of how like
emotional abuse and emotional
manipulation works right people get you
to feel bad so that you'll do things you
wouldn't otherwise want to do because if
the guy wasn't making you feel bad you
would never be his friend you would
never entertain these conversations
right the only reason you do is because
he's trying to emotionally manipulate
you to feel otherwise just ignore it you
just tell him to [ __ ] off could come
down the road and let him do whatever
the [ __ ]
stalkers do Craig's
Kirika groceries I just don't want him
to feel I don't want I don't want him to
feel bad I understand like so it doesn't
matter like you should talk to
trainwrecks about this kind of screaming
at you okay because this is like it's
like a non-negotiable like you can't you
can't entertain people like this like
it's so unhealthy for you dude yeah you
can't entertain people like this that's
why he has how many viewers let's see
10,000 yeah definitely not Britney what
do you think entertainment in that
context you want Willis to the
dictionary game today destiny all you've
been doing is acting like a feminist all
stream trying to save textbook
definitions pulling up [ __ ]
dictionaries if I'm the feminist in here
then why is most of I been critiqued by
named are the only [ __ ] in the call
come on dude chill the [ __ ] dude this is
gonna take five this conversation is
getting way out of hand

microphones really low I have you up on
maximum and I barely heard you it's

I follow you I thought you said I black
sure now wait wait do I follow you
I block you Britney which one is it how
many stories you got spinning around in
that heavy block me and then you unlock
me and then you block me again I don't
know what's your story
this is some crazy story this is a
pretty crazy [ __ ] I did I've got a lot
of different stories going on in here a
lot of different stories yes I'm lying
right just like I lied about the I'm can
we take a break wait real talk
real talk can we take a break for you I
really I really want to take a break you
sound like you're about to cry Britney
you sound like you're about to cry can
we take a break can we take a break
honey you sound like you're about to cry
I want you to be unlike the virgin tears
for this conversation okay I think you
need to take a break because you have a
very small gauge you get angry berry
juice would you say that I'm
short-tempered
haha you got any more in there yeah I do
hello I can hear me I could hear you
what do you well buddy I don't know
people just called me and they said that
we should have somewhat of a debate if
you're interested yeah okay how do you
think we're gonna get the communism in
society today my dude well I mean it's
not really the best question to be
asking okay what's the best question to
be asking well from what I was hearing
of you you seem to kind of have the idea
that most communists and socialists and
anarchists are primarily interested in
kind of sitting around talking about
utopia's you know the old stereotype
with the the first year philosophy
student you know taking a drag on his
joint and thinking about how perfect the
future will be I don't really think
that's that's accurate and I don't think
that most socialists you know especially
not just teenage meme lords on the
internet but you know people out there
with the essay or really organizing I
don't think that's what they're focused
on okay what do we focused on
well obviously views different and the
left and socialism is pretty
multifaceted there's a lot of different
branches but I would say most of those
branches have something of an ideal
which they would like to move towards
which is generally workers owning or
controlling the means reduction and some
meaningful sense and they have different
ideas that get there but a lot of those
things are they also have they pay
dividends in the very short term so for
example if you're a union organizer you
do have some sort of a long term ideal
right mm-hm but in the short term it
actually helps workers if they're more
organized to have more workers rights
maybe they have better wages and
benefits and things like that
okay so you know just to say that okay
if you're you know a union organizer you
don't actually care about the short term
and you just really want to think about
your communist utopia where wages don't
even exist so why would you care about
the short term where you do have a wage
yeah I think that's a little inaccurate
and I do think you know if you're you
can organizer you may very well be a
communist or a socialist but you're also
concerned about real benefits in the
short term
Mido unions imply communism or socialism
well they don't necessarily I you you
can certainly have you know as well that
I did in Seneca Yeah right like the
afl-cio right traditionally in the 50s
they were very liberal in fact they were
very anti-communist they ratted out a
lot of communist leaders in their
organization they worked very closely
with the American government they're a
big part of you know the whole McCarthy
scare era mm-hmm
but generally today especially a lot of
the more the scrappier unions they tend
to be led still buy a lot of socialists
and they are looking for a better future
then again that's just one example I
just want to say you know like a lot of
the people doing real-world work who do
consider themselves socialists their
focus for the long term and the short
term and they think that by moving
towards their ideal right like basically
you know if you have an ideal Society
it's like you know how Christians no one
no one who believes in Jesus and the
more his moral teachings and things like
that and for the record I'm not a
Christian but if you were a Christian I
don't think that you think you can
personally reach that moral example of
Jesus like you can't be Jesus but it's
still a good moral ideal to have around
right you think those teachings are a
good idea even if you can't personally
live up to them mm-hm I think that's
that's a good way to see a lot of
socialists communists anarchists and
things like that it's that we don't
think that necessarily we're gonna have
our utopia in our lifetime or maybe even
anyone's lifetime but if we try to move
closer to that ideal it'll be better for
everyone and particularly the working
class does that make any sense to you
yeah I'm just curious what specific
things you have in mine hmm
you mean under capitalism or like whoa
like how would we move closer to so the
reason why these I these are the reason
why these discussions or I avoid them
and they're always really boring three
is because I'm not really interested in
talking about how communism or socialism
works under like a communist or
socialist utopia so what like what
policy moves are
decisions do you want it like when you
talk about like workers owning the means
of production like what's to keep a
bunch of people from collectively
pulling their money right now in
purchasing capital and then splitting it
amongst all workers doing like either
employee owned program or like a stock
share I'm sure something like what's to
keep that from happening right now I
don't people just do it now okay so
that's good because I I tend to think
utopia's are kind of boring to talk
about too right I don't know if you ever
read Thomas Moore but that's that that
book kind of drags yeah so I think it's
not impossible to have coops and I
wouldn't say that you know a society
made of coops would necessarily be
communist there's disagreement there's
actually a school of thought called
mutualism past that stemmed from a guy
written writing in the early 1800
saint-pierre Joseph Pradhan who
basically yeah his idea of socialism was
everyone is in a co-op and there's some
sort of public banking system and the
co-ops compete and that socialism right
or market socialism is another form of
that but yeah how would I you know
supposing I didn't want markets or
currency I wanted the you know the
communism of Karl Marx or something how
would I start going about that and why
why don't workers just all produce coops
now well I think one argument that I
don't really want to spend a lot of time
on is cultural and that people not only
people just not think about it it's just
not accepted and some you know
especially in America here where we have
this sort of you know robbery capitalism
the idea of workers banding together to
buy out their own business is frowned
upon I would say increasingly less so
are you familiar with Richard Wolffe
nope okay he's an economist he has a
very popular podcast and he has a sort
of think tank called democracy at work
his podcast his economic update in case
anyone's wondering and he basically
every week he kind of will highlight a
new example of a co-op being formed and
things like that so it's definitely more
common I would say and people don't have
this idea that it's like the Soviet
Union if the workers get together and
buy out their own business so but still
I think they're still
some sort of stigma more important
arguments is that legally the laws
aren't really set up to have coops
think again they are increasingly but
they're still you know it because it's
such an uncommon sort of organizational
form of the firm as opposed to joint
stock corporation or something like that
or partnership not every state really
has the rules in place and I think the
biggest difficulty is that you know
businesses are expensive and if you are
a relatively low paid worker even if
there's twenty of you you might not be
able to pool the money or to get credit
to buy a business does that make sense
to you
yeah so how does that change without
changing like the whole government
structure so while it's not impossible I
think that we if if we're looking in
this direction okay we want people to
say get more coops this sort of an early
stage of socialism or to move in that
direction I I do think we're seeing you
know movements in that direction again
legally organizationally maybe people
will start making sort of you know
workers banks or things like that
there's all sorts of interesting ideas
where does a Harker's Bank it would you
know like a bank well like it's sort of
like another cooperative right well I
mean we already have credit unions but
imagine a credit union that was focused
on providing credit only to cooperatives
right instead of homework could just or
something like that it would be like a
business a cooperative business shares
so forgive me for the viewing this under
my capitalist paradigm but if coops
could successfully thrive and make money
why wouldn't normal banks lend these
people money in part because they might
view them as a threat and they do right
like the coops I do get credit often do
get them from normal banks why would
banks to view coops as a threat in a
wider sort of systemic level I I think
wait I don't I just like an SBA loan or
something no no III don't want to say
like the PERT the bank managers these
guys are gonna turn us into communists
yeah yeah
don't think it's like that like he's the
coop guy a guy in charge of you know
asking for a loan in behalf of the
workers comes in he just pictures in
like a cartoon with a Soviet hat or
something like oh it's a gremlin from
the Kremlin no it's not like that but
but I think and again these arguments
can get really complicated because it's
not just like the individual bank
managers decision but it's how does
capital move around and society what are
the legal structures associated with
these kinds of loans and things like
that and and also ESD not just personal
prejudice but if you are not used to
loaning to a cooperative you've never
even heard of it before where the
workers all jointly manage and own
something and distribute the profits or
whatever at the end of the day well even
in your system it wouldn't be all the
workers it would be an elected board by
the workers that would manage it right
sure depending on depending on the size
I mean again I don't want to get back
into the details of cooperatives and I I
know I haven't worked in a cooperative
myself I I think it's not just
representative democracy in that sense
though I mean I think the whole idea
about cooperatives and you know I'd use
a libertarian socialism stuff like that
is that decisions are made
democratically at the relevant level
right so even in the co-operative it's
not just like you know you can have
co-ops where there's just an ownership
stake but you have the normal firm
structure right you have your CEO you
have your upper management and things
like that technically every employee has
a share and the work sorry in the the
coop but they don't actually get to make
the management decisions and there's
other forms of coops where that's that's
not sure where actually that all the
workers get some sort of state say more
or less directly at relevant decisions
well yeah I think a banker would just
say you know I'm not used to this maybe
it's a bigger risk I think that happens
and on another level
there has been statistics and I'll try
to pull that up for you I just headed up
the other day it was a nice yeah it's a
co-op report by Virginia pay routine
what do we really know about workers
cooperatives and they basically find
that in some traditional methods that a
capitalist might judge the importance
and usefulness of firms maybe coops are
a little bit different but they're
successful in their own right worker
coops survive at least as long as other
businesses and have more stable
employment they tend to be more
productive than conventional businesses
I mean the average productivity per
worker seems to be higher they retain a
larger share their profits and other
business models and executive and
non-executive pay differentials are much
narrower and worker coops in other firms
you know I understand all of this but I
feel like I could describe and this
could exist and already does exist under
like a capitalist framework so like to
set something like this up on a somewhat
capitalist level I would basically
create I would create an employee owned
business where every employee is vested
in the company to some extent or part of
the pay involves some sort of divulging
of like stocks or whatever right like to
get a decision yeah and I mean even
decision making could be implemented on
the managerial level this wouldn't
require communism I socials and it do it
like such that like yeah I don't know if
that would necessarily be a good idea
for all types of businesses I guess I
would have to think of like specific
examples like I don't think I would want
like if I owned a car factory I don't
think I would want to take a vote on
what kind of cars we build next I think
that I'd leave that up to the guys in
like marketing and market research well
well you can it's not like cooperatives
or socialist ideas means you can't
recognize expertise right I mean it's
like if you have some sort of a business
that requires I don't know some sort of
expert scientific input right for one
experts do disagree so it doesn't mean
like the expert says something that's
the final say in the matter
and currently existing capitalist firms
you know with the top you know very
top-down experts disagree but like if
there is a room full of like eight like
high-level political nuclear physicists
scientists and everything that we're
having a discussion on who to nuke and
there was some disagreements in that
room I wouldn't want to leave it up to
like a popular vote after that like I no
no no I think consensus you know well
what I'm saying is I think people should
still have because experts aren't always
right I think people should still at
least have the ability to
you know agree to accept their
recommendations and no I don't think if
we're talking about a nuclear war I mean
this is Banzai use an extreme example
but like anything like siding like on
how to move a company forward I mean
like new yes to the average person but
the average person is a [ __ ] [ __ ] I
wouldn't want my job to be held captive
to the voice of like well how somebody
wants to move a business forward well
we'll say you know they bring in an
expert and this cooperative firm says
okay here's our expert is this you know
this idea and then the workforce can say
well yeah we'll accept their advice or
say no will look for another expert
maybe get a second opinion right I mean
the same way that you know if you go to
a doctor your doctor people do get
second opinions right the doctor is the
expert and it's very unlikely the
patient knows better but so they do have
a choice we don't force them to accept
the doctor's recommendation I think
that's generally what socialism is all
about it's democracy not just in the
public sphere like we have now where we
vote for politicians and things like
that but also democracy and it's very
large amount of time we spend per day
which is at a workplace and we would get
to make decisions there and that would
include accepting or you know asking for
a second opinion from experts that give
advice because clearly yeah every worker
you know if you're at a you're at the
assembly line I mean that's your one job
you don't know necessarily a bit
marketing or something like that but you
should still have a say right I don't I
mean maybe I'm not sure I guess I'm the
thing that I'm having a big trouble are
having big trouble with is it seems like
you could do all of this right now under
a capitalist system like you can make
good and and like I said increasingly
people are and we've did studies that
you know cooperatives are more
productive and employments
longer-lasting but they also earn is
aggressive right and I think that's one
big reason that they tend not to expand
with a few exceptions I think there is
Mondragon corporation in Spain which has
its own problems with its an extremely
large co-op with like a hundreds of
thousands of workers mm-hmm and there's
a few examples like that in the world
but most of them are pretty small and I
think what they do when they do form if
the workers can get the capital together
and get the loan and things like that
they tend to focus on what's good for
the workers which may not necessarily be
the same
business plan is aggressively expanding
right because that tends to require you
know lowering the wages and cost as much
as possible making decisions based on
you know just as cutthroat as possible
as opposed to what the community might
need if most firms you know if they were
in a community and it might double their
profits to say pollute and just like
destroy the local water supply and then
move on I mean a lot of the management
will think really hard before saying no
or maybe they'll just try to cover it up
and do it anyway whereas a worker owned
firm and worker controlled firm and why
would they do that right they have to
live there they're not going to move
away they wouldn't destroy their own
water supply so things like this can
make them less competitive in terms of
you know the the wall street movie sense
Gordon Gekko that makes them much less
like that but much more successful in
terms of stable employment good-paying
jobs things like that sure I don't know
if I necessarily buy that example that
assumes that all the pollution damage
being done by a company is being done by
workers who are directly suffering that
it's possible to pollute in a way that
affects other people for instance
dumping into a river that flows
downstream to affect people that don't
work for that company right that's true
and I I mean you can also make these
sort of tragedy Commons arguments for
everything I think at least that is
saying that I don't think that like
because you're the implication there was
that this sort of co-op system solves
externalities of some types and I don't
think that's enough no it reduces them I
would say it would reduces them I
wouldn't say they would be eliminated
right I mean you could you could have a
bunch of people right and they could say
well the hell with that city downstream
we'll just yeah I guess it's just like
it seems like these same pressures could
also exist in a market system to like
look how many people are selecting
restaurants based on how much they
adhere to responsible farming practices
and going green and all that like these
are markets elections that have been
made into a capitalist system as well
all right well I think information
asymmetries come into play there in a
big way
yeah but that even so many society
socialism or capitalism right they do
and the again it's like how you respond
to these problems right Oh tragedy
Commons arguments information asymmetry
arguments do different structures of
economic production respond to those
problems differently and I think they do
I think no system is per
like no system would ever reduce them
and you know and because you find this
uninteresting I mean I've mostly talked
just a bit coops which can exist
perfectly under capitalism I mean this
guy this professor I talked about
Richard Wolff his whole argument is let
the different ideas of production
compete you know within capitalism have
a top-down CEO management structure and
a worker-owned structure competing to
see what people like best right and in
me exactly I mean we're not we're not
even talking about like what a socialist
society how they would ill handle these
okay whoa are you excited yeah I'm
pretty stoked actually another it's
working I am super excited because you
were saying a lot of really mean things
about me on Twitter okay really means
even meaner than the average Quebec in I
knew you're gonna say that did you in
your might ignore mine I think I will
just roll a d20 what's perceivable in a
way that you're pro pedophilia or you
probably ignore that I said or if you
have a bias against the skeptics and
said they didn't have an argument before
listening to the whole stream you could
just admit that wait what
can you say that again I'm sorry I can
go find a tweet I said to me you saying
that no argument was made when a lot of
good ones were made Tomita implied that
or you're unconvinced able or you didn't
actually listen to the arguments before
you said there was no argument good
arguments I was made oh so I listened to
um I went back and I we listened to
because I talked to that Jeff guy quite
a bit I went back and I relisted to the
Jeff video and at the beginning of that
video for the first like five or ten
minutes he makes some pretty good
arguments when I'd listened to it before
I was linked like halfway through I
listen to two different like twenty
minute sections that were really dumb so
I thought that the whole thing was like
about that but I went back a tree listen
to the start and I thought that
everything he said at the beginning was
pretty good I said as much on Twitter I
think I said to Jeff that he was pretty
good at the beginning but exactly that's
the thing I I didn't see the follow-up
oh well I'm sorry you didn't see it well
that's why I said if you if you just
didn't watch it and then like I said
that but your mob was already spamming
me so I don't even know if you saw it oh
I might have I think I bought you it
pretty quickly though because you were
talking a lot of [ __ ] but I'm not sure
if I so hot or not but I think there's
more than that right it seems like it
seems like we had a whole lot of
disagreements about a lot of things no
well I'd like to I'd like to know what
do you think I believe first of all I
have no idea I want to know you think I
believe my son it looks like you threw
around a lot of I feel like we got a lot
of those that skeptic stuff going on in
your tweets but I'm not sure I'd have to
go back and look
exactly because I'm I'm a centrist
that's [ __ ] like I'm very Pro up a
equality of opportunity that's that's
kind of why I like I find it like harsh
the way you you know try to point paint
it out like Christians are like gonna
destroy the world and they're trying to
kill all the babies and gays and [ __ ]
oh no well I think Christians in the
United States are pretty [ __ ]
disgusting I mean we can talk about
Christian policy in the United States if
you want if they focus on yeah yeah
that's what we decided on oh sure okay
well how do you feel a person and is
Christianity and Islam like basically
yeah sure so how do you feel about
Christians in the United States trying
to prevent like sex education or access
to contraception to teens when the
empirical data has pretty much proven
that these things like improve outcomes
for teens as far as like teenage
pregnancy and stuff goes that's a big
claim you're making there what kind of
sources do you have to prove that that's
happening wait to prove that which one
is happening I'm sorry my real thing is
what if I ever say something and you'd
like disagree with it you could just
stop me immediately and we can go over a
particular thing okay I'm not trying to
like like okay if you can walk around
it's my debate over I'm trying my best
yeah that's fine no it's just a child
it's not like a like a super debate okay
yeah okay well because I agree with
young a lot of things it's just I it's
more sort of tactics that you use warm
you can cost instead of it well I want
to I want to get as close to the truth
at all cost but we can talk about
tactics later um so my initial statement
was that I think that Christians
advocate against like sex ed and whatnot
in the United States and the sex ed
seems to help students like access to
contraception and all that does what
which part of that did you disagree with
I believe that like first of all you're
saying Christians are trying to stop
that huh to me I I would uh I would
point out that it's probably more the
older Christians that are trying to do
that like a baby boomers sure because
like I have actually the statistics here
where is it
yeah like most of the the Christians are
[ __ ] boomers I think it was like a
30-something percent where did I write
it down sorry this is really messy here
yeah you do you realize though like that
basically the the younger Christians
aren't the same as the older Christians
right yeah probably imagine that age
probably plays a decent role into that
because like I went to check her the Pew
researches and most of like was it the
54% say that homosexuality should be
accepted 54 yeah 38 states should be
discouraged 44 are pro same-sex marriage
48 are against forty five percent are
pro legal abortions 51 percent want it
to be illegal in most cases so so to me
you're making it sound like all
Christians want to stop sex ed and
things like that and me the way I see it
is I think you're talking about more the
older ones sure but there are two things
going here one I'm just curious do you
have the poll numbers for the standard
population or for the non-christian
population so like if you say for
instance so like those numbers that you
just gave me if fifty five percent are
okay with gay marriage but the general
population or maybe non-christians are
like eighty percent okay for it then
those numbers are really bad but if
those are only like two percent off then
that's not a big deal I'm just curious
spotlights or anything but go ahead well
because what I'm trying to where I'm
trying to go with that is a the baby
boomers are gonna be dead soon sure so
basically it's gonna be young Christians
only so they've been raised having great
gay friends they've been raised having
trans people on TV and things like that
so they're they're gonna be more
accepted and used to these things than
their predecessors and so on and so
forth because their religion as is is
acceptant and it's moving in a accepting
way you know well compare I mean
not really accepting of gay people right
by religious doctrine I mean like you
you're like I don't know 54% say like
that this should be accepted that
there's homosexuals and like only 10%
think that they shouldn't get married so
I don't know well sure but like what's
but what's like the standard population
no no but we're talking about Christians
right right now you're trying to say
that all Christians are against
homosexuality it had to be a good crit
you're trying to say that being against
homosexuality is tied with christianism
but it's not so much anymore okay so who
firstly Christian you don't have to be
against gays okay we had a lot of
different claims in here okay
let's take one second okay so firstly I
never said that all gays or all
Christians were against gays I've never
said that right because you're making it
sound like it's a Christian problem yeah
well because I think that the majority
of the backlash against gays in society
generally comes from Christians so
speaking of that okay what backlash are
you talking about like trying to not let
gay people get married or being opposed
to gay marriage that's it well that's a
pretty big one I mean well I mean
compared to two other religions that say
that they need to or change their sex
and things like that so like I mean well
I'm really by Christian doctrine you
don't want gay people to be gay but I
mean I mean in the United States the way
that I would measure your acceptance of
gays or homosexuality would be whether
or not you were four against gay
marriage I think that's a pretty fair
test well well I just showed to you that
like there's a difference of 10 percent
people Christians that believe like like
54 say you should accept them 44 say
they're pro-marriage
yeah so that I'm inclined to say that
marriage is not necessarily a good way
to look at if they're there accept them
or not
okay so let's say that we have a
population of people okay let's say that
in that population let's say that 55
percent of Christians approve of gay
marriage but 95 percent of non
Christians approve of gay marriage
that's a big problem right even though
most Christians are okay with gay
marriage you would say the majority of
the opposition to gay marriage and
society comes from Christians even
though it's a minority of Christians
that have these beliefs right no
actually I wouldn't the only way I would
say that is a big problem would be if
the Christian faith in America would be
actually growing not in decline then I'd
say well maybe you could actually be
worried about this considering that this
movement is growing but I'm telling you
that they're becoming more acceptant and
there's less Christians as the time goes
and not only that but a lot of them are
gonna die soon
okay so again there's acting for no
reason maybe I mean we're making a lot
of different kinds a lot of okay so
firstly Christianity is shrinking in the
United States I've never disagreed with
that I would agree with you there
old people dying is generally a good
thing if you want more progressive
values
I would never disagree with you that's
absolutely true it's like the baby
boomers yeah old people baby boomers
right now yes dying is there yeah I when
they form the biggest part they're like
38% of all Christians or something sure
I don't disagree with any of that
however all I'm saying is that in the
United States today typically the
biggest threat to to gay rights comes
from Christians now whether it's their
old Christians or or they're not all
Christians I'm just saying that if you
would find people outside protesting
abortion clinics or members of the
Republican Party trying to push
anti-homosexual legislation or trying to
get Supreme Court justices that will
overturn the gay bakery case whatever
right it's stuff like this these are
Republican and Christian issues now
maybe the majority of Christians in the
United States are supportive of gay
rights but if somebody is protesting gay
rights it's usually a Christian in the
United States yeah but you keep saying
it's a big threat to gay people it's a
big threat for abortion well I'm you so
my only point my contingency here I'm
basically saying that I feel like you're
fear-mongering
okay hold on because we're jumping
around so much so okay so I'm gonna
ignore the show me like okay home okay
really think that rights are gonna be
taken away from the gays well I don't I
at this point probably not I don't think
I've ever said that I'm just so when I
say that like Christians are a threat to
gay people in the United States it's
usually in the context of compared to
Muslims so in the United States there
aren't there isn't like this Muslim
majority of people that are trying to
take rights away from gay people at
every type no no you're going too fast
now we're we're not we didn't get there
yet
okay wait which part are we yet
well cuz because you started talking
about Muslims like you just jump to like
wait oh yeah I just have to make sure
that we're very clear on the claims that
I'm making so well we've got to start by
coming to an agreement about how big the
threat on gays and abortion the
Christians do okay well let's focus on
gays no not at the abortion part that's
a separate conversation so for the gay
people right now at this point in the
United States with the Supreme Court
rulings and everything it's gonna be
pretty hard to roll back any type of gay
rights I don't think that there is a
legitimate threat to gay people in the
United States right now as far as like
getting married and whatnot go so it's
probably never going to get rolled back
I don't think so see I'm really happy we
could come on an understanding about
this well yeah I mean we've always
understood that I've never said anything
differently so I'm happy to well cause
you're you're saying that Christians are
a big threat in America compared to
Islam so yes but to me it seems like
you're saying like they're not not
actually at threat of changing anything
right now probably not but I mean like
for instance the Trump administration
has made statements judging the the
ruling of whether or not like a bakery
can be allowed to turn down serving a
product to a gay person right that's
something right now whether or not they
have the power to change that this is
stuff that's going through our Supreme
Court stuff that goes through our
Supreme Court is pretty hard to change I
don't know if any of that can ever get
changed or overturned but if it was
going to be changed
overturn it would come from Christians
in the United States right now yeah and
and it the Christians I'm pretty
emboldened right now with Trump in
office and Republicans holding the
majority on both sides I don't know if
that's going to be the same for the 2018
election season since everything for the
Republicans in the United States is
falling apart you do realize that like
Trump isn't a real Republican right like
he doesn't want her like he's not like
pence
well Pence is [ __ ] there's a lot of
different flavors of Republicans right
now it's like it's like Trump is more
liberal liberal than Hillary in my mind
a pin we've been accepting a gay people
like for way longer and I never heard
him say like like do you think that
Hillary would have enacted like the
trans ban via Twitter for military
people actually that there's a lot of
what you say propaganda that was spread
about that like what kind of propaganda
well people like basically their doctor
they're putting a halt on this and the
general Kelly I think was was in charge
of that and they don't want to outright
ban them forever that's not the thing
they just if you're manage to change
your gender and you're stable and
everything like they need studies about
that but where they cut wanna go is like
when somebody is stable and transition
completely and normal and it get proved
that it's fine
then like they can open the floodgates
you know it's just basically yeah but
this is how it was already it was
already like this I think the Pentagon
ended to ended up like overturning some
of what Trump had tweeted or wanted to
do but it's already been like that if
you've got like mental if you've got
like mental problems you're not gonna be
allowed to be in the military whether
it's trans issues or not like this was
already accounted for in the military
I'm pretty sure Trump wanted to enact a
full ban on transgender people no it's
because because what was starting to
happen was a it was becoming a thing
that people wanted to go there for the
operation so that means they would have
to be recruited before they get treated
okay so Trump tweeted that heat the
United States government
not accept or allow transgender
individuals to serve in any capacity in
the US military this means that even
people that had already transitioned
wouldn't be allowed to serve in the US
military
this is tweet what is the legislation
that came out though I all I know the
Pentagon overturned because Trump tried
to sign this as like a neo or something
or or an executive action and the
Pentagon ended up overturning hold on I
have to find the exact example maybe
they were like general lines I'm pretty
sure he just kind of like gave the
general lines and then gave his staffer
of the Army Staff dude was it Kelly
maybe I don't know apparent so
apparently the Pentagon hasn't taken any
steps yet to enforce Trump's ban because
he had the White House hasn't given
exact guidance yet on what to do this
article is a few months old but um but I
mean we were initially talking about
Trump being accepting of LGBT like this
is a pretty auntie trans tweet like
there's not much room for I am because I
no no because I am bisexual sapiosexual
and you know I'm accepting of the LGBT
I'm a part of it and I still can look at
that and be like well I understand why
you'd want to do that you want so you if
you had a trans person serving in the
military right now who is doing a good
job you would want them kicked out well
no that's why it's not gonna go in place
like that it's not going in place
because the White House hasn't given any
guidance to the Pentagon yet about what
to do but I mean look what Trump tweeted
well basically what I'm trying to say
here is like I don't think that you
should take a Trump tweet like it's a
official order like signed and printed
by your government okay we're not
talking the question wasn't whether or
not this was an official order or not
though the question was whether or not
Trump was pro or anti LGBT so of trouble
exactly I'm telling you you're saying
that banning trans people from the
military to you it seems like anti LGBT
I'm telling you I'm LGBT and I'm not
against the LGBT and I could see why
you'd want to
what let's back up and look at the let's
just philosophically look at the
validity of your artist no no no hold on
we have to look at this argument so
you're basically saying in the simplest
terms that if Trump tweets something
that's anti LGBT it doesn't matter if
the actual legislation isn't anti LGBT
no I'm saying that trumps saying that he
wants to ban the military the trans
people out of the military isn't against
the LGBT that's what I'm saying so the
fact that every trans person needs to
leave the military that that's a
statement made by the president that's
not an anti trans statement I don't I
don't think so
I think that's a pro security statement
so you don't think that any trans person
is capable of serving in any capacity in
any military position I have to ask you
right now you do realize that some trans
people are actually Pro that as well
you're saying so I don't care what the
opinions of some trans people are I'm
just trying to find out your it sound
like you can't hold both opinions at
once well you know I don't think you can
I'm trying to yes I'm trying to expose a
contradiction in your position I so I'm
asking you do you think that it's fair
to say that no trans person can serve in
any military position whatsoever because
that's what Trump is saying and you're
saying that he can say that and not be
anti trans that sounds anti-trans to me
to me it sounded like he was saying
until all the proper research was done
and everything was sorted okay so let me
just here I'll I'm gonna shoot you one
second but you know what I mean duh I'm
gonna shoot you this link okay so this
includes his three tweets after
consultation with my generals and
military experts please be advised that
the United States government will not
all right well how you doing buddy I'm
doing well
are we like yeah we're live oh yeah
don't solve it like hey I was going
pretty good
alright alright um I guess just for my
audience you wanna go ahead and
introduce yourself and all that jazz I'm
Amos key I'm the guy who has been
stirring [ __ ] up within the skeptic
community by being by supporting
pedophilia trying to eliminate age of
consent laws for sex
legalizing child pornography and ending
discrimination for pedophiles people who
are sexually attracted to children so
yeah gotcha all right
well I like philosophical debates and it
seems like a lot of people have a lot of
difficulty discussing things that make
them uncomfortable and what could be
more uncomfortable to discuss them
pedophilia so it sounds like exactly it
sounds like a fun conversation so I
guess if if there's anything if there's
something else gonna get our way we
could just hop right into it um oh I
just want to say like without a doubt
you don't think I'm a troll alright um
I'm not too sure I mean I've looked at a
little bit of your stuff it's really
hard for me to say but I don't really
care if you're trolling or not I think
it's an interesting idea to engage with
regardless and a lot of people seemed
ill-equipped to do it so yeah that's
wonderful because like all the big
youtubers like Andy borsky illogic Jeff
holiday like sargon of akkad
they've all been falsely claiming that
I'm a troll which I'm not I'm perfectly
genuine with my opinions I think that
that's just a way to weasel out of a
discussion about this since I think
they're kind of incompetent in dealing
with it yeah sure that's entirely
possible and that's how I would assume
that when it comes to people like Sargon
or Andy so yeah that's not yeah yeah but
like I said to go back to you know
really whether or not you're trolling I
don't really care I'm more interested in
the discussion so okay before so before
we start I just want to define on
something so that we can all say that
we're kind of on the same page and
everything okay so firstly just so that
we're on the same page
I'll make the distinction between I know
there's different things it's like
pedophilia and he Bethulia or something
for the
purposes of this conversation or do I
think we're just gonna refer to all
underage sexual relationships with older
people as pedophilia understanding that
a 15 or 16 year old or attraction to a
15-6 knows that necessarily a pedophile
like medically speaking right we'll just
stick with like the legal definition is
that okay or yeah sure okay and then I
understand the distinction that
pedophilia is scientific more medically
speaking is an attraction to a
prepubescent person so if somebody
attractive to a 14 15 16 year old isn't
scientifically or medically like a
pedophile but we'll just stick with that
definition for a consistency sight for
the argument right cool okay so
basically like like a sexual attraction
to anybody below the age of 18 yeah
we'll say age of majority in the United
States is 18 chair we'll just use that
although that is kind of arbitrary
because moving on to the next point
I'm just so I understand your position
you're arguing that all age of consent
laws should be abolished that a 2 or 3
year old could sufficiently engage with
sexual activity engage in sexual
activity with somebody that's 20 30 40
years old right yes absolutely I would
say I'm sexual penetration perhaps not
until the age of 7 or something but
sexual acts definitely okay I got you
all right just so that we're on the same
page okay so for my moral system and I
think that most people would agree with
this acts are generally considered to be
considered as morally neutral
unless you're given an argument for why
something shouldn't be done so in the
realm of like pedophilia for instance
this is something that you would regard
as a morally neutral act unless you give
a reason why it shouldn't be done
because that's typically how we approach
you you know I'm making value statements
about things so I believe that the onus
would be on me to present a reason why I
believe that pedophilia
is an immoral action rather than
pedophilia is the default and then you
have to provide a reason or its default
bad and you have to provide a reason why
it's good so then I'll be giving an
argument for why I believe it's immoral
and then I'm kind of curious to hear
your response to that sweet oh I just
like to confirm like are we live because
I don't see the video on YouTube that's
live like okay I'm sorry I'm actually a
youtuber just like a little thing I do
on the side I'm actually a Twitter
streamer if you go to this website this
is where I'm at right now or this is my
website I'd type both here on discord II
see it
yeah okay so basically you're like I can
after the stream if I want a mirror to
being on my channel I'll just um like
download it from there
yeah if you want to yeah sure okay cool
but we're definitely alive right now yep
yeah we are yeah if you go to that
twitch site you'll be able to see me
alright that works that works
alright let's dance okay um okay so so
why I think pedophilia is all right well
yeah basically um there's absolutely
nothing wrong with having a sexual
attraction to children and pure sexual
acts with the children like you know
making out with them you know casual
touching of genitals I think it's
perfectly fine and the fact is that
there's definitely discrimination
involved in terms of saying that that
act is completely very harmful and I
think if it's perfectly consensual and
it's not abuse or manipulative in that
kind of relationship then it should not
be considered harmful and so if we just
strip away the human rights of adults to
have sexual you know sexual interaction
with children then yeah that's that's
just that stripping away their human
rights taking away somebody's rights to
enjoy something that's completely
harmless that is yeah the epitome of
discrimination and authoritarianism sure
so okay so I have two syllogisms that I
kind of want to run through to get to
the conclusion where pedophilia is
immoral and I just want to talk through
these and you can tell me you can tell
me what-what you agree or disagree with
so I'm going to do my first syllogism
has three premises and then a conclusion
and then the second one we want to that
so the first thing that I want to talk
about is whether or not children are
capable of giving informed consent and
this may or may not be where we disagree
with the most so yeah so my first so
holiday kind of touched on this but I
think he was missing a little bit out of
this but this will be probably what most
of our discussion is centered on so so
my first so my first thing I would say
is that informed consent means that both
sides are able to weigh the short-term
and long-term ramifications of an action
do you think that's an okay definition
for informed consent sure okay I would
say that as it exists so
it's important to recognize the
distinction between how we would wish
society would act and how society exists
today so I would say that as exist in
society today sexual activity carries
long term ramifications would you agree
or disagree with that
you're saying that every action contains
long term ramifications well
specifically I would say that sexual
activity today carries long term
ramifications oh yeah sure you can say
that for every activity all right
well not necessarily on for instance a
child playing with a set of Lego blocks
probably won't carry on long term
ramifications playing a few keys on a
piano probably won't getting a life
altering surgery like female genital
mutilation or male genital mutilation or
something like that okay right would be
long-term ramifications so I draw a
distinction okay that's what I get so
with sexual activity especially in
regard to sexual activity there are
social stigmas that are carried along
with sexual activity along with possible
mental or personal trauma that could or
could not occur with with sexual
activity right I'm not saying it happens
every single time but that it could
happen right of course of course
okay but yeah I think I should stop you
right there because I think you're
you're just defining I'm assuming what
you're trying to imply is that basically
if a child if you want a child to
consent to sex yes be completely
informed in his decision to consent the
sex
yeah a little bit completely real quick
I mean if we agree in these two that
this is my next this would be my next
part of my premise that is that would be
children are incapable of weighing the
long-term ramifications of sexual
activity and then they would disagree or
agree with that long-term ramifications
of sexual activity I would I think that
there hmm some of them might not be fun
but some of them could have you think
there exists do you sure but do you
think there exists a four-year-old child
that is capable of weighing the
long-term emotional or mental
ramifications of sexual activity on this
planet of for a four or five-year-old
very unlikely I'll give you that
sure hmm but yeah and I think that the
argument completely falls apart for you
because I think that you think that you
need to be completely informed of an
action before you're able to consent to
it and I'm going to make the argument
that no you do not have to be completely
informed of an action you know to be
able to consent to it
for instance yeah do you want to do an
away for like two seconds because that's
actually my next syllogism and then we
can hop right into that I sure so the
conclusion on my first syllogism that is
that children are incapable of giving
informed consent and it sounds like we
both agree on that we're not at a moral
condemnation of pedophilia yet we just
agree that children aren't really
capable of giving informed consent to
sexual activity right that no I'm not
I'm not gonna make a broad
generalization that all children can't
give consent
especially informed consent especially
since we're already referring to
children as people below the 18 okay
post pubescent children definitely and
younger children less likely but yeah
I'm not gonna give the broad
generalization that all of them can't
consent do you think it would be fair we
importance that sure we can narrow this
a little bit to make it less ambiguous
what if we narrowed this part of the
argument to just children under the age
of 13 so like an 11 or 12 year old
wouldn't be able to give informed
consent to having sexual activity I
don't know or I'll give it to you so you
can try I think that a 5 or a 6 year old
person would be able to give we'd have
an L understanding or would have it
would have a good understanding of the
long-term ramifications of sexual
activity with a 30 or 40 year old the
long term like I'm talking like like
some type of mental ramification or
emotional ramification so for instance a
child engages in sexual activity at the
age of five and then later when they're
13 or 14 they start to have regrets
about it or they wish they hadn't done
that do you think that that yeah but
that's basically a possibility for any
kind of action really so kind of but if
it's an action where you didn't really
have the capability how that sexual is
it kind of goes back another informed
consent thing they wouldn't we would
expect them to understand like what the
ramifications of that action were versus
like comparing it's like a 22 year old
buying a car
and then regretting it three years later
well it was within their faculty to do
all of the necessary research to know if
they wanted to keep the car or not
whereas a four or five or six year old
we wouldn't really expect them to have
developed the mental faculty yet to
understand whether or not that sexual
activity they were engaging with would
be condemned by society or not it would
make them otherwise feel uncomfortable
at you know as they approach their
pubescent reowww
that really depends on like the sexual
activity because I'm assuming that um I
think I think Bureau you're under the
broad generalization that every sexual
activity is like you know it has a huge
impact on the child and it will have
really long-term emotional consequences
I doubt that I would consider like
bathing a sexual activity I would
consider like you know a kid happily
touching adults dick after um the child
after the parent gives him candy as a
sexual activity and those are completely
harmless and I don't think it has the
huge emotional ramifications that you
are implying that sexual activities
would have so so moving on to it so we
can revisit the second premise because
now it seems that you disagree with this
one which is fine so the second premise
was as it exists in society today sexual
activity carries long term ramifications
so you would say that let's say that an
adult male gives a child or it doesn't
really I will say don't mail because
it's got a peanut or whatever an adult
person with a penis gives a child some
candy and that child fondles the
person's penis in exchange for the candy
right you would argue that that action
carries no long-term ramifications um
actually in exchange for the candy um
well it really depends on the
circumstance but I'm I'm assuming in
that harmless little story that you give
probably know when you say
yep similar to how um I mean many people
are around the kid then like perhaps
perhaps a kid the people will pressure
they get into thinking that it's harmful
I would disagree but let's say it's
about some of the problems that you're
when you as you go into this and I
understand you doing it as an adult but
when you say things like well it depends
on the circumstance what you're showing
me is that you as an adult are able to
distinguish between times when it would
okay and not okay and my argument goes
back to informed consent that a child
would never be able to distinguish when
it is okay or not okay yeah and my
argument is that you don't it's not
about being informed when you give the
consent that's completely irrelevant
it's more of whether or not there is
harm involved in the action you see you
guys have a problem when a baby you know
kit comes over and you know in exchange
for candy you know touches the adults
face but let's instead of the face the
kid touches the dick instead and then
you guys have a problem but why should
there be a problem they're completely
harmless because the problem is that
sexual activity in society today carries
a much different ramification with it
than non sexual activity so for instance
we could say that these two actions are
equivalent right it's just the child
touching the skin of another person and
we might be able to make that statement
in a vacuum but in society as it exists
today if I tell my friend that I want to
touch his face he might look at me
strangely and let me do it but if I tell
him that I want to touch his penis there
would be a much different interaction
there right because these are debts hmm
but that's really that's really not
because touching a dick like touching
the face is harmful it's just because
society first you've said it's such and
I think it's way more accurate if you
want to determine whether or not an
action is harmful or not not to you know
consider you know society because
obviously society doesn't affect whether
or not it's harmful or not if the action
itself that we need to look at so I feel
like if you want to make this argument
so I will I will say that in certain
hypothetical worlds your argument may be
correct but the problem is that I think
that when you're weighing the
ramifications of an action you have to
take into account how society will
respond to that basically saying that
okay in the 70s you know gays are we're
being discriminated but would use but
will you now say that oh during the 70s
revealing that you are a gay and having
sex with a gay man is wrong
then the society argument I think just
because you know society is backwards
and II don't consider the action wrong
good at that time therefore it can be
considered wrong I think it's very
flawed so I agree with you that an
appeal to tradition to determine whether
or not something is morally right or
morally condemnable is bad I would never
use an appeal to a tradition what I'm
talking about right now though is the
very real kind of like mental
consequence of doing something that that
that society kind of bucks so for
instance and going back to the gay
example they are using a tradition so
well it sounds like that but going back
to the gay example for instance even if
society is fully against you know
homosexual relationships it is entirely
possible that to informed and consenting
men could engage in a consensual
homosexual relationship maybe they would
have to keep it hidden from society or
something so that they wouldn't find out
but to them like no personal damage or
whatever would be caused right because
they're capable of engaging in that
relationship in making all the necessary
considerations to engage in that
relationship
yeah as it stands today because of our
societal views on sex it doesn't seem
like children are capable of engaging in
in those kinds of sexual relationships
because they can't weigh the pros and
cons em I guess like if I were to draw
like a like a similar thing to try to
make your analogy fit more so like we
could look at like interracial
relationships maybe could we do that as
a stand-in instead of gay relationships
I could say interracial relationships
well what do you mean by that
so like well since people used to say
interracial relationships are wrong
wouldn't you say that then because
Society says interracial relationships
are wrong that they shouldn't be allowed
to do that or whatever well yeah I
wouldn't say that just because society
considers those relationships wrong
doesn't mean they're they shouldn't be
allowed to do it sure
so like let's say that there was a so
the this analogy is getting incredibly
hypothetical by like let's say that
there was a an actual punishment there
was an actual punishment for somebody
engaging in friendship with a with
somebody of a different race or whatever
right let's say that that exists right
that
if an adult if a 45 year old person of a
race were to engage in a friendship with
a five year old person of a race I would
I would say that to some extent that's
an immoral behavior on the part of the
adult even though there's nothing
necessarily wrong with interracial
relationships because the child isn't
able to fully understand the
ramifications of engaging in that
relationship that the relationship
itself might not be wrong but that that
yeah it is really awesome when an
employee gets X and a 30 and a CEO gets
37 X yeah that's awesome right yeah so
again like these are like the child did
like the child like when you're like
maybe you are a 10 year old dude I don't
even know if you're allowed on Twitch if
you're making arguments that are this
[ __ ] immature right so of course a
CEO is going to make a [ __ ] ton more
than than a low level employee if what
is his name Sam Walton is that the owner
of Walmart is that this guy's name if
this guy were to get on Twitter right
now and spam the n-word okay how many
millions of people would have their
wages impacted how many millions of
shareholders would have their portfolios
tanked how many millions of jobs that
are related to Walmart could be grossly
impacted the CEO of a company has the
ability to potentially single-handedly
destroy a company of course somebody
like that is going to be compensated at
a much higher level than than a line
level employee like yeah CEOs get paid a
[ __ ] ton more than employees but they
also have the ability to do an
incredible amount of harm to the company
there are millions of jobs potentially
maybe not millions but oftentimes
thousands tens of thousands or hundreds
of thousands of jobs that are resting on
some of these companies
all right we're chatting with ex kills
me real quick I'm sure this will be a
real quick really simple agreeable
conversation how's it going man my
favorite disingenuous [ __ ] for my
subreddit and chat I am ingenuously so
indigenous okay let's go hit me up with
them Bernie communism memes no no I
think about this because I think a lot
of people especially people who are here
transiently haven't been here long or
gonna be kind of surprised that you're
stalwart defensive capitalism even
despite that you actually supported
Bernie Sanders in the primary and I know
I know the reason you did but I don't
know if everybody does so for context I
just want to ask you as a as the last
liberal capitalist why did you support
Bernie Sanders so for me the single most
important issue plaguing American
politics today is the presence of
corporate money in the political world
that is something that I think is a
cancer on our system that makes it
impossible for the representatives that
we have in Congress to to to truly
represent us as citizens and Bernie Koch
to that issue okay all right so I'm
gonna claim the claim I'm gonna make is
that if what you said is true and Bernie
Sanders is the last candidate and
one of the last politicians in the
entire country that you should support
if you're president
oh okay why is that so I'll explain it
in a few dimensions in the first way I
want to explain is by explaining to you
in a chat which I think a lot of people
don't understand is basically how the
political economy works and how it
functions because you talk about money
and politics as a cancer and I guess you
can call it a cancer but really what it
is is it just it functions as its own
market
there's just apply and demand
relationship for regulation and the same
way there to supply demand relationship
for other goods and services and I think
the best way to actually explain this is
to bring up an illustration you gave
somebody else when you were discussing
the manner in which the market
incorporates relevant information and
stock pricing a stock remember that talk
you had a little while ago when you're
talking on future earning potentials and
whatnot people will price that into
their current exactly that was beautiful
that was like spot-on when you actually
drew you drew a curve and paint we're
like okay here's kind of like the
baseline stock price right and for
example if there's some there's some
legislation that would bump their stock
price up by 10% and there's a 20% chance
of that legislation passing then you
know the stock market would be higher
than a sign but it's not gonna be all
the way up to the impact of that
regulation right sure well that's really
key visualization because if you
understand that dynamic you understand
why there is influence of money in
politics basically when you're talking
about the deviation between that
baseline stock price and the price that
would be after that regulation is passed
that's pure money on the table in fact
that had there's a word for that it's
called economic rinse that's all rent
that is on the table for firms to strike
economic rent is that what you call
economic rents okay the act of trying to
capture those economic prints is called
the rent seeking behavior so you can
imagine is they some does this rent
seeking behaviour that specifically
applied to politics or is this just in a
general term it's it's specific for this
in the political economy
okay people who use it more generally
oftentimes rince is like kind of
synonymous with profits but economic
rents in this case is actually very
specific Ocasek the rent-seeking
behavior defines the behavior that firms
take and capturing those rents because
you can imagine there's a gap between
the baseline and the world with this
legislation right uh-huh
so the extent to which corporations can
either increase the probability of that
late
station passing or change some aspects
of that legislation to alter its impact
on their market share they get a return
on their money for making investments
and changing that you do you accept that
you understand that yeah of course so
just so I can give an example so that I
make sure I understand everybody stands
for me only so I understand you are
saying that there are two worlds one
world in which a firm earns two thousand
dollars of revenue and another world in
which the firm earns one thousand
dollars of revenue the difference
between those two worlds might be some
arbitrary legislation and the the
difference between those would be
described as a rent rent seeking
behavior would be to invest money in
politics that's less than the thousand
dollar difference that would net you
that thousand dollar difference and the
difference of those differences would be
the profit earned by that lobbying
essentially right exactly that is
spot-on and so the problem with that
type of behavior is like you said it's
ethically dubious but even the bigger
problem with that is you have these
large firms who pay a ton of money and
invest a lot and capturing that rent and
the problem with economic rents like
that is that they're getting the
companies are getting wealth but there
aren't actually creating any wealth
they're not like building a better
product and that could be using that
money for things like investing in
research and development and for hiring
workers you have any workers raise its
but instead they're dedicating that
money to capturing that rank on the
table so what you can see with this and
what you just said is that the incentive
these companies have to invest in that
and that rent is proportional to the
amount of money on the table so if you
have a regime like dare I say Bernie
Sanders or Elizabeth Warren who claimed
that they were gonna basically manhandle
all aspects of the economy to give you
an example Bernie Sanders says he's
gonna break up the big banks like I know
Bernie didn't actually say that
Braniac specifically said that he would
leave that up to regulators who thought
it was appropriate if it was going to
actually very specifically memory of
Sanders I was actually shocked that he
said this I remember a specific
interview that he was somebody asked
would you break up these large financial
institutions and Bernie said no I would
leave it to the appropriate federal
agencies I'm gonna Skype you his
campaign website or Bernie Sanders comm
slash issues and it has in big bold
letters it's time to break up the
largest financial institutions in the
country right front and center and he
doesn't say how he's gonna do that
frankly he doesn't know how he would do
that sure okay I guess like maybe it's a
finer point maybe his administration
would but I guess he particularly
wouldn't so maybe it's the semantics
it's not really relevant but
right right but that's that's because
right now in our in our hypotheticals
we're talking about a piece of
legislation right now we're talking
about an administration just totally
[ __ ] rearranging the entire industry
based off whatever the regulator's
decide so the amount of money on the
table is gonna be in the trillions of
dollars so the incentives that companies
have to influence money in politics is
proportional to the amount of impact
that these regulators have on those
businesses of course so when you get
somebody like Bernie Sanders she says
it's time to break up the big banks I
guarantee you that's gonna that's gonna
create basically Golden Age of lobbyists
because they all are gonna have to lobby
to have whatever he wants to do done in
such a way that benefits their
shareholders the most and the more
active the measurements he takes in
these actual industries more money there
is on the table for people for companies
to invest and influence it you accept
that right that companies will always be
trying to influence politics via
rent-seeking behavior not always they
will to the extent that there they get
returnable yeah yeah yeah and the return
on their money is correlated basically
with exactly how much impact these
regulators are having on their bottom
line sure and we're talking about Bernie
Sanders who's gonna have an impact on
the bottom line based off argue Latorre
like choice is it's on a massive scale
probably unprecedented so if you care
about money in politics you should
really be concerned about managing the
incentives that companies have to invest
money in politics and when you have
somebody like Bernie Sanders with all of
the reforms he's talking about and
without a specific actual way of doing
that how he says he himself he's gonna
leave up to regulators like what do you
think lobbying is he's obvious don't go
directly the president they go to the
regulators and say look you're trying to
do this this is the way you should do it
and it so happens the way you should do
it is best for our bottom line and when
you have something like Bernie Sanders
that that's where I'm saying the
contradiction lies is that if you're
really concerned about it then you
should say something like well Bernie
Sanders Wall Street Reform would be
absolutely massive and it's very vague
so if I care about money in politics I
don't want that kind of vague large
rent-seeking incentive to be on the
table it's totally opposite okay we're
missing a pretty important part here
though aren't we okay well let me know
well there's two big things okay one I
reject your argument that eliminating
rent-seeking behavior are that
eliminating the rent that eliminating
that is good
but we can talk about that later the
main thing is that Bernie said that he
wanted to prohibit people from being
able to lobby politicians that was like
the big part of his platform okay so how
is he gonna do that I don't know there's
a number of reforms but yeah but I mean
this is you said this is the most
important thing too so like what's he
gonna do like what how is he gonna limit
lobbying I don't know maybe private
companies or the whole idea of super
PACs is probably not a good thing I
don't know it's a really tenuous issue
that has to be navigated but the idea
that companies can dump pretty much
unlimited amounts of money or support
into a political campaign in order to
influence an outcome is probably not
okay I mean I know I guess my critique
would be is he was like you say it's
like a single-issue thing for you so I
would expect more concrete like oh this
this is that they this lobbying lobbying
has its hands in like every single part
of the government I mean companies will
fund individual political campaigns via
super PACs and whatnot that stuff like
that probably not be allowed companies
have their hands in writing legislation
that they hand off to senators to insert
into bills that should not be allowed
any lobbying is a that could massively
huge thing yeah I just explained to you
why that's the case
yeah stopping it I'm saying that I'm
stopped that is why I'm managing the in
terms of economic rents on the table
okay surely minimizing you have to have
some rants there's some regulation is
necessary always gonna have economic
prints we I'm I I reject your rent
argument that no you know that was not
my argument okay argument was not that
you should minimize economic rents is
that you should not maximize them if
your goal is to limit the influence of
money Impala one suggestion that I've
heard and I don't know I would have to
look into the feasibility of these
alternative systems although I'd love to
look into them more if it was ever
realistic I don't think it is right now
but like one suggestion would be like a
public fund that politicians draw from
so for instance if you're running in a
particular City you guys have voted with
your City Council whatever [ __ ] for
like
each politician is allowed to spend
$50,000 or whatever for their
advertising for this quarter or whatever
the season for this political season
something like that where the funds
would be publicly delegated to the
officials but we're also talking about
another aspect of lobbying we're
lobbying a lot of it isn't actually
money or donations a lot of it is
literally these lobbyists going and
that's where the term came from they go
to the lobbies of the hotels of the
regulators and of the corporations and
make a pitch of the politician make a
pitch for why they should consider a
certain bill
so the problem with limiting lobbying is
you have fundamentally a free speech
issue and that's no I don't think
there's anything wrong with pitching
things but but the problem isn't
necessarily pitching things the problem
is the bribery so let me give an example
if somebody would have come and say
something like I think that coal is
really good for the United States and I
really think you should look into this
because we can provide a lot of value to
the American people or whatever like a
pitch like that I wouldn't really have a
problem with edges what do you say
lobbying that encompasses mostly that
okay so I'm not talking about those
types of behaviors what I'm talking
about is a behavior where somebody might
say listen I think that you should vote
in favor of this coal bill if you don't
my company is leaving your state or like
we're not going to be involved with you
or we're gonna give you some sort of
kickback if you do vote in the way that
we want whether that's paying for our
political action campaigns or playing
we're paying for donations to other
types of things or whatever a special
interest [ __ ] so I mean I guess in
my state we have we've had like the
governor's cut deals with complex
companies and Amazon like she do you
think Amazon should be banned for banned
for doing what they're saying where
they're basically like hey we're opening
new headquarters
I want these cities with these
specifications to give us like their
pitch on why they should be there and to
give us basically the best deal possible
to me that's exactly we're talking about
but I think that's economically
efficient and we'll see an ethical issue
with that but it seems like that should
be banned under what you're proposing I
guess it like the particular issues I
guess I'm generally concerned at the
federal level but I guess there would be
state related things I don't know if I
would view like tax cuts or preferential
treatment to businesses coming to a
state in the same line as like this is
how federal register this is how federal
legislation should change to to benefit
like a certain business over another
business I guess I would have to think
more about the finer points I know right
now do you acknowledge that the
rent-seeking behavior like causes a lot
of really bad things to happen in our
economy right that's like a failure that
isn't accounted for at the moment oh I
explained it yet because that's money
that could be spent towards R&D or
product development or customers and it
said it's kind of like song curing well
well not only that also but the
rent-seeking behavior can manifest in
actual negative ways for society as well
that a company could perform in a
negative way that reduces the weather
reduces a competitive product available
to a person not just because they're not
investing the money to R&D but because
they're making other people
uncompetitive or in externalities like
environmental impact or other [ __ ] like
that
that that kind of stuff is really
negative I
what I described that falls under the
umbrella of what I describe when you say
I'm sorry so I guess just to finish this
topic up real fast I don't know exactly
how I haven't looked into the exact
implementations I say that I'm a single
issue on this much the same way that I
would say that like I think voting
reform is absolutely 100% necessary I
think that first-past-the-post is a
disgusting way to vote I don't know what
the best alternative is but I haven't
spent much time thinking of like the
exact specifics of this just because I
don't consider it realistic I don't
think that anybody is realistically
talking about getting money out of
politics so it's just not something I've
looked into that much right and that's
why that's why I really think it was
wrong of you to support Berea Center
since why I don't think he's well but I
think okay well so we can talk about the
rent stuff in particular if you anyone
of that or if you had a final thing to
say go for it oh yeah lastly I was gonna
say cuz I guess you kind of solved for
this by by saying that by lobbying you
don't mean company is actually going
directly to politicians and basically
making a pitch for but that's actually
necessary and important and the reason
for that is that Bernie Sanders doesn't
know fuck-all about banking hears
nothing about it and even the
regulator's ain't no more about banking
but they don't know about the specific
idiosyncrasies of individual banks okay
so it's actually important for banks to
basically represent their interest and
go to these politicians and say hey look
you're thinking about doing it this way
here's why it's not fair and a lot of
the times like they're actually right
like the rules aren't fair yeah but you
have to because the banks are only
representing their businesses they're
not necessarily representing what's best
for all of America they're just
representing what would be best for
their particular business even if that's
why they're in that's why their input is
important because those regulators they
have no incentive to make a decision
that that is best for everybody they're
Dustin you agree that this is completely
internally consistent right it's just
impractical so the challenge that I
would have for this guy his argument is
internally consistent but it all hinges
on something that I think is impossible
to defend and that is the idea that
somebody below the age of somebody below
a certain age is capable of giving
informed consent to a behavior that's
the that would be the challenge right is
you need to prove to me that somebody
below the age of I mean even if we don't
say 18 like 14 or 13 is capable of
understanding the ramifications of
engaging in a sexual relationship with a
30-plus year old and that they have to
prove that they're making that decision
free of any type of influence that that
person could could have harmful
ramifications that they say know that
these questions are essentially am not
[ __ ] that's my whole party are
essentially like impossible to answer
which is why we typically don't let
children consent to things like this I
think that that challenge is
insurmountable I don't think you could
ever prove that there are certain
societal frameworks that I could see
where pedophilia would be nonchalant but
we don't live in that society right now
unfortunately or unfortunately I
shouldn't say that we don't live in that
society right now I guess unfortunately
for pedophiles what do we know that a
ten year old doesn't know all right I
mean I know a lot of things that a ten
year old doesn't know I don't know what
do you feel like you know about as much
as a 10 year old no my dude I guess
that's a personal question for you to
answer
sure but that's from a practical point
of view that is in our society we can't
imagine the relationship dynamics in a
40 year old and a 14 year old which is
healthy and sexual sure the unable table
but I mean all of the arguments that
we're gonna make from this are going to
be within the context of our society
right destiny that guy is obviously
going to reverse the question you're
asked how can you prove a child is
incapable of consenting to a decision oh
well because I can provide a number of
hypotheticals that would make consent
very very hazy let's say for instance
that you have a 30 year old babysitter
and you're a nine-year-old kid let's say
that the babysitter propositions you for
sex how can that child be sure that he
can say no to the babysitter without
suffering any kind of harmful
repercussions if the babysitter decides
to force him or herself on the child the
child has no way to protect himself
if the babysitter decides to mistreat
the child because the child said no the
child might feel like they have no
recourse so they can't do anything
because the person is much stronger much
larger an adult compared to them they
won't be believed or trust it if they
complain that the babysitter did
something wrong I mean you can propose a
number of hypotheticals a very
reasonable hypotheticals where it's like
well in this situation like a child
couldn't reasonably say yes or no you
know that the that the power
differential and the amount of influence
that the other person who's asking for
the sexual relationship has over the
child makes it impossible for that child
to truly give it an informed consent
consensual decision on but a babysitter
already sets up a power dynamic well yes
but most adults are interacting with
children in ways that a power dynamic
has been established like how many times
is a nine-year-old just meeting a random
30 year old for no reason like
unfortunately he would retort back with
sometimes pedophilia should be okay so
therefore it shouldn't be outlawed
across the board but the problem is the
reason why it is outlawed against the
board
well it's outlawed because of icky
reasons but the reason why morally it
should be a lot against the board is
because it is impossible for a third
party observer here is the problem okay
is that if we view pedophilia Croatian
ships as a sort of black box we have a
third party observer okay now this might
be is it consensual versus a
non-consensual this relationship might
be consensual this relationship might be
non-consensual but there is no possible
way for an outside observer to ever
determine if a sexual relationship
a massive power imbalance is consensual
or non-consensual there's just no way
for an outside observer to know the
answer to that you can't possibly know
the answer to that which is why we make
all of it not okay because the only
people that are capable of determining
whether or not it's truly consensual
will be the victim right so and if it's
a non-consensual sexual relationship
than the victims ability to complain
about the relationship is oftentimes
compromised so it's not you frivolous
use the argument of I don't want to talk
to X leftist even though they are
willing because I think their ideas are
too extreme the argument be
hypotheticals in turbulent our
discussion about the advocate of
legalized pedophilia is a good use of
time pedophilia represents an
interesting discussion about people's
views of ethics things like consent
these are all things that are very
practical realistic topics that we are
engaged
right now in society this whole
Hollywood scandal and everything are
things that were engaging with right now
the idea of creating a fantasy utopia
where a board of workers decides how a
factor is used and then Commission's a
man in society take products while you
is boring delusional [ __ ] fantasy
that has never worked in any point in
all of human history it's not an
interesting conversation okay
I'm sorry that this offends you but I
really just don't give a [ __ ] about
anything relating to communism or
socialism it's been failed every single
time it's been attempted and even the
discussion even the thought of it is
dreadfully boring to me wouldn't it be
cool if everybody owned the factory dude
and then we could all just make
decisions about what's best for society
the board of workers I don't care it's
if you want to talk about it that's fine
but it's so fun it's such a boring
thoughtless mind experiment I don't care
it has no practical implication to
reality what we're both workers in real
life do like okay I don't know what I
mean I guess we have unions it's not
really the same thing but like
conversations on ethics or the
philosophy of how we approach like
consent or something are very
interesting conversations that have a
lot of very real life very practical
applications that are important to us
now right the idea of a consensual
sexual relationship that that isn't that
doesn't just apply to pedophilia that
applies to a lot of different things the
the fantasy that is communism or
socialism is just a boring conversation
that is just I don't care don't
discussions about communism have
implications for the ethics of wage
labor and redistribution of wealth
I guess maybe but I feel like I would
have to go and read Marx to actually get
some good arguments about it because
most of the arguments that I hear people
just utter like as a single line are
countered immediately and then they go
oh yeah
like all like what like all labor is the
error all all labor is like the
exploitation of the work or whatever
well no [ __ ] you're exploiting the
worker but the worker is also exploiting
your capital in order to learn or wage
like I mean like it's a two-way
relationship right I don't know I gotta
talk to people like that before that'll
say something like well destiny every
time you work for somebody they're just
taking advantage of you to make money
off of your labor and your labor is
never gonna be worth as much as they're
paying you well no [ __ ] they're earning
a profit on it because they're providing
you the capital to work your labor right
when you go to McDonald's and sell a
cheeseburger you're
you are using their building you're
using their supply chain you're using
their technology to sell burgers to
other people of course they're gonna
take a cut of that but I mean you're
engaging in it somewhat consensually
right depending I guess on your life
circumstances I don't know I just find
all of these arguments to be really
really really really really really
really really really boring really
[ __ ] boring then have no practical
implication to anything that have no I
get nothing in my worldview is ever
going to be changed or shaped by a
discussion with communist or socialist
it's just insanely [ __ ] boring
this intense need to be rooted in the
real and now is often associated with
autism perhaps you should be more
willing to give theoretical discussions
a chance theoretical discussions are
more interesting to me when they're
related and like very very like like
existential things like if you want to
talk about like the nature of
consciousness or or maybe like the
purpose of life or the discovery of an
objective morality like those are
interesting questioning I don't know
socialism and communism are just really
fun okay if anybody from ok I'll do it
right now if you want to do it if
anybody from the politics chat wants to
come on and talk about socialism or
communism this is your chance if you
want to do it sure thing okay who wants
is anybody oh do I have any volunteers
yeah it is really awesome when an
employee gets X and a 30 and a CEO gets
37 X yeah that's awesome right yeah so
again like these are like the child
like the child like when you're like
maybe you are a ten year old dude I
don't even know if you're a lot on
Twitch if you're making arguments that
are this [ __ ] immature right so of
course a CEO is going to make a [ __ ] ton
more than than a low-level employee if
what is his name Sam Walton is that the
owner of Walmart the is that this guy's
name if this guy were to get on Twitter
right now and spam the n-word okay
how many millions of people would have
their wages impacted how many millions
of shareholders would have their
portfolios tanked how many millions of
jobs that are related to Walmart could
be grossly impacted the CEO of a company
has the ability to potentially
single-handedly destroy a company of
course somebody like that is going to be
compensated at a much higher level than
than a line level employee like via CEOs
get paid a [ __ ] ton more than employees
but they also have the ability to do an
incredible amount of harm to the company
there are millions of jobs potentially
maybe not millions but oftentimes
thousands tens of thousands or hundreds
of thousands of jobs that are resting on
some of these companies
all right Kayla Corey what's up buddy
apparently you're willing to talk to a
socialist and I got 4,000 dat's all
right what do you want well what you
never want to talk to socialists so what
what Sony and socialism I dude tell me
of the evils why is capitalism an evil
system capitalism is an evil system it's
a bad system why it's capitalism a bad
system so fundamentally you this has to
start with an ethics conversation yep
about what's one but I think that you
mostly at least have at times said
things that are necessary so we have to
care about what would make society best
for everyone okay yep Rawls curtain yeah
yeah so having established that sort of
the reason that capitalism is flawed and
socialism would probably be better is
because when you look at capitalism it
presents a series of incentives which
are bad for everyone as a whole because
it focuses on specifically profit rather
than better systems of determining
what's best for everyone okay well let's
start with this why can't the government
guide businesses to work in a
capitalistic way such that the profit
motive does benefit Society for instance
a program like cap and trade so there
are a lot of government regulations that
would make capitalism better and to the
extent that they would make capitalism
better it's because they're taking the
decisions out of the hands of
capitalists because the capitalists
motive of profiting themselves is not in
the sighs best interest and it's only
when we prevent them from doing that by
enforcing other rules on them that it
makes it better okay
how does socialism address this
there are a variety of different
socialist systems that people might
hypothesize I think that people told me
to talk to Irish laddie before and use I
don't actually know what he is I know
there's also some man comes and stuff in
our chat I am pretty in favor of a large
state democratic socialism so you would
have a society in which there are
government organizations that you could
think of as I mean it won't be the same
but you could think of it as like
nationalized businesses right
nationalized sectors of the economy so
if you if you go to if you go to work
for that company you get paid something
and then you can use that money to go
and buy things from ok wait hold on look
so focusing on the specific question I'm
asking how to socialism get rid of those
incentives it sounds like the incentives
are still there the difference is that
well the incidents aren't there because
there are no capitalists because they're
private because all of the property
would be owned in public right a
nationalized industry doesn't have the
same incentives as a capitalist owned
industry so there is no profit there is
no profit ok so where do people who want
to invest in businesses come from why
would anybody make an investment in a
business or do anything that with any
level of risk people don't invest in
businesses because that's not how
because when all the property is owned
in public the decisions about where
investment goes is made by the
government as a whole
ok so how do you get like new technology
or new businesses or products that
people will if if you want new
technology or new products you the
government decides that they want that
and then they pay people to work on
those things do you think it's realistic
to expect that the government on its own
is going to come up with all of the
innovation that the private sector can
to the government on its own will think
of all of these ideas of better iPhones
or anything like that on its own left to
do its own devices or yes when you when
you talk about these people coming up
with ideas right all these ideas are
invented by people
who do that right sometimes driven by a
profit motive though some people might
hypothetically Bouma be motivated by a
profit motive but most of most ideas are
a come up with by someone on salary or
be come soon when who isn't yet the
owner of you know capital but then once
they come up with the idea they set up
the process of benefiting from that as a
capitalist right yeah but how do you
decide which ideas make it through or
not it's usually businessmen that decide
which ideas are viable and well invest
that money and that idea it does every
idea just get equal investment under a
socialist system or well so right if you
have a nationalized industry like I
don't know if we have any of those
anymore in the u.s. well if you had a
nationalized industry with the trains
then if you come up with an idea for how
to better implement you know a train
system you've presented to people who
are worked there and who are experts on
that train system and then they would
decide if the that makes sense for the
train system and you could apply that
across any hypothetical industry is
there any Society in all of human
history that has emulated this model
successfully and maintained the level of
innovation that capitalism has yes sort
of so there's no no one who specifically
implemented this system that I'm
describing because the only time it's
been implemented there has not they have
not allowed Democratic control over the
means of production to remain so there
are several societies that have started
implementing them and then mostly been
immediately [ __ ] over by some much
larger stronger country as soon as
possible I guess it just seems unlikely
to me that like a government board like
knowing how [ __ ] [ __ ] most people
are that some democratically elected
government board could make optimal
decisions about how to move forward in a
given industry well so a government
force is not going to make the optimal
decisions to afford an industry but then
again the market doesn't make optimal
decisions on how to move forward in
history either it's a question of
there's always going to be failures in
process somewhere no one's going to be
perfect but when you're looking at what
the government's failures are going to
be they're going to err on the side of
protecting people as a whole
whereas capitalist will err on the side
of [ __ ] over every other person for
their own personal benefit
okay I guess I just I have a really hard
time buying that there's like um like
this idea that you can just elect a
board of people that will know like all
of the best things to do in society and
will make all of like the right choices
for like technological innovation and
technological investment and that like
this magical board of people again that
just seems like so fantastical to me I'm
not sure there's a board of people who
make all these decisions right I'm
saying you you would fundamentally right
now at Apple right there's what really
happens is technically when you make
profits the people who benefit are
shareholders now a lot of shareholders
are on the board but realistically what
happens is you go up the process there's
a CEO who makes decisions to employ and
they're a whole bunch of them plays
below him that make decisions they're
whole bunch of employees below him that
make decisions all these people are the
people are actually making decisions and
some of them might be benefiting you
know as shareholders but some of them
might not be but if you just replaced
all of those people as shareholders with
not being shareholders they would be
able to make the same decisions of the
same quality they would just have
different incentives so for any industry
that is currently being run by any group
of people you can theoretically imagine
that the same group of people would be
running the industry they would just
have different incentives what if they
didn't have the interest in running that
industry of the proper motive wasn't
there do we not think that that would
ever happen well so here's here's the
thing if you if you got paid more for
doing you a good job then you'd probably
still want to work wherever you you know
could do the best job gotcha um I don't
know I just this I don't know okay well
called you have anything else for me I
mean do you want to walk back any
socialism is [ __ ] terrible and stupid
well no it just sounds like an act like
it sounds like a fantastical claim like
you have this world where people are
working out of the goodness of their
hearts for all of men boys I described a
single person working out of the
[Laughter]
my politics channel is revolting against
me not really that implies that they
were ever on my side my politics channel
is talking a lot of [ __ ] though and they
don't have a champion to send to me
Oh Thomas you're up to bat what's up my
dude yeah what are we talking about I
don't [ __ ] know pal you Poppi chose
you as her defender because apparently
she can't do [ __ ] papi gets bullied a
lot well pop he was bullying me so [ __ ]
papi
it's a vicious cycle when someone gets
bullied they stop bullying other people
too well well here I am continuing the
cycle alright what's your problem with
modern monetary theory I don't know it
just kind of sounds pretty me me to me
what about it sounds made me the fact
that a government can produce infinite
currency with no negative repercussions
does anyone say that finding money comes
with no negative repercussions that kind
of seems like the MMT argument that I
heard earlier would you like to rephrase
it or something it comes without the if
you're talking about bankruptcy
specifically we mention anything about
bankruptcy I think mainly we're talking
about like inflation I guess no spending
money into existence definitely causes
inflation oh well what is what are the
central claims of modern monetary theory
because it seemed like that was the big
mean that they tried that the politics
Chad tried to sell me on before well the
government can't become insolvent or go
bankrupt by spending this money into
existence as long as soon as a grief I
mean if you play semantics sure
I mean economies and states can collapse
but I mean yeah technically they'll
never go bankrupt sure yeah so by
spending more money into existence that
does cause inflation but also you need
to spend more money into existence the
inflation needs to match the goods
produced in your economy well yeah it's
almost the entire point of the the
Federal Reserve the entire ideology
behind the Fed yes wait so what you need
say is part of the central bank that
monetary modern monetary theory would
explain wait so what new claims are
being made by modern monetary theory
none there's times that aren't generally
accepted wait like which claim isn't
generally accepted that governments
finance spending by creating the money
endogenously doesn't have the whole
point of like quantitative easing and
[ __ ]
yes well if quantitative easing or
printing more money is something that
the Federal Reserve actively engages in
and how can you say that nobody believes
that it actually works I don't know
that's that's what I'm trying to figure
out what are we doing here are you that
what do we do you know we're supposed to
talk about I don't know you're you had a
pretty strong objection to I don't have
any I'm doing I don't know what the [ __ ]
I don't know what the empty all right
are we good the or anything I start to
bring up one stream now you've got the
floor yeah Ben Waldemar okay he's an
anti-semite all right all I can to it
okay all right these are the people who
my politics Chet okay okay we're
bringing in the next one
pinata what's up my dude oh boy hello
what are you here to talk about tonight
do you want to talk about how you're I
mean people say you're leftist but I
would say you're probably center-right
to me Oh live at best and that if like
you said before if you had Rubio or if
you had any other person that was
trumped ahead similar ideology but was
not an offensive person you would have
voted for I what I don't think I said
that well rather than argue about
potentially ambiguous I think I said
like Rubio would have been better than
Trump and I might consider Rubio over
Hillary I'm not sure but okay cuz like
when I heard you say that I was assuming
you thought like Rubio over Hillary I
mean I don't know why there was created
Hillary killer
oh yes I already but honestly I probably
always on the nose I probably would have
always been swayed to Hill away though
if anybody would have ever brought up a
Supreme Court argument that's like the
one big thing that probably always would
have swayed me to a Democrat but but
okay so what's up
Oh um now that I'm on I'd like to talk
about Mexico and the constant issue you
have that keeps being brought up yeah
what's up I every race realist is that
they keep talking about immigration from
Mexico and the immigrations coming from
Central America and that immigration is
inherently required like an aspect of
American imperialism with in the Central
America and America is in general that
they keep talking about how we have
these issues with all these people that
we don't want them they're low-skilled
low immigrate like the people we don't
want but the people were getting simply
because of the drug wars that we have
kind of perfectly perpetrated and the
drug war is that since the Monroe
Doctrine which when it first was put in
like we didn't actually have any
military to back it up but since then we
have in extract like we have changed
military policy economic policy of most
Central American countries and now we're
kind of reaping the issues with it okay
sounds like I wouldn't probably disagree
with anything you have to say on the
story Bob but I think it's something
that if you actually brought up with
them would make a better argument that
the drug war and our relationship to it
and how we have treated similar
countries they would say oh I totally
agree that US foreign policy is [ __ ]
we should fix our foreign policy but
that doesn't necessarily mean I want
those brownies coming to my country
that's what their response will be would
you not say that they're not really
immigrants they're coming as refugees
and then if we could actually help their
countries out they might want to go back
there thus negating the fact that that
becoming an American citizen they would
argue that it's not our responsibility
as America to be invested in the success
of other countries while there are
natives suffering here I don't want to
invest money in a foreign country also
most of these people as long as you're
brown they don't distinguish between
illegal immigrant immigrant or refugee
Nick Fuentes demonstrated this during
our debate oh okay yeah with Nick
specifically so the argument of that we
don't want to spend money on those
countries but we've already spent money
to [ __ ] up those countries and we're
still spending money there to be there
and continue to [ __ ] yeah so what you're
calling is the sunken fallacy cost just
because the sunken cross policy just
because we've invested money there you
know what let's play this game I'll
argue the race wheel aside okay I don't
want brown people coming to our country
because most of them are low-skilled
immigrants I don't want them hurting
native wages and also I don't want them
coming over here I don't want to miss
money in those other countries and that
money could be better spent here in
America when do not argue that if we
could have money spent in their country
they could become a more prosperous
country with another sphere of influence
thus becoming being able to help our own
economy but yet they could stay in their
country where they would want to go
because no other absolutely would not
risk a single native life for the
well-being of a single native to
potentially bolster another country so
that they can potentially become a
successful trading partner to the United
States that's ridiculous if I want to
risk native life continuing the policy
we have now that can kill Americans over
here with I don't want to continue the
policy we have I want to build a huge
wall I want it to be manned
I want it to be strong will put jobs
there now will put people on the wall
will fund it will make sure that
everybody stays out of this country that
doesn't belong here
we'll start by rounding up everybody
that's here illegally so that we can get
people to respect our laws we're doing
it by getting rid of daca we'll export
them all back to Mexico or Central
America wherever they came from and then
we'll build a really strong border wall
and then we'll keep them out of the
country so you have daca which are
people involved in the drug trade you
have a wall that would not actually end
the drug trade and you're not you
haven't mentioned actual American
citizens or American migrants who have
become citizens or I mean now we kind of
can't deport them well if they're here
and they are said to stay but daca
people aren't here as citizens they're
here illegally about yeah but they're
not the ones participating in the drug
war that's claiming the American lives
it's not just about the drug words the
fact that this country was made for
America that we are all of our policy is
geared towards helping Americans and now
we've got 800,000 people that are
leeching off of American policy that
their parents brought here illegally but
you brought up the point of saving
American you don't want to lose a single
American life for them yet the issue
being when it comes to American lives at
least around the border it's not really
like that
chickens but it is Mexicans I don't know
any other Central Americans that come up
with what do you mean Americans are the
ones that are having the demand of the
ones that are helping it move across the
border Mexicans life that not a hundred
percent Mexicans involved in drug trade
a large portion of it is is Border
Patrol looking the other way and we're
being paid sure but we can uh we can
punish those Americans that are involved
with that as well by enforcing the laws
that we have here on this country that's
not an argument for bringing more
Mexicans over here we're not even bring
Mexicans over here what we're seeing
Guatemalans we're seeing Colombians with
anybody from Central America yeah but
they're they're fleeing the violence
that we're perpetrating so if we said oh
I agree that's bad we should stop that
violence but that still doesn't mean I
want them in my country well if we
helped them actually get their country
into some sort of working order which
we've already [ __ ] up well where does
that stop do we need to go help every
single country in South America how much
money is an appropriate amount one you
just need to stop help them that
eventually those people say say Brazil
falls apart but the Brazilians kind of
get stuck at the the Isthmus and Central
America we could you know we could work
with them and prevent that I'm just like
how Turkey is being helped by he was
helping Turkey to pretty much prevent a
lot of limited funds available to us
we've got people that have coming back
from the Iraq war that are committing
suicide at five times the national
average for women and see that's a
totally different argument but it
doesn't matter you we have money that we
need to spend to fix our VA that we need
to spend fixing our own American lives
and you want to spend all that money
trying to help another country that
might even be beyond salvation almost
like money you want to spend money
considering how much money we've already
spent money we've already spent I
already agree with you that that money
was spent incorrectly but that doesn't
mean I want to go and spend more we can
easily reallocate money anywhere the
amount of money we spend on I mean
there's a significant number of things
that we waste money on we waste money
with health care we waste money with all
the foreign aid we can do that you
probably want to eliminate being erased
realize we have military we get caught
from
I don't want to cut our military and
weaken America's present most of our
American military spending is foreign
aid it's not even American it's not like
American military for the American army
most of our military is foreign a that's
not true not foreign aid but it's it
basically what we do is we a lot of our
military spending which is just we want
ok hey can you company X build this many
tanks we don't even use the tanks mainly
what we do is we give the tanks away and
we we keep those businesses running by
selling parts to foreign countries ok I
was part of foreign aid like our
military spending is not even directly
related to America or American defense
well then we can cut down on that
spending as well if you think that
that's not necessary that's bill number
reason spent money in other countries
we're cutting all that down it'd be much
easier too if we were afraid of mass
immigration to create like you know a
stoppage point Central America if we
work on well East even just work on
Panama why can't our baby our borders
that are to our country would rather try
and patrol the Mexican American border
or like the Panama Canal I don't want to
spend money patrolling the Panama Canal
unless we want to take over Mexico are
you implying that we should invade
Mexico and most of Central America and
then take over the Panama Canal and
enforce our I just take over panel the
panel canal we kind of already do but we
would have to take over in Mexico as
well then in order to be able to market
mexico because we want a place it's like
cut off from our country well ok if we
if we work with those other countries we
can get a net benefit from them here's
the part you keep missing I don't care
about net benefit from other countries
if America's economy is a little bit
slower so that we can maintain our own
country spend money on our own NATO's
that's fine America doesn't have a
responsibility to go and help other
countries in South America or Africa or
the Middle East or a million other
countries that everybody's gonna want to
help if we start dumping a ton of money
and also I don't even think you can fix
those countries those countries have
been [ __ ] for hundreds of years why do
you think that America dumping a bunch
of money into it is magically gonna fix
it that's ridiculous because we're the
country that [ __ ] up originally yeah
but they were [ __ ] before we ever got
there our countries like what 200 plus
whole years old barrel oh I mean if
you're gonna use that argument you could
say like Africa is [ __ ] but that
doesn't prevent the you know
colonialization that kind of
extraordinarily helped yeah we should
stop we should stop Kelowna colonial
izing them - I think imperialism is
wrong I agree
there we can stop imperialism that still
doesn't give me a strong argument to go
and help other countries oh oh we don't
really need to have a strong urban issue
if we want to protect the white people
well anything about white people you
extrapolated that if we want to protect
the Americans okay
even though apparently the designedly
brown people why do you keep saying
brown people you're the one that's
making it about race I just don't want
people from Central America coming here
well you said the same thing about
Mexicans brown people like you said that
in the earlier devil's advocate aspect
of this oh I misspoke I just meant I
don't want Mexicans or Central Americans
here or people from South America I
don't want criminals and rapists and
murderers like Europeans are fine well
yeah most of the Europeans that come
over here are fine they're
underrepresented in our crime stats yeah
workers criminal they're fine or is it
just Mexican no not a criminal but high
school labor that's contributing to the
economy in a positive way not leeching
on the welfare system and all not being
a fiscal drain on the state so if we
were able to create harsh border control
punitive measures to make sure we really
quickly extradite or not extradite yeah
or deport Mountain yeah either way
deport any perfectly and criminal from
Central or Mexico so to Central America
if we actually created the border more
or less at Mexico and yet created
another one by Panama and kind of
partnered with them in order to prevent
any Senate or South American immigration
don't you think that would be a stronger
reason and as we helped not even really
helped but or moderately generous and to
the point where kind of just stopped
[ __ ] with countries and stopped
creating a demand for for drugs and more
or less either legalized or
decriminalized to allow Americans to
basically create their own drugs so that
we won't have to rely on Mexican in like
shitty Mexican drugs we could then
collect all of the skilled labor from
there as they can flee their country is
although the skilled labor to want to
leave because they no longer have the
same kind of economy they have because
of the demand that we created for them I
mean we can do all of these things by
just building a strong border wall I
don't know how you think we have to go
into these
the countries and help them well does it
even if we create a strong border wall
the drug demand is going to continue and
if we continue to have it illegal we're
gonna continue to see violence come over
here where can we continue to see I mean
if we really want to are so more in
favor of legalizing drugs here then and
then this so if you legalize drugs here
build the giant wall Mexico and build a
wall by Panama we would helping I don't
want to do a military invasion of Panama
and making a giant wall there I don't
want to fund that I don't want to help
mix what about people that so legally
immigrated from X I know home Panama
okay so wouldn't we want to kind of
prevent South America for coming up
there what about people coming in from
Mexico well you said we're gonna build a
wall right well why would we build two
walls well because one is externally
smaller and it's a lot easier to get
what could take by boat and get to
Mexico and then come in through the
other wall I think we should just focus
on one wall just focus on one wall but
if you want to focus on one wall people
are gonna come across some boat and then
plane oh yeah but it's much easier to
defend the American coast than it is the
Mexican coast really yeah we own America
we don't know in Mexico unless you're
advocating for a military takeover of
Mexico I'm not advocating for military
I'm navigating for military reduction
everywhere ok well how are we gonna
reduce our military everywhere but then
send enough people down to enforce the
Panama wall plus the coast of Mexico
plus the second well the Panama wall
exists we have a river across the
bisecting the entire zone how do all the
Central Americans get into the United
States illegally they cross the river
okay so it sounds like we don't have a
natural wall there sounds like people
and get across it it's much easier to
create a wall there than it would be
Mexico but that's kind of besides the
point I mean I understand the problem
you're trying to get at with that the
fact that race realists will not do any
of that I just think that for non
infernally disingenuous ones the
incredible problematic aspect that
American military is a military or
colonialization
when everyone called of Central and
Central America Mexico has created a
unstable
basically
destiny can you cover me to determinism
I understand how all actions can be
considered predictable and caused by
actions in the past however how does
that justify it to which of a finger or
a blink of an eye destiny okay so I
don't think I would say determinism per
se because there are some people that
will say well quantum randomness means
that the universe is never 100%
determinable because things can happen
at earnest okay so what I would argue
against is the fact that you have any
genuine free will or any genuine desire
or I'm sorry any genuine inspiration to
choose to do something that is free of
the shackles of your past right so
basically this is the entire argument
okay very simply let's say that I have a
let's say that we have a hill okay we'll
say that this is the top of the hill and
then we come down here to the bottom
okay we've got little mountains maybe
we've got like a tree all right if you
could physically measure the dimensions
of this hill exactly and you could set a
ball at the very top of this okay and
then you roll that ball depending on the
starting position of this ball you would
100% know exactly where that ball will
end up down here down to the atomic
position okay well maybe not because
quantum randomness might never but down
to like an immeasurably small distance
right you would know exactly where it's
going to land now if you want you can
make this course of awesome Tata kaliya
approaching infinite complexity where we
put more and more Hills we put little
rocks we put up big trees we can even
have like little water ponds or whatever
that the ball has to roll through we can
make this this thing infinitely complex
almost right we can do this and make it
now at no point in time will you ever
reach a point where this has gotten so
complicated that you can't tell exactly
where the ball is going to fall rote why
because we have laws that govern the way
that these things behave we have laws
that govern the way or that we
understand theoretically there are laws
and physics that govern the movement of
objects in our universe right so we know
that no matter what it bumps into every
single bump can be measured and
accounted for
and that
end of the day this ball will roll down
the hill and it will land in a precise
spot right so basically all this means
is that if you set an object in motion
right its path through space-time is not
only predictable but is absolutely
knowable right
assuming you can perfectly measure all
of the initial starting conditions so
the idea is that if we know this is true
at no point in your entire life
would you ever argue that when a ball
goes to bump something
well maybe the ball wants to go left
instead of going right you would never
say that because you know that when the
ball hits a point it's going to move in
the direction that the antecedent causes
predicted it would move to right like
that
you know what you just know where it's
going to go right it's got a velocity if
it hits something and then the action is
going to be or the reaction will be
predictable and it will go in a
predictable direction so the idea is
just that your mind is the same your
brain okay in your head is a oh my god
this guy's nose is huge I don't know why
I do this I'm sorry your brain is
predictable it's a it's an object that
is governed by all the normal laws of
physics and every decision every action
you make every everything that's
happened right will have preceding
causes that cause those things to happen
that at no point in time can your brain
summon from some other dimension some
sort of divine inspiration to make a
decision that is free of the universe
that it exists and that that concept is
fantastical and incredibly naive would
be my argument I don't know if everybody
necessarily believes this 100% but I've
never in my life heard a convincing or
remotely convincing argument against
so the way that we seem to deal with
this philosophically is um so I would
just say because I have no philosophy
background and I know I'm gonna irritate
the philosophers in my chat because I
say this all the time I would argue that
all of that your everything is
essentially deterministic that you have
no free will now philosophers don't like
this because freewill is necessary in
order to relegate like responsibility
and consequence and all of this [ __ ]
that we kind of need freewill to make
our moral systems work so what
philosophers will say is well we believe
that that the idea that determinism is
true but the idea that you can make
decisions without people like 100% force
you to make those decisions that that
freewill can be compatible with the
deterministic universe if we just say
that well freewill actually means you're
making a decision without somebody
holding a gun to your head to make that
decision but we don't actually really
believe in free well like anybody does
is what I think right but um yeah
destiny look at the induction problem if
we can measure everything perfectly it
wouldn't apply naturally I don't know
what the induction problem is or if
that's a philosophical question I'm
pretty sure based on my very limited
physics knowledge I don't think it would
be impossible to measure everything
perfectly because a system that's
contained within itself could not
measure itself perfectly because it
would be like an inescapable recursive
thing right if that makes sense I think
I think that's true physics right hi
poppy here I'm sorry
I want to bait you I am very shy
autistic and try to be careful about
what goes online please no bully do
feels
I like your stream Irish laddie is a
pervert creep even without complete
information of everything you can still
prove that free will doesn't exist
well I would argue that so the argument
would go with me is I would say okay
well if you think that people can make
decisions that are free of the physical
universe where does that the ability to
make decisions come from you would have
been the burden of proof would be on you
to point to some metaphysical thing on
it it's a pretty impossible argument i
purely say that I'm not religious own
but destiny is it actually possible to
do the same type of prediction that you
did with the ball with the human action
how is it possible to know what past
experiences will cause specific outcomes
is that something that is actually
measurable so the reason why I'm gonna
make a guess okay I'm not trying to
sound pretentious here even though I
know this sounds pretentious the reason
why you have so much trouble analyzing
that question is because to you what you
have you have two worlds in your mind on
one hand you have well this is the
physical universe these are the laws of
physics if every action is an equal and
opposite meme that you know an object in
motion stays emotionally we know these
memes okay we've got you know entropy is
increasing right we have these things
however we also have humans and human
ability to make choices and decisions
and the human mind and our human ability
to do things right the problem is that
you have these things in two separate
boxes but they're actually just one in
the same everything that you are as a
human is totally governed by the laws of
physics there is nothing in your mind
that is special that is unique that is
different than a rock falling outside
that been a tree falling over than a
leaf falling from a tree then a raindrop
falling from the sky that all of these
things happen and are perfectly governed
by the laws of physics much the same way
that neurons firing in your head are the
product of chemical reactions that all
obey the same laws of physics that all
of it is perfectly within what we
understand of the universe
nobody has ever Brandon experiment or
done a test of the human brain and found
that something was happening that was
metaphysical right although I guess by
definition you can't really test them
out of physical right but well I don't
know that's necessarily turn up but yeah
once you start to see these things as
being a electrochemical my eye on change
yeah once you start to understand that
the human brain is just as much trapped
and bound by the laws of physics as
everything else then it becomes a lot
easier to accept the idea that well okay
if that's true then any particular
chemical reaction firing in my head at
any point in time was probably caused by
prior chemical reactions much the same
as every single other physical thing in
the entire universe takes place right
that nobody nothing in the physical
universe just happens right nothing will
ever just start moving or right energy
can't be created or destroyed but only
you know transfer
from one medium to another or something
I think right how do you explain
consciousness if we're just ordinary it
makes sense to look at around and say it
responds to stimuli but it's way
different being in the driver's seat the
problem of consciousness is a hugely
complicated thing that's left up to a
lot of debate that I can't like I don't
know I can't solve that for you there
are people that are much much much
smarter than me that have contemplated
this question for probably millennia
right yeah my really premature
understanding of it the way that I
visualize it and this is with somebody
that doesn't this is of somebody that
hasn't read into it a [ __ ] ton but I I
view consciousness is just a thing that
exists to make decisions with that's how
I view it as right that typically with
computers we're usually dealing with
things that makes decisions
instantaneously they don't usually have
to like spend a lot of time thinking
about in wing options against one
another that usually the calculations
are pretty quick I guess I just view
consciousness as like a temporary
placeholder it's something that exists
to wait to wait between a and B is more
or less the experience that you have
right the reason why you are a conscious
being is because you are processing a
[ __ ] ton of stimulus stimulus stimuli is
the plural you're processing a [ __ ] ton
of stimuli at any point in time and then
you have to make a decision about what
you want to do in response to all of
that stimuli and that that
decision-making process the I'm getting
this information this information and
this information what should I do that
that process is what consciousness is
yeah that's that's what I believe
personally but that's totally that's a
100% subjective personal [ __ ]
opinion I don't know if that's true or
not and there might be reasons why
that's a really stupid way of looking at
things so I don't I don't actually know
I'm not sure so I think that this
illustrates a naive understanding of the
brain and I understand that's a really
mean thing to say but let me talk about
it what is the point of this who
actually believes they pulled the
decisions out of the eight ether every
decision is based on previous
experiences hold on one second destiny
do have strong feelings about US China
policy or Taiwanese independence my
Chinese / US political seminar professor
is a Chinese national and pretty anti
Taiwan it's pretty spooky stuff oh I
have no idea I don't know [ __ ]
anything about any of that I don't
I have no idea I'm sorry I have no good
opinions about that what is the point of
this who actually believes they pull
these decisions out of the ether every
decision is based on previous
experiences however your choice is not
predetermined you can make a decision
that is abnormal to the predicted
outcome so when you say it you can make
a decision that's abnormal to the
predicted outcome how this is this would
be my argument my argument would be that
if there was a machine of sufficient
complexity that could measure the exact
state of the brain that you could take a
snapshot of a person's brain and then at
that particular moment in time you
should be able to answer every single
possible outcome that that could happen
if you ask my question so let's say that
I took a snapshot of your brain and then
I said what's your pick a random number
right and whatever random number you
pick at that point I should be able to
do that to you and you'll pick the exact
same number that if you could measure
the exact state of a person's brain and
pose a question to it that if you would
oppose the same question to you your
physical self rather than just the copy
that the exam the answers will be
exactly the same every single time
assuming that the question is asked in
the exact same way at the exact same
point in time do you have any evidence
of this so like the evidence is is that
your brain is governed by all the laws
of the physical universe and there is no
Rev al ADRA's Intuit would be different
if the answer is different you would
have to answer why would there be a
difference right that if I were to take
a copy of the human brain at a precise
moment in time ask it pick a random
number and then ask him pick a random
number at the same time with the same
voice the same type of person in the
same everything right that both would
say the exact same answer if they would
say a different answer why would one
choose something different over the
other unless you believe that there is
some true randomness that the human mind
can access that is independent of
everything we know about the physical
universe which is an extraordinary claim
to make in my opinion what do you call
it if we have the ability to choose
between two decisions so when you go to
make a decision between two things
you're basically just weighing prior
experiences towards one another and then
whatever decision you make will be based
on what life has taught you to value
more as a prior experience right to be
very very very reductionist here let's
say that you beat the [ __ ] out of
somebody with a blue chair a million
times and then that person enters a room
and there's a blue chair in a pink chair
and you ask them to sit in one of the
chairs right assuming that person hasn't
been conditioned to enjoy pain they
would choose the pink chair not because
their freewill making a choice to sit
there but because their life a lifetime
experiences has conditioned them away
from the Blue Chair that's an absurdly
simplistic reductionist view of looking
at it but more or less like every
decision would be made in that way right
wrong again destiny through God all
things are possible
got them at the level of neurons there
is probably lots of quantum randomness
so again a lot of people would bring
this up as a counter-argument and I'll
just instantly concede it mainly because
it's boring but all instantly concede it
but the problem is that doesn't get you
anywhere if I say okay well sure there
might be some level of quantum
randomness that doesn't get you to
freewill that just pulls you a little
bit away from my deterministic position
which and I don't know enough about QM
to actually know if that's true or not
if Qi manifests on a macro level that
impacts our normal [ __ ] am I am i but
even if it does that doesn't matter it
doesn't give you free will it's not like
you have the ability to excerpt any kind
of influence over quantum randomness
right so yeah oh the guy four four five
yeah yeah you can argue that the
universe isn't strictly deterministic
because of quantum randomness sure I
don't know if that's actually turnout
but sure but I it's more just it's more
my commentary on the idea of freewill
rather than is the universe 100%
predictable or ever I say 100%
predictable because it simplifies things
but we could argue that it's 100%
predictable except for a few things that
might be left to truly random chance
that you can't and exert influence over
anyway right but um that would be but
that would be more complicated and
unnecessarily so you know I understand
why consciousness exists logically in
regards to evolution and fitness and
makes sense if you look at it from a
third perspective but why am i me why do
i control over myself its consciousness
in some sense ether all where where does
the fact that I am me in my head and not
have a set of chemical reactions
occurring arbitrarily on earth manifests
itself in the physical world so I guess
you could call this like a quasi Turing
test I don't actually even understand
the Turing test I've read a bunch about
it but it seems really meeting me but
basically what I would argue is that if
you could create a machine of sufficient
complexity that it could that it could
emulate emotions on the face and it
could communicate and then you were to
ask it questions that the act of that
machine weighing a one choice against
the other and then communicating the
weighing of those choices would it would
be a conscious thing right that it to
some extent it has that level of
consciousness I think the reason why we
don't really view computers is being
conscious things because we don't
usually ask them to calculate things
that
acquire them to weigh something very
complicated such that it takes a lot of
processing time and then such that it
such that it makes that processing like
empathetic to us if that makes sense no
wrong we don't view them the same
because they aren't organic I don't
think organic has anything to do with it
in my opinion
destiny I don't get why you're focused
on the time spent on thinking as a core
part of your definition of consciousness
I just view I think that um this is an
intuitive emotional thing let me see if
I can rationalize this out I feel like
if you make decisions instantaneously
the illusion of consciousness disappears
let me give you a few things to think
about in real life
zombies why don't some bees appear
contrast to you right if you look at
them like in movies or video games
zombies appear likely I lack
consciousness because they make all of
their decisions instantaneously because
they have very instant responses to very
basic stimuli right you make a noise oh
it goes over to and it walks there
another noise uh and then it attacks
something until it dies it appears like
a zombie has a no consciousness why
because you never see a zombie stop and
really think like should I eat this
person or this person or how should I
kill this person or what right you never
usually see a zombie stop and in like
actually like way a decision against
another thing right and I feel like that
kind of gives zombies the illusion of or
rather it makes it feel like they're not
really conscious because they're not
really weighing those decisions against
one another on the same thing with a
computer if you ask a computer or a
robot to do something like an Android in
a movie why do they always appear to
lack consciousness because you never see
any hesitation in the actions you ask
them to take they always do it
instantaneously they don't ever have to
weigh those decisions against one
another
but this is kind of like a fluffy
I get really really excited to talk to
you what are you excited about buddy
just having a conversation I think that
um maybe you're a little bit of a
platform for the all right we think it's
bad why do you think I'm a platform for
the own right because you host people
that are far less popular than you and
then they get more popular because of it
and they start the other videos gotten
more popular because of me Aidan paladin
no [ __ ] no [ __ ] was already more
popular than me when we initially spoke
I mean Aidan hadn't started yet but I
think she would have gotten about as
popular she was she's a girl on the
right that spews the [ __ ] talking
points she's not even that popular she's
like what fifty thousand subs or
whatever I mean that's still pretty
sizable though right I mean I guess but
I mean like I don't know like I guess I
would feel I would believe it more like
every video was like by the way on the
one that debated destiny but I feel like
she's kind of grown all on her own she
does her video she puts a lot of work on
throat and a lot of [ __ ] [ __ ]
people fall over to that side of the
thinking okay so what about this do you
think that there's more people who watch
you who are more inclined to go and like
be persuaded by the other side or do you
think there's more people who are
watching people like the no bullshit's
who are gonna be persuaded to come and
be more inclined to think like you I
think that I do I think that I give
people on my side strong arguments I
think that I bring people in the middle
over and I hope to foster doubt in the
hardcore supporters on the other end
although that's much more difficult
there is going to be some number of
people I guess that watch me that will
be swayed over but I would hope that
that number would be much much much
smaller than the other two groups I
don't know I just feel like when you're
talking about like the alt light the alt
right like they already believe such
like an unfalsifiable narrative that
there's no way to like sway them over to
you you know like maybe there's a little
the big problem that I have
I guess so like I mean maybe you could
argue that some of this is a bit of an
ego but the problem that I have is that
poppy that Google search doesn't prove
anything I don't know if you understand
how popularity works are growing your
brain works but just because you google
somebody's name in my name
comes up second doesn't necessarily mean
that I'm the only reason that they got
to the level that they did I mean maybe
she got a little bit of initial burst of
popularity off of it sure
but Aiden paladin is much smaller than
roaming millennial she's much smaller
than that black pilled chick she's much
smaller than Lauren southern she's much
smaller than you know any other number
of alt-right alt-right super popular
youtubers all of these guys got big
without my help there's no reason to
assume that Aiden popular only grew
because of me
sorry well I'm sorry what was your
initial question I don't know it was
basically the same exact thing I guess I
would probably argue the same that like
even if like it's possible for people
yeah I remember she said my problem is
that so this is kind of my current
belief right now on the current state of
like moral ethical philosophical
politics is that it seems like the left
has a certain position I'm sorry let me
back up it seems like in the United
States
maybe the whole Western world that we
operated under some a fundamental
assumption some first principles that we
stopped justifying to ourselves because
we were already past the question so in
the 60s we had to ask the question do
black people deserve the same rights of
the same access to institutions in the
US as white people that's a question
that we wrestled with the whole country
wrestled with it and we came to a
decision that yes they do deserve these
equal rights and then we've kind of
lived our life but the problem is as
we've grown and we've lived our life
we've that's a principle that we take
for granted now so when somebody like
Richard Spencer shows up and actually
questions that principle everybody finds
out that it's totally unjustified oh
well I have no [ __ ] idea if black
people deserve the same things as white
people or if women should be allowed to
have the same things men do and the
problem is these people on the right
that are challenging those first
principles have a [ __ ] ton of arguments
to use a gun stem which of course they
will there are valid claim challenges to
any philosophical position but everybody
on the left just goes oh well I don't
know I don't care I don't know that's
dumb stupid I don't want to engage with
that idea bla bla bla bla bla and then
what happens is election season rolls
around and somehow we have a [ __ ]
buffoon in office and nobody has any
idea how the [ __ ] could happened in my
opinion that's that's part of the
political landscape I guess I would
agree with that a little bit I think
that there's a couple things that it is
just a little bit wrong I don't know
later there's a difference between
having legitimate arguments against like
things that are pretty well accepted
like black people should have equal
rights and just having just you know
going off of like this are gone black
people should get married to fix theirs
situation I think it's like there's
definitely difference in like Sargon's
intelligence and like even if Nick
Fuentes like is pretty academically
dishonest like I think there's still a
difference tween his arguments and
Nick's arguments you see what I'm saying
they're like yeah sure but like again
like I think that um I mean this is like
I've gotten so much feedback and reading
the chaplet subreddit and reading a
couple different forums and then an
emails and stuff I've gotten and and
again like I understand that there's a
selection bias people that feel strong
enough to email me are always gonna say
the most positive things but I mean I
see a lot of people saying things like
oh I'm really glad that somebody is
actually out here that engages with
these people that gives us arguments to
use and like um something that I always
complained about on the stream in the
past is that when somebody starts making
an insult against me I always see other
people use it all over the place
well now when I use like different
arguments that I've used against like
immigration or I'm sorry in favor of
immigration or stuff like that I see
other people on my own I'm starting to
use those arguments like in the comments
section of my youtube vids or sometimes
people ship posting on 4chan or even in
the comment sections of other youtube
vids or on reddit so I mean like I don't
know I feel like it to some extent it
helps you know like the Fuentes debate
might have seemed like somewhat of a big
[ __ ] show but I think that he did come
off looking bad to a lot of people in
the center and that outline got passed
around quite a bit too that they had
thousands of hits on it which I call it
the second debater in the first debate
in the second debate okay yeah I'd
probably grew that's Saudi so to me what
this sounds like is Dave rumens free
marketplace of ideas and we should you
know like do you think that like Richard
Spencer should like have a place on
college campuses to go speak and like we
should do that because it's best to like
know how to challenge his ideas or yeah
but it seems like I do agree with that I
do think he should I think that
neo-nazis or anybody should have a place
to speak in America the difference is
though is that Ruben doesn't challenge
these ideas if I bring somebody on to my
stream I'm not gonna sit there and just
let them spew their platform if they do
because I'm not educated on the topic
then I always research it afterwards and
I'll invite them for a second discussion
the difference is that Ruben just lets
people come on and say whatever and ever
challenges any of the ideas I think
that's a difference I don't know but
like if the ideas are so fundamentally
flawed in the first place like why like
give it the time of day like I don't
know it's sort of like the same argument
why take like people off Twitter who are
like they'd I have no idea what they're
talking about to just come on and like
talk for a long time like what's the
difference week bringing somebody like
that on and bring
I don't know I guess no bullshit's not a
very good example because he does
anything that is remotely convincing to
say but like somebody of that caliber on
do want to watch something with me real
quick sure do you have a link to that
Twitter video of Richard Spencer on
Channel 4 News
the one with the black reporter yeah I
don't have a link to it but I've seen it
before
ok hold on I can find it real quick give
me a second are you a my Oh destiny Gigi
chat yeah oh wait no I'm not wait uh all
right now I am ok um one second that
page does not exist
yeah that's cuz I pasted it I think you
got it oh yeah okay let me know when you
have it up and we'll listen to it
together ok and I'll tell you want to
pause now this is really hard ok but
let's say that you're watching this ok
you're a white guy let's say that you
kind of feel like everything has kind of
gotten away from you like you used to
feel really comfortable in your country
and now people are telling you to be
guilty all the time about your skin
colour you hear a lot about privilege
and you're supposed to feel maybe
ashamed of being white or something
let's say you kind of have these
feelings inside of you whether legit or
not to tell you how these feelings now
we're gonna watch some of this interview
ok so are we starting in three two one
go
reckons have benefited from their
experience with white supremacy and we
just have to look at the real oh I'm
just gonna leave that out there
you know that is not even worth
challenging
ok let's pause a real quick at 12
seconds ok so the thing that disturbs me
about this video even more than this
absolutely idiotic interviewer is the
editing done here so that point is worth
addressing don't you think that
african-americans in the United States
are doing better than Africans in
Ethiopia so there's a you asking me you
know saying there's an element to that
isn't there
I mean maybe I don't know there is there
is if you're being honest if you land
and I'm asking you as a lovely versus
say you're somebody in the middle right
you would argue that Kanye West did
things in the United States as a
descendant of a slave that he never
could have done in African and countries
in Africa sure as a Sudanese right okay
that's to some extent true but it's
never addressed why all right watch all
seconds I'm gonna play again are you
ready yeah three two one go well I'm
quite conflicted about interviewing
Richard Spencer he's the leader of what
they call the alt-right which i think is
a new word for fascism and ordinarily
giving someone like that oxygen is
something I think journalists shouldn't
do but here's the difference Spencer and
people like him credit themselves with
providing the intellectual underpinnings
for the Trump revolution and I fear they
might be right this is a group of people
with very dangerous ideas that you've
had to do through the interview I'm the
interviewer I'm Darius life of an
African American in the United States
it's far better than any African living
in Africa so slavery was good for them
all right it looked they benefited from
being in a different nation than their
own no doubt really no doubt how can you
deny that so pause for a second right so
like this is all true so how am I
supposed to feel why is this bad I mean
like it's sort of like arguing with like
a conspiracy theorist right like you
kind of have to like be able to build up
all these you have to be able to break
down all these like super huge pre
assumptions that are just so widely I
don't know that people just don't even
really would make use to make an
argument in the real world so but that's
but that's the problem now so now if I'm
somebody in the middle who's lost and I
really don't have a strong thing but I
kind of feel like I've been a little bit
[ __ ] on by my country maybe I do go to a
college where there's a lot of sjw's on
campus chanting white privilege and [ __ ]
and I'm listening to this guy I mean he
makes a fair point so like in the
journalists I don't know if we even have
to watch the rest of the journalists
never encounters any of these points so
what am I supposed to the entire video
is Spencer making what appeared to me to
be very valid points everything he says
is correct and the interviewer doesn't
counter a single point how am I ever
supposed to walk away from this thinking
like wow that Spencer guy is crazy well
I mean you just don't do it at all like
you don't go in if you're not /
here'd I guess yeah so I would argue
that the interviewer here has a
responsibility to engage with Spencer on
a higher level but that if you never do
engage with them if you just let them go
online and you spear their platforms say
that instead of instead of watching this
interview say I was looking at it on a
website or on reddit or some armed poll
or so I'm sure that I would just listen
to his ideas going completely
unchallenged which they are here and
then I would just think that he's
correct because nobody brings up a
counter to it I mean okay so let me ask
you this do you think that like trumps
like CNN and all the major networks
massive coverage of Trump during the
election definitely help them out um
arguably yeah probably yeah that's
pretty honorable yeah sure yeah so and
obviously I think we can probably both
agree that Trump has some pretty
ridiculous viewpoints that don't really
need to be questioned so when the item
that what I don't agree with that but
I'm sorry go ahead
Trump diamond like things they like I
mean do you really think that it's worth
like arguing with somebody who genuinely
believes that like China made up climate
change to like slow down our
manufacturing I think it's worth
addressing those claims sure so that
people know that it's not true yeah but
you can never like with the alt-right in
the light you can never go on to
disprove it that's the thing though I
guess like you can at least work to
reasonable levels or at least you can
speak to some philosophical assertions
like in a like in this video right here
right with this conversation about
slavery benefiting African Americans
right there is a really simple question
if the interview had been prepared at
all that he could ask Spencer here do
you think that it's okay to forcibly
enslave a person if it ends up
benefiting them later on in life like
that would be a really simple that's a
really easy question that the
interviewer could ask and then it all of
a sudden that spin Spencer in a really
bad light because now Spencer
essentially has to defend slavery as
being morally righteous just because
some people might end up better off on
it so now you come away from that
conversation thinking much differently
right in theory that's what a rational
person would think that you know
yeah asking that question will really
expose something but do you really think
Spencer doesn't have an answer to that
question um he may or may not but at
least you're getting people thinking
rather than just leaving it up to chance
which is kind of what we're doing right
now if you argue that we should never
really question these fundamental
underlying assertions you're basically
just playing the game of who gets to
them first if you take some
disenfranchised white dude in the middle
who lives in a shitty place like West
Virginia
some [ __ ] and you know maybe he doesn't
like the fact that everybody you know
white privilege and all that [ __ ] right
you're pretty much playing the game of
who's he gonna turn on first is he gonna
end up seeing the right clip of Bernie
talking that really speaks to him or is
it gonna end up seeing the right clip of
Spencer talking that that's really going
to speak to him right it feels like
you're playing a game of chance at that
point I guess this is my point with like
Trump in the networks right I feel like
they did engage him in a pretty
reasonable manner and they definitely
did you know they would bring on
scientists and they would bring on oh
absolutely not
they never engage Trump in a reasonable
manner absolutely not
Trump got a ton of airtime he got a ton
of debate questions nobody ever
challenged him on anything I thought I
mean my biggest deals with the coverage
of Trump I thought it was grossly
irresponsible I mean do you really think
that like when they would what what
would they ask Trump when they bring him
on that was just like an easy question
on every debate it was easy question
after easy question every easy question
there was one time during one of the
debates where
[Music]
what was the guy's name Chris Wallace
was it there was one time during the
debate debate where Trump said that um
Trump said that [ __ ] I don't remember
the guys name I think it was something I
think it was the Wallace dude but
basically Trump said that he wanted to
slash the EPA's budget in order to fix
like Medicaid shortfalls and then the
guy brought up the fact that okay well
the EPA's annual budget is like 8
million dollars and the Medicare
shortfall shortfalls were in the
hundreds of billions of dollars right
stuff like that that's a really really
really good question and he nailed him
to the wall on that particular point
that was the only time in every single
debate that I watched during the
nomination question that anybody
actually forced Trump to answer question
oh I'm sorry no there were a couple
other times to when that one guy was a
Jake Tapper when he forced Trump to say
I would punish women for having
abortions when he forced him to say that
that was a really good interview as well
I really enjoyed that that he got too
hammered Trump down on one question but
by far the majority of media coverage
for Trump was grossly irresponsible in
my opinion I mean is it possible that
the reason it comes off as grossly
responsibe cuz every time they asked
Trump a question he's Eve able to easily
dance his way around it and you know
maybe it's on
maybe I assured the interviewers make
sure some fault in this that they don't
nail him down a hard enough but that
Trump just has all these answers that
are unfalsifiable and they can't ever
possibly get to the bottom of it because
Trump's logic is repetitive and it
there's no way to get prove him wrong he
might have answers that are
unfalsifiable but I sure as [ __ ] didn't
hear any most of his answers were just
flat-out [ __ ] rhyming fake news the
Wow am i dude what's up oh are you
excited not particularly but oh how you
doing how's life
um could be better but alright so here
we are in the flesh chatting to one
another
I love Poland random song from Twitter
missus this is the highlight of my week
definitely an effective strategy I agree
okay where do you want to begin my dude
I'll give you the option of directing
the conversation I honestly think we
should just go back to generally where
this started because track of it okay
sure
well it started with you tweeting at me
that I'm a short limp-wristed incest
defending beta male manlet that thinks
socialism is a viable option we can work
away back from there where do you get
the idea that I support socialism
curious I just was pulling that out of
my butt um okay I'll give you that one I
guess and then we've got limp-wristed I
give you that one I guess incest
defending we can focus on that one since
this seems to be such a fun topic yeah
what do you get the idea that I defend
incest
it's button we have a cold but I'll try
not to
um it originally starts with the clips
of you going well why is incest one that
one hence of all and I think that on
it's a direct affirmation you know
approval of incest like it's completely
morally correct it's I agree that it's
simply you know bringing up the topic of
discussion but so anytime somebody
questions something that any
that somebody takes for granted or
anytime somebody's got like like wants
to bring a discussion up like well why
is this wrong you think that that means
that they are explicitly endorsing it
it's not a little extreme mmm i I just I
okay let me collect my thoughts here
it's not necessarily if you question
something that on itself is not a you
know direct affirmation that incest is
morally it's it's more or less just to
opening up discussion I I agree but it's
wasn't that all I did when I asked that
question isn't it just a way to open up
discussion yes and that particular
instance however I guest was recently
looking at for your past it incest
debates with completely random people
such as myself and I disagree on why on
several of your points like yeah and I'm
sorry I have a cold I'm quite tired but
well I'm just like I'm curious I guess
you're gonna talk about a number so I'm
curious to hear it why do you think
incest is wrong I think incest is wrong
for numerous reasons and I think that
you have to look at it you know in two
different forums I think you have to
look at it you have to make different
arguments for heterosexual incest and
then homosexual incest so I think that
though or you know slightly different
arguments to be made against the two
well that kind of makes it sound like
you don't have any arguments against
incest then if you have to make
different arguments for different types
of it right if you can argue that incest
is wrong shouldn't you be able to argue
that all in size wrong the slight differ
different creations between you know
petals heterosexual incest and
homosexual incest overall I think that I
can argue fairly well that
of all is a bad concept but you also
have to go into further detail between
the two and you definitely have to make
that you know differentiation between
the two to stay
all right the same thing in my opinion
all right well which one do you want to
start with let's start with heterosexual
incest so the concept that incest is bad
is generally you know a social construct
that stems from the fact that humans
naturally want to with you know close
family members you'd see the fact that
there's possible repercussions
repercussions in terms of genetics in
offspring okay but couldn't you just
have protected sex yes that that's I'm
just stating quiet you know it generally
stems from yeah understand your state
but I'm so I'm countering your statement
with an argument to challenge the
validity of that statement you say that
one reason why people think that incest
is wrong is because of creating
genetically [ __ ] offspring so I
proposed the option to engage and incest
without ever having offspring right as a
challenge to that argument so it seems
like you can have heterosexual incestual
relationships without ever having
offspring yeah as a about that argument
that that's a perfectly you know valid
statement and that's why I think that
does somewhat of a between no sexual
incest and homosexual incest at least in
terms of that argument so I completely
agree with you there if it's purely just
to UM if it's purely just for the sake
of you know not creating a
however you want to describe it my
nation of nafse playing that is a
alternative to that so it's argument is
perfectly valid to defeat at that point
so it's this is more of a should it be
done rather than you know done with no
repercussions because I think yeah it
could be especially now in you know the
modern world it could be done without
any repercussions but well then let's
move on to the arguments that aren't
easily countered then okay I wasn't
[Music]
bring up but basically I think that
incest at its core is morally wrong
because of the different tips that you
develop with you
you know close relatives as you're
growing up I think it's much different
than that of someone who's in a
relationship it's I'm sorry I think
generally that I think generally that
waiting entirely if it's you know
distant relatives as opposed to close
little tips who are you to make a moral
judgment on the interpersonal
relationship that somebody else has with
a family member just saying that it's
mmm I need to face some stuff because
I'm not the best at articulating my
points okay as he can tell but I think
that these interpersonal relationships
just growing up I generally you know
different than those of which she would
you know
you ship the young relationship with
that person you know who you're a couple
with would be much different than one
with your siblings at least growing up
because children all right you know
little children aren't thinking about
that well no one's talking about little
children I never advocated for
pedophilia saying that but I'm just
saying when you're growing up as a child
the relationships that you're going to
be developing aren't going to be based
off of you know well you know you know
romantic relationships they're going to
be based off of friendships and Buzz you
know I'm having trouble describing my
walls but yeah you see what I mean
hopefully if not just tell me because I
can be quite well it sounds like yours I
think that children grow up and they
form certain types of relationships I
mean that are unique in the family
structure I don't disagree with this but
I'm I guess I'm asking what is your
moral argument against incest like what
my moral seems like a non sequitur so
morally all of this is originally it I
thought that wasn't too much of a gray
area now that I'm looking into it it
definitely is
it's wouldn't you I think okay let me
can you say that that's slightly
interesting because I feel like earlier
you tweeted that there was no gray area
my I did I literally asked you a single
question I just asked you why it was
wrong and your entire argument has like
fallen apart why are you such a mean
person online I'm curious okay so um
honestly I think that with you at least
in particular
because you do let it get to you
I'd let why got to me insults no I don't
I you just black up and move on my dude
that's why I didn't like respond to you
hardly at all I know but it's in my
opinion the fact that he did respond
prove my point
well I responded because sometimes I
firm content by taking people that act
very confident online and then bringing
them into a verbal setting where every
single thing that they said online
starts to look like a satire of itself
because you've completely fallen apart
when I posed you like a single simple
question
so I mean you kind of whoof were falling
a little bit far behind on the on the
make me look like a I'm hold on which
one was it a hobbit a little bit boy
getting ass blasted by whichever guest I
bring on are you one of those guests
that's ass blasting me right now most
definitely not I agree that I'm falling
apart that six I'm a loser why is it
irritates me because like you acted very
very very very very mean online and you
made some very strong statements but now
that I bring you on here you sound like
one of the most incest supporting people
that I've ever talked to you don't have
a single argument against incest due to
the fact that I'm I can't really
articulate my points too well
typically when it's online it's
difficult or you will fat Widow
definitely because it's you miss all the
connotation of actually you know talking
someone but it also gives me the time to
think out you know what I'm going to
wanna so you tweeted this like almost 20
like over 24 hours ago contra is this is
controversial ethics to a [ __ ] redneck
but to the rest of the intelligent
population it is universally a bad thing
like it sounds like you you have a very
strong opinion on this but you can't
articulate a single intelligent thought
as a defense yeah I am really bad at
that but it's kind of thinking
not necessarily how I would put it but
it's when you're actually you know
that's why I'm saying that this is a
very good strategy that you use it's not
a strategy I just brought you on you to
have a conversation I haven't I haven't
insulted you I completely go with me I
just asked you a question
no you just read yourself no that's the
point it's when you that's the you know
point of it at least how I see is you
know people do act much differently
online than they would you know when
actually talking to the person but uh
yeah it's I'm actually I'm a little bit
curious okay let's do a little exercise
in empathy how do you think it feels
from my perspective when I get a million
people like you that are tweeting under
Ian's little wing to try to like throw
up totally random insults at me saying
that I'm a socialist or that I'm an
incest supporter and then when I talk to
them most of them end up sounding like
you not that you sound particularly bad
I mean you are about on the same level
as most other of these types of drones
that I bring on like don't you think
like that's a little annoying like does
Ian have to do with a hit oh I didn't I
assume that you came from his crowd who
did you see - yo I I honestly don't even
remember but ya know I think it just was
I saw you generally with insults I'm
completely fine with people insulting me
because I'd be a massive hypocrite if I
wasn't okay with that I mean and there
are tons of things to himself I don't
care about insulting you
it's the the I don't even care about
being insulted that [ __ ] is fun for me
I've been on the internet my whole life
okay insults are fun for me the annoying
part is when I get misrepresented so
like how can you call me a socialist
like you said that you were joking but
you reference socialism in multiple
tweets you asked if socialism is where I
draw the line and then you said that I'm
phenomenally [ __ ] or a horrible
person based on a belief that you just
admitted you have no idea if I actually
even support I was do you think that
Sweden actually has bomb attacks on a
daily basis on a daily basis but they
definitely do have
terrorist-related tax at a much higher
levels and you know other countries and
I think that what is relatable do you
know how many terrorist attacks Sweden
has had this year there's also a gray
area to that because the government um
the Swedish government doesn't
necessarily classify all of these
attacks as terrorist attacks can you
give an example of a terrorist attack
that happened in Sweden that they didn't
classify as a terrorist attack
oh it's getting pretty sweaty man in
here hold on hang it on the fan on
hello um yeah I'm just yeah I'm sorry I
mean like yeah there are definitely
problems in Sweden right now I would
even go as far as to say there are
probably problems with Muslims in Sweden
right now but it seems like the
hyperbole doesn't really help the
conversation well in terms of socialism
I what's it I think necessarily to miss
was a misrepresent you mostly I guess
was I asked but well who's even who even
advocates for socialism
look at those applies for that comment
because that's it's definitely uh I
definitely was quite pleased with
reaction I got after that well like is
so that's how you determine like who's
actually advocating for a position as
you make a tweet and then you see who
responds to you I'm not necessarily
saying that you advocate for socialism
well you're saying that random people
that tweeted advocated for socialism did
anybody that usually had it even start
to defend socialism well hold on let me
I'm getting that but ain't necessarily I
didn't necessarily mean to myself as any
nor do I think you actually defend
socialism or advocate for it another
what but I don't think that the it's I
don't think that's the main topic here
which is getting a little off track but
if you want to keep on it I'm fine we
can go wherever you want to go here
just was looking at the Swedish thing
sorry for being so disorganized and
discombobulated I am quite nervous
because again it's this is a quite smart
D when you just Paul and the people from
Twitter to defend and make an argument
well I guess it's just it's just a
little bit irritating on my own to see
that somebody that would have so much
[ __ ] to talk on Twitter like when they
talk to me they like have nothing to say
I don't know that's just do you see how
that could be a little frustrating on my
end I guess I definitely do I'm a
disorganized mess but I I think that's
more to me because I've I think that
mm-hmm okay
I'm regular this um again I apologize
for being so completely disoriented all
right well hey do you want to call it
here buddy uh yeah if you want me off
the you know straight you can talk for
as long as you want but if you're if you
feel like the conversation but come to a
close we can call it here if you want no
cuz I've been a little disoriented and
discombobulated so I would like to try
and come off of this not looking like a
complete total jackass so um which I've
Enoch said looking like because I
haven't really made any valid points as
of yet I let's see
okay so just now that I've forgotten my
thoughts somewhat collected it's in
terms of why you know the original point
on why incest is um crap I'm eating the
chat and mmm don't worry in the chat
dude whoo that's yeah that's a it's
gonna stir it you know wolf now imagine
trying to do this on a daily basis
except it's all over your Twitter all
over your social media all over reddit
and then on random forums about you to
who you're getting at is a glimpse into
my life oh I can mmm again I really
don't want to come off as a hypocrite so
that's uh you be waited my copypasta
otherwise is what I'm talking about
it's in terms of like you know getting
insults I honestly think that it's as
long as you as long as you can
you know insult someone but then take it
when it comes to acted back at you I
think it's completely you know I think
there's nothing wrong with that oh I
agree I agree just as much i insult
people though I expected I guess was
rambling on Twitter so well but it's
just but now but ideologically attacking
me is different if you want to call me a
if you want to call me a limp-wristed
limp-wristed that's totally hard but you
said that I defended socialism and I
defended incest now these are
ideological disagreements that are
patently false you might actually think
I'm a beta male manlet which is fine or
that I have a limp wrist which is also
fine but a socialist supporter yeah no
no I'm just saying that like the it's
just the misrepresentation of arguing
I guess is a little bit irritating and
an incest supporter who yeah that's uh
yeah I know the cat is truly amazing
yeah in terms of that and
misrepresentation with the with the
socialism argument yeah I understand you
were just moving on that I guess I got
you there yeah I got it up in a second
tweet but we'll go ahead and say you
were moving there sure carried off with
the people applying but so I not
necessarily directed to achieve but of
with the incest argument I really
haven't
it's what's off what's the skull about
this is is your extrema and so when you
me now on YouTube it's usually in large
chunks and so it's it's quite difficult
to still to see that and make it cuz
concise point based off of that but in
any case it's I think I I disagree that
incest is morally ambiguous I don't
think that those you know I think that
there is some what there is a small gray
area yeah I'm dying on this is gonna be
I'm gonna die on stream well what is why
is it morally wrong then I guess that
brings us back to the initial question I
think it's morally wrong because it
destroys families um and also that in a
personal relationships which brings me
back to that well what do you mean by
destroys families what if everyone in
the family is cool with it I'm getting
to that
it's I think it's you have to be some
kind of messed up to just you know think
that it's completely morally okay and I
think the reason for this is if you're
so in if humans are so intrinsically
ingrained with the instinct to you know
be so opposed to incest that I think
that there's definitely that definitely
has to be something what about people
that made the same arguments against
interracial relationships people that
were revolts by people that look too
different than them do you think that's
a good argument that interracial
relationships are morally wrong
mmm I've gotta collect my thoughts on
that cuz that's actually a really good
point but um it's humans are naturally
you know drawn to people that are like
them they you know prefer to be around
it's just that's one of our instincts
that's of which civilization is founded
upon people natural you know humans are
social creatures and they naturally
really want to you know the they are
more attracted to people that you know
look like them act like them I similar
to them
that's generally you know again how
civilization has been formed as people
go you know it people form groups based
off of you know similarities so um so
what the idea that you're kind of
engaging with is the idea that we can
extrapolate morals from our intuitive
biological feelings so if you think
that's well because you're basically
saying that if you have an innate
revulsion toward something it is morally
wrong but I don't know if you want to
make that argument because I can ask you
I told you guys my [ __ ] hate that guy
hey what's up dates they hurt your
[ __ ]
I maybe did you and [ __ ] a Greek have
a bone to pick that's what he C was
talking [ __ ] right yeah I don't like the

pound well you got lots of times but I

there's nothing to say other than you
being a platinum for past a year I'm in

OH
only interrupted your muskies busy day
I'm playing Minecraft of your son I love
those I might by the way thanks cream
dusty you used my misfortune one time to
win one of your debates I saw that [ __ ]
on goddamn phone how did I use your
misfortune to win a debate no listen you
were talking somebody you're like yo you
ever heard of this guy Mitch Jones he's
like he like super Internet and like he
had everything he he lives as his
parents he's rich or some [ __ ] like that
you were going in about it and like I uh
you used my unfortunate situation to win
one of your goddamn debate I could find
the AH chil no it's somewhere out there
but like I was just wondering and
unfortunate that it can be used to
debate people with like this that's it
that's a booty right there um maybe I
don't remember this [ __ ] I mean I I
think I've watched you like in a debate
before but used your misfortune to win a
debate that sounds pretty rough debating
something about how
[ __ ] and you were saying how my life is
goddamn easy or some [ __ ] and like or
some [ __ ] how I don't [ __ ] I don't
remember is some [ __ ] like that well it
was funny I just thought was funny I saw
how just wondering if you actually
thought my life was really just a [ __ ]
show we were laughing at it that's
that's basically I think you I think he
has some problems you're working to but
I don't think I ever like hardcore talk
[ __ ] about you buddy talk [ __ ] I was
saying that you referenced something at
my misfortune front that's not talking
[ __ ] you literally you could Lily talk
about my penis in the debate and I'd be
like that's funny so I don't go yeah I
actually like you testing I think the
you be a funny guy man and I think you
would even have a bone to pick with like
or whatever the [ __ ] I don't know what
it is the weight and you have an issue
with the train wreck so what he said I
don't are yeah well I mean the clip was
pretty bad but apparently saying it was
just like satire or whatever so I mean I
guess oh my god oh my god she just got
$250 guys thank you there's not expected
oh no she X no look oh yes the X DX DX
okay yeah check this out checks out
checks out at listen this destiny just
listen listen everybody be quiet okay
okay you listen gusty wait yeah wait is
train wreck Siri eat a train wreck so
you gotta tell up inch that he has to
shower okay that shady was talking about
yesterday is not acceptable right I'll
shower right after your list of this
okay okay clear man clear man clear man
clear man clear vent listen to this
listen somebody like Mickey Jones right
you pollen stream at all I know a little
bone yeah so this is a guy that's had
like a lot of problems financially he
owes his ex-girlfriend like forty
thousand dollars not a problem
anything studying come off his
leadership and his parents are rich he
lived in US and then he lived in his
dad's extra house while he took off a
year from streaming yeah I think so I
think the context of the conversation it
had to do with something like like poor
people can't afford to make as many
mistakes as rich before and I think I
used you as an example here because you
admittedly right you've had some
problems in your life but thankfully
you're in a station in your life where
you can absorb a lot more trouble than
other people because you're more wealthy
right I think I think I was using you to
illustrate that point but it was like
you were using my misfortune with my
Lucia and don't think I don't see you
white nightmare on Twitter don't think I
didn't see you in her [ __ ] DMS homey
alright I see you up in there dude i DM
nurse I think we tried it
we've totally created a total like four
messages I think dusties try to get some
extra twitchcon yeah I mean okay it's
all good destiny we good though nobody
say life's a city white night huh was he
like just he just comments on her [ __ ]
and so he okay I literally asked her
what the deal with the car was cuz I was
curious if that was like a true thing

where the [ __ ] Mary lives my dude listen
I'm just trying to get in on that sweet
drama okay if I'm with position close to
the mirror the music get closer to him
buddy [ __ ] good alright we cleared
our [ __ ] now's your turn eight I'm not
gonna talking to more in a more
appropriate atmosphere because you know
that this is more of a loud this is more
of a clown fiesta and I'd like to talk
to them in a more in a more controlled
environment where him and I can actually
you know get our thoughts out and you
know have a little more of a serious you
know yeah okay so you're gonna go lean
on it no I'm not I'm awesome
this is it could turn into a debate if
you disagree this whoops what are we
looking at in what I meant and then if
he disagrees still then we will go into
debate if he doesn't then I'll be like
okay cool give each other hand jobs
we'll move on okay yeah yesterday

want to hear there's me some
residentsleeper because it's not gonna
be crazy 8 it's gonna be goddamn [ __ ]
this [ __ ] show that's in a goddamn you
know lost boys just naked short make it
two minutes actually talk to him that's
why i don't actually talk to him so
that's right he's right hey listen
listen mate he's right here
talk to him he [ __ ] he goes to bed
early sold okay why cuz you were right
there in my room did I [ __ ] you no did I
give you a [ __ ]
no but the end of the day you were right
there correct so sometimes it's not the
appropriate place to give you a [ __ ]
sometimes I gotta wait two weeks you
know sometimes it's better to wait fewer
works no imagine if I would have given a
hands on flip and I would have ruined
everything between us your eyes whereas
next pack South next time imagine all
the [ __ ] between us I can give you a
goddamn hand job we can shoot to the
ceiling there you go dude delayed
gratification is one of the signs of a
mature mind what wait what happened what
you said source watch it I just spaced
out delayed gratification it's like the
mark of an educated complication the
gratification of realizing that if he
gives you a [ __ ] immediately even
though it might feel good now it would
be even better if you would wait later
that delaying your personal
gratification to none of these words are
that big read come on I wasn't one of
those guys that that can talk the talk
but can't walk you know I'm saying well
I mean I walk on loose now anymore
it's you sound smart but you're not that
smart you're like one of those guys that
sounds I mean I don't think I'm that
smart but I think what you like black
your way for a debate by luck like RNG
do you think I like I open a thesaurus
and I throw darts and I pick the correct
word
we know you like I know exactly I didn't
I've seen you google or you go straight
to Google in wit okay sure
Thanks alright destiny the road I just
want a debate
I beat destiny the debate let's make a
t-shirt that's minion rather he'll hide
ice cream fails yeah
you've always open that it's like I
really saw you the other day talking
[ __ ] about twitch and like you got some
bubble something like holy [ __ ] no the
best thing I livestream fills our is uh
big idols are so it's so great insta
games like when I was explaining on my
side of it to to destiny on my stream
yesterday they titled it train wrecks TV
calling out destiny I was explaining my
side yeah when I say this [ __ ] about
like see do or whatever with this
[ __ ] something about like
controversial topics but they like took
everything into context like what with
it yeah I mean well yeah that's like
journalism 101 you do clickbait titles
to get people to click your [ __ ] right
what if it makes you look that with your
they don't care they're not running PR
for you why would they care if they make
you look better or not anyways if you
weren't talking that we can talk now if
you want to talk now Oh champ talk Paul
champion okay so can I stay here yes you
could stay jersey nobody asked me if I
wanted a disdain here oh you want to do
it later I fully understand is the first
of all you know that there's a girl
giggling back I think I think ape should
do on history okay I don't I don't care
any time I love talking dude I can talk
whatever as well I just wanted a more
like with you at least I just wanted a
little bit more of a Mila girl can leave
yeah Oh a peaceful atmosphere or not
peaceful just the calming soothing you
know does that make sense yeah I'm
calmly
he was Felipe I think so if I could
assume what he's saying he's not saying
you have to leave he just doesn't want
people interjecting like giggles every
like two words I'm thinking if you guys
want to stay just mute your mics and
I'll talk to destiny and we'll get her
yes yes don't vaping my fish okay okay
you want to talk now you want to talk
later it's up to you it's it don't
listen to chat about people's things
here yeah yeah okay you want to talk now
sure yeah I don't know we're talking
about but oh wait music Jesus [ __ ] come
on Mitch okay okay so here we go okay so
obviously you know it's it's not only
you there is you know that there is a
lot of people there are a lot of people
that are upset or they they took it you
know in the way that it looks that it
exactly looks to be to be completely
honest with you what are your thoughts
on it like what's your initial take well
I mean it kind of it just sounded like
some Insull big cow stuff do you take me
you know using your you know yeah I mean
you know even a so once someone is
logically inclined or they have some
sort of like self-awareness uh-huh they
can kind of look at another I'm not I'm
not saying they can you know accurately
depict who he is but when you look at me
do you take me as an insole um I really
don't know I've no I haven't heard like
enough of you to have like an accurate
assessment of that
like if somebody held a gun to my head
and they were like we need you to give
us a readout like a percentage chance
that train wrecks is an insulting I
would be like I don't know maybe like 15
20 30 percent I'm not sure I don't know
I don't really know enough about you so
I was more just commenting on the clip
but I owe you I mean I guess from this
you have any questions should I explain
to you what I like what exactly are we
accomplishing like what are we doing are
we just explaining I have no idea my
guys called me in here that was saying
that you wanted to talk oh no my chai
was saying that you wanted to talk
oh that's awkward well I'd like
something specific you wanted
talk about oh no I just wanted it I just
I I wanted to clarify yesterday's
comments you made toward me about you
know the stuff you said which I don't
necessarily blame you I blame you on the
sensor I think you're little too quick
to judge and I think someone like
yourself that we're also what Kat says
rather people say you know something say
you're pretentious some other people say
you know you [ __ ] and you twist you
know you're good with words but I don't
think any of that I I do think I do
think you're intelligent
but through that I was I was I was a
little letdown that you were quick to
judgment you know quickly you know look
at 36 second video and not see what was
going on not see that the height behind
it was more so the heading behind the
veil of of oh I see this is why don't
they spend your channel cuz I'm gonna
talk about some people were hiding
behind a certain veil of you know moral
high ground of of you know burn the
witch you know this guy's a sexist
destroy him but realistically that sort
of thought process that's sort of that's
sort of you know you know punishment
burn burn this guy is exactly what in a
sense their initial argument is toward
me so when that's you know attacking a
group does that make sense like so
they're in a sense being hypocrites so I
guess I kind of I was let down that you
kind of joined that and you were quick
to judge quick to jump on it you know I
was expecting more of a listen it sounds
bad it looks bad but I don't know I
don't know the context you know this is
a 36 second clip you know there is
probably 10 more minutes of this you
know this does that make sense that's
what I expected in my expecting is a bad
thing okay
every human does it everyone's letdown
you can't expect you can't you know read
people's minds expect a certain thing no
one's ever gonna meet those but but
based on your past dream is based on
your past debates based on your past
arguments I did expect just some sort of
maybe level-headedness some sort of you
know does that make sense yeah so what
you're trying to say I think is that
you're disappointed because you consider
yourself to be a person that holds
nuanced views and it upsets you that
somebody that I'm being a little
presumptuous here that you considered to
be fairly intelligent made a snap
judgment about you you thought that was
unfair of me to do right is that we're
unfair I think it's completely fair I
don't think
it's unfair I just think it's it's the
word I don't like the word unfair
because that makes me sound like I'm an
entitled little [ __ ] that you know is
talking about the world isn't fair life
isn't fair does that make sense so it's
not a matter of fairness it's more of a
matter of it's a matter of you know with
this is gonna sound crunchy but with a
certain level of awareness and
intelligence comes a certain level of
responsibility and with that
responsibility I think you had a
responsibility to look at it unbiased
ously and look at it more more you know
I guess objectively is not the right
word because that's actually what you
did I guess to step back and you know
apply your own context apply your own
perspective and experiences and realize
that sometimes there are times when
things are clipped out everyone everyone
can be you know made into the villain
does that make sense yeah I agree with
that okay so I guess I expected that
jumping to the conclusion so it's not
about fairness or unfairness it's more
about you know when someone's more
intelligent I just expected more of a
you know cautiousness in in jutting in
judgment making or whatever the word is
son excellence yeah I I guess I just I
wasn't aware of the context of it being
satire and it didn't seem like anybody
provided me with wallet X but satire I
mean my speeches are the problem is like
when I use the word satire it's like
everyone you know I don't think funny
when Apes think it's more of a matter of
I hate using this word over and over
again it just sounds repetitive and you
know kind of discredits everything but
it's just more it's just context you
know like if people would have heard the
beginning five minutes or if the people
would have watched you know the passive
odds they'd understand who I was talking
about and what I was referring to
whereas they would to clarify them what
were you referring to then I guess just
to clarify so that it's perfectly clear
yeah I will tell you what I was
referring to but before I do that uh-huh
I'm going to I'm going to put a little
disclaimer on there because you know I I
haven't really I haven't I haven't
really gotten used to having a platform
this big and you know being you know
having everything that I've said
magnified and scrutinized so I
definitely want to you know say this
real quick my the word choice I used was
disgusting it was vulgar
um you know if I use the word choice
outside of that I don't think it's
disgusting or vulgar but the word choice
that you know the word choice I used in
that context was disgusting it was wrong
of me it was irresponsible so I'm sorry
I won't use it again and ask him what's
in on it the tone I had and the inciting
the crowd was also wrong and I am fully
but what I meant to say hopefully you
know next time I can you know stay away
from the tone and stay away from the
disgusting word choice what I meant was
which in a sense is still gonna be taken
the wrong way because in reality what
I've learned in life you can't you know
you should never group you should always
generalize and when I said you're always
generalize I mean in like you know when
you're a platform unless you know unless
you're not does that make sense if
you're working for someone and you know
you have to be you know there isn't a
complete freedom of speech you got it
more so you know speak in a generalized
manner instead of you know grouping does
that make sense otherwise what happened
what happened the last five days is just
gonna happen would you agree with that
wait can what do you mean by you need to
speak in a generalized sense so instead
of saying they or she or girls or these
group of girls or these blank and blanks
you say you know in in this world there
are people that do this Oh
CNA discuss whatever generalized yes so
and and that would that would have
it's well it's a winner-take-all
scenario whoever invents the general AI
is going to win the world basically and
that goodbye soon yeah we're like really
close to it aren't we uh yeah I mean if
you're well they theorized 30 to 50
years
but and that's that's incredibly soon
even if it's that which is in some cases
a conservative estimate there were still
hardware limited though that's the big
problem
like the whole idea of it spiraling out
of control with our current hardware
isn't feasible well how's the hardware
limited how was it Hardware limited
because of the cost efficient well
partially what do you want you can
explain it better
oh I was gonna say partially because of
yeah cost and everything but no if you
talk about world wide spread then you're
no longer talking about cost do you know
I can get anyway hold on no you said it
was Hardware limit how is it hardly
limited you realize how much processing
an AI has to do before it can actually
become a true soft day i right
I mean I I'm kind of like a true soft AI
and I don't need like millions and
millions of energies of processing no
well you have millions and millions that
you I don't know the exact number but
you have neurons exactly but I mean I
say to you you're telling me that the
biggest I have more processing power on
my brain than the most complicated
powerful see like thing in the world I
think I've heard it's a software problem
not a hardware one but then why did you
just agree earlier with him when he said
it was hardware limited and now you're
telling me I spiraled out control is
Hardware limited with our technology now
yes you could do that but it wouldn't
spiral out of control in an instant such
as people theorize he was expecting
earlier about quantum computers yeah I
want them computing is that there that
one is basically but I yeah well
basically he was exciting how on
computers they fire on what is it called
again like it's basically an infinite
number of the connections but there you
could argue their equivalent of threads
yeah but it's only forty percent
accuracy because of the fact that
they're don't connects like a normal
computer
well quantum computing to I'm not sure
the exact number
but I know for a while there the current
accuracy of an actual bit received too
bit transmitted was only about 30-40
percent right but but anyways listen
like that you should you should I don't
know if you've heard I mean look the
fact that Stephen Hawking the fact that
Bill Gates Elon Musk I mean there's so
many people who are experts and just in
in the field itself and I'm not an
expert and AI know Bill Gates no but hey
I know okay I can cite there there are
experts in the field as well but they're
just lesser-known people like stupid me
these are people who work in the field
and are talking extensively about how
this is an imminent threat I mean I they
know tomorrow it's gonna be a threat but
in the coming years your future you know
30 to 50 years maybe well here's the
thing
consider this this is a problem that has
incredibly far-reaching implications if
so in other words a general AI has
incredible power incredible implications
of which we've never seen before it's a
winner-take-all scenario to develop it
and so this is a problem that we don't
know how far off it is
but more importantly we don't know how
long it would take us to tackle that
problem for all we know this is a
problem that could take ten years of
people really the right people really
focusing on it and all we have is 15 or
20 years that's an example so it's
something where we're really on the
clock about it so you think that one day
somebody's just going to flip the switch
and we're magically going to come up
with some AI that's going to be ready to
take over the way it's not gonna be like
a progression take thirty to fifty years
is because the fact by the time it takes
that many iterations for the air I
execute like that's that's the hardware
limit if we had a computer that could do
infinim out parallel processes today
like who knows that could be five years
from now that I would know what is
infinite amount of parallel processes
when are we ever getting these computers
that's the argument that's the hardware
limit if we had something that allowed
us to do so many parallel processes we
could cut the the time span between us
having a heart AI today to us having a
soft day tomorrow I'm sorry crisis
I thought the sewer first of all I'm
pretty sure quantum computers only give
you like an order of magnitude more
processing power it's not like yeah and
today this quantum computers are trashed
so secondly I thought that typically
when we were speaking about a eyes these
are problems with algorithms these
aren't problems with like RAW processing
power like I'm pretty sure we can make a
computer that is like it has the
infinitely more processing power than
any individual human brain I'm pretty
sure we have them right now in our homes
but it's yeah I think it's about we
develop a say actually they say that IBM
Watson's its current rate will become a
soft AI in the 30 50 year times I think
I'm pretty skeptical of anything that's
trying to predict tech out even past 15
yeah oh about AI to actually be able to
give a definite answer okay sounds like
a problem that I shouldn't be extremely
concerned about right now that you
should know no no no no no no doesn't
that just give credence to the idea that
in 10 to 15 years we could have some
type of technological breakthrough that
could get us to a soft AI hello I could
be wrong but I don't think correct me if
I'm wrong because you're the expert but
I've never heard of any massive
breakthrough in AI it seems like it's a
lot of grueling work on many iterations
over and over again of slowly improving
different learning techniques in order
to work generally is better so I don't
think there's ever gonna be a time where
we go from having a computer that's
really good at chess - oh my god it's
trying to fire all the nooks and take
over the world is it self identified
than its best interest rate limit it
seems like a huge yeah so the way you're
saying that would it be described as the
old space race with a Cold War because
now we're just doing it for the AI know
and if anyone reaches that AI do they
have the potential to do that a war game
scenario what I don't even know what
that one war game scenario which is what
you just said which is launching all the
nukes towards each other and all that
[ __ ] yeah that's what it makes it sound
like you guys that's where okay guys
kind of like magically real quick yeah
honestly it's just fear-mongering
because this is where I was saying the
AI is not going
to spiral out of control in the fashion
the media wants you to believe way but
that's the amount of patient even do a
calculation for AI is absurd like you're
not gonna have AI hop onto your
smartphone and suddenly be able to
control your vehicle or anything like
that in the fashion that that means it
makes it out to be no one's making that
argument but what yeah the point I'm
saying is that to get that when you get
to it generally I all bets are off the
table I think that's pretty
well-established like we got we already
have like general learning AI don't know
what you a generally AI is in a self
improving AI that is that's how we know
isn't that how we taught the current a
eyes the google deepmind or whatever
isn't that isn't that why you give it a
you give it a task and then you don't
tell it how to complete it and then it
iterates like a process to get there in
the most efficient way possible isn't it
- definitely we can't rewrite our source
code what do you I don't notice how you
mean I didn't say we could
what is it wasn't rewriting your source
code have to do with anything we don't
have a source code I mean we're not yeah
but why would an AI need to be able to
rewrite its source code was I mean DNA
could be your source code limiting its
capabilities and what I'm saying is the
general AI is something where it is
proficient in a multitude of different
fields not just one specialized task
like Watson is for example can I do
controlling your [ __ ] missile defense
systems yeah sure I mean it can do a
variety of different tasks efficiently
better than any human can that's that's
when people are referring to generally I
that's what they generally are referring
to from what I've heard from the experts
in the field that I'm listening to but
anyways wait to answer your original
question you were you were saying you
you said well it seems you said well I
guess that would depend how you define
that but I mean what the things we're
doing now and we can do now with AI has
been is crazy leaps from you know what
was it sure I'm sorry when I hear like
the big alarmist talks like when people
like you talk about this you make it
seem like there's gonna be like some day
we're gonna go from an AI that can do
this to like a massive breakthrough that
that but it seems to me that that's not
how
in this field has worked it's actually
just been a lot of grueling work very
small incremental improvement jump over
jump of things getting slightly better
as time goes on so there's never night
there's never gonna be like the massive
AI break that we're all of a sudden like
something comes out of nowhere we flip a
switch and there's a huge AI thing but
though if we let this problem if we let
this thing go unchecked and if we let it
become an arms race of people racing to
be the first one to create this truly
super intelligent general AI which is
very well could because there's so much
incentive to do so
then that problem could could definitely
arise where obviously look you're right
it's not gonna happen overnight it's not
like it just oh this guy figured how to
do it you broke the code but the problem
is when you have a lot of groups working
towards this and we don't you know have
a way to pump the brakes and be like
whoa let's before we [ __ ] design this
next super crazy intelligent thing we
should figure out the implications of
what this really like they don't have
the protocols set in place to see yeah
there's no protocol exactly there let me
get a little bit closer to it actually
being a thing maybe we will but like
when you're talking about something that
is theorized to be 30 to 50 years out
which one when somebody says something
is 30 to 50 years a ton Tech what it
tells me is they have absolutely no idea
when it's gonna be there nobody knows
what anything attack is gonna look could
also be super well if it was sooner they
would say sooner not 30 to 15 years out
there like that's probably why nobody's
like taking it very sick like for
instance like there's going to need to
be like very big ethical discussions and
repercussions and [ __ ] for genetically
modifying super soldiers and [ __ ] but
we're probably really [ __ ] far out
from that [ __ ] as well so we're not
having those conversations either why
because well that's because this
particular conversation is something
that pretty much trumps everything else
I'm really what if you could genetically
modify and create like super thinking
suit like everybody's becomes like
Captain America that society you'd
probably be I mean that's okay that's
that's an important topic obviously but
what I'm saying is a super intelligent
generally AI is something that trumps
everything else in terms of power and
importance you've got a bunch of Captain
America's running around that can run
covert ops missions and like blow up
these abilities of what if well what
about the super American or what about
the super Captain America soldiers that
confuse Bionic chips into their brains
they can say they can merge with the
general AI
you're right you bigger good [ __ ] to say
but what I'm saying is like imagine
different countries working on their own
version of Captain America okay no no I
understand what you're saying it's a
race what I'm saying is what if somebody
is while all these countries are wasting
time working at AI somebody's working on
a human that can plug the AI chip in and
they're gonna be the ones that win
you're referring to basically versus
that's the element Elon Musk neural
sleeve or whatever idea which is you
know that our base our best solution is
to merge with the AI essentially the
problem with that is you would think the
problem with that is in order to develop
that neural sleeve I figure what he
calls it but in order to develop that
you would first you know assuming you
would first need to create the AI in
order to put it onto your brain yeah but
when these guys will do is they'll wait
for other people to make the eye and
then they'll make of the super people
first but it'll be USB type n it plugs
into your exactly so they'll be
requesting the api's and [ __ ] from them
so that they can make their USB type end
specs so that as soon as their AI is
released they'll be able to plug it
right in and they'll be able to combine
the AI with theirs Captain America jeans
and it'll be Oliver you seem to think
that this is something that just good
it's gonna progress linearly we're all
gonna have an eye on it we're gonna be
able to keep it safe which is not
necessarily the case what I think is
that this issue is so far out that like
talking about is is absurdly
hypothetical that that is so if it's if
that was the case then why are people
who are look you might say well they're
not technically ok there are experts in
the field who are saying these are
things that are not that far off that
are really important that okay very good
I don't want to do this I don't want to
be like a jerk but can you link me like
a paper where somebody's right I just
want to read in their words where
they're saying that like this is gonna
happen soon and not and so when I read
this paper it's not gonna be like hey
guys these are some things that you
might want to think about because
potentially very far down the road these
are going to be issues that we might run
into right it's not gonna be like that
it's gonna be like AI general AI is
gonna be a big thing really soon five
years from now
yeah Stuart Russell is a pretty
prominent figure in the film
I'll find a an article thanks Stuart
Russell tennis Oh artificial
intelligence okay yeah
hey yo Funkmaster Nick Bostrom is
another guy he works with he's not a
like a technician or something but he
works with and talks with a lot he's a
very uh I guess I put I post it into the
politics the shittiest way to compare
freedom I agree into AI that's and I
don't think completely discrediting
people like Elon Musk or Steve Wozniak
and Stephen Hawking also say that I was
like [ __ ] Elon Musk Wozniak Billy
these guys have no background in AI
develop why would I yeah I know but
airway therapy doesn't think it was an
argument of appeal to Authority for a
lot of people they see someone like
Stephen Hawking saying AI is bad we
should stop it
so they're like oh he's an expert on one
field Iman I don't think it's an appeal
to Authority to just say well no if
you're if you're basing your entire this
is the definition of art of fallacious
appeal to Authority well no I'm not
saying I'm saying that's like your
entire life you know just even saying
like oh I think he has that's nice
fallacious is it it's just adding to the
fact that this is I'm not the only one
thinking about this obviously I didn't
get that I didn't formulate these ideas
or this this argument it's just right
you know other people are concerning
Hawking isn't the AI but if you what if
he was a person that made the I never
know man what if that's the reason he
never stands up and then and then people
I don't know if you're you would give
this argument destiny but people would
often say things like well you can just
unplug it you can just you can just have
the kill switch and it's all good but
like that is so that is just that's
not can you just give me the scenario
like you're making it sound like the AI
is gonna magically take over why
wouldn't it be done in like in like a
disconnected environment like a land
environment like a single server like
why do you think that all of a sudden
were doesn't magically alright and they
give it control of all the missiles and
then it's just gonna flip a switch a
takeover let me give you a perfect
example okay so let's say let's say we
do have this AI that's designed like you
said in like a LAN area right back to
the internet isn't it it's a closed box
okay so the problem there is assuming
this AI is super intelligent is greatly
out vastly intelligent than anyone else
that means it can think it can do things
in an incredible scenarios right so for
example this is just me thinking with my
simple human brain compared to it but
for example it could fake having a
[ __ ] malfunctioning virus or
something it needs maintenance during
that time of people opening it up doing
some sort of maintenance dick it in some
way [ __ ] you know alter its source
code it can do something that will have
an unintended consequence of us doing
something oh we're just fixing it it
could stage stuff like that you could do
social engineering like up the [ __ ]
ass like dude this thing is literally
gonna be a god in terms of Intel okay so
even if I give you let even if I get
grant you all of that which is a huge
stretch all you have to have our oh god
what do they call it in um in it when
you've got like a clearance when you're
when you're in like not clean rooms but
there's like there's a name what air gap
yeah you have like air gaps places where
you're not allowed to bring in or out
USB port are USB drives or anything like
that you're not allowed to have internet
or Wi-Fi or anything like that yeah like
air gap places like like how is it mind
went crazy that's that's what people
fear they don't fear of I don't think
the white gap scenarios oh there's one
more snare there's no there's there's
endless scenarios but let me give you
another scenario for example it's absurd
to be honest the fact that we're gonna
have this AI means we're using it for
some purpose and let's hypothetically
say that purpose is to invent things to
[ __ ] solve huge issues that we have
why else would we have the ad well in
one of these solutions or one of these
inventions there could be some
sighs some unintended side effect that
we are not aware of that could be built
into this that could somehow give the AI
power that we're not that we don't want
it to have so for like for example and
it could be something like some [ __ ]
super complex 4d underwater chest [ __ ] I
don't know but essentially we're dealing
with a [ __ ] God you know like he
could predict okay wait a second what if
we make it so that the the only people
that are allowed to interact with the AI
is better AI that we make so the
stronger AI is always keeping the weaker
okay then you're obviously just creating
more problems for the conversation to
distract
I am pretty sober but I mean oh you're
like you're like input on this topic
that's all because like I saw you said
something on Twitter and then your title
so I've like I've heard this discussion
you had like probably two years ago
about casing Tron and whatnot so I want
to know what your input is nowadays like
has it so not really so I'm retreading a
lot of low ground I'm sorry for the
viewers but basically the I think that
the IRL streaming that exists today on
Twitch is fundamentally different than
what I was talking about before so just
to be clear in my view I'm totally okay
with people playing games and looking
sexy while doing it I mean I would do it
if I had [ __ ] boobs I would have the
[ __ ] most cleavage [ __ ] bar I
could do but I think that there's a
fundamental difference between like
playing games on Twitch versus like
selling sex is like entertainment which
is more kind of like what you are
Amaranthe to I think that those are like
fun or like s tph I think those like
fundamentally different types of
streaming yeah like give me an example
of what I mean by selling quote-unquote
sex so like if you just if I'm going to
like um so like if I'm going to your
stream I'm going there for sexually
related reasons and if I'm subscribing
to you a lot of the perks are kind of
like sexually related so like selling
access to like your snapchat or I think
did you have the patreon with like the
not safe for work pictures or whatever
stuff like that it's pretty sexually
explicit or like dancing for Saabs are
squatting or whatever for subs it's like
pretty sight like are people like
genuinely carries like how many body
weight squats you can do in a day for
your endurance or do they just want to
see your ass when you squat you know I
mean to be honest they probably do I
mean it's kind of like a clickbait thing
I suppose mhm
like I'm not gonna sit here and like say
that it's not you know I know what I'm
doing like I'm not yeahsure pretending
like I have no idea that I'm like or
doing squats for no reason or like oh
yeah I wanna I want to exercise on my
stream guys yeah but the thing is like
I have actually talked to a couple of
staff I don't know if you have know like
I'm the on this like what's allowed and
what's not allowed again I'm saying like
explicit line of what they want you to
do and what's not allowed to do on your
stream and they've they've even told me
like I'm kind of in the gray area I
suppose I'm okay with it like if twitch
one day woke up and decided hey we don't
want you to do this on a channel like
one time they actually told me that I'm
not allowed to do squats for bits which
to be perfectly honest I don't really
understand that because I'm allowed to
do squats for subs okay if you wanna if
you want to allow people to do squats at
all I think you should allow them to do
it for subs and bits right I mean with
our two different twitch guys that told
you this was it the same one person
would did you say it was actually the
one that said that you could get banned
for doing squats for subs cuz I actually
like to people that I saw that took on
my thing like they actually kind of
quote unquote copied what I did yeah um
they had the bits right because I had it
for a while and then they got banned for
it so I felt kind of bad because the
staff told me that it wasn't allowed but
then they didn't tell anybody else not
do it you know but I mean to be honest I
fine if they one day said hey we're
implementing new rules that are that
this isn't allowed or like you're not
allowed to do this on stream and like
honestly I actually think they should
have specific rules for IRL because
right now I feel like it's kind of like
I like open for the bait yeah it's like
the Wild West you never know who's gonna
get hit with a bad night I mean because
it's such a new is such a new category
and like so many people are doing such
different things like you know body
painting or like dancing on stream and
things like that so I think they really
should implement
like some sort of guidelines so that
people know what's allowed and what's
not allowed because I I honestly when
you read the Terms of Service for twitch
I feel like it's like so vague you know
like when you say overtly sexual what's
what's really overtly sexual to you
might not be the same for me like I may
not think that something is considered
overtly sexual but somebody else might
yeah like even playing games with
cleavage some people can consider it
yeah without any kind of like guidelines
yeah I'm not saying you are but I'm
saying one person might think that's
completely irresponsible and overtly
sexual but like another person may not
think that way right yeah yeah really
implement a guideline for this though
that's the problem right like how do you
really eat these Michelle I I don't I
don't think that is a problem so the and
I'll be crystal clear of my criticism
because there's a lot of really [ __ ]
stupid people to talk about this
basically people should be open about
criticizing these things like I'm
totally fine with having this discussion
with people just just when people throw
around insults yeah that's when I start
listen stop listening to it you know
yeah so like the problem is that in what
I've said in the beginning was like um I
think this is why I'm so critical at
which on this because I feel like you
people get harassed kind of because of
twitch it's Twitch's fault so the
problem is that twitch needs to make a
very clear statement going forward where
they either a say well listen there are
forms of sexually explicit content that
will allow in certain sections of the
site and we're going to upgrade the TOS
to reflect that in which case nobody if
people are asking they're just [ __ ]
because it's on twitch it's what's
allowed or be they clarify we are going
to enforce our TOS stricter we're gonna
be more clear on our guidelines and then
certain streamers like you or amaranth
or whatever would be told like okay well
this type of content we don't
necessarily want this on the site
anymore so it has to change and then you
go forward from there but I feel like
twitch like wants to have its cake and
eat it to where it sits in this weird
gray area and it doesn't really enforce
the tos except it kind of does it but in
a really inconsistent way and the only
thing that's ever going to happen as
long as that continues is people will
just shed on you guys because they they
view you as violating Atos because by
the letter of the tos you you are kind
of violating right the sexual uh virtus
part but not in twitches eyes but
no reasonable person would read it and
come to the same interpretation as them
so kind of invites people to harass
dreamers like you because they perceive
all of you to be rule breakers right I
think the problem also is that because
the rules are so vague it's like
completely open for interpretation not
only for the staff but also for the
streamer right because sometimes I sit
and I'm just like well you know I'd be
thinking before I strain like am I
allowed to really do this on stream and
then I find myself like contacting staff
members and I'm just like can I do this
on stream and then they'll tell me
whether it's okay or not but like I
think roles shouldn't even be up for
interpretation really I think they need
to be like you said more it's allowed or
not so that people don't make mistakes
and then they're like well I didn't know
you know yeah that's like a big problem
that I talked about earlier like cuz
there's a streamer you want to be on
Twitch is good sorry I want to be on
twitch is a good side so it's really
annoying when I get hit for like a roll
like you're getting a three-day ban
person was like oh well [ __ ] if I knew
that was against the rule I would have
done it like I don't want to be banned
from the platform you know so that's
like a really annoying thing it's like
when you become a partner I don't know
if they told you but like they didn't
actually tell me that there was like
different time frames for when you get
banned and like you know you get like
warnings first and then you get like a
three day band
oh yeah I've never heard I mean I've
heard like I've heard like people
talking about it like on subreddit
threats and [ __ ] but I've never been I
have no idea I have [ __ ] like one
hour conversation with this guy I'm not
gonna say which staff but like he told
me like if you keep doing this you will
be perma banned eventually you know but
it's like I wish they would just be open
about it you know I wish they would let
the partners know that this is a thing
that they follow so that partners know
well if there's like a three-strike rule
get permabanned eventually for it cuz I
feel like people complain about it and
on reddit for example they'd be like oh
well this person didn't get banned for
it but this guy did write but then they
don't really know the
behind-the-scenes of it and the first
person may have gotten a warning for it
you know yeah and twitches never public
about any ban or any punishment ever so
everybody just it's just cancer
speculation every everybody just assumes
that it's the worst yeah yeah and twitch
never makes a public statement about it
so it's obvious that's what people are
gonna do that's really predictable what
do you think about that like partners
getting that kind of quote-unquote
special treatment oh it's it's totally
reasonable that will happen in every
industry you just expect it to happen
but you should be open with it like if
somebody was contributing to [ __ ] on
more to your platform and they're making
$100,000 a year of you of course you're
gonna get more leniency than a brand new
streamer that starts saying the N word
you know if sodapoppin lets the N word
slip on stream he's worth way more to
twitch and is contributed way more so I
mean I think make a little bit of leeway
there is fine and I think of your public
about it and honest with it I think most
people would be okay with it like if
somebody argues against that they're
[ __ ] stupid like [ __ ] you're like
obviously you know it works the same way
to any job you work do you think that's
which should be open about that with in
terms of like how partners get treated
with bands yeah I think so I think they
should be yeah sure
I mean like again like this is this it
works this way at your job you know if
you've got a guy that works really
[ __ ] hard he's been at the company
for 10 years and has a really shitty
week and comes into work late you know
two or three times he's probably not
gonna get like a written warning for
it's probably not going on record the
manager will talk to him or the
supervisor doing like you know do like
get your [ __ ] together like you're fine
but if you're a new employee and you're
like on your third week of employment
and you show up late to work a couple
times you're probably getting written up
for like like an actual written warning
so it goes on record because you don't
know you haven't like built as much
rapport with the company yet yeah I
think it's especially bad because you
know there was this one occasion where
I'm not gonna say who it is obviously
but this one guy he was naked on his
dream and he didn't actually know what
that he was dreaming oh yeah like an
office dream right and he was partnered
and I think someone told me I'm not
really sure but I think he got banned
for 24 hours for it
so upset because wow it's only 24 hours
of being naked on your stream but like I
think the problem is that people just
assume that he's gonna get permabanned
for it you know and they don't realize
that well he's partnered this is the
first time he's ever done this and then
like if somebody else get permabanned
for it they've probably done that before
you know like yeah I rarely see people
get permabanned for something they've
done a single time yeah yeah I think
that's the main problem with twitch but
that's that's like the whole session
that people are saying like I see that
people's throwing around so many
different things like Oh boobie
streamers shouldn't do this and logo
blah but I think the main problem that
people have with which is that they're
not enforcing their rules like equally
of the website
yeah consistently but I mean I do where
that's coming from and I sort of agree
with it to some extent like there was
one person who like was saying that all
women are [ __ ] right and then that
trainwreck guy gets banned for five days
for saying completely the same thing
right yeah oh I don't I don't really
know I don't think twitch should be
really held accountable for it but I
think they should be more open about how
the enforcer rules you know well like so
I think that it becomes an ethics
question and this is why I feel like you
have the cause you have you or you have
a legitimate case to tell them they need
to change their behavior here because
when twitch makes the decision to
enforce things inconsistently they're
really throwing their community under
the bus because if twitch is being very
vague about how they ban people and then
you do something and you get a one day
ban well the person that suffers isn't
twitch you're going to be the one that
could [ __ ] on relentlessly for it why
does this light pink sparkles who sends
all over nudes to Hasan get so much
leeway it's because she's [ __ ]
sencilla right well okay well what are
you supposed to say twitch doesn't
really send you these guidelines
anything you say no one's gonna [ __ ]
believe so twitch essentially throws
it's it's it's contractors under the bus
when they don't come out and clarify
this is how we do bands sometimes we
show leniency this is what's a lot of
yeah so like this is yeah so this is why
I get irritated that one lady their PR
manager said it earlier than
deleted her tweets but she's like people
always come out with these crazy
conspiracy theories bla bla bla bla bla
it's like dude I mean I've been in
gaming for my whole life you know and
anybody that's been in the Internet
arena for a long time knows that this is
really predictable if you don't make
clear guidelines on your site and you
sometimes ban people for other things
that you let other people get away with
it's very predictable that those other
people are gonna start getting harassed
because of a perceived unfairness this
is very very very understandable you
can't just sit here and pretend that you
had no idea this was gonna happen and by
not being clear about your rules you're
inviting this kind of harassment
implicitly I think at least but
especially when people make assumptions
after that - yeah I've had but and again
like it's people shouldn't make
assumptions but they will like that's
what's going to happen if you don't
clear if you don't clarify anything of
course people are going to speculate you
know I mean I I do hope that which will
change this over time because I mean it
seems to be like a consistent problem
like III don't know how long have you
been on Twitch probably since just in TV
or something yeah a long time yeah I
mean it's such an issue for such a long
time and it just it keeps getting blown
out of proportion I just kind of wish
that switch would be more open about how
they enforce the rules to be honest it's
all yeah and especially with their
guidelines it's so incredibly open for
interpretation especially since like non
partnered streamers to get evaluated by
admins that's what I've heard and then
partner streamers get like a tribunal
whatever I'm sure they've got like a
personal guy that will look over reports
and [ __ ] for me everybody should enforce
the rules the same way and like there
should be explicit guidelines on how to
a fortune or and again even to be less
extreme and more favorable to twitch
they don't have to enforce them the same
one everybody but just be just be
transparent about it you know like I
said like if you get a new job usually
you're on a probation period for like
two or three months right you know that
if you [ __ ] up and you're at a new job
you're gonna get [ __ ] for it you know
like people are aware of that you know I
mean they actually did they say that to
you - like the three-month rule whatever
no wait what's the three months what's
the three Wow I seem to know a lot about
this I get in trouble a lot I'm just
saying but okay um basically I mean I'm
not saying this is for certain but this
is just what I've heard right
so I'm not saying this is like a fact
right but I've heard that there's like a
three-month rule where if you've been
clean for three or four months you're
basically in good standing with which so
for example if you're breaking rules and
then you break rules again basically not
really bad she'd be standing like okay
cool six months later bad if you broke
rules twice in three months sure get on
saying yeah I've kind of they're like
weird things that have happened I don't
know if this is ever happened you before
but I caught a two-week ban once and I
was really surprised because I'd never
been punished on twitch before ever my
stream would never I don't ride I can't
remember or maybe I had like one one day
ban or something I think I've ever been
punishing oh you why yeah well was
because I played we watched like four or
five minutes of like a YouTube video on
stream so they caught a two-week banned
for it so I like what a copyrighted
content I guess oh yeah I was to catch a
predator but but yeah but I mean like um
but I'd never expected to catch like a
two-week banned me like that but when I
talked to the guy was like he'll like
how do I get instantly to week bantha
this he's like oh well you know you've
got like three warnings on your account
from other things and it's like oh well
I'd never been told of any of this yeah
well yeah he told me he went back and
told me but I'd never been contacted
about any of these warnings in my
account so I had like no [ __ ] I had
before obvious obviously you would know
and you probably wouldn't do it again
right yeah but they but yeah I don't
know yeah some pretty Mimi [ __ ]
a one occasion with gross score I'm sure
you remember it I mean the whole
scenario thing you had an altercation
with breasts Cory oh no not me
personally but like when he got
permabanned off of twitch oh yeah I
followed it very closely I feel very
strong like he had like three warnings
or something like that but they never
actually like contest contacted him
about it yeah that sounds like - but I
didn't get permabanned his warnings were
[ __ ] you though listen listen gross
score you have three warnings on this
one issue right like one issue of you
quote-unquote harassing other people if
you do it again you will be banned think
about it before he does it again yeah
that's why I'm saying that like from him
keep that in mind
yeah and fundamentally I think every
streamer wants to be on Twitch is a good
sigh I don't want to get banned from
twitch and more than that I want twitch
to like me I want to be viewed as an
asset on their platform so yeah if I'm
[ __ ] up let me know and I'll change
my [ __ ] real fast you know
I kind of wanted to do a YouTube video
on this because I think that organizing
my thoughts here would make the
conversation a little bit more
productive but we'll try to keep things
somewhat organized as we go so I think
that there are four groups of people
here that are probably worth talking
about we have the boobie streamers we
have the boobie streamer supporters or
the people that like women we have the
boobie streamer haters or the RN cell
slash train wrecks crowd and then we
have twitch so there's actually only
like one party that's like super [ __ ]
here
that's like absolutely 100% has no
defense of itself and it's just totally
in the wrong and surprisingly or maybe
not so surprisingly though the problem
is actually just entirely twitches
problem
it's just 100% twitches problem so what
we have right now at twitch I guess or
where it seems to me that for some
reasons which one addresses what we have
right now is a crisis of culture right
where what we don't actually know is
what is the site's supposed to be used
for what is expected on the site what
what what is twitch right that's kind of
the problem so I guess this is really
frustrating for me if you go to Al and
let's say that somebody advertises a
land center to you okay and I want to
talk so much about all these groups okay
let's say that somebody organ offer is a
land center right somebody says okay by
the way if you go to this place there's
a land center and you go there and you
walk inside and you see in one corner
people are playing call of duty in
another corner people are playing
Starcraft in another corner people are
playing League of Legends and then in
another corner there's a bunch of girls
that are like looking at their screens
and they have massive boobies going on
and like every sub they get and they do
squats or whatever and the appeal of the
streams is all sexual it's kind of weird
and you're not really expecting that to
be there now
you can be a sex-positive person that
approves of cam girls and pornography
and sex work and all of that in general
and you can still be a little bit
irritated that it's there when when you
show up to the land center you kind of
expect to go there to play games you
know like it just doesn't jive with what
you expected there to be there right
well we should change to our meme
overlay I guess the problem that we have
is the twitch for whatever reason
refuses to define their culture or give
people any clear guidelines about what
it is twitch is supposed to be about and
again this is a problem with twitch not
just giving people a clear guideline of
what their culture is supposed to be so
oh there was a reason I didn't come to
this view um I guess I don't need to if
if you go to um this is a talk that um
this is a talk that I've had before on
stream okay but I'll kind of give this
this is kind of like a customer service
basic first principles discussion okay
very very very basic very important
thing to understand maybe the most
important thing to understand about
customer service okay well if you have a
friend and you go to McDonald's and
somebody buys $1 double cheeseburger I
don't know if they still sell with
double cheeseburger now let's say you
buy $1 double cheese we're gonna eat it
okay they can be happy right let's say
that somebody goes to a really nice
steakhouse and they order a steak and
they eat it and they're really happy
right how is it pop I was that possible
how can you live in a world where
somebody can be simultaneously happy
with purchasing a cheeseburger and
eating it and thinking that's good but
then also purchasing a steak and eating
that and thinking that's good from a
really nice steakhouse right how can
these two things exist right the steak
is way better than the cheeseburger why
would you ever eat a cheeseburger when
you could just eat steaks all the time
right it doesn't really make sense right
but it does make sense right so the idea
is in customer service there's this
really important concept known as
managing the customers expectation
okay if you go to McDonald's or if you
go to Burger King or if you go to
Wendy's and you purchase a cheeseburger
or some chicken nuggets or some french
fries you know exactly what you're
getting you go there you buy the
cheeseburger you buy a french fry you
get exactly what you're expecting
hopefully the food is hot it's not
[ __ ] up and you eat it and you're
happy if you go to a steak house you pay
for a steak and you get a cheeseburger
that you know you're [ __ ] upset right
you're not upset because the
cheeseburger is bad right this is one of
the most important things to understand
about customer service the customer is
never upset because what you delivered
was bad or or or or wasn't good the
customer is upset because you failed to
meet an expectation right this is where
this is where disappointment exists in
the mind of a customer disappointment
exists because of the gap that's created
between what you deliver and what they
expected you to deliver so one of your
most important parts of customer service
is to manage the customer expectation
this this is true across everything
everything that you deal with we can we
can extend the same for haircuts right
if you go to the barber and we'll say
you're a girl or a guy or whatever and
and you're like hey I want you to give
me the sexiest [ __ ] haircut ever I
want to look like Brad Pitt when you
finish it's gonna be the sickest thing
ever oh my god I'm gonna be a [ __ ]
magnet right if they give you like the
same barber can do one of two things you
can say I'm gonna totally do that in
your fine or the barber can say that's
not possible
you're never gonna look like Brad Pitt
but I'll do the best I can and you'll be
happy with it because that's what I do
right the same barber can give the exact
same haircut okay to two different
people and one person will be majorly
upset and the other person will be okay
with it
why even though he delivered the same
product the reason is because the other
customer had a much higher expectation
fostered that was cause for
disappointment right so the problem that
that people have right now with with
twitch is that we just don't really know
what the [ __ ] the site is supposed to be
about at the moment now
I'm being very careful with my words
because there are a lot of [ __ ]
idiots involved in this conversation
people like train wrecks people like
whoever the [ __ ] okay this is not a
conversation about whether or not if
you're a cam girl you're a [ __ ] or
whatever it [ __ ] autistics stupid
[ __ ] that that conversation is about
it's also not a conversation on whether
misogyny or women's rights or any of
that [ __ ] okay that's not what the
conversation is about or should be about
all of these things are really [ __ ]
stupid red herrings okay now is there a
lot of misogyny that exists in these
conversations
abso-fuckin'-lutely and there are a
large share of streamers that can take
the blame for that for being women
hating [ __ ] pieces of [ __ ] whether or
not you agree or disagree that's just a
[ __ ] fact okay there is no reason to
be as obsessive and upset about some
people doing what they do on Twitch
unless you legitimately [ __ ] hate
women and I know that is a fact I know
that to be true there's just no reason
to get so upset about it if you go to an
IRL stream like this is sometimes like
let me this is a reasonable person's
reaction okay so let's say that I go to
a twitch TV I look at the IRL section
okay and I see like like Oh pink
sparkles is doing a boobie stream right
maybe I click it because morbid
curiosity and I go it's like oh okay
well I see she's got her leg up and it
boobs out like jeez that's pretty
[ __ ] bad right
that's stupid whatever and then I click
out okay this is a reasonable person's
reaction to viewing content that they're
not forced to watch okay that they don't
agree with if you go to pink sparkle
stream you see their legs are click I'm
gonna take a [ __ ] screen shot I'm
gonna [ __ ] 4chan I'm gonna [ __ ]
Reddit I'm gonna go my discord group I'm
gonna [ __ ] post this everywhere this
stupid [ __ ] [ __ ]
is never gonna post on Twitch again when
I'm done with her I'm gonna I'm gonna
[ __ ] hate I hate her
and I hope she [ __ ] dies I thought
like this is not a normal reaction to
content that you find offensive okay if
this is your default reaction then I
suggest that you take a really deep
breath take a deep breath step away from
the [ __ ] computer and realize if
something is wrong with you okay
watching something like that but you're
not forced to watch should not have this
kind of visceral reaction on you so when
I see like the livestream fail threads
that are going up where people are going
[ __ ] crazy about boobie streamers and
[ __ ] there's it's obvious okay there's a
problem here with people that [ __ ]
hate women for whatever reason and it
may be because your guys who are [ __ ]
playing video games you never talked to
a woman before I understand it could be
scary maybe a lot of women who [ __ ] on
you because maybe you don't know how to
shower or shave or whatever and so
people don't like to be know you because
you smell bad or whatever it's all cool
that you know there's Ian Chang's in the
world
you know it happens but take it take a
take a deep breath okay take a deep
breath realize that if you're getting
insanely [ __ ] upset about boomy
streamers on Twitch the problem is
probably you chill the [ __ ] out there's
no [ __ ] reason to be [ __ ] on air
on all of them there's no reason to be
[ __ ] on oncam girls in general okay
especially because 99% of the guys that
make fun of those girls blowed up
[ __ ] pornhub and masturbate
immediately [ __ ] after don't be a
huge hypocrite do not be that stupid
[ __ ] piece of [ __ ] that will on one
hand [ __ ] talk ham girls rental
endlessly and then on the next hand go
and [ __ ] jerk it to [ __ ] you know
cam girls because you're never gonna get
a girlfriend okay don't do this [ __ ]
don't be that person okay firstly all
right secondly there is a culture
problem at twitch what the [ __ ] is IRL
and what does IRL have to do with gaming
it's just a totally different bizarre
thing it is possible to be critical of
people that are literally selling sex
which a lot of these boobie streamers do
okay and that's it that's totally valid
to be critical of that just because
somebody is critical that doesn't
necessarily make them misogynistic
doesn't necessarily mean they hate sex
workers doesn't necessarily mean they
hate women it is entirely possible to be
highly critical of the sale of sex on
Twitch okay without being somebody that
hates women so it's important to
simultaneously acknowledge that as well
all right the problem is that we just
have no [ __ ] idea what the [ __ ] the
expectation is at Twitch and the
constant the constant double standards
apparent double standards that seem to
exist when it comes to when it comes to
enforcing these rules it's just not it's
just really [ __ ] confusing you know
like and and I've had strong stances on
boobies streamers in the past you know
if if you um if you play games and you
look hot as [ __ ] that's fine dude if I
was a girl and I had big boobs and I
play games you better [ __ ] believe
that I'm gonna be hardcore [ __ ]
boobie streaming dude I'm gonna have
I'm gonna have t-shirts with no [ __ ]
bra on I'm gonna have my biggest push-up
[ __ ] brought you're gonna see my
boobs every [ __ ] stream because I
will do whatever I can to get feet in
the door okay
it's why I'm joke every stream so I call
people autistic so I have funny insults
and I think of clever and creative ways
for people to commit suicide I do this
because I'm trying to sell my stream to
you better [ __ ] believe it
with that kind of stuff I am totally
[ __ ] okay with that because this is a
hustle okay you're self-employed
nobody's gonna help you stream well
unless you've got friends on Twitch for
me
nobody's really gonna help you okay know
you're looking out for yourself it's
your own stream and you're self-employed
nobody's cutting you a paycheck unless
you're working for it so yeah you do
your hustle you get paid okay however if
there is a stream on Twitch and you
literally like selling access to your
snapchat on Twitch this is a sex stream
now okay there are sub reddits for this
I'm pretty sure they're separate is to
sell clothing you can go to I think sex
sells or sell sex or whatever is a
subreddit you can go there and and have
people pay you for whatever [ __ ] [ __ ]
they offer there there are there there's
the cam web sites we can go to there are
sites that exist for content like this
twitch is not that site you probably
shouldn't be selling access to things
like snapchat on Twitch because it's
just not the type of culture that was
supposed to exist on Twitch now notice
how I keep saying it's not the type of
culture that should be right notice I
keep saying these things that's not
necessarily how it is the problem is
that everything that we're talking about
right now is an extreme hypothetical
because twitch refuses to define the
culture of their platform and this just
is horrible why why can't twitch just
come out and make a statement and say
hey this is like if twitch does this
then we bury the axe in this issue and
we never talk out about it again okay
twitch comes out and twitch says hey
we're just letting you guys know we like
IRL streams if girls want to [ __ ]
workout or squat or sell snapchat or
whatever that's what I RL is for we
created that section to give these
people an outlet to express their
creativity and do whatever content they
want and you're just gonna have to deal
with it because that's what that that's
what that section exists for right if
they put out a statement like that then
fine people on on our livestream fail
we'll post the threads they'll get mad
and then people linked to the tos I go
hey this is what they do at twitch get
over it
and I wouldn't complain about
right okay well fine [ __ ] if that
such which wants to find a community
sure at that point people can decide do
you want to be affiliated with it we'd
rather go to youtube gaming that's cool
you can do whatever you want okay now if
twitch makes the Ock the opposite
statement right the contrapositive or
whatever right if future makes the an
opposing statement it says hey you know
twitch is applied for him primarily
about gaming we have the IRL section
there for gamers to occasionally hang
out in but you're not really supposed to
be like an IRL streamer and and the
whole insanely sexually-charged streams
where sex is the primary selling point
like pink sparkles or st peach or the
amaranth girl or whatever these really
aren't appropriate things for twitch
then you have to ban those streams or
you have to at least communicate with
your partners there that hey if you guys
want to be on twitch you have to be
involved in some sort of gaming culture
because this is just not what our site
is about the fact that the fact that the
fact that twitch tries to like have
their cake and eat it too they're
they're the ones that should take the
blame for the woman-hating and
everything here and I know that sounds
like a really extreme statement but if
you're a woman and people are screaming
at you because you're boobie streamer or
whatever that's because the people are
coming to twitch and they don't expect
to see somebody like you here nobody
messages the pornhub site admins and
says there is a girl here that does a
live stream and her tits are out nobody
does it why because when you go to
pornhub that's the kind of content that
you expect nobody goes to my free cams
and say this chick has literally seven
[ __ ] sharpies and her [ __ ] right
now this is ridiculous
because when you go to my free cams or
ChatterBait that's what you expect to
find okay
people go to threads or streams with
boobie streamers they see them and they
spam reports so they get upset because
they think that twitch is supposed to be
a website for gaming and gaming related
content right this is how the site is
supposed to work so when people are
harassing these girls are getting hella
[ __ ] pissed a lot of it is your fault
is Twitch's fault because you will not
define what your platform is supposed to
be about I don't work professionally in
customer service but I feel like this is
very obvious which so I have to make
either one of two assumptions either one
the people that run PR at twitch are
[ __ ] [ __ ] and I say that very
meaningfully like I legitimately think
you are [ __ ] [ __ ] or two there's
something else that is going on behind
the scenes where you think that you can
keep skirting the issue
so I think that it does well to call
twitch out on this because twitch is not
only responsible for the upsetting of
people that use their site for the user
experience I think that a large amount
of the harassment that exists on twitch
is partially due to their actions
because when you sit here and you add
that sexual content can't be explicit in
your Terms of Service okay but then you
allow streams to exist that are very
clearly sexual in nature on your stream
what do you possibly expect to happen on
your on your service what do you expect
to happen to people that come on in
stream that kind of content they're
going to get harassed that's very
obvious it's very obvious anybody with
half a brain could look at that
situation and go hey you know we're kind
of setting ourselves up for a shitstorm
here we have women that are coming on to
our platform our streaming pretty
sexually explicit material we've added
to our TOS if they're not allowed to do
that and we kind of sort of ban people
for it sometimes yeah we'll just let it
you know we'll see what happens how
could you possibly act surprised when
users of your platform and customers of
your platform are starting to come under
fire for seemingly contradicting your
own TOS it's just really really really
shitty I don't know why twitch doesn't
just come out with a very clear
statement and say hey this is what our
platform is about if twitch does that
everything is solved the oh I don't I
just don't know why twitch doesn't do
that do you think that pink sparkles is
being overly sexual is stated in the
Terms of Service absolutely if you don't
consider pink sparkles streams to be
sexually explicit then you're either
being intellectually dishonest or you or
you or your [ __ ] idiot I don't know I
don't know how to how to communicate
with those people so the question is
okay and this is all it comes down to
this is it it's not a hard question and
again like I get so upset because people
make this issue to be so much more
wait he's saying that I hung up wait
what hold on one second this is a well
now that Robert I'll never talk to him
again
I just don't think he's like interested
in moving towards those the truth claims
that in in the way that I'm interested
in moving towards them which sounds like
really that sounds really arrogant to
say I understand that but like his
arguments are like we're like ridiculous
all right well we learned two things
from this conversation initially from
our first conversation but it was only
because I hadn't challenged him on any
points and I kind of understand I kind
of thought that this could happen
initially he sounded like somebody that
was very interested in arriving at the
truth matter of the arguments that I I
believed initially that he thought that
he was making truth claims about most of
the stuff that he talked about and so I
came into this conversation with enough
facts and figures that if he's sincerely
looking for truth claims what I expected
was him to say I'll get back to you on
most of the arguments I think he got
really mad at the name-calling that's
what I was expecting for most of this
conversation but what happened was every
time I started to give him fact-based
very specific arguments he started to
weasel around and then I started to
realize that and I and I realized
actually at the number one point that he
wasn't really interested in arriving at
any kind of fact-based or truth based
argument so for instance he says I've
been obsessing over this I mean I did
create like a pretty extensive outline
I'm sad that we didn't get to all of my
material but um so like for instance
when we talk about like the will of the
people argument right there is so much
data about different things that what
the Americans thought about at the time
the fact that it had bipartisan support
the fact that there are just so many
things that support the idea that like
the will of the people was represented
it's a pretty easy thing but um he kept
going back to like this really weird
fleein Fuentes kept going back to this
really weird well I've got up poll that
says this thing and I don't believe your
polls and then he kept referencing like
conspiracies that don't exist like this
clergy plan I couldn't find anything
about it the Hooten plan I did find
information about it was literally just
an art
written in a newspaper by some
anthropologist and it was his ideas on
how to destroy German nationalism but it
doesn't mention Africans in here doesn't
mention Western society and it was never
implemented by anybody right so I kind
of was hoping that for most of our
debate that we would kind of like go
through each of these points and that I
could show them like well look the data
says you're wrong and then eventually
he'd be like oh okay well you're right
yeah I guess I or I didn't expect him to
say that I expected you to say well I'll
come back next time there's more
research that I can do here that proves
you wrong that's more what I was looking
for right um
and it's kind of bizarre to me that it's
kind of bizarre to me that he kept he
kept saying that my arguments for
wishy-washy so for instance in the
Constitution there's nothing in there
about immigration from European
countries it doesn't exist
it just doesn't right so that puts a
mighty big burden on him to prove that
that was an intention of the original
founding fathers and the only thing he
has for that is some is the one time
John J inserts the word posterity in the
Constitution but when he references the
Federalist Papers John J's not talking
about posterity in here he's not even
talking about immigration in here so
that's like a really big stretch that
any wouldn't admit to any of that he was
like well this one sentence from John J
definitely proves it and then when I can
find all this evidence that um one there
was no idea this was supposed to be a
European primary country that just
doesn't exist and to even his definition
of white people is something that that
absolutely doesn't exist right that um
Benjamin Franklin had an entirely
different concept of what it meant to be
white than what Fuentes does today which
is beautiful which ironically enough
ironically enough foreigner Fuentes is a
white guy right and this kind of like
goes to prove my point
ironically enough as a as a
multiculturalist or if that's what you
want to call me I hate the word I don't
think I just it just sounds like a dumb
word to me but um like Nick is 25%
Hispanic and he considers himself to be
white enough for white America and he
and he gets there by way of like soul
math right well actually the cost I
don't know any of the background of like
different types of Hispanics or what I
realized well these kinds go back to the
Spanish bla bla bla bla bla well guess
what dude Benjamin Franklin didn't
consider Spanish people any more whiter
than Italians French or Russians and
Swedes all of whom he called swarthy
right
that um yeah that but even somebody like
him he considers himself white or I am
I'm white I'm half Cuban and I'm white
or um
John John Aryan I think that's his last
name
jontron he considers himself white he's
like Middle Eastern he's like half
he wouldn't even be like I don't even
know if he would be like a free person
in like the days of um I don't know like
how dark-skinned I don't know exactly
what was our stance on Middle Easterners
in in early United States history I have
no idea but um
oh is it John Jafari I thought his
middle it was his middle name like Aryan
or some [ __ ] I'm sorry did I read like
memes oh he might not have considered me
white though or look at this obsession
look at it look at how much he's
straining 91 percent ninety-one percent
white yeah it's a hilarious concept um
the person that I argued with from The
Daily stormer he was more he was more
intellectually honest about his position
in an ethnos State and that was a very
difficult conversation for me because he
made logical concessions when I argued
with the Daily stormer guy that guy said
that he understood that if he was going
to create an ethnos state he would be a
slave in that society and he said he was
okay with that but he understood he
wasn't pure enough for it so like I mean
obviously there's a whole bunch of
philosophical assertions that I could
make but on the surface he's at least
being intellectually honest that he's
not pure enough for his death no state
but Little Nicky here yeah I'm not sure
foreigner fuentes yeah so I don't know I
just it seemed really strange that he
was making do I need to explain my my
girl hair color analogy more that the
only poll he would cite was one that
already presupposed his argument that
was the only poll that he was willing to
cite for
yeah I don't know we could walk through
this oh I guess I'll uh I'll publish
this for you guys if you ever want to
use any of this there might be things
that you could criticize in here for
sure
but um no Scandinavia no Italians no
French no Germans when he cites the 1790
US census data he kind of brought this
up like when he talked about like the
Constitution establishes natural rights
so he probably has a bigger history
background than me but he misrepresents
so much which is what bothers me so
insofar as what I know about the
Constitution the idea behind the
Constitution wasn't to say that it God
existed it was just to say that um that
your rights come from something greater
than government now whatever you believe
that to be I believe that's true and I'm
an atheist III think that you can make
philosophical arguments for your rights
that should exist that are greater than
government that government should have
moral obligations to provide certain
things for people but I can believe that
without being without being religious
like social contract theory he kept
bringing up yeah I'm pretty sure you can
believe in social contract theory
without being religious you don't need a
god for any of that Christianity is not
given any special consideration and any
part of of the Constitution or posterity
I mean it's an American posterity it
doesn't say European posterity doesn't
say Christian posterity yeah he just
doesn't have he just didn't make any
good or I feel like I really feel like
he didn't make any good arguments for
any of this we didn't get into this
topic at all immigrants importing their
problems so once again he keeps like I
don't know he keeps like he wouldn't
give me any data [ __ ] I'm really
irritated cuz I looked up like so much
data if I had so much data for this yeah
I don't know just this doesn't seem to
be like a thing and I legitimately tried
to look for data that went against mine
because I'm really scared in any kind of
argument that I go into I'm always
scared that I'm wrong like I don't want
to go into an argument against somebody
that I feel like does research and be
wrong like [ __ ] that would that would
suck why would I ever do that like I
would look like a [ __ ] idiot you know
so no I like I put a lot of work into
putting this together to make sure that
like I don't
think that there are people that are in
the is in the business of collecting
stats that legitimately believe that
immigrants commit more crime than than
natives and this idea that we're missing
it with like second-generation
immigrants somehow or something is is
it's a it's a valid hypothesis but now
you have to provide the data to prove
that a number listen it couldn't give me
a source on anything he kept giving me
this really unrelated data there's 10
million Mexicans well okay what does
that have to do with integration Nick
what does it have to do with any of the
points bring in he would just give me
like this random disjointed data
I think it's cuz he wasn't prepared for
this at all and maybe I over prepared oh
I didn't get to read this quote at all
either
so Andrew balls PIMCO's chief investment
officer for global fixed income former
Financial Times journalist an ex teacher
of economics at Oxford published an
article in National Bureau of Economic
Research remarking on such as the
correlation between geography the
temperate versus non temperate zone and
its impact on societies yeah just that
there's like lots of problems that
countries experience that they can't
bring with them right like Africans
can't immigrate to the United States and
bring shitty temperatures right that
cause worse diseases it worse overall
medical care worse you know farming
conditions like this is kind of a there
are conditions that aren't that don't
come here from immigrants oh and we
didn't get to talk about this either
foreign-born populations from Africa are
actually some of the most educated
people in the country and they actually
hold degrees higher than European
immigrants foreign-born population in
the United States in 2010 this is a 2012
report by the US census shows that if
you come from Africa you've got a 10
percent higher chance of having a
bachelor's degree than if you come from
Europe now you can argue you can argue
that that may be the degrees are easier
to get an Africa or some [ __ ] but like
even if you look at like the breakdown
of like the number is like for instance
Nigerians are highly educated the the
median income for Nigerians is higher
than the median income for the average
American right that their median income
is 62 that so it's not like they get
like fake degrees and come to the United
States and do fuck-all or whatever there
are communities of white people that
commit crime the Italian mafia the Ku
Klux Klan although I don't know if
people consider this crime bad biker
gangs are primarily white people meth
labs and raised in the roll Midwest the
Aryan Brotherhood these are just
examples cuz he brought up that um that
white people don't commit crime and
claves like immigrants to Gallup and
Nick like I like this one
[Laughter]
when Africa sends people they're not
sending their worst guys they're sending
their most educated people oh I was
trying to look up numbers on the fly it
was really hard I was trying to
factoring him on the fly it's really
hard to do we didn't get to do any of
the we didn't get to do any of the
economic argument the economic argument
in the crime argument were the two that
I felt the most strongly about because
these are like these are the slam dunk
arguments nobody nobody legitimate
argues against the crime thing and
nobody legitimate argues against the
economic thing they just don't
immigrants are definitely a boon to the
economy and they seem to commit less
crime when you adjust for reasonable
reasonable like reasonable statistics
reasonable features or whatever they
seem to commit more or less crime than
their native counterparts these two
things are like not debated it just
seems like or I couldn't find any
evidence debating them I found like
there was like a Daily Caller article I
think I have somewhere where like they
try to like if you cherry-pick very
specific stats in very specific states
you can get some over-representation or
American crime for instance I think like
if you look at only like drug drug
runners like in Texas and you only look
at like federal incarceration and you
ignore state incarceration like you can
find you can find over representations
of Hispanics but most of those arguments
seem like they were really heavily
cherry-picked yeah I don't know I mean
if you have if anybody has like
alternate crime data I'd be really
interested to see it because it would be
like it would be a big deal if you could
find it because I just can't find any of
this data that shows that immigrants are
are committing more crime than natives I
just can't find that information what
else did we know so we didn't get to
talk about any of the economics [ __ ]
this was like this was a big slam dunk
er here social cohesion argument ah this
is a big one too I really wanted to
bring up the social cohesion argument
the last time I got into a debate with
Nick he brought up Robert
and Robert Putnam was the singular
person that he cited to prove that we
could not be socially cohesive we could
not be socially cohesive with immigrants
in the United States
he cited putnams research to prove that
but the funny thing is that Putnam
himself doesn't agree with that
assertion and he actually feels so
strongly against it that when the United
States Supreme Court ruled on Fisher
versus University of Texas but had which
had to do with affirmative action
policies basically some chick didn't get
into the school and she blamed
affirmative action when they went to
court Fisher cited putnams research as
evidence for why affirmative action
shouldn't exist
Putnam himself filed a brief with the
Supreme Court saying this [ __ ] is crazy
she's taking all of my research out of
context and I absolutely disagree and I
have quotes from Putnam himself and here
defending immigration defending the
integration of foreigners in our - into
our community and proclaiming the
benefits of things like increased
diversity and increased integration of
people from other countries here [ __ ] I
even had um I even had like there's like
YouTube cry even I listen to these
videos not a way of saying stop worrying
about these poor other poor kids in
America the immigrants are gonna fix it
for us I don't and and by the way family
stability in the second generation of
immigrants goes they revert to a the
American pattern that as the families
become less stable right the Americans
now the funniest thing is that some of
the biggest increases in integration of
Americans or I'm sorry in foreigners was
actually negative so for instance when
immigrants first come over they don't
commit as much crime but the first and
second generations start to commit more
crime but that's because they're
approaching the they're approaching the
native crime rates hold on let me see if
I can find this I actually had a Pew
article about this that was kind of
funny
crime arises among second-generation
immigrants as they assimilate so this is
our first generation immigration right
this is our first generation immigrants
these are the second generation
immigrant crime rates right where they
where because of integration potentially
right that's a pretty hard causal link
to make I'll be honest about that maybe
there are other things going on but like
I thought that was kind of funny that
second-generation immigrants commit more
crime because they're more similar to
the native people a few times your own
youth oh [ __ ] this wasn't the exact
quote I don't know why it linked to this
time stamp I think immigration is a big
success story in America absolutely do
you won't find me not saying immigration
as an important successor in America
that was the quote I don't know why it
linked to something different what isn't
I got like through the subtitles but I'm
too lazy [ __ ] that but anyway yeah the
Putnam thing I wanted to talk about the
social cohesion thing but I didn't get a
chance to do it I wanted to I was gonna
go more I was more because I had the
fact-based part of this argument
rock-solid I wanted to do more
philosophy with him I really wanted to
talk to him about religion and souls
because because I remember these to my
edgy atheist days this was just like
such a slam dunk argument it's so easy
to argue with somebody that's religious
because it's so insanely irrational to
be religious the problem is that you
have to concede that if you're religious
you're religious with no evidence
because you have no evidence for your
belief and that if you can assert a
belief without evidence and expect other
people to follow that belief you have to
accept other people asserting their
beliefs without evidence and you
following their beliefs and no religious
person will make that concession so you
can always force a religious person to
back up and say okay I'm sorry I want to
maintain my religiosity but I understand
I can't enforce those morals on you you
have to do that with every religious
person if you want to make an argument
for any sort of moral or spiritual basis
you have to be able to do so in a
secular manner or in a way that doesn't
force somebody to accept some sort of
supernatural boogeyman and I don't think
Nick would be able to do that because he
falls back on tradition tradition and
religiosity quite a bit
oh I had stuff I looked up stuff on the
brain drain and then I think there was
one more topic let's say oh the white
guilt argument that only white countries
are supposed to take on people that's
not true tons of Middle Easterners have
taken on have taken on refugees and
whatnot even Saudi Arabia has I believe
but they don't register them with the
UNHCR so I don't I don't want it I would
never cite Saudi Arabia numbers because
I'm curious if you hear the sermon once
in America Mexican immigrants face great
challenges often with no knowledge of
the English language and with little
formal education many Mexican immigrants
are compelled to accept low-wage manual
labor jobs and were freaked are
frequently exploited by middlemen who
act as intermediaries between them and
the prospective employers many sought
housing in the older sections of the
large cities were they settled and they
became known as little Mexico is
frequently an overcrowded substandard
tenements which were often dimly lit
with poor heating and ventilation do you
think this is an OK summary of Mexicans
in the United States today yes okay well
I just replaced the word Mexico I
replaced the word Italian with Mexican
these were Italians in the nineteen go
ahead slippery Nick good evening
everybody we are watching America first
my name is Nicholas J Francis and we
have a great show for you tonight a very
exciting debate between myself and
Stephen Bono better known as destiny and
hang out let me check my volumes a
little bit high here so destiny welcome
to the show how are you doing pretty
good how are you done I'm going well I'm
excited so for the audience that is not
aware we had a debate I think it was two
or three weeks ago on the subject of
immigration it was a long one it was a
two-hour debate I thought it was
relatively civil I thought was
relatively reasonable got a little bit
ugly online as it tends to do a little
bit later but your question to come back
on the show and discuss it on you know
obviously you believe there is some
unfinished business here so I'll give
you the floor right out of the gate
let's hear it let's hear your case let's
hear the rematch the the redress of the
first debate sure so basically I kind of
wanted to just go over more or less what
we talked about last time except a
little bit more in depth in each of your
arguments the way that I kind of
envision this happening is I'm going to
try to restate what I believe your
argument is as fairly as possible you
tell me if you agree with it and then
I'll bring up a challenge to it and you
can kind of tell me if you think it's
legitimate or not it's pretty much all I
wanted to do sounds good I'm alright you
want to dive right into it then yeah
let's do it all right so I think I had
like eight or nine different points that
are kind of broke here
argument up into so the first one that
we started off with last time I believe
it was the will of the people argument
yeah this is my summary of your argument
you can tell me if this is fair or not
or if you would amend it the will of the
American people was not represented when
Congress voted on the 1965 Hart cellar
act this immigration reform
fundamentally changed the composition of
America and most people would have been
opposed to that how that information
been made public one may go as far as to
say that this move was actually
subversive and that the will of the
people was intentionally betrayed yes
agreed 100% gotcha so I did a lot of
digging around for this because I was
just kind of curious if this is actually
true or not and I guess not much to my
surprise I really couldn't find any
evidence of this at all I looked at some
polling data at the time I guess so
basically my counter argument was that
the the the composition of America
changed but I don't think there was any
sort of subversive way to do it and I
think it just kind of happened
accidentally I don't think anybody
actually knew how much the composition
of America would change in regards to
the art cellar act passing if I say
anything you disagree would feel free to
stop me
so I have a couple of polls when done
but Harris and one done by Gallup and
both of them show pretty much the same
thing that about seventy percent of
Americans at the time the heart cellar
Act was passed were actually in favor of
judging an immigrant on some
characteristic that wasn't related to
their national origin so only three out
of ten Americans there thirty percent of
Americans were in favor of maintaining
that very strict where does the
immigrant come from quota as part of the
immigration thing as I mentioned before
when we talked about this last time the
bill actually had widespread bipartisan
support seventy-four percent of
Democrats and 85 percent of Republicans
supported this bill and even when
efforts were made to appease I will use
a loaded word to appease some of the
more racist lawmakers such as the
Dixiecrats even when efforts were made
to appease these guys these guys
eventually hopped on and voted for it
and they didn't see any backlash from
any of their constituents later on in
any of their political lives so I guess
my question when I kind of look at this
is how can you honestly say that you
believe that the will of the American
people wasn't represented when both
parts have caught both halves of
Congress the Republican in the Democrat
half and all of the people at the time
in the country seemed to be in favor of
the passage of this act sure well I
think I agreed with the data you know
nothing wrong with the data the problem
I don't think the data contradicts my
claim and I think your summary was a
little bit off you you say that 70
percent from that Gallup poll or a
little bit more than 70 percent said
that they wanted to judge immigrants on
something other than national origin I
don't think that's quite the same as the
particular provisions in the hard sell
or act which were to completely
eliminate the National Origins quota and
additionally to eliminate any kind of
restrictions on the amount of
immigration so those two things I don't
think are I don't think are the same to
to compare those two provisions which is
to not limit people by national origin
and to not limit the number of people
it's not quite the same as saying we
should judge people based on something
other than national origin and 73
percent say that you know we know a lot
of people pay lip service to this idea
of all men are created equal and so on
but in practice rarely really I think do
people agree with that in in pragmatism
in their daily life so that's on the
first hand I'm the second hand I agree
with you there there is no evidence that
this was a conspiracy and I I said we
can speculate that congressmen might
have had a better idea of the
transformative effect than the regular
person that's what I said and I said
maybe there is a conspiracy because
we've seen certain other conspiracies
like the Hooton plan and the clergy plan
in Europe which wanted to transform that
continent in a similar fashion so I said
purely speculatively that it was
conspiracy but regardless I said the
problem was that you had a
transformative act like this that nobody
really knew about or people don't know
about now I mean you yourself said in
the first debate that you hadn't heard
of the 65 Immigration Act or what it
entail my problem was at no point in a
major election at no point in a major
presidential debate in a major midterm
election was mass immigration voted on I
don't feel like there was an election
where mass immigration it was a
referendum on mass immigration and there
should have been something like that so
I can see to you yes you're right that
it had widespread bipartisan support in
the Congress but rarely do I think the
representatives in Congress are totally
representative of the will of the people
and I think if you really are and again
this is a major important thing
happening it should have been a
referendum in an election it should have
been a major issue not an act of
Congress so I mean is that does that
make sense
yeah but I totally disagree firstly
because we usually don't vote by these
kinds of issues by referendum in the
United States just not the kind of
government we run
I guess primarily you keep going back to
this it seems like you're kind of trying
to weasel in that like well people
didn't really think this thing but you
don't really have any polling data or
anything whatsoever to support that view
that's just your personal belief right
do you admit that yeah yeah no I think
it's a personal belief that's based on
well it's you already sound
understanding of the time well be here I
mean you have you have one poll to
suggest you call the people okay you
have two polls to suggest well what's
the second poll I only heard the pie
it's a Harris Poll was done in 1965 and
then in 1965 Gallup poll as well so both
of them were down at the time very
relevant very high but the same I mean
the same data essentially I mean
different polls but the same result
correct that people yeah which goes to
show that the results are probably
accurate yeah yeah right yeah and I of
course I concede the data but again you
have you have these two polls and we
have the mood of the time of the 1960s I
mean do you think and I'm asking you
this in an honest way and please be
intellectually honest do you think that
if people could look at this policy and
we're told the actual results of it if
they were given like a projection of
what would happen in the 80s and the 90s
of immigration that you would have
massive influxes of immigration from
Mexico and Asia do you think that the
people of 1965 when you had the KKK
marching through Skokie Illinois when
you had the Civil Rights Act that was
opposed by politicians who had people
running on the platform of segregation
now segregation forever do you think
that people would have been for that
maybe maybe not but that's a
fundamentally different question oh
let's see okay but see you say maybe
maybe not but I again I think you're
being a little bit intellectually
dishonest like if we look at something
like a war if somebody would have vote
in favor of the Iraq war not against the
Iraq war whatever you can't really ask
after you see how the Iraq war turned
out do you think people the will of the
people is represented it's just a non
sequitur but that's different but no
it's absolutely the same it's absolutely
no of course it's not because you cannot
predict that I mean war in intrinsically
is a chaotic event I mean that
Bismark you roll the iron dice with
immigration when you put in place
certain policies they have projections
based on how these things turn out and
obviously so we can talk we can talk
specifically about one of these
projections so in an effort to appease
conservative lawmakers like the
Dixiecrats there's a guy called Michael
Michael Fagan Feyen I don't know to
pronounce this guy's name I'm sorry but
this was like an example of a politician
that was very much against this bill
because he thought that it was going to
transform the demographics of America
much like you as a result of people like
that of the more racist anti-civil
rights people they actually made that
family member provision one of the most
important parts of the bill itself so
that idea that you can bring over family
members that actually became the
highest-ranking part of that bill in an
effort to appease those people so the
people that were most ideologically
aligned to you ended up advocating for
the number-one part of the bill that
caused so much of this immigration to
happen that people like you would be
opposed to I think that points pretty
concretely that it was kind of an
accident that the congressman didn't
actually know how it would turn out
unless you have any evidence to the
contrary that people did know and were
being deliberately misrepresentative
again it's purely speculative I I didn't
say that there was I knew of a
conspiracy or there was evidence I said
there was evidence that there have been
conspiracies in the past there have been
deliberate attempts in the past to
mislead and deceive people into excuse
me accepting massive amounts of
immigrants for meta political ads and
and I cited the Hooten plan and the
clergy plan of people sharing those up I
actually I did look those up so the
Hooten plan wasn't done by a politician
it was just an anthropologist that like
wrote an article in editorial for a
newspaper the Hooten plan was never
anything that was done or advocated for
by any politician whatsoever this would
be the equivalent of me finding an
editorial on the New York Times and
saying well look at what this plan was
in the past it was literally just some
anthropologist guy who I think was
Jewish so maybe I don't know if you
don't like him because of that but um he
just basically wrote an op-ed and he was
like oh this is what should happen from
and and it basically had to do with them
helping to take Germany out of like
they're crazy nationalistic Hitler era
or whatever it was more or less related
there was no grand Hooten conspiracy
plan and for the clergy plan I tried to
find information on that too I really
couldn't find anything I see that this
color-keyed guy was somebody that was
instrumental in founding I think was
called the pan European Union which was
like one of the precursors to the United
Nations but
this guy wasn't an influential
politician I think it was like a count I
think he talked to a couple people like
he was friends with a few politicians I
want to say like a like a Polish
Ambassador or somebody but these guys
weren't massive pop political figures
neither of these plans were some crazy
subversive plan implemented by any
politician anywhere there's no evidence
that any of these plants were ever
exercised and really there's no evidence
of that there's no evidence of the fact
that Europe has been transformed
demographically not by a plan now of
course we have very limited evidence of
conspiracies that happen it but look I
mean this is fundamentally getting away
from the point
well I only because you you brought this
up to defend your point and I'm showing
you that neither of these plans are even
real no Clark your plan is the point is
that this is this has been thought of
before the point is that it wasn't a
thought this yeah and I finished your
talking over me Ivan
so the clergy the Hooten planned the
point is I'm not saying they were
implemented I'm not saying they were
exercising levers of government what I
am saying is that to speculate that
people might have a vested interest in
transforming the the composition of the
country and might deceive people has an
intellectual antecedent in these ideas
I'm saying it's not it's not like some
fiction of my imagination the people
have thought of these political ends
before and written about them and
promulgated them yeah but I mean the
recent since we can do both this
speculation all day people speculate
that the moon but that doesn't make it
it's a very point those it's not it's
not a baseless it's based on
intellectual antecedents in Europe that
has nothing to do with any politicians
or any political plans would you take
moon landing conspiracy seriously
because some people theorize that the
moon landing could be faked it just
doesn't make any sense yeah you're
missing the point the point was to say
if we were to speculate that somebody
wanted to deceive the American public to
transform it demographically there have
been intellectuals in the past who have
thought the same thing so it's not you
know again I'm saying it has nothing to
do with with politicians I never claimed
that so you keep saying it has nothing
to do with politicians I'm not arguing
that I'm arguing that these
intellectuals had this idea they said in
order to achieve these political ends to
to hurt Europe to hurt the West and in a
strange vindictive fashion we want to
inflict demographic transformation on
them and I'm saying
if we are to speculate that people could
have understood the ramifications of
this policy and it's quite clear if you
read the actual text of the bill what
would result from it I think it is fair
to say there is a chance and I'm not
saying I'm saying it's a nonzero chance
I'm not saying it's a good chance I'm
saying there's a nonzero chance that
this was deceptively forced on the
public and you know what you bring up
your poll I will read you one of my
polls so you talk about 60 or 70 some
percent say that they don't think people
should be chosen based on their national
identity here is a poll from Cornell and
this is from the Roper Center from 1965
and people are asked which countries or
places would you least like to see
immigrants into the United States come
from Asia 15 percent 15 percent of
respondents said they would at least
like to see people from that country
Mexico is 11 percent people were polled
and asked what countries would they most
like to see people come from 28 percent
of Canada 28% said England or Scotland
20 percent said skin I mean all the top
countries for most wanted or were
Northern European all the top countries
for the least wanted were third-world
Latin American and Asia and we could
look at other data here if you want to I
mean do you want to address that first
before I get into these other numbers
yeah but um so so first cuz I don't
wanna just leave these points so the
Hooton plan was not a plan to destroy
Western Europe I'm just not sure what
you think it was so the Hooton plan was
an article I read it actually you can
take it out of old newspapers by an
anthropologist and basically he was kind
of theorizing ideas based on kind of
oldie wacky pseudoscience he things but
his idea was that he wanted to breed the
extremism out of the German people they
don't know the war strains yeah the
worst means the worst trains out of the
German people ironically enough Africa's
not even mentioned I think he was
mentioning bringing in like British
people and whatnot or other other
European Nationals had nothing to do
with bringing black people into Europe
to take over the entire continent it
literally was very specifically targeted
towards Germans and breeding out the war
strains or whatever and
again this wasn't supposed to be done
secretly he wrote this as like an op-ed
in like a newspaper it wasn't a secret
subversive plan there's no evidence that
anybody tried to implement anything he
said it's just not what you're
presenting it as it that you're fixating
on a small detail I'm not presenting it
as anything other than I am what I'm
saying is people have theorized in the
past that you can use immigration
whether it be from Britain or Africa or
anywhere else people if they arise that
you can use race you can use the
transformation of the demographic
composition of country to inflict harm
on it and I'm saying again I said
there's a nonzero chance that that
happen and given again the results of
the immigration and if you read the text
of the bill there is no way that you
could not predict that you would have
massive third world immigration there's
no way and so I and again I'm being
generous and saying let's give them the
benefit of the doubt however there is a
this is like my incredibly basic opinion
so I could be totally uninformed about
this but the few like so okay so I'm
gonna be a little arrogant here it seems
like when people are decent at math it
seems like they develop little tricks
inside of their head to shortcut things
so I went through life assuming that
this was just common that people always
did this that people have these little
shortcuts in their head to make things
easier but apparently not everybody does
this what common core or some of what
common core seems to do from what I've
seen is it just make some of those
tricks more transparent so that you can
use them so like for instance when I did
this math here eight times 115 that's
like that's a really hard math problem
in your head 115 115 115 it's just very
weird the five makes it weird think it's
just a weird it's a weird no 500 yeah
but if you do yeah eight times one
hundred is eight hundred ten times eight
is eighty five times eight is forty so
48 at least 120 and then 120 and eight
hundred is nine 20 like that is that's a
really easy thing that you can do yeah
and there's a lot of little tricks like
that with addition subtract subtract
ssin and multiplication probably
division as well there's just a lot of
little tricks like that that you kind of
develop and I guess Common Core spells
some of those out but adults when they
see some of those tricks spelled out get
like really really really [ __ ] ass
pained like I've seen like the railroad
track thing if you've ever seen that
some parents give a breakdown on how
autistic the railroad track thing is but
um that's like that's how I've always
thought of it like you group things up
to the closest hundreds like 394 - like
112 would be like like you would do like
like 300 - 100 and then you do like 94
might like you'd there's just like a
bunch of like little things like that
you do but um yeah the conventional
method of doing the addition and
subtraction with that [ __ ] with you like
somewhere you subtract something to
carry the 1 or whatever that [ __ ] is
impossible to do in your head or I can't
do that [ __ ] in my head if I think of
like if I think I'd like the number like
372 - like 85 like trying to think of
like - -5 carry the 1 from the 7 to make
it a 6 and that's like that's really
really difficult that's not intuitive or
at least for me personally I don't feel
that in my head at all I could never do
that type of math on my head I just make
it a round number yeah you make it a
round number you remember what you added
and then you just kind of like throw it
later yeah yeah exactly like that kind
of stuff is like really really simple
you can do that math very quickly very
accurately in your head
and it seems like most of what I read
from comically strives to teach that
type of thinking the whole point of
order of operations to eliminate
ambiguity obviously ambiguity shouldn't
exist in any of these poems are used to
test order of operations knowledge I
totally disagree
but okay do you have a how can you
disagree with that because order of
operations is supposed to test your
ability to to evaluate solutions in the
correct order it's not supposed to be
ambiguously written those are two
totally different things for instance if
I say the quantity of five plus five
times seven or whatever like you
supposed to do the addition before you
do the multiplication or whatever right
although you could do the you could use
like algebra to do it but um it's just
supposed to test your knowledge of the
orbiter operation not supposed to
ambiguously write problems it's just not
you're wrong here please stop oh no I'm
gonna hide in a shock for a second I
don't know why we're talking about math
which I don't know why I do it's just
there's no argument here so the problem
with this problem okay is that the
divisor sign is just something that we
don't see used in math often because
it's an incredibly ambiguous sign this
doesn't test your knowledge on anything
it's a poorly written problem the
problem is that we don't know if we have
20 divided by 5 times okay the quantity
of two times two this is one way to
interpret the problem but because of how
everybody that I've known now I only say
this I only say this because I don't
know what math looks like in other
countries maybe in other countries you
guys do it differently is that it this
looks like it could be twenty divided by
the quantity of five times the quantity
of two times two okay
it's ambiguously written because this
divisor sign is never ever ever [ __ ]
or lease I never saw it I've never seen
this when you get to calculus I've never
seen the divisor sign used like this
before I would never ever ever ever
survive the slash yeah you don't see
because the way this would be spoken is
it sounds like it's 20 divided by the
quantity of 5 times the quantity of 2
times 2
what it sounds like so this divisor sign
is just really really really [ __ ]
bizarre it's just really weird it's a
very very very ambiguously written
problem
yeah destiny Syria oh yeah okay whatever
dude good luck have fun let me know in
your kal call back when you get teachers
writing the [ __ ] divisor sign when
you get to calc and reef up in yours dog
okay dude
well Justin in algebra we still use the
divisor sign all the time actually
destiny when you're doing integrals you
actually see that's actually really
[ __ ] common actually destiny you see
kind of you see stuff like this you see
stuff like this all the time destiny
like okay dude this is this is so
shittily written I can't even imagine
that anybody would accept a problem
written like this from a [ __ ]
professor if you had a problem written
like this in any calc class every
[ __ ] student would be raised on hair
like hey professor what the [ __ ] did you
mean by this because I never see this
notation in anything ever because it's
the dumbest [ __ ] possible way to
write a division problem but okay it's
not uncommon to use a slash when putting
an equation in line okay Nariman all
right now right now I'm not gonna get
the fact that so many people get it
wrong is evidence that I'm 100% correct
like the fact that so many people can
read it and get it wrong when there's an
alternative to writing it that makes the
answer incredibly obvious demonstrates
that there is a problem with getting it
wrong unless you're some kind of elitist
little [ __ ] [ __ ] that enjoys writing
things as ambiguously as possible to
show how [ __ ] huge your brain is like
it's so obviously written incorrectly
that if a ton of people can look at it
and evaluate it incorrectly there's a
problem in the notation like this is why
we have like standards for notation it's
why this types of stuffs exist I don't
know how you can sit here and take a
problem that so many people can be
confused about not because they don't
know order of operations people know
generally how to do past math class know
that you're supposed to multiply and
divide first the fact that you can take
something that's so ambiguously written
against so many people to get it
incorrect is evidence of the notation is
incredibly flawed but but but okay
there is a specific niche occasion where
that writings acceptable yeah sure of
course yeah of course you can find like
niches where like there are times where
this where this notation is your I'm
sure like there is a [ __ ] assignment
I did on Maple at some point where
there's like become for covers in
formatting and [ __ ] like you might write
on the guy but in general you're not
gonna pair the divisor sign with other
like quantitative multiplication where
you're you're multiplying quantities of
things it's just way too confusing it's
way too [ __ ] stupid explain this then
these divisor signs are not ambiguous
these all look better this is just
dividing a single thing it's not giving
you something that is where it looks
like if you were looking at an algebra
or a calc problem that the coin so it's
an it's multiplying the quantity of
something different software will
process this differently even different
models of Texas Instruments graphing
calculators will process this
differently in cases of ambiguity be
very careful of your parentheses and
make your meaning clear the general
consensus among math people is that
multiplication by juxtaposition that is
multiplying by just putting things next
to each other rather than using the X
sign indicates that the GX opposed
values must be multiplied together
before processing other operations I
just don't know what to say cuz I can I
can ever tell the people arguing in good
faith or not if I ever had this written
to me on a problem where it was 20
divided by 5x like if you saw this would
you assume that this means 20 divided by
5 and then this quantity here multiplied
by X would you ever assume that would
you ever assume this ever you would
never make that assumption 20 divided by
5x you would never assume this so why
would you make a totally different
assumption for 20 divided by 5 and then
we'll let X equal 3 times 3 or 3 plus 3
or whatever right why would you all of a
sudden assume now that this means 20
divided by 5 and then times 3 plus 3 you
would never make this assumption
with proper bed mass you would yeah so
again like you're taking this order of
operations thing to like some really
like autistic like extreme where it's
just you just shouldn't write things
this way at this point why not just use
parentheses to clear it up well that's
the whole thing of what I'm saying is
that it's a poorly written thing that's
so like if we take the people who sang
the sing the opposite that's not true so
if we were to say look at this 20
divided by 5 times the quantity of 2
times 2 if this was 20 divided by 5 X
correct if it was written this way you
would never assume that it's 20 divided
by 5 and then multiplied by X you would
never assume this you would never assume
that 20 divided by 5x is equal to 20
divided by 5 multiplied by x over 1 you
would never ever ever assume this your x
is always in the denominator here
because you would in your mind because
now again I'm only speaking from an
American perspective maybe in Russia or
the Ukraine or in France America maybe
you guys write your problems a little
bit differently but for American
dictation I've never ever seen somebody
take a 5 X here and assume that this
means 20 divided by 5 times x over 1
I've never seen this in my entire life
so in this case if we let X equal the
quantity of 2 times 2 right where we
take 20 divided by 5 and we replace X
with the quantity of 2 times 2 why would
you ever assume it's just again this is
just autism it's just autism this is
just so it's just so bizarrely written
it's just so bizarrely written that's
all I'm saying that's my original point
that this the way this problem is
written is so ambiguously [ __ ]
ambiguously [ __ ] that it's just [ __ ]
why do we care about this cuz retards
like spider dip [ __ ] whatever have
like one assignment we're like in a
computer program they might have to
notate something a specific way ok
spiders spiders answer this question if
you saw this written this way if
you saw this written out this way would
you assume that you do 20 divided by 5
and then you multiply it by X can you
give me a yes or no answer to that if
you saw this written this way would you
assume that this means 20 divided by 5
and then that quantity right this
quantity multiplied by the value of x
would you assume that you're correct
with your entire last 4 minutes I never
argue that well then what's the
difference between replacing X here with
an actual value that if we do 20 divided
by 5 and we let X represent anything
else why does this change then so you so
you're telling me that you would parse
this you would parse this differently
than you would parse this why why are
you assuming grouping that isn't
explicitly there because that's how math
works because nobody okay I'm sorry
in every calc lesson in every class I
ever took I could be wrong okay I fully
admit this I've never seen this notation
okay maybe you saw this notation okay if
your teachers wrote [ __ ] like this then
I'm totally [ __ ] sorry okay if your
teachers wrote something that looked
like this frequently 7x and you and they
wrote 7x like this then I told that I'm
sorry maybe in your math classes is
within it I've never seen notation like
this before though I saw five
parenthesis X constantly in math class
people think 5x is different than [ __ ]
is it wait so you're saying that this is
treated completely differently than like
this so in all of your like in all of
your functions where you're substituting
functions for other functions you oh I
don't know dude okay sure I I don't care
I lost I have no interest in this entire
argument I have no interest in any of us
anywhere around okay I think I think the
Lord I had an easy education I guess so
none of my teachers ever wrote [ __ ] that
was like so artistically ambiguous that
um like even in this I don't know what
purple math calm is but even in here the
general consensus my math people is that
multiplication by juxtaposition that is
multiplying by just putting things next
to each other like 5x indicates that the
juxtaposed values must be multiplied
together before processing other
operations this is how I've always seen
everything written about in my entire
life but
[Music]
is this the new portal problem mas ter
b8 like if I was working with I only
ever used maple I never use Wolfram
Alpha so if I was working with with a
program and I wanted to do this if I
wanted to write I'm sorry if I wanted to
write this out I would never ever ever
ever ever ever ever enter this into
anything that I ever worked with I would
never do this what I would write is I
would write if this is how I intend for
this to be interpreted it would be it
would there would be an easy parentheses
here now we have the quantity of 20
divided by 5 and then that would be
multiplied by 2 plus 2 and then this is
completely unambiguous it could never be
written differently we follow our we
don't have any weird [ __ ] autism
order of operations [ __ ] like this
is what you would write there would be
no confusion here oh ok the quantity of
20 divided by 5 multiplied by the
quantity of 2 plus 2 not having adopted
reverse polish notation there's clearly
one answer to the top so if this was 20
divided by 5x you would assume that
you're having 20 divided by 5 times X 5
times X would be calculated and then you
do 20 divided by 5 X so if we let X
equal any value it would be 20 divided
by 5 with the way that it's written
you could easily interpret it that way
that these are this is one term 5 times
the quantity of 2 times 2 is just 5 X
way there is actually something called
the reverse polish notation okay we're
done why are we talking about this put
it in Excel click
oh [ __ ] dude I would never enter that
former thing in a software and any type
of software maybe there's some software
that people use that I'm not familiar
with but like this is so ambiguous like
it's so ambiguous to stay here and look
at this and say this is a well written
problem requires a special type of
autism it's the opposite you wouldn't
write it like that in real life but it's
so much easier to write like that on a
computer it's that hard to stick one
extra parenthesis I feel like I would
get confused looking at my own work I
feel like I would lose my mind trying to
parse that information I feel like I
would just get constantly befuddled but
maybe I'm not like 190 IQ why not just
make it easy with yourselves and just
[Music]
you
sustainable that holds our values and
will be enjoyable for generations who
will inherit that oh you just jumped in
here Oh doc we're in it
Baron and everyone's favorite destiny it
is joining us as well destiny could you
give us a little bit of an intro hey
what's up I do video games of politics I
think most people here probably know who
I am I think I've talked to most of you
at one point or another right fuentes I
remember Laura and I remember
roaming Millenial I've seen you say a
couple things and then a no-bullshit
we've had the pleasure of talking a few
times hi guys I'm taking a while thank
you for having me on Lauren hi guys
of course alright so let's start things
out with Nick you are probably the most
far right on this stream so you would
see a very different future from the
ones that people even on the alt light
or of course Steven or contra points
would see where do you think you veer
off from the traditional right people
like roaming millennial and myself and
why do you think the future you foresee
it with more of the alt-right is
preferable sure so where I veer off from
the alt light Drive you're off from a
lot of these new characters that came
about since the election is I'm a
traditionalist a traditionalist
conservative more accurately so whereas
many people in the alt light are
classical liberals self-described
classical liberals I define myself as a
traditionalist conservative in that I
value order hierarchy tradition ritual
over things like freedom over things
like economic Liberty that a lot of the
ben shapiro types enjoy so my vision for
the country is a country that is
producing children again as a country
that has jesus christ at its core a
country that has the family at its core
and a country fundamentally that people
enjoy living in and is healthy for
people's mental and soul you know their
their minds and their souls so to speak
and so I think that's preferable in a
lot of ways because you look at the
Reagan Revolution for example is kind of
a good example of the triumph of
classical liberalism this this purely
materialist vision of our country and of
the West
and you see that we still even though we
have well even though we have freedom we
still have suicide epidemics we still
have drug epidemics we still have all
kinds of symptoms of a society that is
not working and so that's why my vision
I think would work because we're getting
back to a country that is functional it
has the fundamentals right now when you
consider yourself alright
just to clarify things my technical II
don't consider it myself all right only
because they tend to lose me on the pure
racialism the identitarian ism and
specifically the racialist strand of
identitarian ISM I'm not about that but
do you want like a white America what do
you say I want a white super majority in
America yeah okay now no [ __ ]
roaming millennial there and don't worry
Steven I will get to you and would you
say that you have any disagreements with
Nick on this um well I'm someone who is
also on the right something that from
what I've just heard him say I do
disagree with is that I'm someone who's
on the right but I am a someone who
lives leans libertarian and from the
sounds of it Nick you kind of lean more
to the authoritarian spectrum so I'm
someone who like ben shapiro really
values my things like economic freedom
individual liberty things like that and
so that's probably a disagreement we
would have and that's also one of the
among many disagreements that i have
with people who tend to be more on the
alright i tend to see this desire for i
guess not not you know the social
justice more left-leaning type of
government regulations but still a very
strong state or a very strong state
power and that's i'm someone who i want
small government and big community
involvement big churches things like
that it's not that i'm a libertarian who
things like yeah you know we'll all just
do drugs and have no roads that kind of
thing no control I'm just someone who
would rather those sort of I guess
tampering influences come from things
like community smaller communities
churches even on the state level of
things like that
now Stephen what are your issues with
adorable sweater man and wonderful small
government Neil because I know you're
probably seething there about people not
doing jobs anymore and
having traditional families oh I'm never
seeing so basically the undeniable
reality right now is that the world is
headed towards a more kind of globalist
whatever you want to call it thing and
that it's probably the best thing that
we can do is make sure that we kind of
integrate ourselves into that world as
effectively as possible to ensure that
as many people are you know kept free
and happy and economically prosperous as
possible rather than to try to hold on
to this idea that we can keep the
country looking like it did 50 or 100 or
150 years ago why do you think this
future is going to be more economically
prosperous than what we had 50 years ago
this globalists future you envision why
why will that be a positive thing for
the future for me personally I mean I'm
a capitalist I'm a strong believer in
capitalism and in terms of like
globalist policy generally being good
for economics that's not really an issue
that's debated by any I guess any
economist that I've ever heard of
the ability to work together with other
countries to capitalize on each other's
advantages these are things that are
generally accepted by pretty much all
economists to be incredibly economically
beneficial things of course they bring
all their problems as well but those are
problems that I would hope to address
rather than I guess some people kind of
want to throw out the whole system
because there are a couple things wrong
with it and then go back to whatever we
had 50 or a hundred years ago
you're being shockingly reasonable right
now I mean I'm a very reasonable person
Concha points welcome thank you for
coming on the stream I know you guys can
get in [ __ ] for associating with us
horrible full fascist Nazis on right
wing YouTube but do tell me what your
vision is for the future and where you
would veer off from people like myself
Nick and Roma millennial and others well
I would like to see an America that is a
juster and fairer version of the one we
already have which is to say a country
built by waves of immigration and not
Disneyland for white supremacists
Disneyland for whites predict because
these people who talk about equality in
one breath and then talk about mass
immigration and another what do you
think is going to happen when you import
people from the third
you're going to get the same Brutalism
the same despotism the same tyranny the
same low IQ of the third world in our
country I just I don't see how you score
this sir what happened when you had ways
of Italian immigrants or Irish
immigrants people in the third world
back then no no those were followers of
Christ those are Europeans and average
IQs you see really followers of Christ
are going to cook wait aren't Mexicans
mainly Catholic I do like what's up
aren't Mexicans Catholics too primarily
because in the early 21st century the
Catholic Irish Catholics it was viewed
as papist invasion like I mean it's
essentially the same argument no it's
not I mean there's just there's
differences between Italians and Anglos
for example but the differences between
Mediterraneans and Italians or excuse me
mediterraneans and Anglos is a lot
smaller than the differences between
sub-saharan Africans and Anglos I don't
think anyone would argue if you granted
up this racist pseudoscience is correct
no but I mean just like we're not not
even talking about genetically but just
culturally you have to admit that a
judeo-christian culture and I you know
I'm including Mexico and this is it is
more that's right I'm bringing the Jews
into this as well I'm counting them
they're gonna be more similar and have
an easier time integrating than
individuals from somewhere from like a
predominantly Muslim culture and I think
we're seeing that like historically
speaking even people from Latin America
are having an easier time assimilating
culturally than what we're seeing in
Europe right now with migrants from
largely Muslim countries right there is
that cultural difference that is harder
to breach the more different the
cultures are what would you say cultural
difference like I don't understand where
this idea is so funny hearing this
because like in America we don't have
one culture like if you take somebody
that lives in LA and you try to transmit
them to a city in Alabama or you even
take somebody from New York and try to
take them and transmit them into San
Francisco these are incredibly different
cultures what is this unifying like what
are some traits of this unifying
American culture that as someone who
oversees let me tell you there are
cultural differences between East Coast
and West Coast absolutely people you
know cold and I guess always in a rush
in New York more laid-back and friendly
in LA that those differences pale in
comparison to the differences we see
when
talking about you know like say Saudi
Arabian culture just basic things like
our respecting someone's right to
freedom of religion so like respect
women's rights respecting the rights of
so would you say women's rights it's
really it's interesting you say that
because if you look at somebody like la
like if you take somebody from LA and
you take their view on women's rights
you would find a lot more similarities
between like a conservative like Lauren
southern or her view on women's rights
comparable to like a Muslim than you
would to somebody in LA right the idea
that women need to cover up that they
shouldn't show too much skin yeah sure
so like when you get conservatives of
David Lauren Lauren is not closer to
someone who is an Islamic fundamental oh
yeah absolutely in terms of like in
terms of what should women wear to be
presentable in public this is very much
a fundamentalist religious idea that
women need to cover up in order to in
order to be presentable let me clarify
the difference is the choice to do so
and that it is not enforced by being
stoned into the freakin ground by your
Sharia police I think it should be a
choice I always have been more
libertarian on the values of yes women
should be traditional yes I believe you
should not be running around like my
release iris with a dildo strapped to
you with your tits out I think that's
ridiculous I don't think it's productive
or to a good society or anything that
has produced a good society with the
nuclear family however I don't believe
you should be stoned for not doing so
and I think that is the fundamental
difference between Islamic cultures do
you believe in this culture of
submission that's not Islamic culture
that's Western but that's not a slur on
that culture you keep saying Islamic
culture that's the culture of some very
particular Islamic societies we don't
stone people I'm sorry can you tell me
when Muslims in America have stoned a
woman for not wearing a hijab can you
give me that story extremely well
integrated population yeah like where is
this happening look at that City
Michigan you could look at in
Minneapolis where they have Somalis have
taken over or you haven't taken over I'm
sorry where we actually I remember when
a bunch of Minneapolis that's Somali
paradise how can I forget about me well
I'm
time I remember somebody the first to go
the only time the only thing the only
time I remember like sovereignty in the
United States being threatened was when
a bunch of rednecks and um what state
was it where they all tried to take over
the federal land because they were mad
that the government was trying to market
office at the park yeah that's the last
session oh the legal secession name okay
that's beside the point the South
seceding from the Union is a far cry
from a cultural and demographic
subversion and invasion by the third
world I don't think anybody would would
argue that a change of regime in
government is comparable to the
fundamental transformation
demographically of a nation and its
people I don't think anyone in their
right mind would argue that yeah but not
everybody is I guess obsessed with this
demographic change and for something
that seems so important to somebody that
calls himself their traditionalist this
wasn't written into the Constitution at
all that we were supposed to be so it
was absolutely but it actually isn't in
the preamble and but unfortunately on
the Federalist Papers when he talks
about our posterity one he never
mentions race a single time and to that
same guy that you cite that mentioned
posterity said that if he had the
opportunity to he would have banned
Catholics from ever entering the United
States which yourself I mean I have I
have my own close as well but your pick
you're quoting you're quoting a guy
you're quoting a guy that we so do you
think D leave a path legit do you think
Catholics should be banned from the
United States as well then because he
was quoted as saying the same thing the
definition can expand but it must expand
reasonably okay if you want to
reasonably expand no no did Somali
Muslims if you want to expand the
definition you can't you white America
in the 1700s was anglo-saxon not white
European Christian the idea that Germans
and Italians and Spaniards were all seen
as the same as British people is
ridiculous destiny who discovered the
new world who discovered the new world
in 1492 who is the
continent named after who
circumnavigated the glorious was
catholic italians and you know again
reasonable expansion you know if we
could go back to the 1924 National
Origins quota sits very laid out you
know we would like if it were possible
in this day and age to have that
Protestant anglo-saxon majority again I
think it'd be worth pursuing but the
fact that matter is demographically it's
just not tenable so we reasonably expand
the definition to Christian Europeans
and that's fine and everybody
understands what that means well guys
there's gonna be two minutes destiny I
will give you an opportunity to respond
but I do want to quickly calm things
down this didn't take long to ignite
it's lots of fun but I do want to
quickly bring in Theron and no [ __ ]
but first Theron you are coming from a
more centrist for you so watching Nick
and Steven argue over this what do you
make of it well let's talk about
immigration I I'm not quite as I don't
think that immigration a more just
society is necessarily a society in
which there is more immigration I
actually think that a just society would
be a society where immigration but it
benefits the people in the nation rather
than the people outside organizing
people immigrating I think they're the
ones who should benefit secondarily but
I do think the whole conversation on
mass immigration is interesting because
I don't hear people taking much concern
with the they take a lot of concern of
the cultural differences between Muslims
or people from Africa and Europeans or
Americans but they don't talk much about
the differences and the problems with
the differences between Western culture
and say Asian countries because I I am
engaged to a Korean man and the only
reason I mean I can be engaged to him is
because he doesn't he doesn't connect or
identify with Korean culture at all and
I think if he did we wouldn't be able to
be together for reasons that it's
extremely collectivist and conformist
it's it's very antithetical to many
Western values
such as individualism for example that
further and say we need to cut out all
the Asians no no I'm saying I'm saying
that not talking about about Asian the
very real problems in Asian culture and
how it differs from Western culture and
how important a lot of Asian people can
change Western culture in a bad way and
rather focusing on all the brown people
could come off as a dog whistle towards
leftist that you're all just a bunch of
rice it is a dog whistle to everyone
you're all basis because you're all
racists because you'd rather focus on
the brown people nonetheless brown
people I'm just saying you're racist but
I'm telling you what it comes off that
sometimes okay let's let's discuss that
for just one minute here because I think
that's an interesting point so I would
say the same thing to leftists who focus
on only white privilege and never
mention Asian privilege right there
seems to be this great ignoring of the
Asian question per se the reality is
though that Asians do typically don't
commit any crime how often do you see
Asian man shot in the streets for
attacking cops or whatever never happens
they typically contribute to the economy
I do think there is a cultural aspect to
it where they say they don't really
integrate either for involved we have we
have we have Chinese enclaves and
they're completely tight-knit in their
own communities they don't integrate
everyone talking so much about
integration why do you care about brown
integration so much and you don't even
care about you don't even talk about
Koreans I'm just saying my last two
videos I did exactly on this topic Asian
integration though so I I would disagree
with you I understand your a point that
people are focusing too much on maybe
one specific thing Islam because a lot
of terrorism is coming from there right
now which is giving a lot of media focus
but I disagree that people don't also
talk about the problem with no
integration from Asian immigrants
immigrants in the United States there
are many Muslim immigrants in the United
States who are extremely well integrated
and you know when you mentions it
because you're focused on people who
have been in Europe for three weeks
there's not really that many Muslim in
America it's like a 1% very small amount
of Muslims as 1% of people is 3 million
people in the United States I think the
other issue here is we're talking about
kind of an optics problem people
unfortunately have a lot to do with what
they see and so this issue it's kind of
coupled with the stuff we're talking
about before since a lot of Muslims most
Muslims are brown and we're talking
about the race problem it comes off as
racist but I think I don't think it's
because they're brown I think it's
because of the belief system and the
differences between the other reformed
religions that we've mentioned before
Christianity and Judaism have both been
reformed over time and we've got we've
got a more progressive future
future-proofing there but we get when
you talk about Muslims this is an
ancient antiquated system that just
doesn't doesn't work in America does it
clash us too much because like things we
mentioned before I agree with a lot of
things that nick said earlier I'm
probably not as religious myself I'm
virtually an atheist but I do still hold
Wow my dude what's up hey are you done
pretty good how you doing all right all
right we're live are you ready to chat
my dude why not wait oh did you say why
not yeah why not sure okay well I guess
here's like my general question why do
you feel like you have to tie yourself
to people that aren't even alive anymore
to be like proud of yourself or to feel
like some level of success I'm really
curious I've never understood this
feeling about personal success I think
that's I get this a lot online it's not
about personal success or failure I get
this a lot from people who say that your
personal failures by aligning yourself
to your race or whatever this isn't even
really as much about race even for me I
mean it's about I don't mind favorable
white ethno state in general or any of
those types of considerations I mean
your name is literally mostly nightmare
and you reference the Warsaw Uprising
are we gonna pretend now that nothing
that you said in any of this
conversation was about race are we we're
gonna talk about race okay yes okay well
I mean I'm shy I'm just under the
impression it sounded like you were like
heavily invested in the race thing but
it I mean we can it's definitely a topic
that comes up a lot with me and I'm
definitely very I guess interested in it
certainly yes okay I mean you won't you
specifically called this out when I
referenced white culture yeah you
understand the difference between white
why there isn't really like white
culture black culture but there is black
culture whatever it's like the blacks we
took the blacks from Africa I get it and
they don't really they can't trace their
lineage back I get that I get that
Americans can trace their lineage back
to Europe but that doesn't mean that
whites don't also have a culture black
culture is kind of a reaction to white
culture in fact okay don't necessarily
agree with that but um I mean this is
like the general this is like the
general reason why there is like a unity
of black people in the United States but
for white people it just it works a
little bit differently because we are
Germans and Russians and British English
people whatever we can trace it back
a little differently I didn't seem like
you understood that distinction on
Twitter but I guess you do now do I do
okay a - and that's also in my opinion
nonsensical because we're not most
American whites are not one specific
Irish or German or whatever I mean
personally I'm a mix of many different
European ethnicities as many people are
that's why white American is different
for instance from Polish polish culture
is different so white American why do
you feel so strongly that this is like
such an important part of who you are
this like white culture thing why is it
so important to you it's not about who I
mean I am white certainly and I am a
part of white culture but they're things
I enjoy from black culture I love the
NBA for instance I love sports in
general there are many sports that are
dominated by blacks and by Hispanics for
instance like the Houston Astros are
just won the World Series they were a
team of mostly Hispanics and that mostly
Dominicans and okay right like okay so
like your running back on like
everything you said now because you
literally were saying like the founding
fathers recognized immigration was to be
the for the benefit of the native
culture and stuff like they did okay so
why is like the whole white ice and
everything why is this so important to
you is why what I'm asking I guess I'm
free when it was at its highest power
which essentially to me would probably
be in the 1950s would be post-war I mean
obviously there are reasons for why that
was but if this is an argument that I
get from Jerry Taylor also know as well
is that when you look at American the
world in general whites when they were
the vast majority of the country 90%
which is what this was before 1960 the
entire United States was 90% white in
general a point we were the leaders of
the world now we're diminishing more and
more each year whereas the Chinese for
instance are raising and the Chinese are
90% conscious and that Chinese are
engaging things like eugenics for
instance which we would never do in this
country and they're doing it on an
industrial scale they're do you think we
should engage in eugenics I think it's
something we should certainly have are
you Pro socialism
that doesn't necessarily I mean
obviously a socialist structure would be
more have a lot more ability to
implement a eugenics system because they
would have a central top-down economic
structure essential top-down political
structure it just seems it seems very
weird to me that you would say America
was at its height in the 50s and then
you like you're citing America's
likability like really the capitalism
that drove us our individual outlook on
the world individual freedoms that
Americans enjoy and now you're like well
in order to get back to that level of
freedom we had we need to literally turn
into eugenics advocating China I'm not
saying that all I'm saying the change
China recognizes racial differences we
don't I mean we kind of have this this I
mean we do I think there are many people
who do obviously and it depends on which
you know what study you're taking part
in they're biologists a lot of usually
Excel you the differences between
different races and there are so why
does any of this matter and because
we're having a discussion I mean like
you you've invited me here to talk about
white culture right so I'm answering
questions from you yet
oh yeah sure and I'm asking you like why
does it matter even if there are racial
differences why can't we have different
types of Superman country mission comes
from white pursuits ninety to
ninety-five percent in general okay
because we have like successful
immigrant founded businesses in the
United States like we have people that
have immigrated from other parts of the
world that still contribute here because
it's the United States of America
because there's a ton of economic
opportunity here opportunity because the
white culture here was superior there's
nothing with the white culture here it
has to do with the opportunity nobody
comes here people don't migrate here
from our immigrating from Nigeria
because they want to be part of the
white culture because they want the
Economic Opportunity here full culture
wait outside your might cut out what did
you say culture okay I don't know I I
what do you what do you do that's not it
kind of is though I'm trying to
understand like I'm trying to set your
head cuz I don't understand like you
think that people like across the ocean
like try to find like the like okay I
have my degree I'm a very successful
business person I'm ready to go and
invest like I'm gonna go see who has the
best culture like
just like a really strange oh okay
that's ridiculous they're going to
choose the opportunity yeah economic
opportunity studies yeah what does that
have to do with white culture or culture
the best culture for me because white
cultures create those economic just like
Asian cultures do I mean like poor just
say the agent cultures we're at like
what 60% white people in America it
still seems like we've got a lot of the
like the largest companies here there's
no people that immigrate here like what
it's not and we there are a number of
reasons why people immigrate here the
biggest part is the fact that being poor
here is better than being rich in their
countries for the most part I mean the
the vast majority of the rest of the
world is still impoverished so I mean
the fact that well okay so firstly I'm
not I mean look at America maybe I think
it's probably okay to be poor in most of
the Western world in fact you're
probably better off being poor and a lot
of wars
I say socialized countries when in
countries have better welfare structures
you're better off being poor in Germany
I know that's for sure you're better off
being poor in any Nordic country wider
countries in the u.s. okay but them
being white is an intrinsic to them
being successful it's not like if there
were you know 20% black people there all
of a sudden the social structures
disappear that provide like socialized
medicine or the things that provide like
education it's exactly what happened in
South Africa I mean they'd been the
whites were at majority in that country
for a very long time and up until about
the early 1900's in fact so so you're
saying that at certain point of the
United States somehow we're just gonna
reach the tipping point they're gonna be
too many black people here and then all
of a sudden everything is gonna go to
[ __ ] maybe - not to me non-white people
here but Chinese people are okay so what
kind of brown people are we talking
about the topic of immigration when
you're talking about that I mean maybe
issues politics right I mean it's not
it's for me it is all right now I'm not
you're a liberal right or you would
describe your describe yourself is
leaning more towards the left or
democratically right sure okay so you
are you aware that seven out of ten
Hispanic families in the United States
are life long Democrats mean for both
among voting families sure I Spanx I
come here the more left this country's
goes them it
okay right so I like conservativism I
like small government I like low taxes I
like you know the Second Amendment I
like a lot of conservative ideals not
all of them you know how you're not a
big fan of the Constitution
why because the Constitution allows you
the right to vote as long as you're
naturalized citizen and it sounds like
you disagree with the naturalization
process the people that immigrated here
that are Hispanic are as much of an
American as you are why don't you like
the fact that they can vote are you
against the Constitution just it's not a
lot it's a really basic thing so if you
come to the United States and you're
naturalized as a citizen you're endowed
the right to vote right this is what
we've decided this is what was written
in the Constitution do you disagree with
that notion yes why we should have been
choosing like we did for the first 200
years of this country who comes here and
takes part in American culture we did
choose and then we made a different
decision because it's granted to
Congress the power to the heart do you
know what that decision was yeah I sure
do yeah it was the 1965 Immigration Act
also referred to as the heart cellar act
70% of Americans based on multiple polls
at the time were in favor of changing up
the way that we did immigration and it
also had bipartisan support in Congress
so yeah ever everybody in America was
for this change yes it did from the men
okay they were thinking about you can
read me all the quotes you want my dude
even dixiecrats voted for that bill I
mean you're not gonna fight there is no
grand conspiracy of the majority of
Americans and bipartisan support in
Congress got it passed dog there was no
grand conspiracy here who was who lied
how would they lied how would they like
yep okay out of deference to the critics
I want to comment on what the bill will
not do first our cities will not be
flooded with million immigrants annually
we taken about three million immigrants
in this country per year right so that's
that's wrong right there first and
foremost okay
secondly under the proposed bill the
present level of immigration remain
substantially the same ok that's
obviously ridiculous immigration has
jumped so much in the past 50 years it's
completely out of a historical pattern
that we none of these courts are back
your initial claim up so far but go
ahead important part Edward Kennedy
Democrat from Massachusetts said this
secondly the ethnic mix of this country
will not be upset ok obviously is that
yes these are men who literally said oh
wait wait hold on your initial claim was
that they lied about it do you have a
quote in here showing me somewhere that
he knew what the impact was going to be
of that immigration bill or are you
totally pulling that at your ass this
was one of the crafters of the bill and
yes saying it will not mix the it will
not change the ethnic mix of the can you
prove time that he thought it would I'll
complete the quote contrary to the
charges in some quarters s500 the bill's
name will not inundate America with
immigrants from any one country or area
or the most populated and economically
deprived nations of Africa and Asia well
actually it obviously has because the
majority of our immigrants are Hispanic
can you prove that they knew that at the
time because your initial claim was that
they lied when they saw what was coming
out about the bill to the American
public they were saying this was a
stopgap to basically correct historical
racial ills this is this they did they
claimed at the very least that this
would not change the ethnic mix of this
country and that they knew that it was
going to cuz you said they lied about it
how do you know they weren't just
mistaken okay oh if you don't think they
did then they didn't then what are we
arguing about
yeah the 1965 immigration bill passed
nobody thought that I would have the
impact it did it obviously a much
different impact than a lot of people
thought it would why are we talking
about it because that was the point
where our immigration policy got so out
of whack that is going to change this
country forever sure it ain't you
changed you know they're the Carnation
people what at the time does not mean
it's not adding the effect that it is I
never claimed about I never said
anything about the effects of it you're
the one that initially played perfectly
except the lack because the people
supported it back then in 1972 or any
excuse me 1964 I mean that's kind of how
our system works yeah it's a democratic
republic the people supported it they
like
here but I hear this a lot - what about
slavery we thought slavery was
acceptable at one point yeah what is it
then we changed them - I mean what about
it now I changed and I think and many
many people have changed their view of
this bill okay we'll try I guess your
goal - to elect a person to change the
Immigration Act then I guess we did why
he hasn't done it yet I'm sorry dude
you're a bad surprise of youth a trump
is getting any comprehensive immigration
reform through through Congress but I
mean good luck my did just basically
stole Pat Buchanan's entire election
platform and that's how he won and as he
basically took patty cannon set 20 years
beforehand any motton I mean mimicked
him essentially in Steve an annuity bans
when poor castrated that entire campaign
so I mean I don't love Trump but at
least somebody was talking about
immigration that's why Trump won that's
exactly the reason Trump won okay all
right so so we've dropped the original
claim that they lied to pass that act
right that was just a big name right is
that lays how did Jared Taylor thing as
he say that a lot because I've heard
that claim from other people but you
have absolutely no proof of that you
just believe that based on your own gut
feeling your statements at the time but
you can't prove that they were making
those statements of the time maliciously
there's no evidence of standing or fill
apart whose name is on the bill right
the notion was created that somehow or
another 190 million people which was the
population in 1965 are going to be
swallowed up none of us would want that
this bill does not seek to do it and
this bill could not do it okay you have
any proof that he misled people
intentionally on that well part a liar
I'm saying that he didn't know what the
bill was going to do and the bill is
that disaster responsible oh okay we can
argue that we didn't know what the boat
was going to do I'm okay with that yeah
for sure
nobody at the time knew how dramatically
it would impact the American
demographics but they didn't
intentionally lied to the American
public and nobody was mislead and nobody
was malicious about the passing of the
legislation in 1960 wait how was it a
lot wait okay let's say that I let's say
that I tell my friends I'm gonna drive
us to the bar and I'm not gonna get in
an accident and then I drive and then
some guy t-bones me or something or it's
something [ __ ] something I do does
that mean I lied
it's really weird you still lied
wait so you would consider that a lie or
like let's say let's say that I tell
like I tell like a kid or something I go
I'll go pick you up from school at 4:00
p.m. and then I get into a cry or like
my car breaks down or something right
now I'm not able to get there would you
said oh you lied when you said you were
coming at 4:00 p.m. is that a lie you
implied there was some malice in your
tone of voice I mean it's not a
malicious lie I mean it's a lie that
that in retrospect you were incorrect
about do you not agree that the term
like carries with it mal-intent do I
think if you make a claim that later
turns out to not be true then you were
incorrect which means that your claim
was fallacious it was a lie so incorrect
and liar the same I'm just gonna get the
words correct so to you being incorrect
and lying are the same thing you you
recognized that nobody else like really
uses it that way right like if you would
have hand in a math assignment and you
were wrong on like questions 4 5 & 6
your teacher wouldn't say why did you
lie on 4 5 & 6 or something weird like
that writer yeah no I mean it's it's
looking back on it at the statements
they were clearly incorrect okay I'm not
trying to assign malice so you're lying
something right now hold on are you
lying to me and I don't appreciate it
okay you were trying to assign malice
that was the point of your quote mining
that you just did okay because you don't
fully understand how the 1965 Act you
were trying to say that there was some
verse what no you don't you really don't
do you know why do you know why do you
know why it was changed that first
provision to make it so that one of the
most important reasons was so that
families of people could could immigrate
here and how that ended up being like
one of the worst parts of it in terms of
changing the demographic composition
that particular thing that was put in
the reason why that provision was
changed was actually to apply or was
actually to bring over the more races to
people like you because the idea was the
only way that they could get part of the
the racist Democrats the Dixiecrats part
of the reasons why they could get them
on board is because they made it so one
of the most important thing was to bring
over family members because most of the
people in America were white at that
point in time they thought that if they
changed it so that mainly family members
were given preferential treatment more
white people would come over but that
first provision the
put in ended up being one of the big
reasons why so many other types of
people came over because people would
emigrate and then bring their families
all right so this is a gentleman from
Twitter who wanted to take up the mighty
incest debate position all right so what
so how did this even start I'm not sure
I get like there's a million people that
I'll fight on my mentions now so I lose
track are you guys sometimes what's what
happen well I I noticed one of the
things one of the people I follow had
retweeted still gray and I noticed your
photo you know a screencap of what yet
said I was like huh okay what was I read
come here I'll actually just pull it up
so I can quote it properly cuz I don't
know my memory is not the best I don't
want to misquote you
where are we okay so you say yeah you
can pull up a VOD aware I say I think
incest is good rather than merely taking
sorry talking about it as a concept oh
sure and the second part where it was or
rather do you want me to hop on and talk
about incest I'm a hundred percent sure
you wouldn't be able to mount an
argument again yeah talking to the still
great guy I don't know because I
consider that guy to be one of the
dumbest [ __ ] idiots I've ever seen on
Twitter so yeah I stand by that
statement still yeah that's fine
whether that's him personally would not
be able to do it that that but I saw
that and I was like you know what I I
will take the man on his challenge okay
where and honestly i I don't talk to
still gray I don't know him personally
or just off the cuff from Twitter so I I
don't really give a [ __ ] about him okay
cool well good luck you're stepping up
to the challenge
no one who's been able to do this
successful he had so who so just so I
cuz I don't want to misrepresent you
straw menu or anything I want you to
just you yourself say what your position
is sure so for me personally at this
point I'm pretty ambiguous on it I guess
I don't spend too much time dwelling on
it but for the sake of the argument I
guess the position is that incest should
be seen as a morally neutral thing that
there you cannot assign like a moral
evil or a moral wrong to in the act of
incest itself okay and that's usually
people will come in guns blazing trying
to do that and then you know that's
that's the default position okay well I
might as well open up so I I'm
personally atheists and obviously that
that feel there you can attribute that
well as an atheist I would feel that
morality is ambiguous and it flows
between culture to culture but there is
biologically innately certain things
that are implemented into our social
can construct because yeah there's a
social construct as in what society
tells you is okay but there is you you
know you don't have to be told that
certain things are wrong to an 8 li know
that there is something wrong about it
there's that gut feeling that you get
from it like murder it's a lot there's
not you you could even tell a serial
killer knows murder is wrong cuz they
hide it they know there's something
abstractly wrong about it whether they
follow those social cues is different
between person and person some people
can within their own person morally
object or agree with a position such as
murder so like let's say we're talking
about
I understand what you're kind of taking
it intuitive position right yeah yeah so
this is kind of um I don't mean to be
like the walking [ __ ] encyclopedia
right but this is something that's
called the naturalistic fallacy so the
idea is that because it is somehow
intrinsic to our nature that makes it a
moral imperative the problem with this
line of thinking is that it doesn't
really hold true for almost anything for
instance let's say that you've got a 7
year old and he wants to steal something
from another kid that's something that
you could feel very naturally I really
want this thing I want to take it from
somebody just because he has that
impulse though doesn't mean that we say
well that impulse is morally good
because he has the impulse or say you
see an attractive woman walking down the
street and you're in a relationship you
walk up to her and you start hitting on
her because you really want to you know
have sex with her well just because you
naturally feel that impulse doesn't make
it morally correct and then also yeah
like you can find like a million
examples I just I don't think that the
it's something that you intuitively feel
I don't think that's a good guidance for
like a moral system we tend to not
construct moral systems on people's
personal intuition things like slavery
or racism can be justified that way too
well when I'm around black people I just
feel uncomfortable or like I feel I
don't like people that look different
than me like it just like you could
justify all sorts of stuff that way as
well so I don't think that's a good line
of reasoning to go down well here let me
rephrase it so that there's
Understanding between me and you like I
said I openly said that moralistically
people have different
views on different positions as to just
to point out one of the positions you
held on there was someone being
attracted somebody and hitting on that
person yeah there's nothing morally
wrong and or right about that well but
we would argue in society that there is
something morally wrong about that that
you're betraying the trust of a partner
some people would view that and that's
why I'm saying that what I'm trying to
say here is as an atheist some people
would argue that there is a naturalistic
point of view and so I'm just trying to
break that barrier down so nobody views
me oh well you're an atheist so you have
to believe in this you know oh sure I'm
just saying that I don't think you can
ever consistently derive morals from a
naturalistic point of view because you
just run it way too many yes that that's
true
and so that's why I wanted to get that
out of the way okay so my moralistic
view on life if we're gonna be
philosophical about this is that there
is certain things that people agreed on
whether it was the majority or not and
when you look at some religious views it
was the majority those things were fine
and those values carried on to Western
society so that was Christianity mmm-hmm
Christianity has well I don't practice
it is a great religion for picking and
choosing what it wants to teach over and
Christianity as the way I've looked at
it is the religion for people that want
to have a strong family where they want
a quote unquote father figure quote
unquote
mother and you have the children that
fall under line there so where my mark
argument comes from is the family
structure so not even biologically
because I mean there's but biologically
cases for where incest and there's laws
in place that say
incest is bad just to cover on those but
that won't be the main part of my
argument is in regards to incest most of
the laws there and the way that they're
worded is to protect people that are
otherwise underage or in a structure of
less power than the person that is
predating on them so usually the father
and then the daughter or a older sibling
on a younger sibling let's do these one
at a time you can see we brought up a
lot of things so firstly in the
beginning you talked about how
Christianity has done things a certain
way we've done things a certain way for
a long time right so again like I'm not
trying to machine-gun these out but this
is like an appeal tradition right the
reason why we don't like appeals to
tradition is because you can justify bad
things in the past as being morally okay
in the in the future so for instance at
one point in time slavery used to be
legal at one point in time women weren't
allowed to vote we don't make the
argument today that women shouldn't be
allowed to vote because at one point in
time they weren't allowed to vote or we
should be allowed to hold slaves because
at one point in time we were allowed to
hold slaves these things are not
legitimate appeals to what morality
should be so we kind of have to discard
what happened in the past is guiding
morality for the future we don't we
don't typically run things like that do
you agree with that or do you disagree
that no I don't okay so the second part
you spoke about like family structures
so this is stuff that I don't disagree
with but I don't think it's really
related to the core idea of incest so
there are several examples one you could
have two siblings that are infertile or
one is infertile would they be allowed
to engage in sexual activity within
another under this kite type of system
because they're not going to produce
offspring - you could have siblings that
use contraception so they have no chance
of ever producing offspring three you
could have them engaging in forms of
sexual activity that don't result in
offspring like oral sex or whatever or
anal sex so you don't think about it for
it could be homosexual ancestral
relationships you wouldn't have to worry
about any offspring there the attack
that you're making right now against
like a dysfunctional family is a quasi
valid it's an issue but the problem is
you can mount the same attack against
heterosexual people as well for instance
like should heterosexual people be
allowed to have sex since there are so
many single mothers right that destroys
the family structure as well this isn't
something that is unique to incest well
just because it isn't unique to for
so let's just jump back when talking
about the family structure would you not
agree that the family structure is I
won't even say destroyed but there is a
rift in the family structure if you
would find out that your siblings were
having intercourse would you agree with
that yeah but with that isn't a good
moral this isn't a good moral writing
for instance in a family in the south
would there be a rift created in the
family I say in the south that's kind of
races but whether it be a rift created
in the family if a father found out that
his daughter was dating somebody of a
different religion or somebody that was
a different skin color like yeah this
could create a rift but that doesn't
mean that that action was morally wrong
she's right maybe the father is just
racist or bigoted against people with
other types of religion well again
because more because you're arguing that
because your position requires that
morality is set in stone because it can
be morally wrong it can be morally right
you're asking me to argue whether or not
incest can be morally wrong well what
I'm basically asking is and you say
something that's not good yeah so what
I'm trying to say here is the family
structure not even biologically cuz yes
like because I understand that there is
incestuous things that have been in a
homosexual or maybe the person the
heterosexual group someone's sterile so
that biological argument necessarily
doesn't work there but the family
structure so one of the big things that
was argued against homosexuality was a
period not even incestuous was that it
destroyed the structure the nuclear
family now the problem with that
argument is that you still had two
parents or at least parents one that
could provide and one that was able to
be a caretaker if you tried to put
someone in a position where they have to
do both it it's a jack-of-all-trades
trade-off that you do there where
they're not gonna be able to do one job
great they're gonna be able to do each
one subpar or good at best they're not
going to be as good as people working
together so this is you I don't even
have to argue monogamy on this position
because the position is that the family
that is able to trade off so children
back then where you mostly had children
because you needed people to work on the
farm that was the only way to survive
that's not a big imperative anymore
the more the imperative is is passing on
either your moral traits or just your
genetic traits you know as a whole
depending on how you look have a look on
life so when I argue a structural change
I'm talking about like the nuclear
family unable to support itself because
now you have the roles of what was a
child now acting as a parent to what
would otherwise so now the child is who
would be their grandparents is now their
parents and it it causes this confusion
that would be put on the child because
everyone from the outside in is going to
have the stable relationship with their
parents and their grandparents but this
child now does not if they can have a
child does not have the structure yes
structure it's not necessarily an
argument against ancestor relationship
is just an arguments against ancestral
procreation that's probably a bad thing
that's a note because all right like I
asked you if you found out both your
siblings with that not destroy the
nuclear family in a culture in a culture
where incest is normalized no it
wouldn't it wouldn't be a big deal at
all the thing the reason well how would
it be normalized and that well how would
yeah I mean how would interracial
relationships be normalized I don't know
at one point in time if you were in an
interracial relationship that could
destroy your family but the fact that
your family responds poorly to something
doesn't make it a moral imperative to
act that way that's not where we derive
our morals or ethics from basically what
I'm asking
for you to do or what you would have to
do to make this argument and it's much
more difficult than it seems what you
have to do is you have to construct a
system of morals or ethics axiomatically
from the foundation that would get you
to saying incest is morally wrong but
not because of some ancillary reason
that applies to other things so for
instance we say well incest is wrong
because there's a chance that you could
have a baby that's genetically deformed
well that doesn't really work because
that's an argument of eugenics right we
don't tell normal people like
heterosexual normal people that they're
not allowed to have children because
their children might have autism or
something right if there's some genetic
defect they can pass on right you have
to find something that makes incest on
its own like intrinsically a moral wrong
and and the only way that it seems like
people can do it is to kind of take
these really roundabout routes that
don't specifically apply to incest so
for instance you're giving you this
example what if it causes a rift in the
family but but we both agree that there
are plenty of things that can cause
rifts in the family that don't make them
moral wrongs I mean [ __ ] like you could
have a kid decide to go to art school
and it causes a huge rift in the family
but that doesn't make the decision to go
to art school morally wrong to do so
right okay well I understand your
position there right just to get like an
example of like I'm world wrong right so
I would say rape is something that is
morally wrong and I know in my my
argument for that wouldn't be well it
makes the family feel bad or there's a
rift or it can create a baby bub or
whatever any of that should my argument
would be rape is morally wrong because
from an axiomatic point of view I
believe that people are entitled to
their own bodily autonomy they have
their own personal freedoms an
infringement on another person's
personal freedom should be one of the
greatest crimes you can commit so things
like stealing murder or rape and raping
somebody is doing something to
somebody's body against their consent
and that would make it morally wrong and
under my point of view and that that is
specific and core to the idea of rape it
doesn't bring in any kind of ancillary
or roundabout you know things that
impact it right okay so in the in that
case how would you argue pedophilia then
so pedophilia is something that is
probably wrong in society or that I see
is wrong I guess it depends on the ages
in particular so if we talk about the
strict definition of pedophilia prefer
children like under adult like they do
not meet the
agent consent yeah okay I just want to
speak clearly because like AG sent like
a 20 year old [ __ ] a 17 year old is a
lot different than like a 25 year old
[ __ ] a 7 year old right so I guess
just to be like strict um the reason why
pedophilia is usually seen as wrong and
why I believe that it's wrong is because
children typically do not possess the
mental faculty to truly consent to a
sexual relationship with an older person
and it is almost impossible to be in a
position of equal power so if you're a 7
8 or 9 year old child and an adult is
propositioning you for sex 1 you don't
you can't possibly fully understand the
repercussions of consenting to that
sexual relationships you can't really
provide true consent to do it and to in
almost every single one of those
scenarios the adult is going to hold way
more power than the child will so it
makes it difficult even if we assume the
child did have the ability to consent it
makes it difficult for them to truly
consent because they don't know what the
repercussions are going to be if they
say no right much the same reason we
don't like employee employer
relationships professor-student
relationships and stuff like that
ok and the the reason why I wanted to
argue this is because this is one of
those positions where I want to like
learn about how someone likes to argue
and the position of like just incest in
general the way I look at it is there's
many things that it ends up covering
that as a whole piece of together as
something that we decided is a morally
wrong well so what happens is we're
sorry immoral as I should say so anyway
it's good ok yeah so because of the fact
that when you add in the decay of the
nuclear family which is important for
the proper growth of a child like we see
that kids that have parents instead of
just a parent do exceptionally better
can I have you can I help you with this
argument so no no no I just want to push
on through with what I have to say ok so
ok
push
through what I just said so there's the
nuclear family then there's the argument
of the the issue with genetics there's
the argument of when these cases pop up
it's an issue of it being incestuous and
that it is damaging to what could be a
prospective child and all those three
together make a lawful case for why it's
illegal so okay so starting from the
beginning of these so again the issue
with genetics this is an issue of
eugenics which we typically don't
legally enforce so I think that argument
doesn't work we let we already allow
people in society hold on one second
hello oh my bad
I can give you the rest Amaro okay yep
oh yeah no no problem that's fun okay
Fox sorry so yeah so the problem with
genetics is we don't use that argument
in any other place in society we don't
tell people that they're not allowed to
have children because they have some
sort of genetic defect so the eugenics
that the eugenics argument just doesn't
work here the damaging to a prospective
child you're talking more about
judgments from the family or judgments
from society and these aren't ways that
we usually derive our morals either and
hey steven
hey what's up can you hear me right now
yep i can hear you loud and clear all
right awesome i'm sorry for some reason
my internet's been i don't want it so
i'm at a starbucks right now so if i
need to sneak up just let me know okay
yeah yeah i've been there myself no
problem
all right so um how you doing buddy
doing well uh i i've seen you debate a
lot of uh a lot of uh trump supporters
and
um you kind of make mince meat of these
people a lot of times i don't think
they're really
equipped to have a conversation with you
about politics or economics or whatever
the subject of the day is just browsing
through some of these videos and it was
pretty
pretty
insane to see kind of
wait i think you might cut out just at
the end there hello
uh can you hear me oh i can hear you
right now all right yeah yeah so it's i
i think that uh i'll be particularly
better equipped to you know talk to you
about i mean
i think that a lot of the confusion with
regards to economics is
separating trump's rhetoric from his
actual
economic principles or dogmas or
whatever you'd want to call them uh but
there's there's one group of people that
seem to be particularly good at doing so
and that's people that actually bet on
the market every day uh like i did
and
it's my living to
you know figure out what's real and
what's not and what
what it's going to do and what he's not
going to do
and really the extent to which that has
any impact on what's happening in the
world
uh a lot of people have this idea both
negative that that trump is some kind of
magic force going to the direction of
world markets and
it's really misplaced faith in some
cases and misplaced blame in other cases
um
you know like people predicted this
whole inflation trade as a result of
trump
none of that happened it's not as if
trump is going to change the trend of
global
hold on one second
okay i'm sorry they were grinding
something in the background um you
stopped at reddit it's not like trump is
going to change and then it yeah i mean
it's like people predicted that just
because trump happens to be the guy in
the office of obama that you know
inflation would jump from one percent to
three percent and and
global bond markets would sell off
massively and that's just a ridiculous
concept i mean it you know that trump
decides things that are in the realm of
billions of dollars over atoms
um you know when you think about
something like infrastructure spending
if that's really done big i mean if they
just decide that they're gonna do a
massive infrastructure bill you're
talking about a trillion dollars
and in the grand scheme of the global
markets that's not even that much money
um you know every day on the the new
york stock exchange
seven or eight trillion dollars worth of
apple stock alone trades hands um so so
this idea that
that you know trump is going to have a
profound impact on
on economics globally whether or that
trump is some kind of you know anti-adam
smith mercantilist protectionist kind of
person is just is is completely
misplaced
you know where the protectionist kind of
claims come from right
well there's there's certain there's
certain things that poll well okay and
whether you're a democrat or republican
buy american hire american hashtags
whatever you want to call them slogans
these are things that pull very well and
if you want to be elected president and
do whatever it is you want to do these
are things that you should say so trump
needed to say that he was going to put
like a 20 tariff on mexican products or
that he was going to try to tear up
other countries in an attempt to bring
back manufacturing do you think this
would just pull tested ideas
i think that i think these these are
full tested ideas that that do very well
politically speaking okay i guess
yeah so so with with regards to like how
that how that kind of
plays down to policy um
you know the real question is and you
know what's kind of given rise to trump
is that
you know globalization has won in terms
of the the global war ideas just like
capitalism is one i mean the the only
there's basically one country two
countries maybe that don't participate
in in a globalized economy that would be
cuba now and in north korea
ideology um so
the idea that that protectionism is a
thing first of all is kind of misplaced
um but the the debate is how do you
manage the downsides of globalization
because there there are downsides i mean
too many people have this this concept
that
certain things are all good or all bad
like like you talk to people they say
immigration is all bad or you talk to
others they say immigration is all good
have open borders don't do anything
about inspiration and i mean i'm just
not to cut you straight i'm pretty sure
i'm gonna agree with everything you're
gonna say right there are some people
that are disproportionately impacted by
certain globalist policies a lot of
these disenfranchised people voted for
trump to alleviate their concerns and
went out i don't discourage any of this
for sure
yeah so so but the question is how do
you how do you manage that because there
are ways that you can manage the
downside uh you know in in democrats
case they they had you know these these
rinky-dink programs that that were
supposedly going to turn full motors
into you know solar panel insulation
and magically these people would would
make as much money again
uh we've seen from empirical data that
retraining is very very difficult to do
and maybe even impossible for people you
know like past 30 40 years old you're
not going to retrain a somebody working
in a factory to be like an engineer or a
software dev
yeah and and if you were going to even
think about doing so you would have to
spend 10 times as much money as
anybody's even thinking about spending i
mean these are
this would be an undertaking
the likes of which has has never been
done in the united states um
you know these are things that they do
and kind of command and control
economies like china very regularly uh
where they move into a village and say
you're not a farmer anymore go do this
uh but in the united states it would
just be incredibly tough to do that um
it would have to take place over
multiple generations and
you know spending the money would be uh
would be a perilous
task because you may spend
half a trillion dollars doing that and
it just it just might not work it just
might fail
so i don't necessarily disagree with
this um all of these opinions sound
really reasonable i guess um
the thing that kind of confuses me um
kind of the precursor to our initial uh
this conversation and kind of in terms
of reading your twitter um i'm really
curious what you think trump has done so
far in terms of policy that's actually
impacted the markets because it seems
like i don't know if your twitter
persona is a little different than your
normal persona but it seems like you
have a lot of
confidence that trump has enacted some
policy or done something that have
dramatically moved the markets yeah so
so just in terms of in so there's a
couple of things that i'll that'll
happen there and just be just because
it's in the news i think that it makes
sense to start with the fed chairman
pick um it looks like that's going to be
jerome powell uh guys that i really
respect like chuck gunlock got this
totally wrong and thought that trump
would
would bring in neil kashkari or some of
these other figures that the betting
odds and the market just didn't suggest
were possible picks um and when you talk
about the fed chair a lot of people
don't think about this but the
the fed chair in many ways is sort of
like
a supreme court pick in the way that it
totally transcends
the the power of the presidency it has
almost nothing to do with the day-to-day
operations of the presidency and yet
it's so important because if you get
another 2008 trump's not going to fix
that
congress isn't going to fix it the
stimulus package in 08 was a was
basically a bust it came down to the fed
lowering interest rates to zero and
injecting funny money into the economy
and it worked i mean they put the
economy and the markets on heroin they
drove down interest rates and they
forced people into risk assets when
people are forced into risk assets they
stopped saving they start spending it
works i mean it's it's a pretty
documented
uh agreeable strategy
now hispanic and jerome powell
represents somebody who
is sort of a janet yellen-esque type of
pick in the sense that he's very
dovish generally speaking when it comes
to raising interest rates he's not one
of these
economic militants that thinks you need
to jack up the the base rate to three
percent overnight because
xyz and it's not even worth discussing
what the xyz is um but he's different in
the sense that
he very much seems to be somebody who's
more along the lines of a rules-based uh
monetary policy whether that rather than
janet yellen which is which is much more
kind of just blowing in the wind and you
know this month she might want to raise
rates but maybe not
and and we'll see but she won't do it
unless the market bets on it and so
people will just manipulate the the
libor market to you know
dictate what janet yellen is going to do
i mean her her policy is it's worked
fine i think that she's done a fine job
i don't have any major issues with her
uh but
we need to we need to get things sped up
in terms of raising rates because if you
get another 2008
and rates are at you know 75 basis
points on on the floor rate for the fed
or they're at you know one percent it's
going to be really tough to do anything
about the situation uh and we're going
to be in a situation like europe where
you have negative interest rates which
would be
fundamentally something that i think is
agreeably
sure and i don't disagree with any of
this but um yeah so and then as far as
like trump impacting the the economy
that like i don't think a potential
yeah
the fed chair pick is is one thing um
but in terms of in terms of other
policies that i that i think are
favorable uh to the economy um
in terms of
getting things done um he's made very
clear that you know while well he may
not be you know the the
sort of caricature protectionist that
the media makes him out to be he's he's
very willing to
walk away from deals
um and on the foreign policy stage with
respect to things like the iran deal you
can't really do that right i mean it's
not
the iran deal is not like a new york
real estate deal where if you don't like
it you just you just walk away yeah
weakens the ability for america to make
deals because then everything looks like
we could walk back on it
well and and and the alternatives with
respect to
those types of foreign policy
implications are are very
dire when you talk about war or you know
covert action et cetera et cetera that
these are very serious impacts however
with foreign policy in regards to
economics with with deals like nafta
with deals um like the tpp
these are deals that that
you very much can walk away from uh
these are these are deals where
you can make the argument that
they weaken the united states position
in the world and ability to make deals
this out of the other i actually am not
a big buyer of that perspective because
really uh uh you don't have any choice
but to make deals with the united states
we are such an economic machine uh that
that you don't just get to choose to opt
out of making deals with the united
states and you know no matter who the
president is whether you like him or not
well i don't know if that's necessarily
true because if you look at things like
um wouldn't you say that one of the
things that worries me the most about
trump pulling out of some deals like the
tpp is that we give up a lot of
influence to say china who's trying to
explain a lot of south america and stuff
like that that kind of stuff doesn't
worry again
some some i i i think that that like i
said i think that's an argument that can
be made but i think that it's a lot less
sturdy than people make it out to be you
know that's always that china's making a
real effort right now to exert influence
in the rest of the world economically as
they continue to grow
the argument is if you if you step out
of the world you make yourself harder to
deal with then people will just deal
with china instead of you or
people who made the argument with
respect to the middle east if you pull
out they'll just they'll just deal with
russia instead of you because everybody
needs their own personal superpower in
their corner well but i think that i
think they can be demonstrated the iraqi
leader because we toned down support um
came out and said that the newest one in
there so that he would be willing to
work with russia if they could help and
um china's made significant investments
in african countries in terms of
education and labor and whatnot that we
kind of haven't been doing as much of i
think you can make those arguments
pretty steadily now
i i i agree but i when when you talk
about economic deals like the tpp which
are which are very specific to shipping
and manufacturing and
things that aren't so related to let's
say military boots on the ground which
the middle east very much is kind of a
military boots on the ground kind of
question
um with respect to the economic deals
apple is a fundamentally american thing
if you want iphones you have to deal
with apple period uh if you want
computers you have to deal with
microsoft period
so the united states
has a a demonstrable economic edge
over a place like china which you know
if you want trinkets if you want coal if
you want um
cheap manufacturing go right down to
guangzhou they will hook you up believe
me uh but but the united states does
have a a novelty factor over these
countries and it has a size factor i
mean people forget america's economy is
still about 30 larger than china's uh
the growth rates in china are
precipitously higher and the reason for
that is simple okay china went from
there they're making up for lost time in
china
in 1980 the united states was talking
about flying cars and and beginning to
have computers in their homes and china
was a
basically one giant farming commune so
so they're making up for lost time it's
it's not a matter of a massive
population as well right they have a
massive population they they have they
have a command and control economy in
terms of authoritarianism which brings
with it certain benefits
um and and the other thing i mean the
biggest part about china that gives them
that growth rate which i think cannot be
understated and is is understated all
too often is that in china when you have
a centralized economy
uh alibaba is
is they are the people and if they want
to
get into social networking
all they do is they call up the the
leaders of china and the biggest social
network company becomes a part of
alibaba
overnight
they are very much not opposed to to
trusts in their economy uh everything is
organized from the top down and so you
have these kind of giants where
you don't have facebook competing with
twitter competing with snapchat and and
other companies to gain traffic it's
just all one big machine uh and and in
some senses that's good and in some
senses it's bad because obviously you
don't have competition for labor um
you know you you have kind of a bad
situation for
lower class people in china you have a
middle class which is beginning to crop
up but not in a in a really serious way
uh so so it becomes it becomes
troublesome but
um
back back to what trump's doing i mean
i think that on the on the global stage
people really didn't take obama very
seriously um
a country like north korea really did
not believe that that obama was a
credible threat in terms of using
military force on the peninsula
that's very much different today
and you saw the same thing in economic
deals i mean you know obama would
and then and then obama the worst part
about it too is that he wasn't honest
about his kind of passivity when it came
to dealing on the global stage for
instance the iran deal i mean he came to
the table on the iran deal
um and he told this grandiose story
about how
we strangled iran with economic
sanctions and we made them come to the
table and that's not what happened at
all i mean we didn't make iran come to
the table uh we made clear that we were
prepared to offer certain concessions
and and they came to the table uh
sanctions are real you don't think the
sanctions are a big part of that iran's
economy has been like really those
sanctions did a lot they were like one
of the most ancient countries in the
world i don't i don't i don't think so i
mean talking to the the experts that
i've talked to uh sanctions are are
really bad things in the short term uh
but but countries adapt to sanctions and
they figure it out and and they move on
especially in a place like iran or north
korea i mean in north korea they have
okay this guy said hi you don't know me
but I'm a small YouTube that runs a news
channel when you spoke to Jeff Holliday
I criticized you in the comments section
a few people said I should try and sit
down and talk with you and promotion of
that if you have any interest in a
discussion with someone generally on the
right to discuss policy feel free to
drop me a line at your convenience
that's the guy
all right good luck boys my dude what's
up hey man how's it going
I don't know I'm about to find out what
are we talking about today
outline anything here but oh well that's
I'm streaming so don't say anything like
personal or anything like that at work
okay I was watching for reference
I am dawn of the two Clips channel for
everyone who doesn't know me which is
everyone and I am generally available to
be your self-esteem bump and look dumb
on your channel if you need me to okay
anyway that said you made a lot of
criticisms of basically everyone on the
right while talking to Jeff yeah and
then you don't want to talk about the
right never wants to talk policy it's
always really the right word like
bathrooms the skeptics fear on YouTube
but but yeah sometimes yeah so I mean if
we can go big we can go small honestly I
don't know that many of your political
positions outside of what you talked to
Jeff about and that's been six weeks I
did not rewatch it so there's so gotcha
well what did I say to me I guess are
you like vehemently disagreed with uh
you know I don't even remember the
problem I should re-watch the damn
stream but I don't know if there's a
policy position that is currently
tickling your fancy that you argue with
somebody over I'm available for that if
not there's always the popular ones we
do I don't know guns healthcare whatever
you like well [ __ ] I don't know I I
thought I said I thought there's like a
specific thing I guess if they do you
think Trump's doing a good job in office
so far how about that
oh so you're a little bit on the fence
so I think Trump is done probably one of
the worst jobs at least in my living
lifetime a president so far wait so we
can talk about anything Trump related I
guess I'm just kind of curious sure
again we can start popular things should
we start with the wall the most popular
topic Norrell yeah I guess it seems kind
of like a kind of a dumb idea but so I
think the entire discussion with wall
comes down to are you willing to pay the
quantity of money that's gonna be
required for the wall to have fiscal
symbol of an idea
and if we are then we should build it
and if not we should what is that what
is that symbol of an idea what idea are
we talking about we don't like Mexicans
or whether or not we're willing to
whether or no we're going to harshly
enforce immigration policies why don't
we have a wall between US and Canada you
know again if we want a physical symbol
of the idea we probably should okay I I
guess like fiscally so I'm kind of
left-leaning but I'm kind of libertarian
or maybe not libertarian but I believe
in like fiscal responsibility building a
wall to the north of south of our
country to represent an idea seems like
kind of a bad idea I guess that sounds
like a lot of bureaucratic waste seems
absolutely fiscally ridiculous totally
agreed again the the entire debate is
either and you know reality in my
opinion this comes down to you that
we're fiscally ridiculous with
everything and so the pure and simple
fact that is going to cost a lot of
money is almost never a consideration
for the government engaging large
projects so if we're gonna do it it's
because we like the idea of having a
physical wall that by nature of it being
there says no you cannot just hop this
border or at least implies it to people
who I guess this just sounds like like
one of the dumbest things of I'm sorry I
guess like I mean if you want if I guess
it philosophically if you want to take
the position that all government
spending should be done for memes or
whatever then if we are like if we argue
out if we establish that as our
or axiomatic belief of government
spending that government spending should
be focused around like what the best
Mimas then from there we can start to
argue whether or not establishing a meme
wall would be like a responsible way to
manage our government money but without
first accepting that like I'm sure you
realize that this is a pretty untenable
position right they're like we need to
spend a [ __ ] ton of money not only
building the wall but also maintaining
the wall also pissing off our neighbors
and then having to staff the wall that
we should and then add probably another
government department or some [ __ ] to
manage it unless it falls under the DHS
or I don't know I don't know who like
this is a lot of commitment for a meme
right that's a pretty big commitment
it's not a meme Phil and I mean there
there is a pure and simple fact the
matter that people don't start worse
with us because we have giant fluff
military so by nature of having a giant
flag military it's you know well if we
start a war with America
we gotta contend with that thing and I
don't want to do it why I'm sure the
worst of us because we're separated by
oceans and we're not really there's not
many like huge Wars going on right now
like we had a few military went to ban
attacked us but they still bombed Pearl
Harbor
we had been cutting it since I'm pretty
sure that America's military in World
War two was pretty damn big and our
infrastructure to back it up was massive
as well this is why we were Len leasing
things to the Soviets the British this
is why we had a huge [ __ ] army to it
like we did all of we did most of our
work in the web the Pacific Theater
whatever we like our army it's not like
we nuked every single island that we
walked to giant marine core hop
island-hopping campaign that happened
over there but all of that was spin up
that occurred after the war began is the
same reason that we used Sherman tanks
because we could make them at the drop
of a hat like literally sneezing was
another tank okay but you know part of
like your military that right if you
have the ability to spin up a massive
military in like a year that that's
probably part of your military right
like I don't think it should add all
that already like Japan would've been
like okay well we need to stay away from
Pearl Harbor because now the Americans
can attack us like six months sooner
right they're their generals disagree
with you they they came out and said
America's very weak and that makes us
able to attack them so we should do it
now well they were pretty damn wrong I
guess if they were dumb enough to be
wrong and probably I
I know I guess I have a hard time
imagining that like Iraq declares war on
the United States and start shipping
troops off like over the Atlantic Ocean
to come and attack us that's probably
pretty unlikely however there the
military deterrence of having a large
military is there and now I don't know
that if we pick whatever shrinking in
the military you want but assuming that
we did tomorrow
Russia would invade or something I think
that's pretty ridiculous but there is by
nature of the military being there
okay so let's back off the military
thing because it's not too relevant that
was kind of yeah so going going to
little shooting I guess like well show
that that's my premise right yeah that
it works as a deterrent I guess so like
when I look at illegal immigration it
seems like the number of Mexicans that
have been illegally immigrating here has
decreased I think they're actually on a
decline there's like a net negative of
Mexicans or Hispanics whatever in the
country or whatever since some like what
like 10 years ago is a 2008 or something
when the numbers decrease it seems like
there's a massive industry getting
people here illegally in a plethora of
different ways whether it's illegally by
vehicle whether it's by air whether it's
by ocean there's also a ton of people
that like some like half the people that
are here illegally or overstaying visas
and [ __ ] it just seems like that wall
isn't a great idea I've just never
really been sold on it if the wall could
Lake them be like be demonstrated to
actually significantly reduce illegal
immigration I might be a little bit more
in favor of it at that point although
there would still be some things that I
would like to drive first but I don't
know it just doesn't seem to be that
effective well so with the I mean
clearly again no one is actually talking
about building a wall in the northern
border because we don't have a [ __ ] ton
of Canadians who show up right so
address the problem where it lies as
opposed to just under the idea now that
said though there is a razörfist has a
good unknown of the the Mexican
immigration system
illegal immigration system and when she
talks about that basically the Mexican
government can get as tyrannical is at
once and once they reach a certain point
then we get a large flood of illegal
immigration north and to be fair right
at the moment it's not even them mostly
that are immigrating
the Mexican border it's a lot of South
America who is experiencing all of the
financial problems that could be
experienced by countries in a lot of
places down there so they are making a
trek through Mexico and ending up here
but we blame it on the Mexicans
regardless of whether or not it's
actually that sure but I mean if Mexico
seems like it's been improving markedly
like over the past decade I think that's
what a lot of people attribute though
the declining numbers of illegal
immigrants to I I guess I why not like
try to find ways to help Mexico so they
can get like more control over their
country rather than just throwing up a
giant wall and then pretending that that
problem doesn't exist south of the
border that just seems kind of strange
to me apparently because Mexico's not
our problem so you're trying to sell me
the idea of building a massive [ __ ]
wall to the south of the border that
makes it seem like that that's kind of
our problem then well no so if we do
deterrence base things be it a wall
which I will sort of agree that it is
somewhat mean based but again it does
represent a principle so if we are
saying Mexico unfuck your [ __ ] no you
can't use us as a dumping ground for
people who get tired of the Mexican
government being corrupt Mexico will
honestly probably devolve into a
revolution relatively quickly however
will come out greater on the other side
that seems like quite the extrapolation
I don't think the Mexican government
like intentionally dumps people over
here anything and no a lot of the people
that leave are probably people that they
wouldn't want leaving wouldn't for the
most part would be my guest so though
I'm not entirely sure but in the world
of I have no idea if the Mexican
government sits down and like writes a
list of like well Bob should stay and
Joe should go and I seriously doubt that
they do or that they are actually
physically sending people however it
being is it is a outlet pressure release
valve for those who say this system is
untenable and I don't like it I can just
go to the United States and not fix
Mexico it perpetually leaves Mexico
handicapped in a sense of actually
getting better I guess if if they were
like more Mexicans coming I might
believe that but of all the illegal
immigrants here
is what like isn't it like 5 or 6
million of them are Mexican Mexico's got
a population like 130 million people
well so nobody knows and I say that
knowing that that seems like sort of a
cop-out but there is a reality that to
say I know this many Mexicans are here
means that we know every single illegal
immigrants in the country will know but
we have like we've got like estimates it
seems unlikely well it's like 12 or 13
million illegals are probably in the
United States and I think almost half of
them are from Mexico I think oh you're
talking five or six million people but I
would suggest that no revolution in any
country has taken even a majority it has
only taken hey generally rather small
minority who are in fact vocal who say
okay enough is enough
yeah I guess so I mean like I guess so
maybe I maybe it would be good to go
back and establish more core positions
like I don't deny that what you're
suggesting could be true but it just
seems like so unnecessary and it seems
like such a convoluted way to get things
done like rather than working with one
of our largest trading partners with
somebody whose economy our economy is in
some ways dependent on like it just
seems like it would be so much better
than to [ __ ] them and then pray that a
revolution happens and then pray that
things get resolved quickly and then
pray that somebody more radical or
corrupt doesn't step in and then pray
that this like doesn't dramatically
impact things like the automobile
industry oh it's like that seems like
you're leaving so much more up to chance
and it just seems like an irresponsible
path well so the best counter I have to
that is that no one really and myself
included seems to enjoy when we decide
to go tell another country how to run
itself and we are notoriously not very
good at recreating America and other
countries so why don't we don't need to
recreate Mexico I'm not saying we need
to go over in Middle East them but like
I'm pretty sure they're away I'm pretty
sure that Mexico's government doesn't
like the cartels there I'm pretty sure
there are ways that we could work with
the government I'm not talking about
like a Gaddafi or an Assad like to pose
situation like you don't think there's
any way that we can work in like a
greater capacity with the Mexican
government to help them with the cartel
should this is a maybe just be a
fundamentally different view of how a
Mexican government treats the cartels I
am leaning towards that they are almost
in the sense of banana
like except as opposed to corporations
they work with the cartels because
they're I mean if they really and they
were I mean I guess it depends on but
they were willing to do but if they
really want it to go just effectively
declare martial law and get rid of the
cartels they probably could but they
don't so yeah I guess I'm not too sure
if that's necessarily true um that
sounds really untrue I don't I don't
think why wouldn't they so you're saying
that they actually really like their
country being [ __ ] up and they really
like the cartels being there well so
either the government there is in some
way corrupt which is notoriously true of
Mexico and has been for a long period of
time or they are ineffectual in which
case if they if what they were doing is
going hey United States can we borrow I
don't know the army and help us root out
these cartels we would probably be
willing to help them and that could have
happened any time over the past 50 years
but so much as the requests never
happened I guess I don't know I I guess
I guess when I think of the problem
south of the border like if let me put
it this way if the cartels were Muslims
I think that we would have fixed this
problem by now I think it seems like
we're really eager to get involved in
all sorts of other places around the
world for reasons that were pretty
dishonest with our population and the
rest of the world about but when it
comes to Mexico like just building a
wall with one of our largest trading
partners saying [ __ ] god I hope they
figure their own [ __ ] out like this all
sounds incredibly stupid to me like so
much of our automobile industry
especially rests on our trade with
Mexico they are a massive trading
partner we you know we've got that huge
highway that runs north and south
they're part of NAFTA just throwing up a
massive wall when immigration is already
declining when Mexico is already
improving and then writing it off as a
totally lost cause while we would
continue to pump money into places like
[ __ ] Syria it just seems so stupid to
me now that's a little bit of a straw
man I'm not I'm kind of making the
assumption that you're pros here there
or maybe you're not so you would be
consistent there but it just seems like
we invest so much money around the world
doing [ __ ] I don't know why we wouldn't
look south of our border or why we would
say something like Mexico's not our
problem while you're advocating that we
build a massive wall because there is
some problem down there that just seems
like not
and not a good path forward well so I
don't have a prime differently not an
economic protectionist so by all means
if they want to trade then go ahead it's
one of many things I think Trump does
wrong you say oh yeah that's my American
well you know I mean you apply whatever
the hell you want that said though I am
generally against foreign aid so where
with very very few exceptions everywhere
that we're pumping money has gone not
good through most of all of history so
what do you mean we wrote a ton of
programs in places like Africa where
we've like where we've helped to curb a
lot of diseases and we've helped a lot
of humanitarian related to stuff where
you've seen marked improvement in a lot
of countries that we've been supporting
that's that's easy to say as an
aggregate however when we have done
things like foreign aid where we hand
their governments money it is
notoriously used to increase military
and various problems they're going on
there that are not in any way related to
solve the problems however at the same
time wake an example of like a
government that we've supported or we've
tried to support and then they spend all
the money on military what Gaddafi is
probably the best one but I mean he's
gone now however I mean pick one Niger
we punched a pumps a bunch of money to
in in I think 90s and because we were
trying to deal with what it's still the
pirate situation there and it all just
disappeared no one has any idea what
happened to that money but the
government got bigger and more powerful
so I'm not sure so so your deals like
there was more there yeah I don't know
so so because so because some eight has
failed in some places at some point you
think that we should just withdraw all
types of aid
I don't know this sounds like kind of
protectionist now well so I don't think
our government should be doing it I
think you see absolutely better output
when private basically anything does for
a name there have been you know any
number of that bill gates with malaria's
probably my single favorite example that
that man is pretty well on schedule to
cure malaria almost worldwide if he has
his way within his own lifetime and that
is I mean that is better than anything
we have done anywhere else in and of
itself okay but these things can work in
conjunction just because somebody is
privately giving aid doesn't mean the
government can't do it I'm suggesting
that the output of the government doing
it is not in any way anything that even
but the buns came through do you it the
bunts it is the plants the one and only
how you doing I'm good just chilling I
just probably negative video just not
feeling it nah that's where we record
everything yeah he wasn't feeling it
no no I wasn't feeling oh oh no that's
okay the other guy would never agree
trust me there's no possible way I was
talking about editing a video and I
didn't feel it so I'm just probably a
bit of life information here all this
needless information is totally fine
okay I know I'm actually pitched it to
him yet but I want a picture
no don't he won't hear you can try but
make sure you come a big baby once I
make things happen
oh okay all right um hold on I'm just
case I want to listen to something
together and then you can give me your
opinion about it okay sure can do have
to watch it for the same time yeah we're
gonna do it I'm gonna link it on a
circle it's like two minutes long okay
okay wait what's this website called
like circle tea mugs my circle o my
circle TV this alba tree and oppressive
all right I'm sending you a meme okay
okay I want to give you full context to
everything that's going on right now
okay
you ready okay okay so a long time ago
who from a whole other convoluted
scenario there were chat logs of mine
that ended up getting leaked from a puck
conversation okay in those chat logs I
was talking about how it's crazy some of
these like 15 16 year-old fangirls or
whatever they try to like send you pics
and like get with your like some of
these chicks are like ridiculous so that
was like more or less the conversation
okay that's it happen so yeah sure so in
this conversation that's all I ever say
I never say like I [ __ ] a 15 year old
this chick sent me nudes you know I
tried to get with the fit never said any
[Music]
no yeah so I'm just given this as
provided so like it was literally like
one line from a chat log and the I think
Thorin and like the
he and dude are using it to call me a
pedophile okay now I want to watch this
you have this loaded let's watch this
clip of Milo okay and I want you to tell
me what you think about it are you ready
mm-hmm okay
we're starting in three two one go this
arbitrary and oppressive idea of consent
which totally destroys you know the you
know understanding that many of us have
the complexities and subtleties and
complicated nature of many relationships
you know people are messy and complex
and actually in a homosexual world
particularly some of those relationships
between younger boy is and older men the
sort of coming of age relationships the
relationships in which those older men
have helped those young boys to discover
who they are and give them security and
safety and provide them with love and
and and and a reliable sort of a rock
where they can't sleep some of those
relationships are salvation to me it
sounds like priests molestation to me
I'm grateful for father Michael I
wouldn't give nearly such good head if
it wasn't for him and yet here you are
talking about how look you know some of
these kids that get diddled by these
priests I mean it's a good thing for
them they're you're misunderstanding
what pedophilia means pedophilia is not
a sexual attraction to somebody 13 years
old who is sexually mature pedophilia is
attraction children to children who have
not reached puberty
pedophilia is attraction to people who
don't have functioning sex organs yet
who have not gone through puberty who
are too young to be able to understand
where their body that is not what we're
talking about and you are Steven how old
how old is this um I don't know a couple
of years okay I like what I feel is that
he had to deal with that [ __ ] and he had
to [ __ ] cope with it and now he's
using his [ __ ] experiences and the
weight and manner in which he cope with
it he's projecting and he's saying you
know what this is what I feel pedophilia
is it's not pedophilia I'm not a victim
of pedophilia it's okay I'm totally fine
I'm fine no it's fine I'm so thankful of
her father because he lied me to suck
good head like this is what I'm doing
guys it's okay don't worry about it and
then of course he's completing all these
other issues where
people who feel like they've got touched
and they're like [ __ ] this is pedophilia
because you took advantage of me like
and of course in this situation he's
also been taken advantage of but he's
trying to cope with it and in trying to
cope with it he's [ __ ] being this guy
that's like oh it start that's not
that's not the defined reason of
pedophilia pedophilia is like for kids
or something okay but he's saying all
right which is which is arguable by the
way because of the fact that they like
you can argue that you can argue like
they have sexual feelings like I have
sexual feelings as a 14 year old kid you
know but you understand it like a 13
year old boy having a sex well a 13 year
old boy having a sexual relationship
with someone in their 30s is probably
not good right of course of course not
and that and that has to do with I think
I think well no there's no level of
maturity I don't think we're a 13 year
old cannon or sexual relationship on
equal grounds of the 30-plus year old
right no no of course that's what Milo's
advocating here how can somebody like
Ian defend Milo here as not a no bees no
I don't that's the thing though if you
now if you take this and you you come
you juxtapose it with his PR speech that
he gave he gave a PR speech after right
after he got nailed
yeah exactly Gabriel speech you said
listen like he's like and then he
explained himself he and I won't
remember everything you said in detail
but when I have heard it I was I was
alarmed by the stuff that he was saying
on and on the Joe Rogan podcast cuz he
also repeats this on the tour-roland
podcasts which means that he was pretty
confident about what he had to say which
is really interesting when he was really
confident enough to go ahead and bring
this from one podcast to another podcast
you know and it's just like it for me
like I find that interesting on its own
some you probably felt strongly about it
and he on it and it has a lot to do with
the way in which he wanted to cope with
this and of course like I do and like
everybody else does we all try to
project these like opinions to people
and show them like this work for me this
is how it is for me and it can work for
you too when there's so much more there
between all of us there's all this other
[ __ ] going on okay so like that's why I
get any well you're giving me lots of
reasons to explain why Milo is
advocating for underage boys to have
relationship sexual relationships with
older men no you know I feel like I feel
like you've already
conclusion about him so no because he
literally said younger boys older men
thirteen year old boys and he says
cross-generational relationships are
good in the homosexual community do you
say that a beginning
good let's go up with wonders he didn't
say it in the beginning but he goes on
to say that like a little bit after we
pause it I'm sorry are we um let's go
hold on I gotta go back to the circle
thing one second okay you ready there's
like 30 seconds left here can we can we
be honest about that
wait I'm back fo because he just said it
so I'm back and to be able to is not
what we're talking you are you
advocating for cross-generational
relationships here can we can we be
honest about that I don't mind admitting
that and I think particularly in the gay
world and our outside the Catholic
Church if that's where some of you want
to go with this I think in the gay world
some of the most important enriching and
incredibly you know life-affirming
important shaping relationships very
often between younger boys and older men
can they can be hugely positive
experiences mm-hmm yeah I know I know it
seems I know it seems but once again I
think he's speaking purely from
perspective
he's on perspective and of course that's
what anyone can do okay well do you see
how it might bother me that I get in
well Ian will defend this and say well
this isn't pedophilia but then one line
in a chat log gets me instantly branded
as a pedophile yeah okay okay okay so
destiny I feel like all of this stems
from major personal grudges with
everyone in some form of like community
no no it can you see like how this
button is irritating that they slam the
left so hard when they don't slam their
own sort or isn't it interesting like
how like they're not he's he thinks this
is totally okay but then a chat I like a
little line from a chat log is something
our pedophile it's the same thing as me
in being called a Nazi every time they
get pull up some [ __ ] dumb chat log
from 2002 or he's talking about like
Hitler being his idol which is just so
Eddie dumping okay so firstly Ian
attacked me first tonight which he has
done multiple times in the past because
he was upset when I exposed jontron for
being a pretty racist person so ian has
already been like against me a lot of
people were after that jontron debate
firstly secondly remember what we talked
about before like I feel like just
because the other side does it but I
thought this was supposed to be a
community of people that rose above that
I I didn't know that like well the left
does it or crazy sjw's do it then we
spent all of our time making fun of you
and now we're gonna do it too isn't it a
little bit ridiculous I get it I get I
get because you this I get that you've
established that with me so are you
trying to establish this mentality with
other people and yeah no it was never
personally about you it was I know I
know today exactly so trying to
establish this mentality of the
community yeah like like holding them
did that happens every yeah that it
happens across this entire community you
could be doing it in a much [ __ ]
nicer way bro that's all started off the
conversation you know calling me a
pedophile because people because the
thing is though steven is that you're an
easy guy to [ __ ] hate I'm sorry I
don't want to be this I'm not being a
dick here I'm just saying that you're
easy garden-gate because you come off as
very arrogant you come off as I know
everything and I can I guess okay so
[ __ ] no listen like you guys are
expecting me to act like the Pope like
you're expecting me to act in an
impossibly mature way I mean like do it
after I talked to jontron every single
account both my emails an old one that I
don't even use anymore my PayPal and my
bank we're trying people were trying to
hack my accounts like I was up like that
whole night with my phone [ __ ]
vibrating because of like alerts I had
tens of thousands of mentions from every
single person in this kept espera
tweeting [ __ ] I mean and that
includes the big people like Chris Ray
grand like Thorin
like armored sceptic like Richard Lewis
like all these [ __ ] people tweeting
me and you expect me to like take that
all in a jolly Drive and then when these
random [ __ ] creeps come out of
nowhere and start calling me a pedophile
I'm supposed to engage them and in like
in good conversation like you have any
idea how much you're asking for me
that's really hard to do yeah and and
yeah that's that's that is pretty
intense you described quite a bit there
that is very intense and I do apologize
for being a little bit insensitive I
guess I just come from a very privileged
place well the thing is is that like
yeah I think that you now understand
that there there is an opportunity for
discussion they're not just there to
[ __ ] with people so like the idea is
that like just now you can do it you can
do it sorry but it's hard to get them to
even do it that mouthy Buddha guy for
instance my first interaction with
mouthy Buddha was after I had a
conversation with jontron he made a
little six-minute [ __ ] hit piece
video me that I think he's removed since
then and then when I asked him to talk
about it he ducked out of a convo with
me and he just made like a care a little
five minute character assassination
piece I'm just curious how like cuz you
keep saying I'm really easy to hate
right and I can understand that but like
the reason why I'm easy to hate is
because everybody decided they hated me
after my conversation with jontron where
he said that he wanted at white majority
United States and he said he wanted
Hispanics to integrate into the gene
pool and he said that he thought that
blacks in Africa were like blacks in
America I was the one that came out of
this conversation the bad guy how like
I'm you know I I need to watch that
whole stream I only saw the segments
that were given to me like four five
second clips of Sargon posted with the
communism thing with the Hispanic no no
no the it was the it was like the whole
like riots and Sweden thing oh the
rights of Sweden thing really you were
like no they're not happening
no well that might respond Trent thought
that Europe is literally burning down
and my response was that Europe is not
burning down obviously there are some
problems there but the whole of Europe
the whole of Sweden the whole of the
United Kingdom is not like on fire and
being ravaged by immigration yeah yeah
well he was definitely really
misinformed in that whole [ __ ] debate
sure if you ever have time to watch that
debate and you watch it with like an
open mind
honestly like I mean maybe I come off
like I was a little smug but it's really
hard for a reasonable person to take me
out of there is the bad guy after all
the crazy [ __ ] [ __ ] that John John
says like well then what's this deal
what's this deal that I've been hearing
about you like kind of daxing a chick
what's that about so like everything
you've ever heard about me has been
ripped out of context so hard do you
want to
here the story I guess sir yeah okay so
here's like well this is what happened I
know I'm the only one apparently that
remembers what I'm like so this is kind
of like the concise version okay so I
[ __ ] around with a chick that I
probably shouldn't have I said some mean
things about her she hacked my Twitter
and she posted my dick on Twitter okay
it was stupid of me I admitted I totally
thought it was a dumb thing on my end
and that's what happened she leaked my
Twitter and she leaked some chat logs
these are the chat logs that you see
that everybody posts about right I was
obviously very [ __ ] mad right when it
happened and I wrote some stuff on my
subreddit because she was writing she
was talking [ __ ] on my sub bird or
something and I wrote some [ __ ] like
okay well [ __ ] you like I'm gonna email
your school or whatever and I'm gonna
get you kicked out of school because
you're literally on my Twitter I'm like
posting my dick and whatnot that's all I
ever said I never threatened to Docs
anybody I never posted any of her
personal information
I never posted her address or even
threatened to there was no threat of
daxing anywhere in there and after I'd
cooled off after a day or two I didn't
even like I didn't even say anything
else to her like we pretty much I guess
like you do understand that it by just
saying that though like the same that
publicly and being like I'm gonna
contact your school or something like
that and just like let them know that
gives your audience motivation to find
out where this girl's school is do you
do know that right like by doing that
because this your audience does idolize
you your audience looks up to you I can
see it they're [ __ ] yeah sure sure
and I can kind of I can kind of maybe
get that I mean like if we're being
totally honest maybe that wasn't what I
was thinking at the time though like I
was super raged at the time like if you
had somebody break into your Twitter and
post your [ __ ] dick while you're at
an event I had to drive back from an
event like while it happened like I was
really but this was like literally like
this is [ __ ] that I typed like literally
that night and nothing ever came from it
I never contacted an employer I don't
think any of my fans tried to docks her
I don't I've never heard about this
happen you know and I'm friends with her
now like anytime I fly through SFO we
usually get coffee and chat like we're
cool but like everybody keeps making it
out like I literally destroyed this
girl's life and a lot of people say that
she's underage even though she's like
one year younger than me a lot of people
say that I like raped her and then I was
in an abusive relationship with her even
though we never dated there's like a
million different stories like every
time somebody talks about this I read
like a new fanfic about my life I'm like
if this literally happened in 2012 like
it was like five years ago mmm but um ya
know like that it's like not me I know
like I've never done
anybody or anything in my entire life do
you want to hear another meme you've
probably heard about me that I planned
on murdering somebody yeah well I've
seen that clip I've seen that clip sure
do you know what that was in reference
to no okay so a lot of people when they
when they type about this it's because I
lost a video game to some guy so I
wanted to go and murder him so back in
the early days of the internet streamers
didn't have any protections against
anything so if people wanted to ddos you
you just kind of got [ __ ] so I was at
a point in my life where a kid had
contacted me was taunting me about
ddossing me and then for the next like
three to six months proceeded to like
destroy my stream so I have a family I
have a child I've got a house I have
real bills to pay and my [ __ ] is [ __ ]
I had three separate interviews with the
FBI where they didn't help me ever even
though I had the full information of
this kid because they didn't care
because I was a gamer I contacted the
kid to get him to stop I contacted his
father and I traded emails with his
father where his father pretty much said
his son was too smart to do that and
that I should make friends with him so I
went through I exhausted all of my legal
channels and I exhausted all of my
reasonable channels I contacted him I
had Cox out to my house like 50 million
times to see if there's anything they
could do I had like a fancy [ __ ]
router like there was no nothing I could
figure out at the time and you know
being really [ __ ] upset I was like
dude like I have to find this [ __ ]
can to kill me this is [ __ ]
ridiculous it's hard to understand I
guess because I'm a streamer but this
would be the equivalent if you've ever
worked a conventional job if some guy
showed up outside your house every
single day and slashed your tires every
single [ __ ] day and you could never
call the cops on them and you literally
like I'm losing like thousands and
thousands of dollars because I can't
stream I can't pay my bills like so you
know is murder okay obviously not
was I really [ __ ] mad though like
that's this story is a lot different
what's up buddy me yeah wait I was just
in the other channel hold on let me get
off your string sure thing dude all
right so I hop probably a quarter of the
way through mm-hmm and the only issue I
well the unless there was some huge
qualifier at the beginning it just seems
like she is trying to paint like way to
blur out of a picture of any point that
disagrees with there like what well it
just like the idea that you can
characterize someone based off like some
sort of undertone that isn't even there
but you know it's like somewhere out the
ether so the last part of the video
actually addressed this specifically is
that it's really hard to identify and
that even she makes mistakes where she
thinks some people might be signaling it
but they actually aren't this is part of
the kind of the goal of the way that
they message but I mean did you actually
I'm sure that there is some small subset
of like right-wing people who do
actually do that or like you know we're
talking about that subset it's
essentially like racist people but I I
do not agree with that that's like
anywhere near like a majority I have
totally agree that's the point though
the problem is that a small minority of
people that are genuinely racist and
genuinely hateful are able to manipulate
large groups of people via messaging
that's more palpable to them yeah that
is what I disagree with like a lot I
don't think that anybody who is like
what she was saying an order me
basically huh I don't think any nor me
who believes in like right-wing things
is actually getting accosted into this
lifestyle by this like a racial
undertone okay I mean I guess we can
agree to disagree but I've seen plenty
of people that are starting to give
strong arguments for why black people
are genetically predisposed to crime or
why all Mexicans are like racist and
murderer thieves murderers
you know that's anecdotal evidence like
like you love to cite which part is
anecdotal the part where Trump won the
election based on this type of
propaganda or so yeah I disagree I don't
think that you can actually make that I
think it's really easy to wait why can't
I make the argument that Trump won the
election based on a lot of pretty racist
propaganda
because you can't you can't attribute
racism to people voting in a way that
you dislike well it seemed like a lot of
racism was a pretty big selling part of
Trump's message there was a lot of anti
Islam rhetoric there was a lot of anti
Mexico rhetoric yeah I mean I think
you're attributing racism to what what
you can call stupidity and I don't
actually think it's these stupid people
we're voting for Trump and that are or I
don't think that they're getting like
convinced by this undertone of racism
you know what I mean like it's people
that is crowds literally chant build the
wall build the wall what do you think
you could argue for a wall you know with
it's not actually racist like you could
have tight border control
you are hood but when you're messaging
is literally we need to put up a wall
because Mexico is sending rapists
murderers and thieves here that doesn't
have racial undertones to you I mean
that definitely does but it's when I was
Trump's message I mean yeah but he's not
saying that the majority of them are he
said that you when Mexico sends people
over here they're said they're not
sending their best they're sending
rapists murderers and thieves and some
of them are good people I imagine so
because minority there yeah but the
illegal ways people are getting over
here actually there were so many people
who were like raping people coming over
yeah but when you say so many that
number is less than than any native grew
number I've ever seen in my life I've
never seen a number that says illegal
immigrants commit crimes and greater
proportion than the native than natives
well so now you're talking about once
they get here you're saying that it's
probably the same crime right
no it's less where do you see that I
have a hard time believing that I mean I
would argue it's probably the same but I
have our time believing people who come
here illegally are already committing
you know a crime to come here illegally
are less likely to commit crime in the
future I would say that there by default
as likely as someone who's living here
in the first place okay hold on one
second I'm sorry well do you have that
because I'm not even pro Trump for
anything I just you accused me of using
anecdotes so this is data pulled from a
Cato study that they pulled from Census
Bureau statistics this shows that you
sent me this on discard so this shows
the proportion of the incarceration
rates for illegal immigrants illegal
immigrants and all natives and you can
see that illegal immigrants compared to
all natives is actually like half and
then legal immigrants has even further
beneath that so when you say that you
feel like illegal immigrants commit more
crime than than I didn't say that well
that's what it sounded like you said you
had a hard time believing it was the
other way around so I assumed that you
meant the opposite was true so I'm
carrying I just you just thought that I
assumed that it would be the same but oh
yeah and you can I link the fuller
article that it comes from and then you
can go to the Bureau if you don't I
guess I think they misrepresented the
stats whatever but I'm curious why you
think that illegal immigrants commit
more crime is it because of stories
you've heard or have you actually seen
stats or numbers that point in the other
direction no no again I didn't say that
I think they commit more crime I said I
if I had to assume without stats like I
just said I would assume that they come
at the same amount of crime okay but I
had a hard time believing because like I
mean I thought it would be rational to
assume that if someone's committing one
crime they're probably more likely to
commit a different crime in the future
gotcha so you were a victim of
propaganda essentially is what you're
saying
mmm no because I also wouldn't base
policy around whether or not people
coming here are committing crime because
that's such a small subset why would you
think that somebody that was risk their
life illegally immigrating to another
country would come here just to be a
criminal couldn't I just be a criminal
in Mexico yeah sure so it seems like
you're feeling that they're coming here
to commit crime based on propaganda
based on spooky stories you've seen or
news stories or whatever but not on any
actual hard data right okay yeah but I
would never make a policy decision based
on that's fine you don't have to make a
policy decision you just have to feel a
certain way and then that's going to
guide you when you go to vote at the
polls and the people that you vote in
are gonna be the ones making policy
decision right and we don't we don't
usually leave all of our policy and yeah
that states up to referendum so the
problem this is a problem right so what
are you saying is the problem just the
problem is that right now you just
demonstrated that you held a belief that
was based on misinformation or fantasy
and that you're going to probably vote
with that
misinformation in mind and you're gonna
vote for people that will write policy
that will have an impact on people
coming over based on a delusion in your
mind well one I didn't vote for Joe and
two I would I would I just I'd like I'm
saying that I just had an assumption
there so I never like thought anything
of it you know and I mean if I haven't
thought of something I'm not gonna hold
say well this is just one assumption
that you had that was completely
backward I bet we could find more if we
were to come if we were to go further
like oh yeah sure but it's like I don't
you seem I don't know I just think that
he makes these stranger arguments and
wait what are you gonna make a stroke
sir the whole argument that you think
that there's a large majority of people
in the u.s. that are being swayed over
with undertones of racism well when you
have communities of people like
anti-semitic people that proposed the
Jewish question or race realest people
that think that Mexicans or Hispanics
and black people are inferior to those
to the to the white race or neo-nazis
like Richard Spencer that advocate for
white ethnos state when all of these
people's beliefs are perfectly aligned
with Trump's policies yeah I mean it
makes it hard to believe that there's
not like some subversive attempt here to
move a lot of people over into this
train of thought by way of bogus science
or bogus history I guess but I feel like
you're also kind of if you're kind of
making an argument like if you hold a
viewpoint and then there are also
garbage people who hold that viewpoint
you should reconsider your viewpoint you
know not necessarily you just have to
make sure that you're holding your
viewpoint for the right reason so that
you don't get moved over into these
things but the problem is that often
that the end point isn't so like for
instance building a wall isn't really
rational there's no real rational reason
to have that viewpoint you can't really
make a good argument for it the number
of Mexicans in the United States are
people that come from Mexico has
decreased over the past decade so that's
a problem that's going away I think like
60% of people that stay here holding the
UM or that stay here that are legal
immigrants like overstayed their visas
so a wall is not gonna help with that
there is no guarantee even that the wall
itself will be effective people can go
over under or around via boat or
continue to travel through illegally
vehicles so you have a position here
that a lot of people have that is no
basis in reality
that only further serves the goals of
people that are legitimately racist
because it probably not even really
gonna help the illegal immigration
problem that much yeah okay and one
thing that I realize are like Trump
supporters not that I am a Trump
supporter is like I think he speaks
extremely hyperbolically and I know that
you're probably gonna say I could give
the benefit of the doubt well no I'm not
gonna say that I'll just say that you're
absolutely wrong because Trump has
already demonstrated via executive
action and his own rhetoric in office
that he wasn't being hyperbolic he
legitimately tried to ban most of
majority countries for no real reason
from the ah specifically okay well his
cookies are but he tried to get funding
from the wall in the congressional
budget negotiation so I mean even that's
not true I mean yeah but it's never
actually gonna happen you know and he's
trying to make it happen he is he is
trying to get funding for the wall as
part of the negotiations in Congress for
the next budget like so it wasn't
hyperbolic it's stuff that he's actually
trying to do I guess but it's it's not
gonna happen and I think that people
know things like on my end I can show
you people going build the wall build I
can show you that Trump's rhetoric is
saying he wants to build the wall I can
show you that when Trump goes to the
presidency he's trying to build the wall
and then you're telling me well I don't
think any of those people really thought
it because that's what I feel like which
argument is more convincing there I mean
obviously people yelling but you do you
genuinely believe that people who are
yelling build the wall are voting for
him because he's gonna build a wall like
it seems that seems like further out of
the realm of possibility to me unless
I'm waiting so you're saying you're
saying does it seem to me like people
that show up at rallies and scream build
the wall and then vote for a guy that
says he's gonna build a wall and then
support a guy in office who's trying to
build the wall you're saying isn't it
it's not realistic that these people
actually want to build the wall is that
what you're asking me yeah I think that
the vast majority of people are actually
just voting for Trump because he is the
lesser of two evils like I don't think
anyone is actually so Pro Trump or I
don't think that any sort of majority of
Trump voters are that proach
like they want all these crazy things
like a wall or like to ban all Muslims
which you could argue wasn't even the
goal in the first place well he's on his
website it's listed that he wanted a
Muslim ban like and then he talked to
Giuliani about trying to find a legal
way to do a Muslim ban and then he
Bamford sure his quote was like a
temporary muscle that's a temporary
Muslim ban is still RT yeah and in order
to increase the vetting process that he
doesn't understand that's already one of
the strictest in the history of the
world yeah that's what I was just gonna
say I don't think people who say that we
need a better vetting process have
actually looked into the vetting process
so like if your argument is that you
can't believe that people are actually
this [ __ ] stupid I could almost
believe that but I mean it's been
demonstrated time and time and time and
time and time and time and time again
that when there was this cornucopia of
evidence on one side that people
actually do want this thing for you to
just say well really do they really want
it I mean they've proven it time and
time again that they do I mean I haven't
looked it up because I figured it was
self-evident but we could probably find
polling data on people who want the wall
I mean Gallup the wall I mean I'm sure
we could find this somewhere yeah okay
well we're got this my goal is
definitely not to oh well actually
nowadays it looks like more people are
favoring a path to citizenship but I
think that the people that went to these
rallies and voted for Trump I'm sure
that sure like you know I'm sorry
let me correct that real quick 62% of
Republicans are in favor of building a
wall along the entire US Mexican border
so a majority of them are still okay for
building the wall but a lot of them are
also okay with them giving them a path
to citizenship as well sorry God okay
well regardless my point we like with
what I was saying about the video with
the example they are getting right now
is people who are being swayed over by
Trump like blatantly saying we need a
very Mexicans or whatever sort of thing
right
they're not being swayed over by like
some random dude on Twitter who has a
thumbs up thing this Twitter handle and
obviously it's more subtle than that
there's less subtle than that what what
she's saying but so I like the problem
is that like here's the problem the
problem is that if I go in your centrist
world where everybody's innocent I can
get people so [ __ ] close to being
racist that moving them over to racism
is very [ __ ] easy that if I go by all
of Trump's rhetoric okay I can take
somebody who is anti-immigration okay
there's so anti-immigration and they're
so [ __ ] Mexico that they want to build a
wall between the countries they want
Trump to enact a 20% tariff on all
products coming from that country and
they want Trump to renegotiate NAFTA
because they think Mexico got the
benefit of us these are all things that
exist in reality today okay now I can
also take those same groups of people
and I could say things like stop and
frisk treating black people unfairly in
the United States that's okay
I think we stop and frisk is a good idea
cutting taxes to the to the rich and and
leaving a larger burden to be shouldered
by the poor and carving back things like
welfare like the ACH whatever things
that inarguably have a higher impact on
on poor black people right these are all
things that I can I can have that are
really good anti-muslim that a lot of
Muslims are brown now maybe that doesn't
matter but a lot of Muslim and we want
to get rid of all Muslims Muslim
terrorism is a huge [ __ ] deal we need
to ban all Muslims on the crushinator
kick him out [ __ ] us we need to keep
them from ever coming right if I have
you believing all of these things okay
if you believe all of these things
wholeheartedly it's not really that
difficult to move you into this idea
that hey white people okay Rajan
ethically what you just said that you
were just talking about centrists what
centrists believe that every [ __ ]
century sargon of akkad does armored
skeptics see the big anti-globalization
anti-immigration Pro protecting your
Western culture [ __ ] Lauren southern
yeah these people say the [ __ ] all the
time
you call sargon of akkad or Lauren
southern centrist well I say that but
Sargon actually calls herself a leftist
but what yes so Sargon described as a
subscribed leftist Lauren southern I
don't know I think she describes herself
as conservative retiree but she's often
cited by the centrist people or whatever
but but the if I have you here if you
believe all these things getting you to
believe that colored people are just
genetically predisposed to being you
know more likely a criminal or whatever
that's a pretty easy step like it's not
that far removed like it already fits
your whole worldview the
we need to keep colored people from
coming here the color people in the
country need to pick themselves up by
their bootstraps and work their [ __ ]
instead of getting welfare handouts and
that we need to keep people that's
colored people to celebrate other
religions away from this country right
it's not that hard to move you into the
idea that white people are genetically
gifted in some ways compared to cover
people that's not really that hard to do
do you could you see how close you are
there I guess but I have two problems
one sure what's Sargon that's kind of
proven my point of like the people being
kind of I mean I don't know what you
think about him I I saw like part of one
in fear talks with him but I think that
he's just kind of like not too bright no
I don't want to sound like a douche like
on my high horse or something but I feel
like he's just not that bright and he's
definitely not being like I don't know
the idea that he's just like being
swindled by these racists who are like
using him as a platform for all right
like I mean Richard Spencer literally
tweeted that Sargon is a great stepping
stone to white nationalism because he
agree okay he agrees with what he said
yeah because this platform is almost
impossible to differentiate between an
authentic white nationalist platform
from what I've seen that disagree very
strong I mean he sits there any rallies
against Muslims and that horrible
immigrant manifest the infestation in
Europe then all these Muslims and
colored people are going to Europe and
rape and gangs and everything all over
that the United States has a right to
protect itself from multiculturalism as
the enemy and diversity is our greatest
strength is [ __ ] like he has all the
good talking points like that black
people are disadvantaged in the United
States because they're just too dumb to
get married and deserve what I was
saying but he hasn't he has non racist
ways of arguing for these things and
it's again the matter of like not
well what's up my dude hey what's going
on destiny I do it man not too good I
got a lot of people talking a lot of
[ __ ] to me on Twitter today some for
some reason I'm not sure what's going on
okay first of all I'm telling you that
in about what 15 20 minutes
aha and I'll for like five minutes yeah
No right yeah cool cool just you know uh
yeah so basically there's that whole
thing I mean I'm sure you saw my video
already about you telling Bunty you
cutting into some [ __ ] with Bunty and
calling pretty much all of me and my
buddies racist for so for just our
belief system I don't think I ever said
that all the people that went to VidCon
were racist everyone well I don't think
I ever talked about the people at VidCon
I usually say that sargon fans are
really stupid
that's what I think Monty is me and him
we're talking about okay cuz I got the
impression from watching your video you
made it sound like that I said that all
the VidCon people were really the
Bitcoin just generally us people with my
you know more of a conservative
viewpoint and I'm not even really
conservative like fully I have some
liberal views as well but I say mostly
conservative but a lot of us in our
genre that we're like racist that were
and that
Bunty is pretty much just bending over
and taking it in the ass from us just
cuz we're nice to him in person I guess
that you really think that the only type
of racism is literally you like hating
minorities and burning crosses like this
is one of the reasons why this
conversation it's so hard to have with
you guys like you literally say and I'm
willing to have the conversation that's
the thing I'm a hundred percent willing
to have the conversation and what I want
to know from people who claim that were
a racist is we're exactly and what
points exactly that we're talking about
that are racist or make us viewed as
racist and I kept I keep being called a
racist from a lot of people on the left
for and I keep asking them why and I
don't get an answer why I never get an
answer of why and then it just sounds
like an empty you know
assault right oh you're a racist because
blah blah and then there's no actual
reason behind why you're calling me a
racist okay how about a voter ID okay
boater ID yeah key so hot so how exactly
is that racist do you are you supportive
of the attempts to devote her ID so far
in the United States you supporter ID in
general yes okay cool so you might not
be racist right and I don't know if I
would call you racist maybe I would just
call you a racist enabler because you
have opinions on things you haven't
researched at all you feel like you feel
like voter ID is a good thing but when
you look at what happens when
Republicans and I say Republicans
because it's Republicans to do this try
to implement voter ID for instance in
North Carolina well you find out is that
they're just targeting black people
that's literally what they're doing not
trying to make the election process any
safer they're not trying to make the
integrity of the whole cycle better for
anybody it's literally just we want to
keep as many black people from voting as
possible not really then how do we well
we were talking about voter ID yeah what
we're talking about is people who don't
have enough money to get ID therefore
black people would be more racist
because more black people are poor
Carolina what we were talk in North
Carolina what happened was we found out
all the types of ID that black people
used and we made those somewhat expired
some not some some given by the state
and some not we made all of those types
illegal and we kept all the ones that
only white people used we took the
13-day early voting period and we cut
that down to seven days because we found
out that black people were the ones that
tended to voted early over white people
and then we shut down polling stations
that were predominantly black they were
predominantly used by black people if
you do not agree your state no this is
North Carolina that went to the Supreme
Court and it got shut down because it
was horribly [ __ ] racist public
assemblies so what's the IDS that mostly
black people use all right I don't know
you would have to get that data okay so
so but but here is my understanding with
the voter ID law like like in general
what a lot of people on the left now
what whether it be there
them shutting down only black people IDs
now I have to look into that because I
don't know too much about that and
keeping white people IDs which I guess
what our driver's license or whatever if
we if we don't have IDs like is it what
you want is no IDs in general like you
walk in here's my name bloom you vote
that seems to be the way that we do it
now and I haven't heard of any current
problems in the electoral process if
you're going to start putting up
barriers to voting which is a
fundamental right of every American
you need have a really good reason for
doing so it doesn't sound like any of
those reasons have been presented so far
but all right here here's the reason
what if I lie about Who I am
okay like what if you walked into it
with my powers and you used it to beat
everybody in a poker game but what I'm
saying is you have to demonstrate that
these problems exist like as well so no
but but if we don't have people showing
ID when they're voting and lying about
who they are or voting twice etc etc
then we have an issue okay probably the
problem that we had this happen it just
doesn't happen anyway but how do you
know well it hasn't happened because
there are voter ID laws no there are the
voter ID laws were removed first in most
states there aren't you go to the place
you say who you are they look up your
address and then you vote that's it I
don't have to show an ID to vote so you
just just give your name and then and
they'll do that they cross you guys out
yeah but how do we know like poor people
poor white people let's talk about poor
white people for for a second here how
how is this not affecting them it is
affecting them right sure therefore it's
affecting poor people not majority black
or majority white in fact there are a
lot like an obviously exponentially
because the of the population of whites
versus blacks in in America obviously a
lot of poor white people whenever I hear
poor people a lot of the people on the
Left they start to reference
you know black people like as if there's
no white people who are poor and then
when I do give a comparison between a
black poor person and a white poor
person I hear well the white poor person
is a little bit more privileged and I
want to know exactly how so so how do we
say poor people like it almost seems
racist in a sense that when we're
talking about poor people that were only
talking about black people you know what
I mean and now like again there are
obviously some states where there's a
way more higher percentage of poor black
people compared to poor white people
I'll give you that for sure and if this
is a problem for them it [ __ ] sucks
and we have to definitely rectify it
however I don't see the correlation
between a certain ID and the person
being black I made a video on this last
year and I got a [ __ ] ton of emails and
tweets and everything from a ton of
black people saying yeah I don't
understand why they're saying that only
black people aren't the ones able to get
IDs because there's a bunch of white
people can get a these are other black
people I don't know who say it but these
are black people that haven't looked
into it either I don't care if you're
white or black if you think this the
opinion here is pretty clear like when
when Republicans have tried to implement
voter ID they've done so without
demonstrating any need for it no one has
demonstrated that oh well look at all
this voter fraud we need ID that's never
been demonstrated and in the ways that
people have tried to implement it such
as the case in North Carolina that went
to the Supreme Court it was pretty clear
that it was just racially motivated so
earlier you said there are a lot of
white people and a lot of black people
that are poor okay I want I want to
understand okay I'm gonna give you an
example if I walk into a room okay let's
say that there are 100 white people and
there are 20 black people okay and I
look into the room and I look at all of
their economic data and I say okay I
want to get rid of all the poor people
from this room get rid of what get rid
of all of my don't wanna talk to see any
of them okay let's say that thirty white
people walk out and fifteen black people
walk out okay so if we lose thirty out
of a hundred white people there's still
70 left it was only thirty percent right
if we
fifteen out of like twenty or thirty
black people it's a much higher
percentage of black people than than
white people that are impacted I get
what you're saying there I can kill
you're saying so like when you look at
the poverty rate of white winning
basically well no what I'm saying is you
know you have to look at the numbers on
a per capita basis in the United States
nine percent of the people that are in
poverty are white 22% of the people are
black hello yeah so yeah you know black
people have a much smaller percentage of
that installation but but again again
the like yeah sure there will be more
white people who will be able to vote
because the percentage is higher of non
poor whites I understand what you're
saying there but to to say that there is
in place laws to make black people not
being able to vote when the same white
people of the same economic standard are
being removed from voting as well then
that's where you lose me you know what I
mean yeah I understand okay um actually
there was an interesting thing I saw one
of your debates it was with no [ __ ]
that you you brought up and it was
talking about how you were saying that
black people are more likely to be
arrested for a drug charge than a white
person right yeah and and then no
[ __ ] you know he like he's a nice
guy I like him but his answer was was
was horrible where he said cuz black
people most likely have guns hanging out
of their pants and they are caught more
and I thought that was a dumb answer and
how I would like I was sort of hearing
or a debate with him and like we have to
understand that there are a lot of bad
areas in the states that have a
predominantly more minority people and
it's obviously unfortunate I'm not
saying it's something I'm happy about it
but there are the you know way more you
know murder and rape caused by the black
community
you know 13% of the people in America
are black and they caused about 50% of
murder and rape so these are horrible
numbers therefore these neighborhoods
have way more police presence because of
you know this statistic yeah I
understand this point can we just go
back to the other thing real quick and
then we could run to this okay okay so
I'm sorry so let's say okay okay I'm not
trying to I don't want to call you names
or anything if I say anything that you
disagree with her if I'm rude feel free
to interrupt me and tell me stuff okay
so there is a term for people okay and
I'm not trying to be rude with this but
the name of the term white nationalist
would use this to describe Trump you
call these people useful idiots so what
you do is you have a law and you have
the intent might be okay and the letter
of the law is good but the actual end
result is not good at all so let me give
you an example okay let's say that I
want to take a vote of people in a room
okay and I want to vote on what we're
going to do in this room what activity
we're gonna do okay now I'm gonna use
specific numbers here okay let's say
that there are 100 white people and
there are 20 black people okay and let's
say that I get an economic breakdown of
all these people know my goal let's say
secretly I'm really racist okay I don't
want any black people to vote okay
on this poll so I can't say no black
people like cuz that's racist as [ __ ]
and everybody would call me out on it so
instead let's say that I get the
economic breakdown I go okay well if I
get rid of all the poor people I can get
rid of 30 white people and 15 black
people now if I get rid of that many if
you look at that right okay 30 30 white
people 15 black people two-thirds of the
people you just got rid of are white
like this isn't racist most of the
people impacted here are white you're
not really like this is this can't be
racist at all like it impacts more white
people than black people how can you
possibly say this keeps more black
people from voting than white people
that was essentially what you were
saying earlier right do you kind of
follow this so far yeah yeah okay but
the problem is that we had a hundred
white people voting and now we only have
70 so you've removed 30% of the white
people from the vote we had 20 black
people voting and then we removed 15 of
them now we only have five you removed
75 I
I totally see what you're saying where
it's almost like you're you're not
saying I don't want black people to vote
I'm just gonna cause this thing that
will have way less black people voting
sure we'll lose some white people
because the cap per capita we have more
white people therefore we'll have more
white people voting yeah so that's how
even though it's easy to say like well
look all these white poor people are
impacted too well sure but on a per
capita basis way more black people are
poor than there are poor white people so
even if some white people aren't able to
vote you lose way more four percentage
of the black vote than the white vote no
okay no no I totally see what you're
saying there and I I totally understand
that however if I it's really hard to it
to explain because if white people are
being as affected as black people and
because per capita there are less black
people than white people when we lower
the percentage of poor people whether it
be black or white we are dropping the
number for both the the white and the
black
therefore it's almost an even playing
field now what you're saying is that
there are more per capita poor black
people right therefore they lose more of
a percentage when this drop happens
because of poor people can't pull with
their IDs however and this is actually
like and this is actually even on on a
franchesca ramsey who have passed
millions of times but on a decoded
episode where there is a lot of areas a
lot of states where there are more white
poor people per capita compared to black
people so how would we explain these
certain states and the overall voting of
a president let's say you know what I
mean so we're so we're dropping
percentage on white people and on black
people but almost at the same rate
because there are per capita as many
poor to white I'm sorry poor black to
white people you know what I mean
so if if there was something that was
way more like solid way more solid
evidence saying hey look there's
obviously ninety percent of black people
are being affected by this and only ten
percent of white people
I'd be on your side you know what I mean
it just seems to me
yeah sure you lose those thirty white
people and you lose that fifteen black
people but percentage-wise
that would make sense okay so when okay
do you get are you okay my okay talking
about these hammers you want to write
this down or something cuz I cuz it can
get a little bit confusing I guess I
don't mean that but what would be the a
percent okay we have one hundred white
people voting and twenty black people
voting okay okay I see what you're
saying yeah okay mathematic I'm actually
hold on women only got now twenty five
percent okay you've got one hundred
white people voting and you've got
twenty black people voting right you
understand that right right okay
so if we look at that that means that of
all the people that voted of the total
votes twenty percent of them were black
people does that make sense right yeah
so we have a whole vote about but now
ideally you want votes in some regards
to represent the population right okay
sure so one hundred white people voting
twenty black people voting that means
that twenty percent of the vote is going
to be black now let's say that we quote
unquote remove the poor okay so we take
out thirty white people and fifteen
black people we move twice as many white
people as black people right so now we
have 70 white people voting okay and we
have and we've got a poem sorry socio
total all right but regardless we've got
seventeen
I'm sorry we've got seventy white people
voting and we've got five black people
voting right yeah no I get your
percentage of the brain but this is
assuming that this example that you
brought out is the actual numbers are on
the table they talk but this is what it
always is it is always
disproportionately impacting black
people versus white people you don't see
Republicans pushing this in areas where
white people this is what I mean
I went where this is where the term
useful idiot comes from because a lot of
Republicans will sit there in champion
like oh you know ovo to perform um you
know or this voter ID is really good it
protects the integrity of our process
but the only people that are the people
that are always disproportionately
impacted by this are always black people
in every area where Republicans have
brought this up it's happened over and
over and over again it happens with
gerrymandering in Texas just recently I
got struck down there where they're
always trying to find what it like this
is like the Republican strategy to
voting is to try to keep as many black
people from voting as possible that
seems to be what it what it is when they
do these voter ID things see I I get
what you're saying
i I and believe me I try to look at
things on you know both sides before I
really like they make a full decision on
what I believe or whatever and I'm not
saying that I'm a hundred percent right
or whatever but what I'm saying is
unless I get some sort of solid
information that makes it obvious that
what is being presented is in fact
racist and like like like here's the
problem with just saying racist or yeah
he's racist or whatever I can now take
this form of I'll say soft racism if
that's cool like if that makes sense
where it's like let's say a hard racist
is is like me walking up to a black dude
and calling him the n-word and a soft
race it's like I don't know if you're
invited to the party let's just pretend
that's the term right these be soft
racist terms I can now take anything
anything any subject any area anything
you want to talk about and find
something racist about it you know what
I mean yeah so I can't be like well you
know I'm Asian people you know there are
really bad drivers which is like a
stereotype I'm using that as an example
you know they're bad drivers and let's
say I've seen this every day an Asian
person always cuts me off or whatever
right now you're saying that me at least
what's up mr. Bunty hi Steven Steven can
we just make a commitment here to not
bark at each other but I never market
anybody I'm the most cordial debater
you've ever met in your life and I'm not
even real Nazi dude yeah all right dude
listen so where do you start where do I
start like rocky know what I'm gonna
start right here first of all I wanted
to apologize to you I don't know if you
saw it earlier for calling you names
cuz it's shitty it's a shitty thing to
do not it's not part of yeah I accept
your apology but that's cool alright
okay cool so and the next thing that's
why scream Addlestone so i'll outline my
general problem and then we'll be Civic
to Matthew Buddha so my general problem
okay that I've spoken to every single
person in your kind of like corner of
the world is that you have two groups of
people okay you have overtly racist
people people get are anti like whatever
ruin okay yeah like anti-semitic anti
brown person like blatantly racist yeah
okay then you have this group of people
that are you guys where you don't come
out and defend these people but like you
viciously attack everybody on the other
side and then you always offer these
quasi haphazard defenses of these other
people who are being like pretty
blatantly racist okay and we pretend
that this doesn't happen that's the part
that bothers me the most
okay where we pretend of this isn't
what's happening okay looking at the
mouthy Buddha thing in particular okay
so I think you saw this cuz you guys see
everything I don't know if you guys are
in like a secret discord group but one
is no Steven soon before you go on okay
I don't see absolutely everything see
the thing is I like for me YouTube is
this thing that I love right because it
allows me to [ __ ] connected people
and then go ahead and like share my
story where I come from you know like
talk about Montreal talk about the stuff
that I care about okay I'm kind of help
people that way so that's what I'm doing
right so for but in the meantime I also
have like real life stuff I'm the
marketer like that's what I do like my
job is social media so like I'm doing
stuff with clients and I'm doing all
sorts of other stuff so that job that
I've had in social media has allowed me
to kind of like
I mean I only got it to begin to begin
with because they understood that I had
like an idea of what how to touch
certain demographics based on
information that they provided me
because they know like because I'm just
able to adjust something I'm just I'm
good at marketing I love it just [ __ ]
fun for me it's like numbers and all
that [ __ ]
so like that's what I do mainly so
should I see when people when people are
like telling me about stuff that's
happening like I miss a bunch of stuff
and so I have to rely on these
conversations that I've had with certain
people and just like based off of my
experiences with them and and how I
question people and how I like pretty
much establish if there's someone that I
want to keep around that's that's pretty
much like how I can operate based on
nothing it will just watch as much as of
their content while still following them
you don't I mean sure so no speak if I
need to explain it more explaining so we
have a massive difference in opinion
here so this is kind of what I riled
against you for saying this and I feel
very strong about this you know that
people can have you could find some okay
so what is your like or I don't know
your ethnic background is okay but let's
say I brown people what okay my parents
are Indian okay that's what I guess
hopefully see okay sure so like you can
have a person that legitimately doesn't
like Indian people like he wants all of
them to be deported he doesn't want them
in the country I get you in real life
and be really friendly
you know that's possible right I can
imagine it being possible absolutely
okay definitely so I'm not I'm not
saying that I'll imagine like oh no it's
not gonna happen no but I can imagine
for sure because people have certain
what of a cait motivations like I yeah
like I've had to you know I've had to
deal with shady people before for sure
I'm sure because they say one thing and
then they see another thing when you're
when you're back stand for sure okay so
do you see how it rubbed some people the
wrong way when somebody releases what is
essentially Nazi propaganda a Nazi
propaganda anti-semitic video and then
yeah that's your defense is literally
like well I met these guys in real life
and most of them are nice and also
here's a funny message I sent him on
Twitter and he said he wasn't
anti-semitic so he must not be the
oldest and but that you know what it's
you know that was like a joke right
that's like something to play on the
actual whole situation and kind of make
people laugh and there's ease people up
a bit I know that like what the
difference is
when you guys have anybody on the left
that makes even the slightest comment
you're later literally like this guy's
trying to destroy Western when you say
you guys are you really lumping me in
with this because I have something that
I do not do and I have people that can
actually a test for that it's something
that I really try to avoid doing in fact
you know because being a Canadian like
theirs we are so far ahead in terms of
social game in terms of gay rights in
terms of the fact that I grew up in a
multi-ethnic city like I had it rough in
the 90s and going up and through the
early 2000s but after that like I was
able to kind of it was easier for me
like I definitely have a sense of
privilege in the sense that like I am
like a Montreal Road that's got that's
living in Canada like an ethnic person
living in Canada is so different from an
ethnic person maybe living in certain
parts of the States or parts of Europe
you know so for me like that's where I'm
coming from you understand like that's
that's I'm not gonna go and [ __ ] [ __ ]
on an sjw just because I disagree with
their opinion and I don't think that
they're gonna bring an end to Western
civilization I really don't believe that
I refuse to believe that so like you
have to understand that like I'm coming
from it in an angle that's like I don't
think that the sjw's are all bad and I
don't think that these people on the
right are all that bad and like I know
that we start off on a very very wrong
foot like we would like [ __ ] called
you out because I saw the things that
happened with jontron and then the
animation thing and even though we
differ on opinion and I see how
passionate you are I mistook your
passion for you being a [ __ ] jerk so
for me I come right out of the gate with
like hard-hitting like [ __ ] being a
pig and that's and the thing is that I
didn't have to do that and that's why
you may put me in that group but I don't
do that generally that's something that
I don't enjoy doing because it closes
doors and so like because the problem
that I have and this is really really
difficult for me is that so many people
in this corner of the internet just
[ __ ] live will just lie to me
constant but what they actually so like
I look at your YouTube channel and I
look through your top videos and
unsurprisingly I think you're actually
telling me the truth okay
for once I do time which is cool so like
I talked to the do you know the Andy
warg [ __ ] what's his name you know who
I'm talking about Andy yeah so like this
is a guy every time I pull you guys on
the Jeff holiday sky sargon every time I
pull these skeptics on and talk to them
it's always like oh no I don't just do
this or I represent
sides or I'm in the middle and then when
you bring up their channel it's 52 ways
that feminism is destroying Western
society 100 ways and it's like dude I
know so the reason why I kind of lumped
you in with these people is because I
think several times now I think this has
happened with three different occasions
you've jumped in with them so I kind of
like put you on this side my big issue
here then so maybe you'll have a more
reasonable opinion than like the Jeff
holidays guy or whatever but like the
the mouthy Buddhist [ __ ] is pretty bad
when he first made the video my initial
impression was that he's another fence
sitting skeptic that's paying way too
much homage to people on the right and
he's doing so in like a way that he
knows what he's doing but at this point
I'm pretty sure that he's actually
anti-semitic do you think so or do you
think not I don't see that's the thing I
don't think so okay but now I was like
just before coming in here just before I
saw you quote eat which hurts my [ __ ]
feelings okay but uh but yeah pretty
much what happened essentially is like
that I saw this video and it was a video
that pretty much seemed very
anti-semitic and I had my friends played
I played him for my friends I'm like
what do you think of this cuz I was so
insurance so [ __ ] up I'm like there's
no way I mean have you seen it have you
seen this video in question I'm sure
people have been sending it to you and
I'm sure that you see all this stuff so
so there are two big videos that have
been released that are you talking about
the Jewish Question part 1 and 2 that's
what you're talking about okay well
those are the main videos right so you
so the way that he phrases things in the
second video
it's just presenting the other argument
it's really hard to tell that right like
if I was presenting um let's say that
I'm presenting like white Indians are
bad people right I would say something
like okay these people claim that any
white people any group of people any any
group of you right these people are bad
or you know it's said that these people
are bad these people claim this bla bla
bla bla right these are the kind of
statements you would make to make it
clear that it's somebody else's point of
view you wouldn't say that um you
wouldn't say that um X person said that
white people are really disgusting
therefore it's obvious that if you look
at all the data white people are
horrible people and this guy actually is
a good point and go on and on like that
and then at the end of the video be like
while I put a disclaimer throught like
it really makes it look like those are
his points of view yeah okay but and
when you study the other two videos okay
so yeah so let's say that we can never
let's say that we are at an impasse here
even though I think the video looks
really about in its own right so there
are I don't trying like ambush you with
these videos these have been getting
circulate alright my fans so this is a
video where you want to listen to like
the first like minute and a half of this
yeah okay if you've already seen that we
don't have to watch ever like no no okay
so I sent you a video and I don't have a
name I want to see the name or anything
it wasn't like a stream leery it's a
streamable video it's called we are do
you want to cook it and listen like the
first min and a half of it are you send
it to me yeah I'm sorry I do scope I'm
sorry but we're gonna do some [ __ ]
weird [ __ ] to watch it together oh I
don't have any of those things I know
but we could just art at the same time
okay
oh yeah okay so this one and then he
pretty much goes on to start talking
about like you know he says like there's
a there's a force taking over at which
point you know I'm like okay well maybe
he's just talking about the fact these
people want to control free speech and
it looks like that because he leads into
the next part and then he be and then
and then he goes and then he goes and
I'll put Israel so in terms of in terms
of like in terms of like what they're
doing is like they are rejecting this
and their mate they're putting the
burden on us so it seems like it's not
that's the where I cut off by the way so
I didn't watch the whole thing sure but
it's really example the first part I
wish a whole wing
I wish well they go the first part of
the video that is the Jewish Question
right the Jews are trying to subvert
Western culture debate and then he gives
an example of two Jewish people also he
earlier in a video that I'm sure you've
heard by now he says that he dog
whistles to his audience at like 115 in
this video he says that he's not going
to let his YouTube channel disappear
into the echoes okay and the echoes is
the parentheses thing you know what I'm
talking about this day right so I mean
like it's pretty hard and then I think
this is the same video where in the
beginning he talks of how the alt-right
has one thing right and that he thinks
the enemy of his enemy is his friend I
know dude dude literally I watched it
just before I saw a quote tweet and I
was like so but this was taken down
right like this is not a channel
anymore right I it was on a private link
like I like an unlisted video I don't
know if it's still there or not well if
it was unlisted that means that he
published it and then like that's the
well so you can publish a video you you
don't have to publish it but you can
list it on the channel but make it
unlisted so you have to it yeah exactly
exactly but most people if they want to
keep something private like this then
they would just go ahead and they would
they would private it right away like
they wouldn't have it didn't unlisted
they would have it in private if they
were I don't know why it wasn't privacy
but I mean like but that's the thing so
here's like I don't know I I sent this
link to him and I was like what the [ __ ]
is this explain this and what he is like
what I'm thinking here is that II put it
up a while back how old is this video do
you know how old this video is I'm not
sure because I only was seeing the
reuploads I think so yes say there's no
way to tell so the idea is that like
what I would assume here just based on
the fact that I like assume the good in
people is that he's took he had this
video up he was like oh this is not the
I'm wrong you know I'm totally wrong
this makes no sense because he probably
went and started talking to more Jewish
people and they were like no so at that
point he probably took it off and he
probably unlisted it instead of like
profiting it I don't know that's the
thing that's just me trying to like make
sense of it before he actually explains
it to me if he's gonna explain it to me
like I supposed to schedule an interview
with him on my channel like as soon as
he uploaded his third video so I don't
know like now I'm like now that
definitely brings in the question and
like but even even though I looked at
his first tube those those videos on the
Jewish Question
and for me they didn't seem based on
like me going in I'm like oh hey I went
in being someone that grew up in the
Jewish community being someone like that
is able to like kind of get an idea if
this is like really [ __ ] up and son
I'd worry about and for me apart from
the second video at the very beginning
and the very half of it I was like I was
like this is okay like this is like he's
just pretty much explaining what the
alt-right stands for what the hell let
me the first video for me sorry the
first video for me didn't seem super
propaganda because he was presented I
remember he spent a significant portion
on like defending you know Judaism and
and so I watched the first video okay
and I totally disagree with this so like
let me give you an example of okay we'll
use black people okay let's say that I'm
making a video of black people this
would be the equivalent of what he's
doing okay let's look at what people
think of
black people the United States we
they're violent they are
disproportionately represented a crime
spooky music in the background images in
the foreground look at this right in
Charlotte oh look at this right here
let's look at all the black people in
history that have been violent this
violent criminal trial Trayvon Martin
you know and like naming like 15 names
okay cuz he did for the Jewish part
right we know that all of these
different sahjhan etic scientists that
nobody takes seriously all think that um
black people have the warrior gene are
genetically predisposed and then you
spend like ten seconds and then you
spend Lincoln's then you spend it was we
can watch the video if you want he
spends like 10 seconds oh but that's
probably not true they're just they're
just cool people and then he moves on to
the next it really doesn't feel like
that because I mean I watched it and I
was like this is a there was a good like
solid two minutes there but here's the
thing before we do watch it okay uh-huh
going in I'm thinking this guy isn't a
I'm like he's not a someone there's not
there's no way like it makes no sense
based on the conversation of you had
with each other no conversation he's
never gonna tell you that he's
anti-semitic that's something that I
guess yeah I listen this now if we're
exploring the idea we're like everyone
that he's completely dishonest sure but
I'm assuming that he isn't dishonest
because I'm not I have no reason to be
dishonest with me but why will I
honestly say this is the whole reason
this is what's so frustrating by dealing
with skeptic Mooney is that these people
don't operate where they go like oh yes
we want to kill all black people they it
the way that they phrase it is so much
more insidious the phrasing race it's
like they're like it's almost marketable
and this is Riley so much against you
for the comments you made about Spencer
the whole point of rebranding the Nazi
movement into slick speaking awesome
looking dudes that wear suits that are
professional is to make it so their
ideas are presentable so when people
like you are literally tweeting well
Spencer's a really nice dude act like
that's their propaganda working that's
not that's not what I was saying so I
wasn't expenses really nice dude I'm
saying that I could approach Spencer in
an easier manner because of the fact
that he's doesn't seem like he's on like
an 11 every time he looks like he's down
at a [ __ ] 7 like I don't agree with
that it's it's so like I feel like that
was like really taken out of context I
mean like I'm not listen I'm not
accusing you of making a bad faith
argument that's definitely know what I'm
doing okay I'm just saying that like
maybe you're predisposed to think that
I'm just kind of like downplaying his
[ __ ] role
I get what they're trying to do I know
exactly what they're trying to do I'm a
[ __ ] marketer I understand it it's so
easy to tell anybody with [ __ ] like
half a brain can see that they're trying
to be more marketable to this this this
group of like white children that are
like disenfranchised by what the [ __ ]
media is doing but continuously talking
about race issues and it's like they're
losing it and of course they're
capitalizing on that so I see all of
that I'm like but like the idea is that
like I can approach Richard Spencer and
be like I feel like I can talk to him
and be like what are you doing why are
you being like this as opposed to
someone like Tariq machine who literally
will just send spend like a good 20
what's that buddy all right
the other day Jochen stefan molyneux
spoke on stream and he went to the
difference between logical and true
section now and you had a criticism of
his use of the word sound yeah because
it was easy okay
could you pull up the book real quick
why I remember that way what do you want
me to pull up okay that's fine
so Stefan says all men are mortal
Socrates is a man therefore Socrates is
immortal and he says the structure
remains logically sound he doesn't say
the argument is logically sound so he's
not using it in the philosophical sense
that you know like when a philosopher
says an argument is saundra he says that
the premises are true number one and
number two that the conclusion follows
from the premises but he's not saying
the argument is sound he's saying the
structure is logically stop do you know
anything about music
sure yeah really yeah I play guitar do
you know a decent amount of theory yeah
okay let's say that I have let's say
that I have an 80 measure piece okay um
let's say that for some measure okay
let's say that the whole piece is in the
key of C okay but and but in some
measure let's say that we play like like
an F B flat E flat or whatever or
something like real quick right I quit
two five one or whatever right if
somebody were to say it to me like oh
that measure I'm like that's in the key
of that's in the key of E flat right
that phrasing would be very odd and if I
were to hear somebody say that I would
immediately think like okay I understand
what you're trying to say but that's not
really how you would ever say that you
would never describe a quick two five
one as a key change that's just that's
just not what a key changes at all if
you say something is in a certain key
you're very very oftentimes speaking
about the entire piece itself you would
never ever ever refer to a very quick
even if it was a modular well we know a
modulation way but if it was a quick tip
I when you've never referred
is a key change right this is in a
different key does that make sense right
so when you're writing a book on
philosophy one of the most pedantic
things of all time right very semantics
very pedantic very much using the
correct terms right and you are trying
to introduce beginners to philosophy why
would you ever use a word like sound
that has a very very very well
understood meaning to describe something
that is not sound but that the meaning
you're talking about is when you say the
argument is sound yes like when you're
calling that your argument is sound like
do you understand how confusing it would
be to a new person to say like oh this
argument here it's logically sound but
it's not you and I both know Stephane
isn't an academic philosopher first of
all right okay but philosophy is very
rigorous and its usages of terms okay
yes yeah understand is like I'm being
rigorous right now like the way he said
sound is not in reference to the
argument so he's not incorrect even in
like with the definition you and I know
no he's a problem the problem is that
he's not even wrong because he's using a
phrase that doesn't make sense
what is logically sound mean the word he
was looking for was valid that would
that is the word and if you were to go
to bring open a philosophical textbook
they would never define valid as meaning
something that's logically sound
now here's what sound means but not that
sound like that doesn't make any sense
well we can just go off the dictionary
definition of sound I don't care about
the dictionary definition we're talking
about a very well understood
philosophical term yeah if you say the
argument is sound though but why would
you say what is logically something like
if he's what logic is logically sound
he'd be wrong I fully admit but you
didn't say that
hold on let me bring up just so I can
look at the
why would you use the phrase the
structure remains logically sound why
wouldn't you just say the I don't care
about the dictionary definition because
that's not what we're talking about the
point that I was bringing up was that
this guy is like [ __ ] [ __ ] like
why would know like why wouldn't you say
if you'd knew what you were talking
first of all I don't even know what the
difference being logical and true is is
trying to sound like he's trying to talk
about the difference between the
validity and the soundness of an
argument but maybe he's doesn't he's not
aware of that but if sound if of an
argument being sound means a very
particular thing and an argument being
valid it means exactly what he's trying
to say why wouldn't he say this argument
is valid but unseen see that's like
that's my entire no and he uses a bunch
of other words is sown the uses a bunch
of other words that makes me wonder what
if you hit any background in philosophy
then why does he call himself the
leading philosopher who's gonna save
Western civilization don't you think
that's gonna be so [ __ ] enlightened
rogue philosopher but I just don't see
the error he's made like he hasn't said
anything that's just wrong but let's
contextualise this okay the problem is
that he's writing a book that's supposed
to introduce the layman to philosophy
this is why I wasn't ever even gonna
look at this book ever because I looked
at the table of context and he and it
looks like he wants to give like an
intro to philosophy 101 class which is
fine and I okay a section on deductive
reasoning
okay sure yeah this is fine but the
problem is that when you dig into this
you would have to discard everything if
you want it to learn anything about
philosophy you couldn't read this book
you would have to like forget everything
stefan molyneux in the first place okay
but that's like it's very clear that
this is a political book it's not but
but he's just trying to push his agenda
but that's not what he markets that he's
talking about the argument he's talking
about ruthless objectivity
let me read like the for intro the first
thing to understand is that the argument
is everything its civilization its peace
its love its truth and beauty the
argument is life itself like the
argument is a rational map that allows
us to navigate a need in reality it
keeps us sane by reminding us of facts
and reason and evidence
like but it sounds like he wants to give
you a pretty rigorous introduction to
philosophy in some of these like he uses
some words that seem like like if if
we're just going by the definitions of
the words he hasn't said anything wrong
okay I mean if this is how you guys want
to analyze but that but the point is
[ __ ] that the promise that what
you're saying is [ __ ] stupid like
well sound sound and if I would have
described to you right a valid argument
is one whose structure is internally
consistent a sound argument is one whose
premises are correct and then the
conclusion logically follows and then
you were to describe to me an unsound
argument and call it the structure that
is logically sound I would look at you
like why would you use that word that
doesn't call by thousands like it means
in good condition and not damage okay
that's not what structure is not damaged
sound but but sound has a very
particular meaning in philosophy sound
you need something you would never take
something ok but that's the problem
that's the problem that I would the book
is that it presents itself but some type
of intro to philosophy I'm going to
introduce you to my rigorous
understanding of philosophy but then he
doesn't understand very basic this is
one Oh what this isn't even philosophy
101 this is like you go to a wiki page
you to read this in two seconds wait
like my whole point is that he said
nothing factually incorrect okay like it
like an academic could read this and
recognize that he hasn't made any errors
I I don't think so I don't agree but if
you can find somebody like a master he
probably knows somewhat phd's in
philosophy right yeah but most on the
watch game probably hates to fun so you
would argue that they're bias I would
have a very hard time believing that
like a student no philosophy would read
somebody saying that the structure
remains logically sound and they would
go oh he doesn't mean sound in this way
but the way that he said it is okay like
it would because he didn't say the
argument is so but the problem is you're
using in a different context so we have
to assume that he's not using it no why
would you confuse a student that way
like if I would add on to the sentence
the structure remains logically sound
but the argument is not sound that's so
confusing what when we
have words to say this the struck this
argument is valid but unsound that is so
much more clear like oh it's valid
because it's internally consistent its
unsound because the first premise is
false these are words that have very
strict meanings very rigor and well
understood meanings that will be
repeated throughout your entire life of
philosophy people say them over why
would you use logically sound I don't
even know what that phrase moves what is
logically sound are we talking is there
something that's a logically sound why
does he even have logical as a qualifier
it's literally lay fedora tip like what
it's not it he means like when he says
this he's just saying the argument is
valid by the way maybe you know then why
not say valid because it means the same
thing logically sound what is logically
mean what is logic mean here that's a
meaningless word it's a fedora tipper
word the structure remains logically set
what is logic it users that the
conclusion falls from the premises oh
what's the word for that valid hasn't
said anything wrong but okay it's not
even wrong that's the problem is that
it's not really wrong but it's not
saying anything the structure remains
logically sound what that doesn't mean
anything what is logically sound mean
like do your honor there's nothing wrong
with the structure of the argument so
it's Carvalho whether the premise is
right or wrong
yeah how it's valid that's the word
you're looking for logically sound
doesn't mean anything it's wrong it's
stupid it's meaningless to have it
English it's not wrong though it's not
even wrong it's just dumb if you remove
logically the whole sentence falls apart
the structure remains sound that
wouldn't probably be true and logically
it doesn't work what is logically mean
here that to add as a modifier that that
makes sound okay to use here the logic
isn't broken the premise follows from
the conclusion that word is yes that
word is valid I understand but like what
he said isn't wrong what he said is just
a more convoluted way that's not kind of
a large soak but convoluted in a
philosophy text talking about elementary
fundamental terms yes
on there's no academic philosophy you
could at least it's not fine if you
market yourself is like the leading
[ __ ] philosopher and he wants to try
to English yeah he talks about he wants
to challenge and talk about all sir he
wants to engage with the philosophy and
[ __ ] all the time doesn't he have like
are you into like Chomsky or some [ __ ]
on his channel and any any tries to talk
about things like determinism and he
wants to like have like he wants to be
part of like the the philosophy
discussion like how can you engage with
academic literature or how can you
engage but if you don't even know the
vernacular of course you can't engage
with these I'm never gonna be able to
have a have a have an articulate
conversation about high level music
concepts with somebody that doesn't
understand the fundamental uses
philosophy on ustream all your time you
said you've never even taken a class
sure but I do my best to read and get
the basics down so that I understand the
vernacular that every time I have a
discussion on philosophy I get people
emailing me different things like hey
when you use this word may that's why I
know the difference between valid and
sound and I always say when I have
discussions philosophy I'm trying to
speak very carefully if I say something
that isn't ruthlessly correct feel free
to correct me on it this is why I have
tons of conversations on syntax when I
talk about philosophy because it's so
important to get it correct otherwise
you're you're spouting meaningless
statements like logically sound that
don't mean anything so I think under
sense so your gripe is that in the fluff
like in the philosophy community sound
has a certain meaning right yes
we've seen argument is sound that as a
certain meaning yes and we all agreed on
it that it's understood what is Li
throughout all of philosophy yes gotcha
and when Stefan says it it's just wrong
or misleading when he says logically
sound that's a statement that means
nothing if I were to go and open a
dictionary I could probably piece
together what that means yeah but but
that's but that's not we've agreed as a
society like no no no that's not how
that works in any academic thing ever
because you don't call an academic but
philosophy is is a study the study of
philosophy the study of a philosophy is
a thing you never ever ever walk into
any kind of liberal arts class you never
walk into any class we're like your
business teacher right
would you ever walk
like a business class with its where
he's talking about some type of
corporate interchange or I don't know
something and you bring out your
dictionary like well the dictionary
definition is actually like well no in
business we understand it to mean this
or in science we understand this to mean
this or in this winners right in
philosophy the words valid and sound are
understood to mean very particular
things it's not this so to have
elementary discussions on fundamental
philosophy things like a deductive
reasoning or whatever and then to not
know your [ __ ] terms makes me wonder
why you're trying to have this
conversation just move on to the
propaganda or whatever agenda you're
trying to push don't pretend to try to
be talking to people in informing them
about baseline philosophical stuff you
don't understand it all right well I
don't know what to say I still don't
think he's wrong like I I'm being as
rigorous as possible but not even
because if somebody were to say that
something is logically sound and we were
speaking philosophy I would probably
assume that they're using the
philosophical definition of sound the
problem you were being thrown out by the
word logically or like the fedora tip is
working so hard that logically doesn't
mean anything like what I ever say would
I ever use any other thing before the
word sound here it remains a logically
sound it remains rationally sound I
guess as a synonym like what's the point
of putting logically before the word
sound here can I get maybe I'm being too
charitable though like when he says it
remains the structure remains logically
sound I just understand okay that he's
saying let's have a inclusion follows
from let's remain logically here okay
well cuz it's a worthless adjective and
I think you've admitted as much because
you can't tell me why it belongs here
let's say that he said that the
structure remains sound do you think
that's still an OK statement sure yeah
okay if he said the argument was sound I
would have hundred for son agree with
you Stefan would be wrong by saying more
okay
all right any other points any other
point do you want to point out okay no
I'm good I'll everybody
yeah
[Music]
good evening folks and welcome to
everybody coming over from America first
with Nick Jeff went Eze this is of
course James all Sapir on America first
overdrive we have a very special guest
with us tonight it's not not every day
we get to do a debate here but this week
is gonna be full of debates for the
people here over at America first media
me today obviously with destiny and then
Nick tomorrow with will will Chamberlain
debating about Israel but tonight we're
gonna be talking about birth control a
very conscious controversial I should
say topic a very touchy topic for a lot
of people and we're gonna talking about
birth control and whether or not the
government should be subsidizing it so
of course I'm joined here by Steve
destiny how's it going man hey you
pretty good you can call me Stu okay
cool cool cool okay so basically we got
into it a little bit on Twitter and you
know as as people tend to do on Twitter
and we had a disagreement about whether
or not the government this is
essentially for those of you don't know
the backstory on this is the government
or under the Trump administration they
decided to roll back and Obama era
directive that required insurance
companies to cover birth control so
insurance companies and employers could
could agree not to cover it if they
didn't want to if it was a conscientious
objection or something and the Trump
administration rolled back the director
that forced them to cover it so people
been debating about this a lot in over
the past couple days and week on Twitter
what is essentially Steve what's what's
your case for why the government should
be involved in this at all and why
should they be forcing companies to
subsidize birth control so I guess it
just seems like one of the like really
rare scenarios where if we invest in
something almost every single party wins
money is ultimately saved by the state
we reduce the number of abortions we
have lowered numbers of teenagers
getting pregnant the health and back to
women that are prescribed birth control
is oftentimes very positive and it seems
like the alternatives just haven't been
effective in any of these areas like for
instance like abstinence only education
so I guess that my question would be why
can't a insurance company or employer if
they're then providing the birth they're
the ones providing the insurance why
shouldn't they be able to opt out it
seems like to me be for people who have
religious objections it seems like a
rational opportunity for them
it should be something available to them
to opt-out of covering that if they
object to it I don't really I don't buy
the religious objection thing I mean in
society our tax money goes towards
supporting things that you might or may
not have moral objections to for
instance vegans are forced to pay taxes
to subsidize like agriculture and
whatnot you know farm animals and shed
people that ride bikes you don't have to
pay taxes that maybe go towards you know
cars or the automobile industry and
around about--we like I mean we pay
people that are against Wars you know
people that might even dodge drafts or
whatever you know their money is
ultimately goes into the government for
like the war fund and whatnot so the
idea that like because I have a personal
religious belief I disagree with this
thing that has a measurable positive
impact in almost every single way I just
don't really I don't think that's a
legitimate argument against the issue I
feel like that opens a whole can of
worms well you could be morally opposed
to like a tent like should we be able to
opt out of you know funding the military
is that like a thing that you what we
already do allow objections on certain
grounds we allow exceptions for there
are a litany of religious exceptions in
our law that have been supported by the
Supreme Court and actually enshrined by
the Supreme Court for example there was
a case I forget the year there were
several cases actually where people were
using drugs for religious purposes and
they're using peyote was the drug in
question and they are allowed to do so
as part of a religious ceremony there's
religious exemptions to certain to
certain laws and in fact we do allow
conscientious objection to military
service so we already do have this
system in place well who objected things
on religious lines can opt out yeah you
don't you can't opt out of where your
taxes go to right these are kind of
different things like I think religious
institutions can opt out of like certain
types of taxes that they have to pay if
they're recognized as religious but this
is different than like I don't want my
tax money going towards this thing right
these are fundamentally things I don't
think you can like delegate like this is
I want 40% of my tax money to go to this
I don't want any percent to go to the
military like we don't really do that
right now I agree but what's the
question here is whether or not the
insurance companies should be able to
opt out and not pay for the birth
control or whether employers should be
able to opt out of paying for birth
control and it seems like if the
employer is the one paying for it then
they should have the right and the
ability to tell their employees hey
we're gonna pay for this this and this
service but we don't wanna pay for birth
control because we object to it it's
really not even a question of it's not
even birth control specific if they
say hey we don't want to pay for
cosmetic surgery I think they should
have that same right so why is that the
government stopped to intervene and to
intervene in that relationship between
the employer and the insurance company
and the end user of the insurance oh I
might have agreed with this before the
ACA but we're we're being mandated now
to purchase insurance on behalf of
ourselves right the government is
essentially forcing us to do it I think
that the insurance companies kind of
have to fall in line in terms of what
they offer for services also insurance
is oftentimes your access to insurance
can be pretty restricted based on your
job so I'm not sure if that's like a
positive thing right for instance if you
work for a company oftentimes you only
have access to their insurance if they
can tell you what they will or will not
cover that can get like a little strange
I think that in a vacuum I'm a pretty
I'm a pretty free market guy I like
minimal government intervention so in a
vacuum
I can I can kind of see the idea that
well an insurance company shouldn't be
forced to provide any service that they
don't necessarily want to but I'm forced
to buy insurance I have to do it now
under government mandate so if I'm gonna
be forced to purchase insurance and
everyone else gonna be forced to
purchase insurance from you well now
there's gonna have to be some minimum
things that you provide as an insurance
company if you want the all the benefit
of the entire US public being compelled
to buy from you well now you have a
minimum standard of service that you
have to me you've almost become like a
public service at that point sort of and
that makes sense for for you know public
entities with that right with the public
the federal government when they're
providing insurance plans if they are
providing a plans on the exchanges or
whatever do that but but individuals who
go out and choose to purchase a service
or if even better example sticking with
the employer model here an employer you
don't have a right to insurance from
your employer you don't have a right to
be insured by them so if they want to
say hey look we will employ you and give
you insurance as a condition of your
employment
there's nothing then that that they're
not forbidding you from buying other
insurance right they're not saying you
can't buy this other policy you can
still buy that policy if you want or you
can just buy the birth control over the
counter for 30 bucks a month if you
really want to but there's there's
nothing there's no restrictive capacity
that the employer has over you deciding
where to get insurance from they may
offer I think you don't like but
nobody's forcing me to take it I don't
know if I necessarily agree with that
because if you if you have to buy
insurance right you're forced to in the
United States or you pay a penalty that
comes out to be I think it's averaged
out to what the average silver plan or
whatever on your exchange would be right
and also all the insurance riders on the
exchange those are
all federal programs right a lot of
those are private insurers that on that
fact on the on the exchange on the
public exchanges if you have to buy
insurance right and your employee offers
like some type of insurance I mean like
you have to buy something I I just I'm
really uncomfortable with this idea that
the companies are able to tell us that
we have to for it we're forced to
purchase insurance from them but they
can then like neg out on some things
that are so positive like and I don't
know there just seems really weird to me
that um that you could make that
argument I guess like I said I would
agree with you if we weren't forced to
buy insurance but since we're forced to
buy some type of insurance I don't feel
like they should get to pick and choose
what they offer but you just buy the
insurance that offers a better thing and
and the free market will then dictate
that whoever is offering the worst
services whoever is not offering birth
control for example if that is a product
and demand the free market will then
weed them out of competition and they
will not receive anybody signing up for
them this is not really how the free
market works here right there's huge
there's huge market failures in so far
as insurance goes this has been
demonstrated time and time again if you
look at the history the United States
when the biggest market failures
attached to insurance is the fact that
it's like inelastically tied into your
job into your employment this has been
one of the biggest failures of insurance
in like American history is the fact
they are tied to your employer to get
insurance like this is something that I
think should be dissuaded as much as
possible so the idea that somebody has a
job somewhere and can can throw in and
oftentimes you get cheaper insurance
with your job because you're pulled
together right if that insurance is
going to be restricted and now you're
forced to go by other insurance that you
can't really afford I don't I don't
agree that there's gonna be any type of
market pressure there to move people
into doing the right thing because
oftentimes people are always buying
insurance with their workplace like
before the ACA for instance how many
people bought private insurance it
didn't really happen unless you were
incredibly wealthy or self-employed
right you pretty much always bought your
work insurance because it was so much
cheaper because the market just fails
and insofar as providing medical
insurance yeah I suppose that's still
that's still true and and I would agree
with you that the ACA if you're arguing
the ACA is a problem then I would agree
with that I think the solution to a lot
of this stuff and where we could have a
little a better argument is more
principle would be with the repeal of
the ACA because then if you eliminate
that hurdle then you can have a totally
different discussion with area and more
than and again for like for market
principles I I kind of agree with you
but I think that even morally and
ethically I don't know if it would even
be these insurers that should be
doing things like this like restricting
access to burglar we can move on to like
those types of arguments if you want as
well for me personally I'm pro-life and
I'm very budget-conscious I think that
budgets should be balanced when possible
so anytime the state can save money and
we can reduce the number of abortions or
we can reduce the number of broken
families children born out of wedlock I
think that all of those things should be
advocated for and restricting birth
control to people seems to play against
every single one of those points like
demonstrably show like you could show
that like you study after state after
study so it just seems like a weird
stance to take well so the that's a good
good topic to get into is because I
think that we can also separate out the
financial benefits of birth control
which there may be I'm not going to
contest the idea that overall
subsidizing birth control may save the
state money I think that's probably true
but what can you see the save the state
even more money would be things like
forced sterilizations or mass abortion
so if we want to say that that saving
money is the only the only objective
here then I think we get into kind of a
tricky territory no I don't think so
philosophically we don't agree that
these are the same thing though
philosophically so I think I'm more in
the libertarian camp in terms of
philosophy goes we want as little
aggression against the individual as
possible right ready so when you talk
about forced sterilization this is a
highly philosophically aggressive act
could you save money on behalf of the
state by doing it yeah you could save
money on behalf of the state by doing a
lot of things that are very
philosophically aggressive towards an
individual giving somebody the access to
take contraception nobody's being
compelled to take it or force to take it
these two things are very dissimilar I
think right and that's again what I was
getting to is that there are there's a
difference between what is the most
fiscally conservative you could say that
it will save you the most money and what
is ethically and morally correct
although there is a level of force
required when you're saying that
insurance companies and employers have
to be forced to pay for these services
that in that they may not want to
because that implies there some kind of
punishment for them if they don't so
you're you're still you're just
transferring where the force is really
it's not an elimination of force to say
that we're requiring insurers to pay for
these things or requiring employers
maybe sheriff's but again I think I can
make a stronger argument for force on
the side of the insurance companies
because you're forcing me to buy it
right so like if I go on if I go March
on a public street and I say I should be
allowed to have freedom with feature
right I'm forcing you to put up with it
because all of our money goes towards
funding public areas and this is why we
have the right to demand that
you know free speech and all of this can
be advocated for here because we all pay
for it so again with the insurance
companies like UTEP the government is
telling me right now that every single
person in the United States has to buy
insurance if that's the case then fine
but all of you guys now are going to
have to offer what we all agree on as a
society is a baseline of services if
we're gonna be forced to buy from you if
it was all private and companies private
companies or whatever then you can all
do whatever you want but that's just not
the case anymore where we're being Mandy
I have to pay penalty at the end of the
year for not having insurance like not
right yeah I mean but I think that the
the ACA wrinkle is kind of a kind of a
red herring in this in this conversation
right because we're not talking about
what what should be done we're talking
within a very constrained manner about
the the limitations that are being
placed that you know it sounds like that
we don't even both agree with that what
with what the ACA does so you know I
have an issue with that of course the
ACA but anyway so let's talk more about
the the birth control itself let's talk
more about birth control as a product
now you mentioned on Twitter and a lot
of people have also mentioned on Twitter
that birth control is something that is
used by people not only to to act as a
contraceptive but also as a manner of
eliminating you know irregular periods
of you know controlling flow etc of acne
is another hormonal agent you know well
that it's true I think that there are
other alternatives that can be used
there that don't necessarily require
they don't require employers or
insurance companies to pay for and to
subsidize birth control which they still
may find morally objectionable so I
don't see birth control as the only
option in these cases and that's in fact
Barb's many options that work even
better than well but that's not true and
why does your opinion there matter like
birth control is well no no that's but
no that's not the medical community's
opinion right for PCOS for the
polycystic ovarian syndrome birth
control is the leading lead prescribed
thing for things like issues with
regular periods acne menstrual cramps
things like that birth control is the
leading prescribed thing like in the
medical community that's that is the
most often prescribed thing to deal with
these issues
so I mean you might think that there are
other ways to deal with it and that's
fine but that's not what the medical
community thinks why would why would
anybody adhere to the opinions of some
people with more
from on medical grounds that seems like
a strange well no there are side-effects
though there are our alternatives to
treat those things
the PCOS I agree with you the birth
control is the best way to treat it but
the other hormonal irregular
irregularities for example there are
other ways to treat that that don't have
the same side effects as birth control
birth control is associated with things
like weight gain its associated with
depression there are a lot of links that
that are not often publicized that birth
control can actually a very detrimental
health effect well so and everything is
publicized birth control is very heavily
studied in the US the idea that there
are secret side effects aren't
publicized is not true right no but it's
not talked about it's not it's not put
I'm sure it's talked about if you of
course if you're a woman and you go and
you talk to your OBGYN they're gonna
give you this is why there are different
types of birth controls available not
everybody is on oral contraceptives some
people get an IUD
some people go low hormone some people
this is why I kind of railed you when
you tweeted out that $9 generic crap and
you said look birth control only nine
dollars
birth control is very very unique to
every single woman this is why you have
a conversation with your caretaker and
you decide which birth control is best
for you oftentimes women will switch
between oral contraceptives one may not
work as well as another a generic brand
might not have the same in actives that
affect you in a different way that the
name brand will write there are tons of
different types of birth control are
there side effects to some of course but
these aren't secret and even though the
side effects exist doctors still are
leading recommending the birth controls
for things like PCOS and other types of
okay I'm in here poor and crime-ridden
what do you want to Merc Merc ablator oh
[ __ ] about you what do you want to
debate about dog
I honestly wanted to make like the I
wanted to make the issue
cuz I heard you were good from a friend
oh [ __ ] a debating yeah so little what
about oh it's up to you really
well I mean it's up to you up to me yeah
well you're the guy that came here right
so we're gonna be up to you okay so I
was I said I said we could debate about
we could bait about how the black
community brings most of their the the
issues upon themselves sure really
okay let's do that one racism yeah sure
okay let's do it how do you think the
black community brings racism on itself
by as a community uh-huh I'm like I'm
not gonna say a majority but a good
amount of the black community actually
commits harmful acts to other other
other people and the the other people
could be in the black community or not
okay so I give this could be like any
race so you think so just the black
community brings issues onto itself
because a lot of black people kill a lot
of other black people and white people
and why sometimes okay if I rephrase
anything you say I'm just trying to
understand your argument so if I say
anything incorrect feel free to tell me
that you don't agree with my
interpretation right okay so why do you
think more black people kill black
people and white people than white
people kill white people and black
people
what was the question why did why do
more black people kill black people and
white people why black people more
violent than white people
I couldn't say really well they just are
do you think it's like do you think it's
like a song do you think it's like a
socio-economic thing you could say that
I mean that is the cause really if if
you have to boil it down to something
but it isn't it isn't something that
that is not avoidable it's the issue oh
sure I mean technically is it's totally
avoidable well maybe but if we pin it on
socio-economic issues and we know it
Saints intrinsic to black identity we
can kind of say that black people out of
much different socio-economic start in
the United States than white people
right mm-hmm
and it's mostly not necessarily black
people's fault that they had that start
right no it isn't how do we blame black
people for causing black problems
because it's a choice is why you blame
them it is a choice if you have to I
mean when somebody does something
whatever it is good or bad it's always a
choice okay who you think has a higher
likelihood of choosing to invest in a
Roth IRA up to the federal government
maximums every year it's to maximize
their retirement potential somebody
that's born into a wealthy middle or
upper class but it was born into what
yeah sure so if our choices on it that
doesn't mean that that doesn't mean that
they couldn't it's just a choice
yes you're not talking about likelihood
well I mean that's that's a cop-out
really they can I do it really they just
don't is it yes it is it's only since
it's only statistics it doesn't it
doesn't define what you can do in your
life really no but I mean like we can
point to like probabilities like yeah
but probabilities only those they're
only probable it's not what's going to
happen it's not what you can make happen
right Shh
not necessarily it is I mean if we as a
race of human beings the the choice in
most
tuitions is really would defines us as
human beings sure I in terms of speaking
to an individual like I don't disagree
with you if I was talking to an
individual like I would tell you to do
what you can don't be a victim of your
circumstances you know try to make as
much out of your life as possible but
when looking at like all of society we
can kind of accept that statistically
speaking certain people will act in
certain ways right that it would be
pretty extraordinary for somebody born
in a multi-million dollar family to
become a crackhead that is homeless
right that would require extraordinary
circumstances right yes much the same
way that somebody that's born into a
crackhead single-parent family would
require extraordinary circumstances to
become a multimillionaire
right yes so I mean if we can point to
kind of like these generalities it seems
kind of strange to say that every single
person in a certain circumstance could
rise above like that just seems like
really extraordinary to me like that you
could say every single person born in
these circumstances that leads to all of
these like pretty are you saying it's
unlikely or it's undoable I'm saying
that it's unlikely statistically
speaking it's but that's not the issue
here well but it kind of the issue is
choice it's not the issue is choice they
have a choice they just don't take it
but is it reasonable to expect every
single person that's born into these
types of environments to make the
correct choices to become like
middle-class well-off people is that a
reasonable expectation reasonable or
possible it's not is it yes it's
possible what this is not really a
matter of a reason but as it never
happened in all of human history like
when in all of human history has there
been like a whole class of poor people
who are like I'm gonna make better
choices and then all of them became
human history is not that old so I mean
it's not it's not something that
couldn't happen that's the issue okay
well in the thirteen thousand years of
human history spanning multiple
civilizations it seems like that's never
happened so wouldn't it make more sense
to do things that we kind of know work
rather than hoping that something
happens that has never happened before
it's not a hope so you're saying they're
saying that like the people who are in
these situations
don't have a hope to change their
situation which they do well the pair
there are alternatives there are
alternatives to committing violent eggs
to get money depending on your situation
though it might be very very very easy
to do that and so yeah and that's the
issue it's easy I agree so we would want
to give them environments where it isn't
easy to make those choices
rather than expect that they're and that
is why it depends on what specifically
you're talking about I mean access to
higher quality education access to
better jobs better doesn't make it does
that make it less possible to commit
these acts yeah I would say no so I'm so
somebody like me or somebody that goes
like a private schools probably never
gonna be a drug dealer right oh you bet
you agreed to this proposition earlier
right somebody born to a multi-million
dollar family is never gonna be a
crackhead right or they could be but it
would be extraordinary for them to wind
up in that situation right yes it'd be
unlikely yeah but somebody born to like
a single parent crackhead household
probably is a much higher chance of like
being a drug deal or something just by
virtue of circumstances right do you say
one more time sorry Oh somebody somebody
born to like a single parent crackhead
family with crackhead friends in a
shitty city with like [ __ ] jobs and the
public school is falling apart like this
person is a much higher chance of
turning to something turning to some
kind of crime right because it's just
it's the easiest thing right right but
it's still a choice though it is it
doesn't stop becoming a choice you're
saying you're good I mean you're the
probability in these situations is not
high but it's still a choice so the
problem is that you ever play like any
role-playing games or anything like that
I like about I like a lot of those dude
okay so like you say this word choice
and when you say the word choice it
sounds to me like you're making a choice
sound like a 50/50 thing it either
happens or it doesn't but the choices
that we make in life are very heavily
weighted which you seem to kind of agree
with but maybe not really yeah so like
for instance the multi-millionaire
choosing to become a crackhead this is
like a less than 1% this is very very
very very difficult this choice he would
have to [ __ ] up monumentally right
whereas a poor person
depending on the depending on the
environment how [ __ ] their environment
is choosing to avoid all crime choosing
to booze through higher education
choosing to you know get out of the
ghetto and you know move into middle
class whatever these are very very very
difficult choices to make these aren't
50/50 choices like well I just have to
choose to be a good person and that's
fine I can just do that like it's gonna
be really difficult choices to make no
yes but does that stop them from being
choices though no no I mean like we
don't but like reasonably speaking like
we it's I don't think it's reasonable to
expect to hold good people to make very
easy very difficult choices it's not
it's not about it's not about how's that
unreasonable because we don't expect
anybody else to do whatever you're
placing an undue burden on it on a whole
class of people you would never place on
another group of people but this is it's
required it's it's it has to be done
though you understand that right
well I it doesn't stop it doesn't stop
it from being their fault they have a
choice it's just a harder choice which
no matter how much like how fair that
doesn't sound very fair I mean to some
extent we have some responsibility for
our choices but like there are people
that are born in a circle you get put in
a bad situation
uh-huh and you decide not to get out is
that the person who put you into the
situation is it that is it that person's
fault that you don't decide to get out
we can we can share responsibility on
whose fault it is but like I mean the
like the punishments aren't equal for a
bad decision is like if I go if I Drive
100 miles an hour and I get a speeding
ticket like I can pay it and it doesn't
bother me at all it doesn't matter but
if somebody else you know that's like
super [ __ ] somebody living
paycheck-to-paycheck gets a speeding
ticket that could be like three months
of their life [ __ ] up no because they
got a really bad speeding ticket like
when you say like make good choices or
or like you know like well whose fault
is whatever you know like if you if
you're born into a really good situation
you can make a lot of bad choices and
still be okay whereas if you're born
into a really [ __ ] situation [ __ ]
one bad choice can end your life right I
look at like recidivism and prisons for
instance if you've got a [ __ ] if you've
got a rap sheet right if you've got a
criminal record like damn that [ __ ] so
much of your life up right there that's
why so many people are repeat offenders
right
so it just seems like telling a whole
group of people to just make better
choices when you never shoulder that
burden on anybody else and then
expecting them to be able to do it
successfully that just says who else who
else should be but it's their it's their
burden the shoulder though you know that
right no I don't agree with that I'll
shoulder some of it if I can with the
form of tax money or [ __ ] what I
don't know any other policy way or
whatever we can help out that's fine but
you're not though the majority of people
are not are not you so why we have
government policy of force people that
like the mandate but it's not it's not
reasonable to actually enforce a policy
to help those people I think it's a lot
of people would not okay but most people
don't agree with you I think that's what
the political debate is about right look
at something like the Affordable Care
Act right like why like why should I
have to pay for a type 1 diabetics
treatment like let's do diet 20 like
it's not my [ __ ] problem right I mean
I could make that argument but I think
as a society we're okay with all
shouldering some of the burden to make
all of society better off right and in
ways that help all of us because it's
better to do that than have a bunch of
random people dying you know no I think
it's I think maybe it's it's close to
50/50 on that to be honest with you well
yeah right now Mike I'm not I'm not I'm
not one person I'm not a person who
talks to a lot of people huh so you know
I'm not I'm not hip on how people feel
like most like the actual majority but I
know how in my group of friends how
people feel and in a group of friends
it's 50/50 sure
and I could even buy that I guess if you
go by like presidential election results
maybe you can say it's like 50/50 but I
mean that's that would be a argument
that I would try to make you don't want
to be the king of ashes right you want
to be part of a civilization where
everybody is doing well gives you access
to better employees gives you access to
better job markets better markets to
sell goods to like it just seems to make
everybody better off right you know I'm
sorry I just
people texted me I'm getting distracted
I'm listening
no problem you say that last part one
more time so like if everybody in your
city is doing well then everybody else
in your city will do well as a result
right you've got more customers to sell
things to more employees to hire
hopefully that's how it's that
it's set up but not necessarily well
yeah necessarily would you rather set up
a business in like Lithuania or a
business and you know San Francisco if
you've got the ability to write you've
got a much better customer yeah in
California because that is and what you
just said you said if you have a place
that is doing well is just gonna be
doing well like across the board well
yeah so like we'll take my city for
example all right oh yeah I can use a
personal sample right in my city West
middle and West is all white people rich
people south is Hispanic people north is
black people north part of the city
always has the worst crime it's pretty
it's a [ __ ] pretty much the housing
is worth [ __ ] businesses they're all
stuck or police spent all of our time
there right now it's easy for the mid
middle and the western people and even
the Hispanics don't say [ __ ] them and
let them deal with their own problems we
don't care but if the northern part of
my city it was doing better if I was a
constructor I'd be able to build better
houses out there if I was opening up a
business downtown I would be able to
hire people from from North Omaha and
have more employees to choose from if I
wanted to start a business
I could go to North Omaha and open a
business right if these if this part of
the city was doing better everybody
would have more opportunity to make
money from them opportunity right but
what happens if people just don't take
those opportunities well I mean I
believe in the power of the free market
capitalism so I think people would take
advantage of those opportunities but
they might not go right well III think
they would I'm a capitalist so I mean
that's what I believe I understand I
understand but they might not what if
their culture says they they don't of
their culture says that they shouldn't
well sure I mean these are things that I
guess like behavioral economics tries to
address I gif that but I don't believe
that that culture of intense racism
still exists in the United States such
that somebody wouldn't open a business
in North Omaha I guess I'm saying what
if what if somebody opened a business
uh-huh
that somebody who was impoverished could
work it but their culture dictated that
they not but I don't know hmm and this
is my issue we're an impoverished black
community
this is the issue the main issue is that
culture dictate that you know we have a
web but it wasn't just about culture
right we kind of step back with us like
why is black culture worse than white
culture what's the reason
what's the reason honestly it's the it's
the the way that you earn money is
important okay really
and some ways of earning money are not
as accept accepted in the black
community in other ways do you really
think well okay so why why because it's
more it's more I don't want to say
reputable but it's more like I'm not
sure how to phrase this except for
reputable but it's not where it is why
is it more revenue so like I'm trying to
get back to like do you think it's why
because because in the eyes of their
peers it's better to not do those things
okay but why do they don't they don't
over white people I'm not sure they
don't they don't they don't actually see
the the like maybe they don't see like
the benefits that they can actually get
by not by by accepting these
opportunities right sure but I don't
think that they don't see I think they
just choose not to see they choose not I
think they do see in the black community
they just opt out okay but if you give
black people access to good education
decent families you get people like
Barack Obama or any other like wealthy
black person like do you think that
given like ample education and financial
opportunity and vocational opportunity
right good jobs that they would make
better choices typically what do you
think that like people that are born to
like you know decent off black families
will go and be drug dealers I'm sorry I
won't um do you think that like I'm
sorry that's a guy dealing that people
that are born into like well-off black
families will run off to become like
drug dealers er no but that isn't the
