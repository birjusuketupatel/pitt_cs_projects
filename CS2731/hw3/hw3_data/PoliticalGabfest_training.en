looking for political benefit
the last minute addition to obscure i want to be happy new year
all we have been with you for two weeks
john dickerson for two weeks but here he is john
gave his face the nation although i must say people feel like they've been with us
maybe even more deeply them for sense of the response to the conundrum show has been really elemental elemental what conundrum most spoke to people that you heard about i heard from somebody who
she would plot on on a different side of the ideological spectrum from you but who found themselves constantly agreeing with you called you even their spirit animal so i just know i'm just saying i may not have been one individual element of the conundrum show but the entire thirty
that that listener you just know that as your spirit animal i am wearing a tale a very very party until also joining us hello emily basil on of and you're kind of magazine in new haven
hello and happy new year happy and they have added southern beginning again
did you guys have a great holiday
i saw an average family
like
you are cold part of the country and so they have any aspirin not was really very free thing but i still managed to that side which are great actor
once i will cherish those the called on this week scan first that the the you they've been the late for feud exploding between president trump and its former spend golly steve ban and then more twists and turns and swerved and you turned and the rush it investigations
talked about all of them
and then a new report says that fake news does not exist right emily we will talk about that know it didn't really say that but it says it doesn't matter where maybe it is even say that anyone will even be about faith in may not even in this cattle future it may just have been a facebook posting about hillary clinton's one point eight billion
dollar house that she was building which is true
plus what of cocktails chatter and and sleet plus we're going to discuss if college is worth anything if it good for anything so slight plus members get additional bonus segment for free but you can get it by going to sleep dot com slash can of first plus to sign up for slate plus
so we learn some really interesting things this week learned that was an air quotes
don't did not want to win the presidency and didn't expect to win the presidency jared kushner vodka trump have a packed in which only one of them can run for president and it will be her steve ban in called the meeting in which done at junior brought some russians and to trump tower treason us and unpatriotic and then said
quote they will crack down junior like an egg on national television
donald trump's own best friend as well as rupert murdoch are quoted as calling him an idiot or maybe a fucking idiot
i may be fucking stupid i can't remember exactly what the phrase was but you get the tenor of it donald trump responded to a suggestion that point john bain earth as chief of staff by saying who's that who's john boehner these revelations or perhaps something or other in michael wolf's wolf's new book about the dawn of the term presidency fire and
fury have prompted an enormous an incredible response
the first response is come from donald trump himself who wrote exceedingly angry
note about steve ban and saying that when steve ban and lost his job he lost his mind
steve then and then also lost his funding for the mergers had been funding has bright bird operation and then there's been a lot of discussion about whether what wolf is reported is even possibly true it
the quotes accurate are these competitions conversations that could really have occurred to trump really see the things that he attributed in this book so john dickerson first of all should we believe this book
going to get her no context for michael wolff and his reputation right not to interrupt yeah sure let's get that for john should we believe this book
emily i'll leave emulated to offer the context because i think
well i'll leave it to her so
i think there very individual details on it it's interesting i think what might be able to say about this book is what i often feel like is possible to say about president trump and his connection with his voters which is the facts may be in dispute but the truth of it is right
which is that the president supporters often said i don't care of that he doesn't tell the truth or is just gets facts wrong there is a thrust of him that i like that i want to correspond to and align myself with and i think this book represents a description of a white house in chaos
whipsawed buddy the impulses if the president and in which there's a lot of back stabbing front stabbing rake stepping
our should say stepping on breaks that all has been fleshed out he and other accounts
i certainly know it from my conversations with people in the white house and people who have witnessed the white house there are appointed moments which are interesting and we should talk about by while we assess those we need to also recognize that this does echo a lot of other things we've heard and also in the response to add both in the response to the book and to
ban the impulsive
kind of chaotic response in which the president says you know about steve ban and
what did you say steve van and has nothing he has nothing to do very little to do with our historic victory owner know that but they but he start he he he said it it beginning of that statement said steep and it has nothing to do with me or my presidency and that odyssey isn't true
and so and then he says a variety of other things in both the statement about ban and in and the white house statement about the book that aren't true that if they aren't directly to their massively distorted span all of which echoes in apart what is described in the block
which is a white house in which the president creates and a campaign which he creates his on reality and in which advisers to shape that reality go through an extraordinary series of back bands and
rivers in that context it's it feels a piece of what we've come to understand that the trump white house like and then we have to assess those individual stories some emily
what makes you doubt about the veracity of particular stories in this so my go off has a reputation for taking quote from getting accused of not having them on the record and ranks and a floating your party and talking to people and gossipy ray recreating full if you were there so i don't know
i said i feel like i'm not binary in the read really trust our right scene setting part of bad but the notion that people are turning on the champ administration and aren't aren't themselves and being brutal and their discussion interact little how will handle the beginning of the presidency scene and right
for the moment at least that's what we got this
at in the that a brawl episode and right about running reality t we shall return returned administration
state than this are carry all
it's puzzling think it's going to have a big great but the president and of course they're going to get back together at father later and it just seems so ginned up like both true and also overwrought john
do you think that this is as them says just another episode and that that bannon and trump will be the fifth one of these days
or is it is split that has actual significance by the political or emotional i think the ban and trump part of it is actually the least interesting i think that the the these two figures don't follow the normal patterns of of human relationships of politics of public life so they
bounce in and out of both affection and antipathy what strikes me about this book is the central claim from wolf is that
people are right around the president are i think he says one hundred percent certain that he cannot do the job there are people who privately or on the president sod some of whom were standing behind him at the tax cuts ceremony the white house testifying to what an extraordinary president he is
if that trend continues and day it comes to pass that people decide this is true and that he cannot do the job i'm not saying it is true but if it comes to pass that it is true and there are those who has sold privately that it is true how will they have going to work out for them that they had this feeling about the president and they didn't do anything
about it either
worked inside the white house or publicly on the other hand if this is being said about the president and it's not deserved then it's and then we shouldn't be taking what wolf is writing as gospel nobody should want this kind of thing to be seen as gospel because you can basically smear a person and a white house because people just have an appetite for the
yes
well although it's very intimate have any countervailing evidence that he is up to the job there's nothing that he's done there's nothing that he said there's nothing is written there's no stories that are told about him privately by anybody that suggests just so that goes back to my first the first of the two options that i presented which is if that's the case
then there are a lot of people who had first hand
witness of this who are in congress with the leaders of congress and who have chosen not to doing it well yeah i mean it does seem like our readers of congress should be the most optimal crock as now watching us and yet they have their own political calculations to make sell when you look at of
public and political dimension of death that and has been trying to play a role in republican primaries riot and terrifying of the republican party the idea was that rape art was a kingmaker like rape or got behind certain people this is certainly true about that rise of jeff sessions and made a differ
friends and their profile and and are signaling the right wing populism that was helpful to chop it doesn't look like grape or with a drying that support i mean it was like credit tame and rape dot com has all this book nonsense was breaking so maybe it fell through to be a kind of paper tiger
at this point
republican establishment was rejoicing on on wednesday night is all this was coming out senators were saying right on and mitch mcconnell with saying that trump or is exactly right and denounce denunciation of ban and etc does any of that matter
well the split in the party that by the way gave rise to trump in the first place doesn't go away because of this episode that's why i think longer lasting part of it's interesting about this book is know whether it's true or not wolves claim that the president who used to repeat stories over thirty minutes now repeat them in course of five minutes
and there's a lot in the book that is that goes to this growing question about his competency and that's gotta be again of question first raised most prominently by the chairman of the senate foreign relations committee the claim is it used to be trump is always somebody who talked about himself told stories about himself and they would repeat cycles of thirty minutes and now it's their repeat
i'm also a five minute suggesting some mental compromise that society and then
that's the suggestion of the book and there are a number of suggestions
a hollywood reporter
excerpt of the reporting on the book because the book itself hasn't actually come out yet so there was the new york magazine piece that was an excerpt of the book then there's been reporting about the book and this i'm getting from a hollywood reporter reported that the book so there are claims in the book on this front
was one line i read the other day
talking about the immediate disassociated people have made with ben and the the glee that you talked about with a republican senators the fact that the mercer scene or maybe deep defending him and they take that series of events to signal
to to argue that this shows why it's so hard for anyone to bring drinks break ranks and the republican party that as soon as you do any rank breaking you are exposed to a loss of income a lot of support that that it's become a party which has only allows a certain limited
of views and they require full throated support of the president and all times and that you can't be an iconoclast doesn't seem right to you
narrow reading and the then and is an exceptional figure i mean bad oh weird ways like a firecracker going off and brian who felt like why would it be a good idea for hadn't savings incredibly and something and demeaning things about people on the president family to that wine
that lot of
you know rather than layers trials harder were happens to be also lawyer
a higher tech hello gawk are in sending cease and desist letters and ban and and got confidentiality clause and sign when he trying to counter pain i have no idea whether that contract surprised that and service in the white house as a person that campaign but we'll just have this specter or here i don't understand this particular ask
back bannon because it just seems like not and his interest except that it gets him a lot of attention and maybe he is just as to bad as donald trump as right and conveys he said he said
street fighter take no prisoners says what's on his mind
person which people has in the president's case elevated in the priority list of personal attributes above above all others one of the things that steve ban and is quoted on the record as saying in the book is this stuff about the about done junior and treason and that meeting that he took with a lawyer who
is represented as having dirt on hillary clinton and represented as coming from the russian government and in saying that that meeting was treason is at the same time the president saying this is a witch hunt there's no proof of collusion to have a quote from his former chief strategist saying that they should have taken it to the f b i is a significant development yeah that's the part i don't get him
on the safety bad and really really despise yeah any vodka and i can see the parochial called half in going after that and is like a global but
the invasion of treason sealed
yes the fact when the self destructive part surprised me
it it is a little bit battle of stalingrad here like you want everyone to lose jared and avant can really seem appalling then and it's appalling they're all appalling trump is obviously the most appalling and all but it's it's a battle and which all sides should should come out good and bloodied and with their population starving that would be better
the
one thing that i know this isn't really question it's just a weird phenomenon of the trump administration
is how many narcissus there are who are part of this administration when you think about it scare me
the carter page ban and trump himself these are people who are court region
clinical narcissistic and i don't recall that it's been a phenomenon of other white house which i guess because people tend to be more public service mind in the matter with the trump the administration
it does seem to mean remarkable in there have been people will for henry kissinger i think as a raging artist and certainly had to find career as a white house advisor brilliant
predominantly there had been in the absence of marriage
the ratio of rip but the ratio of narcissus to to regular people and the tramp administration too much higher than any administration i can recall before
can i go back to a point on i think we're making earlier which really about the president and bring with them at twenty fifth amendment we haven't been top ryan i've done this show that much money and that meant that other commentators have been wondering about it for a while and it's not the most clearly and straightforwardly written
part of the constitution i would argue but it does make found her measurements for gearing with a disability and the president and i've been reluctant to see it as a real honor
i like escape route for the country because it has a kind of era of a cool about it and one imagine that it was written
in a coma but
was after way one imagine in fact it was so i don't know how you would apply it i still feel that way about as president the twenty of them and and created after woodrow wilson collapsed in pueblo colorado and lift the last seventeen months of his presidency basically with his wife running the presidency and he
recovering from actually didn't collapse i think he had the stroke after he left the stage but so is you say it does seem like it's something for where they're physically incapacitated
and one of the river i've been thinking that is it seemed like a lot of president it's mental attributes were extremely clear vividly floor agree upon asked when he was elected and so that makes it harder to make the argument that anything has really changed but i suppose what you said about like a thirty minute versus five minutes psychotherapeutic star
might suggest otherwise
and also because people were rolling out the twenty fifth amendment
on your emptiness say overstating the getting no longer
and so which has always been the argument against hyperbole from second one because then if you have a case in which people who i mean in this case wouldn't emily it i mean it would require buy in from republican leaders which is also the other robbie so huge hurdle here
essentially it relies on the vice president to ram and we've just again we should know we've just seen the greatest collective affirmation of the president's skills
and talons by both by the vice president by the majority leader by though
well basically the entire leadership of the house and senate on the republican party just publicly testified not just to the greatness of the tax cut but specifically the talents of the president the sustain talents the in public and private of his office
so that always happens when dictatorships right before the coup
the very sick offense the courtiers know the ones who end up
doing the doing the dirty deed anyway so i wouldn't wait but that may much on the their public statements as matter if and decided they want to do it i don't think an advantage
the way that the data make pants frets it's going to be scary to watch it happen
like it's going to feel like a dictatorship it's gonna be like you know newspeak like make a will and we're in the syntax we're in the lymph nodes and a half we are nearing the end of escort but since we in that lamb
that's the sound of the testicle limb and which things won't come to pass happen
don't you think emily that because the barriers are so high as they rightfully should be to overturn the will of the people that were it to come to pass the ascension by the vice president would almost be pro forma because what whatever will have happened will have been so public and so hand forcing that
that it actually that it will be just like okay everybody goes through the steps i mean and it would require a president
let's take it outside of the specific for a moment in a situation in which the president's party controls both houses of congress it will require a president to actually collapse and be medically
could diagnose i think the bigger question is can they figure out a way not to get him to run for a second term so that a the country doesn't have to suffer through this be he doesn't have to continue to a job for which you obviously have a quick and see they don't have to be strapped him and twenty twenty which i don't think they
want to be that's the hard part when you're dealing with somebody who isn't narcissistic and ego driven is trumpets can can he be veered on to another course
because they're not they are not going to question they're not going to depose play

the russia investigation or investigations swerved and veered again over the past several weeks reports suggest to the house
inquiry into russian election meddling is nearing some kind of conclusion with huge divisions between the committee republicans or democrats and the possibility of to reports been issued one of the huge divisions is over the question of whether as the republicans would like to whether to focus on
misdeeds of democrats are possible misdeeds of the f b i and of course if it's own investigation is whether that should be a focus that's one big question their other big questions about whether all the when witnesses have been talked to and subpoenaed meanwhile we have an overall stepping up of attacks on the f b i from some republican
and stepping up of attacks on the independence of robert moeller there appear to be efforts to undermine mahler's steep investigation to the trump campaign
and then a third sort of threat of all of this is there now new york times is reporting that the impetus or one original impetus for the f b i a few should trump appears to be the loose lips of george papadopoulos who drunk blob the to an australian diplomat about dirt that the term campaign had on
from russians about the clinton campaign
so in the point of this papadopoulos mine if it encounters the the previous argument that servers were making that it was this democratic funded steel dots that had instigated f b i interest anyway there a lot of different threads going on here emily any one of which you pull and you end up
three weeks later
drunk in new mexico like unsure where you got there how you got there and with a body of a dead russian agent line on top of you so or as i like to call it the weekend
so what why is this house investigation wrap up why is that important why does it matter there's so many other investigations why does it matter that the the house investigation is wrapping up quickly and there's some disagreement over it i mean it's an embarrassment for our as stands
that's not credible jaw dropping back and this question which you know should not be drenched part is then division that is about whether the russians never been more action and how safe are electoral process as a real old for acts time not spent just absurd
by that's fine that seems like devon in california congress man who has been in particular are re obstructionist and impossible in august at one point he is anger and ethics investigation under any was clear and he never really gave up and told me it just seems like an embarrassment all around and adam shephard ankle democrat has tried
hard to at least make public and transparent
is not during but it just seems as i myself were given up on it more and more her at are running feel that if we're ever going to really understand what happened is gonna be hard like robert our and
has continued to work and every day that i wake up and he lost his job as a good day and right i don't know what he going to find and i think it's i don't care whatever it is i just want to finish but it is very hard to imagine that private i'm trapped as gonna rat robert mahler and day numbers and his family and
one theory that is a palpably on the table now these committees we're supposed to deal with the question of russian interference in the election how it happened how to stop it from happening where the failures were in the intelligence committee so that's one substantive part of the work that they were supposed to do which separate and apart from the investigated part
is really important and if they don't do that is a real failure because you have that's one in which you have this bipartisan consensus that it needs to be done
then you get to the political question which is to have they been doing and are they even able to do the kind of investigative work that this requires which was always
trouble troubling because these are not investigators and sell it it was always going to be difficult to send it's doing a better job than the house but i feel like i come back to a point i was making in the previous conversation which is at the end of the day there is going to be muller's going to produce something and that will be the fact record against
which the performance of the congress will be measured and so both the specific members of the committee who said and believes in various things will have something against which to measure and their leaders who allow them to do or not do what they're supposed to do in these
in these committees will be on the hook for not letting them go forward and finding true wrong doing or laden go too far because mother comes out and says well there's nothing here there's gonna be a day of reckoning why do you guys think
both have you discussed what is the critical issue
in this investigation or all these investigation which is that you have a hostile foreign government engage in what appears to be an incredibly successful campaign to disrupt mislead propagandize confuse interfere with the integrity of an american election and
completely independent of any possible collusion that there might have been between present terms campaign and any russians there's very little doubt that this was an enormous effort by a hostile foreign government which has had a cascade of really detrimental effects on american democracy
and it is sad
and i don't think this is just the republicans
playing possum on i also feel like democrats because if so focused on collusion have also had bear some culpability here it is really sad that there isn't a deeper national outrage and consensus and work to try to understand what was done and fight what was done and ensure that doesn't happen again and that the these all these investigations have lost
last the trail which is that that is the path that's the thing they should care about why do you think it is that they've done such a poor job of interesting american than even interesting themselves
in this fundamental question because there was no way to talk about that but didn't make president trump interact and angry bear and a cane a questioned integrity and legitimacy and his electoral victory which had their things the most driven at our republicans are spa
farming time had no way to ask those questions that felt reddit great faith to them and sell it in math fan and i guess you can throw over democrats under the bass chair for obsessing over courage and but i don't really think that's right the main shell here
i wonder about is whether
every election is different and guess the russians will be back as i think james clapper was famously said but they'll be back in some different way that the technology morphs and that what just as important as understanding what happened is figuring out what they're likely to do next one thing that bothers me tremendously is that no
nobody's really talk seriously or maybe that's an exaggeration but i don't see on the horizon legislation about trying to change the way political ads online are regulated which seems like such a key part of this that all of this on some of it was fake postings but some of it was paid for advertising met wasn't subjects any of the room
we have for political ads
those sorts of things kind of swirling around or what bottom me the most about us
i have three things
first is the topic that nice story gonna do your point do that of sums what the president still is reluctant to admit i'm rushing which denies which is that the republicans the russians were actively trying to push this dirt on ritalin which later came out through wiki leaks we also know that from home the meeting
we have strong evidence that that was the that they were trying to find him and true point in this meeting a trump tower with the president's son so in addition the other things that the bump it up his story in the new your time shows including by the way the other thing that it shows that there are some conflict between the new york times reporting at the time which said there was no evidence of any connection between
trump campaign and russia now they're near times reporting that the f b i did have that have that evidence and was and was curious about it and investigating it and that's now peasants in part where we are today but that's one thing about that story is that it shows that this was in fact the russians were up to this not that we need any more evidence of that based on the months and months and
in which intelligence officials past and present have had present have claimed that but it's just learning this piece of the story tells us that other thing i think emily's right about the collusion and the you're both right actually there has been an excessive focus on collusion in kind of sloppy way you know the obstruction story has police to me been
dynamic and more explosive because it's the one in which the president plays a role nobody's ever put the president in the center of the drama on the collusion question and the final point i would make it and will maybe we should just wait and talk about this in the next topic but i guess i'll do that oh wait till the next to a certain point when everybody why we know they're they're going to have to wait no but she
she has a response to perception of the things we can forget about money laundering because both and papadopoulos story and and other writing this week and then paul man for discussion and what's going on money laundering is looming large that's also true about the michael wolff and the ban a trial but this investigation is about
and that is the kind of thread that could be playing on where they're reporting a subpoena deutsche bank records that is a tantalizing peace and best it's just that seems like a direction in which this investigation can go that could forget the president
jared kushner and donald trump junior who knows but
oh hey a tantalizing out there to be a two two points on that one the money laundering of course makes sense because they didn't expect to win the election if you don't expect to win the election for them bleed planning for what you're going to get out of having run
do know that trump is constantly looking to gain some kind of edge there and money laundering getting himself advantage on some sort of deals is presumably think you would look for one point i want to make about the papadopoulos story overall and the and how it connects to the collusion allegations which is if they were colluding
and i think they were i think they were think it's such a bad job
which is that you have this kind of know nobody nick
papadopoulos going he let's not that's a little two months on the ben carson campaign
it does not make him a nobody mic and he any find some some random academic some path baked academic with some big time
malta or something cypress melissa
i think i with with a day of google lane and a couple of phone calls could find somebody better to collude with within the industry who no no no russians no no russian think just a little bit of basic collusion google mean would have would have gotten a better said of outcomes are better time
attacks it just seems like he's gone about it and really dumb how fast where i totally agree i've always felt like the biggest obstacle to collusion is just how she symbolic it has all seemed kind of on both hands and while they would this was obviously a campaign that was highly disorganized and was pulling from quarter's that had not
not because most of the republican establishment had fled and was fleeing from donald trump still just as a kind of i mean they were able to do lots and lots of things including win the nomination and you'd think if they were colluding they would have been it would have been a little bit more present also some of the meetings and then later took place during the transition
happened in a way where there was no like you it was like getting to know you meetings which you presume wouldn't have happened if there was already collusion going on away but the rebuttal to that is well we haven't seen what the data analytics people are doing and that and then if there was a relationship there to trade information to try to connect russians with the targeting and
tapping the campaign itself was doing that that might not have been known by everybody and maybe it kind of collusion that leave yet to see so maybe there's a it but i totally agree with you did it like that we sort of assume some level of coordination and like it's how i have also like why are the russians continually trying with different people
i clearly they're knocking on eight different doors ten times and if there's this smooth glide path that they've all figured out why bother
i think it's entirely likely that different people were doing different things
no and yeah anyway
a total it yes totally continues to amaze me that none of them could very well like that
every particular episode we hear of has a has a keystone cops quality to it that is surprising that you think you feel like if if if you feel like of the term for the obama campaign
why in her sleep plus segment on his can't why his college necessary collusion is really only taught at some of your more esoteric most esoteric liberal arts institutions and really the the draw down in collusion education has been one of the told was all because they're doing scam and the day
answer and it's a real problem in humanity i mean market majors are sure

okay moving on comes this week a very interesting study by political scientist andrew deaths brenda nine and jason rae floor have been pronouncing her husband jason about fake news so the three political scientists examined web traffic data collected from
a national sample of americans from october seventh november fourteenth twenty sixteen so in the heart of the presidential election campaign
in order to see what kind of fake news consumption there was which platforms help spread it and they had some very interesting findings so apparently fake news doesn't matter right emily
what was the idea wide but shallow impact so lot
and it's and you didn't like it here
isn't that the line
whose line and thought about he's like the the river of his great home state of nebraska of the river thames student in africa my way than three thousand miles wide and several inches deep
it's a great loan and battle
her failed idea ideas a significant percentage of the electorate is exposed to fake news but it's a tiny percentage of their overall news diet sell it looks like it doesn't matter a whole lotta at least that people have lots of other information coming and so that was one of the defining paper by
and brandon nyhan at dartmouth and account barnacles colleagues
but then another
less cherry reassuring finding was that when people do we go to fake news sites on facebook they don't often see a fact check or at least the researchers couldn't find any evidence that bad and directly seeing a fact check that would refute that make news so the problems going on in the way that
facebook and spreading they seem like they are significant alliance
looks like monkeying around or whatever it's james i don't think we can trust facebook too seriously address the problem i guess what i wonder about this is whether to thing so one thing i worry about is that the real problem with fake news and bennett just because of puff of smoke in which everyone who is despite
to not like a piece of real news says well maybe not true and there's just of destabilization are reporting and information going on that as what to do with the term and it's obsessive you thin trump is you know does this all the time and so that's the real concerns so that's like right one and then i guess point two
whether a fake news has an effect it's because people are already primed by mostly right wing media but sometimes left wing conspiracy media to believe whatever the little drop or fake news isn't it just adds a little extra hot sauce so this obviously has effects with
respect to the pizza gate you know that the fake news sent somebody with an automatic rifle to
to find the pedophilia ring in the basement of a pizza place in washington dc that doesn't even have a basement so there's that a fact which is real which is outside of the election the election effect
i saw some coverage of the suggesting well maybe then this whole russian thing is overblown i think that obviously leaves out to pieces at least two pieces one the wiki leaks
russia inspired wiki leaks dump had a huge effect on the election and that wasn't that's not under the category of fake news that's that to me is what does the more and this is what i was gonna mentioned in our previous topic and that's the bigger danger
to our democracy and our election which is that the russians didn't it wasn't so much fake news that they had to deal as they took advantage of both real news and are the way we cover news in the way we cover elections to have an effect on the election in the way and the way it was covered and i think that you could argue and perhaps i will argue perhaps i am now
currently arguing that the most important thing that we could do to fix the way we go through elections is to change the proportionality with which we assess candidates and events in elections which has obviously been something that i've spent quite a lot of time banging on about over the years but if we had a better understanding of the presidency and what we need our president's to do
and and reported a little of that into the actual campaign process maybe we wouldn't be susceptible to the flashy but not
totally dominant stories that the russians clearly took advantage of with wiki leaks has lime i fell for that extreme goo goo goo philosophy of john dickerson i want to quit points one is just too also
double down on what you said a second ago family which is that the problem of fake news is not the existence of the story themselves fit it the way allows politicians and voters and general to call into question
truth and it contaminates media trust generally people stop believing anything they don't want to believe because it's so that becomes the charge that can be thrown at it and so that's the bigger problem is not so much that they're convinced by the dumb fake news stories that allows them to dismiss factual stories that are contrary to police
a dispute
the second thing question i'm interested in is why do you think it is and i have a theory about this
the fake news as a category of information is false stories exists for politics and entertainment but it basically doesn't exist in sports
very little in financial news and not and things like the weather
there isn't fake weather news right people well that people have a long time blamed the weather for the unpredictability and margin of error in whether they said oh you said there was going to rain and whether men would say well no i said there was a so there no
there's no industry somebody i don't change what climate changes different climate change is different climate is different i'm talking about whether i'm talking about and i think the climate is different from whether i think id i think that i think i think i think the key things there are in weather in the immediate weather forecast in finance and in sports people essentially have money riding on there yeah
any and therefore the the value of having actually accurate trusted information is extremely high whereas in politics and in entertainment people their entertainment followed for sport mostly even if inaccurate political information doesn't affect your business life it doesn't affect
but don't cross the i'm going to plan your day
but not directly yeah
i would add i would i would shave off just a few percentage points to what you're saying which is it certainly i remember from covering business
which was some time ago but lots and lots of people in business would say the coverage of this is awful now that's different than what you're saying which is like the actual production of fake news
but but i would say
that there is i mean there's not there's super precision and there is a lot of like fraud and monkeying with balance sheets and stuff the companies do to make themselves look better monkeying with car companies that monkey with their with their emissions standards and all that so
but i think the your general point which is that the the stakes are higher for precision
is true
and then i guess the other obvious trying to make about the weather sport
you can actually see the results immediately right
when i mean every day
all to let are all dead and small boy am i know i think good
in fact
oh and when the radio outside my window right now and i iraq and to be separate
approximately every two hours one pennsylvania and downs in the trunk of the gas
left on mondays
in
every second counts
the life
i visited
of the night
people with pennsylvania taxpayer dollars okay let's get a cocktail chatter i bought myself some moonshine which i've never bought before real moonshine or were like the new stuff that take home and i'm shirts the new stuff they called me and because of a solid a farmer's market
but it
it's delicious it's sweater
why isn't why is moonshine john i feel like because you're an alcoholic fake on and on another
either unfair are perfectly accurate way the moonshine similar to vodka
it's clear and kind of tasteless like like well it's oh well i so the only fake posture i'll take on this is that my the late beloved wonderful man dickie sharp lose my wife's uncle gave us some actual moonshine many many years ago
oh and uncle bobby his brother brought a some of i think i remember it's actual me china or the stuff they sell in in stores but that stuff
tasted that it was you drink it and you you you can't swallow it immediately
basically the kind of stuff that i mean it in this case we didn't drink enough to find out but you know home distilled the stuff that may used to make people go blind
so that had a very strong that was not like vodka that was more it felt more to me like you know like scotch or or maybe it's just my reaction scotch but
yeah that's that's that's just have you don't bring near an open flame
if i'm blind next week
yeah we know so we had is probably smoother did it very much more than fairytale yeah yeah so what is your moon moon china
so my moonshine or is that is about the
nigerian prince michael and he you so new maybe he resides in in louisiana in a town of louisiana any of course is not from nigeria by he he's facing two hundred and sixty nine counts of wire fraud and one count of money laundering he's a sixty seven year old louisiana man and he is your
or nigerian official who claims that he's been the beneficiary of a will and the he'll get a million dollars if you send him your bank account and some moonshine and
anyway he is he was busted after an eighteen month investigation as one of those nigerian princes that we've all heard from in our email inbox he lives thirty three miles northeast of new orleans and i will
your money and her multiply it clear a game is still on it's just slightly changed the parameters he's got a million dollars but is temporarily and disposed and need you to hold onto it for a little while before he's able to be at liberty again
i thought a lot of those you're in in printers were actually nigerians or west african that leaves just i'm disappointed your printer aerial nigerians you don't necessarily royalty not rotate finley emily
when you're having your moonshine and coke as you do every year every couple hours what would you betrayed you know i read two really good books over break salvage the bonds and thing and guy and same by just one word if you have not read either books i really recommend it's real and while after the other they're both short they sort of
speak to each other a with like a great week
so guarantee that i and
paying attention can't lead to two story is this mean that we didn't have an one is this threat to the census that the justice department is talking about adding a question asking people about citizenship which like every single person has ever worked on offenses are sense or studied it says it's really depressed results that people were documented or answer
are we won't get an accurate count or end up having to spend hundreds of millions more dollars trying to make up for it it's just like a puny it is and anti immigrant proposal on i really really hope dies a correct dac also really interesting and fun my is commission on voter integrity or whatever ridiculous jumped
his name and that it had it suddenly tank this week in the middle of the steam banning news maybe because it was added on steam bad and bad but it wasn't really a theme ban and shell was a chris kovacs a while some of the people who have been the most addicted to that voter fraud net
and then there was a lot of celebration of the end of best condition which didn't accomplish anything and was a god by eight million lost it a lot of controversy and just at our ham handed from day one but the idea in this order trump sign to send its work over the department of homeland security and i agree with the secretary of
of main reason this commission that that is a really alarming proposition because we will not know exactly what is going on over at the age ass in terms of days ideas of cross checking voter rolls and purging people and potentially discriminating against people with foreigners on surnames which is something that has happened and states like florida so
i think it's really important to just keep watching that at one point chris call back was flooded as a name for some under secretary position over at the department of homeland security and that seems like a really bad place for this whole strain of voter suppression to go

the f b i russia story has taken on the quality of a tell a novella each day brings so many twists and turns that is impossible to keep up
i will try to capture a few of them just in the last day or so then comes the
news of the the rumor that a former trump official more corolla it's going to testify that hope hicks
suggested that the email to donald trump junior had sent about the legendary russia meeting and trump tower would never get out and play some element of struck the injustice perhaps also in the last day or so comes news that devon newness as memo which has been sent over the white house for approval
may have been altered and republicans really wasn't altered except trivial a but if it was altered doesn't need to be approved by congress also comes news that peter struck the f b i agent to suppose that anti trump bias is poisoning the f b i and subjecting into investigation was in fact one of the leading people fighting
to get the hillary clinton
i email investigation reopened right before the election and wrote the letter that there is a widely regarded as costing having coughed hillary clinton the election
there's so much other stuff the f b i chief chris ray has taken the remarkable step a publicly opposing the release of the nunez memo meanwhile the president's lawyer seem to be positioning themselves to project
special counsel bob mahler's request for direct interview with the president there and literally forgot i was ready my notes down that after we taped last week was the revelation that the president had tried to fire the special counsel it was only stopped when when his lawyer dom again threaten to resign if you did that when more thing which is it called episode kept it as tax last week and they sadness and and
a feminist
anyway i hate like literally as we were close it finishing up at the show
it was able to recover that it's just an extraordinary spectacle i continue to have doubts whether this is where democrats should want to spend all of their time but it don't seem to be aware of the media spending all of time can you can you find a theme in this putting in this kind of garbage pile of horror show whatever
mech metaphor i'm gonna mix here can you find a theme for us
well one game i think it's really important is the institutional prerogative and just kind of basic doing its job of the administrative state in particular i had the f b i and the justice department and the extraordinary spectacle of champs handpicked after i a director christopher array
saying like he has to defend his institution from devon nunez and from present and jump from this effort to discredit the f b i it's as if whatever the f b i is doing to investigate russian meddling in the election
it's as if from the point of view of the president and his allies that stopping that is worth burning down house basically it's very confusing to watch an institution which is led by people who travel packed which is in the executive branch have to take this stance against champ and against me
nice as if they were on opposite sides when in fact it looks like the afghan the justice department
these figures chris re run steam they are people who jumped hired presumably they're not eager to be out there taking this stance against him and i really feel like they must feel like they don't have any choice
i think i think and matter it doesn't matter because i think what emily is saying when you have a president in engaged with another branch of government in an effort to undermine the f b i in a broad way this is not just to say there was a bad apple here or about apple of their it's a really to throw a broad
skepticism over the f b i and to get more support for this idea that there is a deep state at the guy that was trying to to meddle in the election and keep donald trump from being president we should known as i mentioned last week if there is such a deep state and in all corners of the i they did a terrible job of keeping donald trump from being present
and they did such a bad job that perhaps they should be fired for malfeasance because the memo that was released eleven days before the election certainly contributed hillary clinton thinks the cost of the election it's certainly contributed to her rose in the final eleven days of the election and so they were trying to keep donald trump the deep state which in
this narrative is so all powerful the fact that they helped donald trump
in that very public way seems to me that they did a terrible job at being deep state participants may than this latest news about peter struck wine to reopen the investigation to cleanse emails and drafting the letter that call me earliest right before that two thousand and sixteen elections which are so damaging to clinton all that suggests that whatever reservation
stock had about champ becoming president which he clearly expressed in the text messages he had some other duty he saw his overriding i mean if you pick of like he was actually in a position to make a decision that would have a favorite clinton and he made the opposite call i don't
personally i think that guy in public at that moment was the right call but it certainly wasn't just that whatever political affiliations and preferences he had they were not determined to dev in his judgment and in a partisan the that's right as i read the reporting and i've only seen the and and reporting on this though i think there's an important distinction
and struck lawn in the investigation to happen which supports your point of view which is he wanted to investigate these new sets of emails where he had some debate is whether there with this should be made public and tell congress if he had qualms about it being made public what that connects with his the department of justice policy which says
make something public in a way that is going to have a potentially destabilizing effect on an election and the reason that matters and figuring out that is that there was a report this week and both why shouldn't post and the wall street journal that andrew mackay the number two at the f b i was being investigated by the inspector general of the
by for taking a month
when these emails that were found on and any means
laptop for taking a month before notifying congress that they were being looked into it
his defenders say that's because he was exercising the regular standard operating procedure of the department of justice
others who say know these shows the fix was in to try to cool things for hillary clinton so she could win the way i mean one thing i've been running about is it sounds like this inspector general part is going to be critical of mccain that that was part of why you know abrupt raid departed this week and if it contained that is true that
seems like the best rap and for a new nathan trump and describing the f b i and yet the haven't been talking about that much it's confusing to me maybe that's because it's not yet clear what's in it and maybe it's because the criticisms don't fall neatly along partisan lines because of the issues you were just talking about i mean commie really does
did we talked about the time and he really did depart from the regular rules both in the press conference he had the summer before the election and then in october let are still sorting through those questions about the timing of the investigation becoming public seems really important to me to figure it out and i hope
inspector general port will do that in a way that seems like truly neutral on has the institutional kind of rules and norms at heart well i mean john what do you think i just wonder if this is like an act of desperation that is just
maybe it's not a good place for democrats to put all their energy but i wonder if republicans are going to be sorry that they went down this road to i don't know how the politics play out i think the that one thing you have obviously is that you could imagine
whatever is in this memo being used to begin the case to get rid of rosenstein and then replace and by somebody who would fire muller now where am i getting that from that's from joe mansion the west virginia andrews on the intelligence committee who we talked to this week and who said that's what to look for another theory i've heard is that this effort
is a way to kind of broadly do discredit the f b i and then use that as a pretext for claiming that mahler's not on the level and therefore why should the president talked to him and don't know if we've talked about this on the show but for a president who is plays so fast and loose with the truth washington post counted over two thousand
misstatements lies on truce and otherwise from the president it's hard to imagine what an interview with a special counsel would be like it's almost certain that the president would say something that could get him into trouble and so if you're a lawyer and i wonder what your thoughts about this emily whether you would ever let your client go into such as
situation those are two possible options for what is happening with this memo i think there is another option which is the memo never gets released what's more powerful a memo with claims that can be rebutted buddy the director or remember that never gets published and then people can say well i mean if only it had been published we would know the true virulence of the
crimes that the f b i and now that it isn't you know it can become in people's imagination whatever they choose to one guy i would have thought that would have been the way to go except that they already voted to release like already going down this road i mean i guess like trump could stop it that just seems he does not seem him to do that it's not as character right and i kept thinking that
from his point of view and there so many examples of this rate this idea of any astros and stan are you on my team like where he just math find this like we have well we i have these bedrock assumptions about the norms that govern the president relationship with the justice department and the f b i and carefully worked out
balance since watergate that gas these institutions are within the executive branch but the president is very careful to stay away from anything that would seem like interfering an investigation i mean to determine trump this is clearly just incredibly frustrating and stupid and he just doesn't buy it and some fundamental level of the notion that like he's going to be the
one to stand in front of the memo out on the right
i was listening to a slow burn the really wonderful slate pod cast about the watergate affair i can't wait to listen to the last episode of that has gotten better and better as it's it's fantastic and what's really interesting about what happened with nixon is that the crimes that nixon
was accused of and with guilty of are somewhat analogous to some of the things that people are talking about with trump and in particular the find the smoking gun tape that took him down was nixon
proposing that that tell the to shut down and f b i investigation so it was something similar meddling in places the president shouldn't be meddling but where he did prove also have authority to do it but what was really interesting about the fall of nixon is that hear you had a president who was really pop
killer and it was also by most
reasonable standard a pretty good president someone who who has no interest did good stuff was really interested in policy was innovative on policy had a lot widespread popular support for a lot of what he was doing
and and that he even but there were so much danger to the institutions and norms of the country that that threat was so powerful that even members of his own party felt they couldn't support him the justified the removal of a good and successful president trump isn't good and six
president trump is a is a bad president who is not very good on policy
effective he's not helping the republican brand at all is not really clear why the republican party is so willing to defend that and to defend the destruction of the institutions yes it is clear and know is with them he as eighty percent and the higher approval ratings and my my my god like
pence president mike pence would have just as high approval and would be a lot more competent yeah but that has is believed to have and does have a connection has base and all of that is boosted by railing media and until that changes think this is the way it is so he is the president we elected president and you also forget the events between
been getting from trump as president to penn since president would cause extraordinary disruption them in that base and would not let which would not be good for those lawmakers on the republican side who made that happen they would suffer all the while while trying to get present trump i guess in this is honoring i think that was that was absolutely true nixon as
well that was true and the knicks and i don't know and there wasn't even close and the next time
yeah the republicans had a blood bath and seventy four and seventy six they were destroyed and then six years later
but but but the partisanship of today is nowhere close to the way it was in i mean you had moderate republican you had moderate republicans in in the nineteen sixties or in the early nineteen seventies and way you don't really have them today and then also the power of the base in both parties but but most particularly the power of the
base in the republican party and fealty required or else you'll get a primary opponent financed by outside groups and supported by media and social media that all didn't exist back then in the way it does today yeah no that's all and by the way through and that you know the cowardice that
it's been demonstrated is proof of that and it just is amazing to me that the level of destruction the level of threat to institutions that republicans basically support and think are good for the country is incredible
only an unwillingness the unwillingness to resist that so far is bizarre to me i think and so worrisome
you give to other things one it wasn't really until the june twenty third tape came out i mean there was a smoking gun and there was sterile million
none and and secondly you have a republican party that finds the president perhaps distasteful but they like the tax cut bill that passed they like what's happening in judicial appointments and this courses in addition to the points we just made about partisanship they like to direction in which judicial appointments are going and
and they like the supreme court pic of course as well so and they liked the fact that a lot of regulations are going away and that at the
and the rest of them regulations and the entire direction of those agencies is being reversed from the obama years so there's a great deal for republicans to like that's pretty generic republican viewpoints on all those things with the axe and on by the way on immigration but then the only thing where
there's an there's a distance there would be on trade but most friendly policies are all pretty much in keeping with what republicans like right but that doesn't that is actually has nothing to do with with with what we're talking about you are assuming that we are just like trade in for a no announcement and that going around know melodrama it
nato is the two thousand and twenty they're gonna lose the twenty two thousand election they're going to get a good chat about they're going to get crushed in two thousand and eighteen and that's going to happen and it's going to have been worse the more they're attached to trump but i thought you were saying he didn't why there that they didn't like the policies that he's supporting and they do well you are saying is a bad president which is a more global a statement they
like ish the policy supporting but he's embarrassing the party and he's making he's he's making the i don't think there are many republicans who think that donald trump as a president is a better president for the country or for the republican party than mike pence would be if you could just imagine magically said could achieve a magic wand maybe they'd way that they absolutely cannot
it's not how it works and they're deeply aware of that can i say one more thing steal one more thing from slow burn that really jumped out at me when a special counsel was a to investigate knicks and it was archibald cox who was this like harvard bow tie wearing liberal i am now stealing directly from leon on his show
nixon did not go after him on partisan grounds it just like didn't occur to them to try to argue that cox was is an unbiased i mean if muller was a cox like figure just imagine what would be happening and there is something illustrative in detail about the distance we've traveled
and what what what partisanship is coming to mean
i continue to think that this investigation is audrey flu super important in yet
is the wrong tree
to be barking up trump trump a terribly corrupt person he is obstructed justice it looks to me he is probably his campaign probably colluded attempted to collude with russians to affect the election all of that i think he's committed impeachable offense probably every day he's been in office practice
but it's if democrats wish to damage the presidency and and restore themselves to power and and make a political comeback it's spending their time on trumps policies on the republican policies
not on this stuff this stuff it's just confusing and model some and you know i know it has to be done because it's so law but i just don't think i think of an local
operative right now i'll just say that like a non later went to law school i'm much less shorter than you are that of those nefarious things about trump are true but i deeply care about finishing this investigation and finding out whatever mahler has to tell us because that's rule of law basic principle the the president is subject
to the laws just like everyone else i feel like that matters enormously and it may not be the best way to win the two thousand and eighteen or twenty and twenty elections focusing on this i also think like it's not an either or but it just seems institutionally to be an imperative that we get an answer to this we can't just be like you know what sire we don't care
care about looking into whether the russians like through the election we're we're not interested in whether the president obstructing justice we're just going to like caught her eyes this chapter and pretend that it didn't happen that's just that just seems like a deep error and we know how in this is from watergate
also democrats i mean i guess
what do you mean you mean like elected officials are just democrats in general what him in one in because because nancy pelosi and chuck schumer actually go and talk about this that much writer
i think i mean you on adam schiff and mark warner
i mean like i like i want us in the media
well we guns that are not discussing it and but here's the thing no think of it don't make all that he isn't enjoying slow burn and like the president and and and the chairman of a committee and congress going after the f b i is that's a that's an objectively big deal that's not about politics that's about
separation of powers and a boat as you were making the case last week about your rhino an independent institution right it's more me is speaking as a somebody who who wishes that republican congress ill and out of office and wishes this president out of office
also there is big the rabbit hole part of it is like serious i mean you have to concentrate really hard they're like new names to learn every week or remind yourself bob
wait this out a new piece of information and did i hear that six i was sure that i would never hear devon newness his name again i really wish sure he was somebody who i thought i've heard that learned this person's name back a year ago and i was like i don't need to know what i never knew to know this person's name again and now i know his damn name convention on the thing about marker although who
oh yeah you said trump official he was the spokesperson for legal to admit it
there before he left perhaps because he was concerned about obstruction wrangler had resigned i mean i think the reporting is that he resigned at a very strange moment and reporting has been that he resigned because of the handling of this memo about explaining this press release explaining what happened in them done junior meeting with some
the russian lawyer who is promising him dirt on hillary clinton he's a fascinating figure in this because he resigned in the moment
piers because he said something fishy happened and now the new york times is reporting that one of the things that was fishy is the whole pick said these emails will never showed the light of day i don't know what i mean was that obstruction or was that her just hoping something where it was true for some other reason but dumb great but something bad to mark corolla about
yeah to say that her picks says layer on her behalf denied that she ever made such a statement that's very very useful thank you that's right

president from delivered an exceptionally long state of the union address on tuesday night i'm must begin with a confession which is that i did not watch it i started to watch the dickerson in coverage on cbs i heard john i heard you say we're waiting for the house surgeon of armed and then i realized that literally anything i would do with an ex ninety minutes would be more edifying
fine and less distressing so i watched a black mirror episode instead
fuck me i'm great
okay really good yeah he really really good argument it's really good round but i mean a redneck things about the second season actually it's the fourth season but
currently yeah he's good
and season
in any case i did read the speech i read about the speech i watch some highlights i now understand that we're about to go to war with north korea and also emma thirteen that has been defeated that we are not going to spend one point five trillion dollars in infrastructure but somehow going to spend one point five trillion dollars in infrastructure and indicates john new
what do you thought that all americans are dreamers were all the dreamers i'm not really a dreamer so it didn't stick with me john how was the speech when there's a lot to there's a lead to unpack there's obvious
the theater review part which i'm
this is a president who thinks of things as a stage and so he used the format of the city union with dotted by these stories which presented his vision of america in which people end up the government were of the authors of their fate often in the trunk presidency because it comes to the president the messages and
it's a very blunt instrument and i thought in this case the speech itself showed some interesting political thoughts about how to use the speech to put democrats in in a box
by creating a picture of america and essentially saying to democrats why don't you come along with this issue this idea of america there was actually a lot of restraint in the speech the president didn't didn't talk about himself clearly he was they front loaded a lot of these stories to talk about other people to create this tableau why is that matter because it suggests that it
and an impulsive president who has been at war had one way or another with his own staff that has been raining these impulses got him at some level to trying to portray a picture of the presidency that during his actual presidency he hasn't bothered with much but in terms of actually extending an olive branch to
democrats by either accepting their view of the world in any small way to suggest that he was creating some political space for them to work with him he didn't do that he have you see when he said americans are dreamers to that was a direct shot at democrats and then we should obviously get to immigration which was the core policy part of the speech
but i've been talking too long but there was obviously a lot in the looks like the president has like not for an hour and twenty minute
finally every state of the union is too long it's forgettable and irrelevant is there anything reason to think this one will be relevant and remembered
wow i mean i think that divisiveness about immigration that kind of getting further from a deal on my taking them hard line on this that seems like it actually might matter i hate the state of the union i don't think i've lots to state of the union from more than like five or ten minutes in little pieces
his name be my whole life it's such a grab bag and i i'm allergic to this kind of political theater i don't like the standing up of people around the room then come to symbolize it just seems like using people to me i don't like the whole unlike anything about it to be fist just on the spectacle beaucoup
from the spectacle of it one is i simply do not understand through this every year why someone doesn't try a whole new format and just try to try to make a point in a totally different way shake it up
it's it's soul crushing not that it's soul crushing it's not a soul crushing other term it's it's just really boring and demoralizing
if you're if you're in the majority if you support the president it's it's like boring and you have moments to cheer about if you pose a president it's boring a new just irritating and frustrating but in for nobody is it actually enlightening or does it does it change people are energized people it doesn't energize people provide it sucks energy
away from people and so i i don't understand why somebody like trump who is such a master spectacle doesn't recognize i did i slightly disagree i think for republicans in that case i'm talking about not just the trump base i'm talking about the trump base plus the people who reluctantly supported them because they didn't like hillary clinton and those people who
i don't like him at all i think curing a president praise the military talk about the american flag talk about face
provide a public spectacle because that's what they say the union has become in support of those values in that picture of america i think is something that a lot of people who are republicans would find appealing
i don't think anyone really been of all democrats praise the military john that's a complete fallacies showing rape and so my point is that praising the military is different than praising it in the way that don't come to this was more now i shined that matter how many words and not along no absolutely and how we measure our like new
it's not it's not how we measure my point was just that there are a thought as ours and i think it's actually even beyond the trump days who would find something appealing in spending that much time on those things in in a presidential address
of course people will find that appealing and i'm sure if you install it and maybe cbs did this afterwards and you take a focus group that that there are people who are encouraged and heartened by it i just think you know this better than i do john if you look at historical polling data
the duration like does that indoor does that have meaning whole lasting significance to the change how people think or behave in the world no yeah there's no memorable for people you know nobody would make that claim i mean i just meant that dead when you saying that they're nobody would have liked it i don't i don't think that's true does it have any lasting significance i don't think it does i think it does tell
as something interesting about what is going on inside the white house a presidency dominated both in policy and spectacle government in which the president calls the tune about what is going to be going into congress and that's how it should go and congress is expected to do what he says
and then he is also the central spectacle in the american drama he is the ringmaster here at center stage even though his speech was obviously written and the whole tableau is written to create a notion of that america rather than i donald trump but in the symbolism you can't mistake that it's i donald trump which is also an aberration of the era
design are very representative government
that's very well said john i wonder that was the point i want to make read the pomp i think one of the thing that happens every year on the state of the union is that anchors like john dickerson perhaps i don't even know if you did this
this rhetoric that used about the symbolism the solemnity the the coming together that the peaceful coming together of all these branches of government you have a joint chiefs of staff you have supreme court
justices you have the cabinet you have the house and senate of both members from both parties in front of a public both physically present public and the galleries and then i obviously millions of people watching this
this magnificent solemnity that represents the glory of the institutions that i feel that that there's an element of poison has crept into it for just the region that you cite one other one other point just juxtaposition that i thought was really interesting was the state of union was the same day that there was this announcement that amazon and berkshire hathaway
and j p morgan chase are teaming up to try to remake healthcare they're trying to come up with a better model for health care and health care delivery so interesting and the reason they're doing that is because essentially the public sector has been hopeless that at public sector has failed or been these efforts but because there's simply no there's no agreement with
the public sector about what measures should be pursued and i just thought that the juxtaposition of a president standing up there and outline of course these grand ideas and in front of congress which is supposed to execute on these grand ideas and the contrast of the their shabby ability to do it first is that real problems that we face whether it's porto rico
whether it's inequality whether it's declines in life expectancy across the country whether it's that the failure of the healthcare system that is a pretty shabby and fad juxtaposition it is but if we feel like
partisan lock is unbreakable for all the reasons that we've talked about over the millions of years in in politics the idea that they at least one to try to do at work around is at least momentarily hopeful
that now i don't i'm sure there are all kinds of things i'm glad i'm glad yeah sure yeah oh i'm glad they're doing just that he can make them more likely to solve it but if that it's a sign of outline and have public sector oh absolutely no it's at i mean it's absolutely the case there is a nice column by dana milbank in the washington post which wax democrats for their
behavior during the state of the union
he says i should have and clapping my well that some of them didn't stand when the president enter the house chamber do you think it is ok for opposition politicians to behave this way i mean there were certainly
mega disapproval from liberals when joe wilson
yeah i'll do you lie at barack obama back in two thousand and nine or two thousand and ten indeed do you think the same the same applies to democrats who are who didn't yell you live but they certainly conveyed their distaste for the president on the one hand you are just talking about the danger of kind of lionized saying the president me off
yes to match in the way in the hall event creates that
rifkin that i would say reality and it's all geared toward that size does if that's your main concern then having people
in some small way or a large way exercise their right to distance themselves and make clear their lack of affinity for the president in both parties is fine it's like congress rabble rousing a little bad and using it's like nanosecond in front of the camera to try it
at present a different point of view
i know i'm not a big fan of these pomp and circumstance moments like i said from the beginning but once you're in one the just basic lake
politeness and fidelity doesn't seem to me like it has some worth and currency and i worry that because champ is such a device that figure this is an example i've had and just like bringing everyone down and that there is just like some basic civility that should reign in that chamber in public moment on i don't know
damn money and no i i i agree and
and i thought it was
bad on on those grounds and then just also in tactical grounds people are watching and see you not standing up when he talks about the national anthem a lot of people are going to realize that use think that this is a shot at you know come cavanagh and the players who are kneeling because of social justice concerns about america and
all of that all they see as a guy talking about in god we trust and national anthem and you're not standing and clapping you're looking furious and so it's just tactically it's a bad idea so why not just follows basic decorum ideas for this one min and moment of symbolism and then move on john end us with a brief
discussion on immigration
the president's policy goals as outlined in the speech and whether they will carry forth into legislation wow that president he outlined four pillars of his immigration plan
late in his back and forest for the president to be finally engaging and in the negotiations but anyway essentially what he offered was
this trade which is a lot of money for the border wall in exchange sure one point eight million undocumented immigrants who were brought here by their parents at a younger age that would have a pathway to citizenship then he would end of a lottery that's the third pillar and then ending what they call chain migration what others call family reunification
setting limits on that even the use of say that term chain migration if you are in earnest trying to put together a deal with democrats he just leave that expression out because you know what it does to irritate the other side and and so when the president's and also them when the president says americans are dreamers to your pitting democrats who who care about the dream
and basically you don't care about americans that's the subtext of that so and then when you talk about him as thirteen you you know you're sending a signal to democrats that i should say you know democrats will read that as you portraying all immigrants as murderers and the other subjects here is that the president ran and
add or the president's campaign committee ran an ad in which they said that the democrats were complicit in in killings by illegal immigrants
because they shut down the government so with all that mood music if you really wanted to get a deal done on immigration you wouldn't have done all of those things and so there's the policy but then there were also actual word choices and because this is a public argument over policy that were either not avoided or they were purposely chosen to irritate democrats there was no
nothing done in putting out those four pillars that's going to help solve the problem in the problem is that the president has concerned we target this last week and don't you to belabor it but he has conservatives who think that one point eight million dreamers are being given amnesty and will be furious that bad and then their democrats who aren't going to get any closer because he's he's up the price now for his wall it didn't doing
anything to actually make the situation better made it worse and he also had this little sleight of hand murray said we've been working with democrats and this is the bipartisan bill he presented his ideas as if they were the product a bipartisan negotiation which is why dick durbin was shaking his head and saying no violently while he was speaking so if this speech was an attempt to get a clue
closer to a deal i don't think it did that at all

hillary clinton found herself on the wrong side of me to this week after reports came out that she had overruled a recommendation back in two thousand and i met her presidential campaign fire it's faith advisor for harassing a woman who worked for him
the faith advisor who was named burns striker a name you could not make up if you tried was accused of delivering unwanted kittens and back massager sending and toward late night texts and generally behaving in a stock really manner when alerted to this to senior
campaign officials o'connell and then the campaign mentor petty fours doyle recommended that fire striker she this is
in to two thousand seven overruled them refined a woman to a good job elsewhere in the campaign duct starters pay and required him to go to camp for encountering never went to infect the kowtow to the story the appendix of the story that five years later working at another clinton affiliated organization a pack striker with fired
for sexually harassing other young women who worked for him
clinton at first weeks old when this story came out then a few minutes before the fate of the union she released a longer facebook statement thane she wouldn't do it the same way again that she had talk to the woman who had been a victim and that woman were satisfied with the disposition of it and that
her thinking of the time with the she hoped the punishment would change strikers behavior but it didn't and therefore it was it turned out to be the wrong choice
emily this prompted an outpouring of fury from women who have long supported her do you share that fury
yeah right i mean
so i guess i would start with saying that in the abstract i am in favor of an interim measures and punishments for people accused of sexual harassment i don't think everyone has to be fired and forever like drummed out of their profession i actually think that hearing about this kind of
measure it's like it's important that we figure out some in between punishments just as we need in between punishment in the criminal justice system
that fad there are two things that really very troubled me about this story one was clinton overriding the recommendations of the people who are investigating and supervising and the reason that bothered me so much as this is the kind of story that jeff like a few sentences
sentences we have and news coverage don't really get at it i think you have to like talk to the people involved and really understand the context deeply and why this woman fact i'm comfortable and how constant and it gave this guy his attentions of work to really understand and it sounds like both of the
women in the clinton
world who were investigating and supervising really got all of that context and then they made a decision and so the idea that hillary clinton wife of a kid sexual harasser i'm proud or clinton what if overrode those recommendations because she liked striker or whatever just seems like bad too
me the other thing that really bothered me was her facebook statement i think ruth marcus wrote a column kind of rewriting that statement to make it much more forthright and powerful the part that just drove me up the wall as when clinton said well i thought that the time this was the best solution
oh come on like you thought that this guy didn't weren't getting fired for your own reasons and claims not it's not fair and to hold her accountable in that moment of decision for the stuff he did five years later but it is also i just i just found that most of
that statement to be self serving and defensive in this way that this is the the weakness the kind of achilles heel of bill clinton as a politician and now that she's not running for office she doesn't there's there's no excuse for that kind of we easily language and that just like disappointment
i think i totally disagree with you about everything you just said let's go let's can time
why this is not it seems to me it seems to me that if striker had not really offended there would be no story at all well what about i mean
striker are not really what about the fact that she overrode the recommendations of patties all that oil and other that's what bosses do they make decisions based on more knowledge and
a grander sense and more life experience and that's why she was the the boston they weren't this is very analogous to you parole in in parole decisions all the time parole boards make decisions and there a parolees who reoffend right and when they re offend everyone like well why did they let this person out because they made of
they make bets and sometimes your bets are wrong and i think if if striker had not really offended that you would sit look back and say okay here's a case it was it was a fifty fifty she went one way and it look at this guy got his life together he he he got on antidepressants he restored and the marriage counseling you as opposed to
that is that he didn't go to the government and check to make sure no that was that was poor i think the that decision alone in a vacuum is a perfectly reasonable decision is a perfectly reasonable decision to have made in two thousand and seven and it's very weird to me to impose the standards of two thousand and eighteen
on the standards of two thousand and seven and to say that just because there were these recommendations that cheat you know she committed some shrimp fell act by doing this i think that was was she was engaging and subtlety and she was wrong because she picked the wrong guy
he didn't learn his lesson and he went on to to be a predator elsewhere and so she was wrong she she made a bad choice but i don't think that the choice was intrinsically
wrong at the time that wow i'm wrong in retrospect maybe but so two things i mean i just i do think that when bosses override the decision of the people like involved in the investigation they better have some really good reasons and i haven't heard any really good reasons and i don't think she wants to get it
into that but like that's not good i guess the other thing i would say is that given that the two women who are investigating are overseeing the investigation had a saw style and just o'connell came out the other way it does not seem as if by the standards of two thousand and seven firing this guy was like sa
extreme action to take mean they first thoughts that dozens of is not an anti delivery and period i mean i realize it's like before our current moment but they need the opposite call because that seemed like a reasonable decision to ban and so i think that suggests i don't know it's
also impossible for me to separate this judgment call at hillary clinton made from her relationship with her husband which is none of my business and many ways but does make one wonder whether she is not so good at preventing men from prowling as i think gal kind of thing
yeah i come down between the two view on this game time decision she made she could she could have just believed in forgiveness and redemption and that he was doing a good job and shouldn't be shouldn't get the maximum punishment if she believes it was going to stick but i think you know what you say family obviously has got to be a part of the curriculum
as well surely your own life experience with this must have played a role as a manager it's probably not great either to overrule to have your people sometimes when they make a call you have to trust and this is way truth president's because you can't do all the the speed work yourself you have to basically trust that you hired good enough people
values and you do all the investigative work here make a call and unless you really really really really really have a reason to do it you basically go with them
i just think emily for you
somebody who believes when it comes to the criminal justice system believes and mercy and and subtlety and in
the value of taking a risk that people are learned their lesson and been given a second chances to be so immediately condemned mentor if her giving a second chance to somebody who is far as we know at the time and maybe this will change this was a first offense of his and look the last person
who who needs who deserves a chance in the world the hands he gross middle aged white
i'm not gonna pretend yeah well as it heads triggered abstract principal keep going but i do think the fact that she came down on the side of mercy know maybe she came down on the side of mercy because it was purely opportunistic she didn't want to offend the faith community she thought this guy was doing good work for hearn did
want the the trauma that's entirely possible it's also possible she did because she thought this guy has he's screwed up he's having some messed up time and his family he's depressed and let's let's get him some help and and see if he can rehabilitate himself right so that is why i started out by saying that i think we need to find a place for and are on punishment someone
i first read about death if i was more sympathetic to that point of view and yeah the consequences for this person it seems in retrospect again like this is hard because you're right if you hadn't really offended then we wouldn't be clear about this and she didn't know that at the time and that's like important to kind of hang
onto but one thing i was thinking about is in our current moment we are relying on shaming a great deal right so you know one parallel that clinton kind of obliquely brought up in her facebook stay men with the new york times like interim punishment of gland thrash right near times mine blair i don't know gland but this i
you know you in suspense of mine take him off the white house be but not fire ham and then there are obvious like charges of hypocrisy because the times had broken the story and i guess what i think it's really important element is that you know thrushes been publicly shamed and embarrassed and we're relying on that part of this to dissuade
made him from continuing to treat women like this and that was not part it all of the burn stride our story and in fact there wasn't really any follow up if he didn't go to counseling and sell it seems like the lesson he took from this was that he could get away with this now i don't think that you have to fire someone to show them that they can't get away
a with this but something went wrong and yes it's true that it's only in retrospect we see that but i really wonder what message was sent to have that was insufficient and whether you know the clintons decision as a boss is the main ingredient here for a kind of lacks this and i guess also
yes it's important to allow for a mercy and leniency in second chances but that doesn't mean that you know bosses shouldn't take strong action or not in a current we're not talking about someone going to jail or talking about whether someone should have like a very high ranking positioned sensitive position and that's like a different calculus
yeah i certainly think the if you want to call hillary clinton to account new color to count one for not following up to ensure that counseling was done to for continuing to keep striker
very much in her orbit until very recently until the present essentially if she knew that he really offended in two thousand and thirteen and then still inviting him to her parties and still hanging out with him then she deserves more stick for that them i mean what if she didn't know because no one thought she would care man i don't know that seems weird to he was working on of her pack

anyway he was elected in in in two thousand and ten in south carolina and is basically gotten sick of congress in washington he is not the only republican in that position
a little little less than forty republicans who are retiring
now some in that number are running for other republican offices but that's a huge number of the other really big number is the nine committee chairman in the house who are retiring this week also brought the news the chairman rodney freely highs and is retiring he is one of the appropriations committee chairman
and there are people that spend entire careers just trying to be on the appropriations committee and so you now have these people who for all kinds of reason should stay in congress butter now choosing not to stay it's kind of extraordinary what's happening

can i pause on targeted for one second to i know it's which means your best friend know i know i knew him slightly many many years ago and i found him delightful haven't talked to him and fifteen years but so trade gowdy one that's yeah bob inglis bob inglis
i remember this because you and i recover but bobbing list was notoriously incredibly conservative he was one of the gingrich revolutionaries he was he was the icon of conservatism really really right wing by the standards of the nineties and doubt he beat him in two thousand and ten by say same essentially that english with saw
often was no wonder conservative that and inglis was a moderate know you have god he himself has become get he had no one would call him a moderate go to you as somebody who people treat as is a reasonable republican people on the left will say well he said you know he's a very thoughtful person and
just to signal of i guess how far right party and we have to say something else about bob english switches that last summer
the growth are bad for the washington times about how it's that ten minutes i helped draft clinton's impeachment articles the charges against trump are more serious yeah he's been on a that
iran as long as he's been on

members of the parties you to actually like debate each other a lot in campaigns instead of just rushing off and telling their bases what they want to ear and that was it but two of them read a senior center together and english was very balanced budgets
reno restrain the growth of entitlements kind of candidate and so he went on and on about the demographic boom that was going to cripple the budget and this again
at a time where republicans all were running as deficit hawks counter to the behavior in the most recent tax cut hollings as a purveyor of pork i remember the headline of our story at the time has parks on the gretel was was ruining our fiscal future and he gets done with this long
wind up much like the one i'm on right now

the portland massacre has not come and gone the way mass shootings usually do a nation that had been inured to school massacres is suddenly paying attention because there is a cadre of passionate
very angry and barry righteous because they are right students who are speaking up and demanding gun control
students from douglas high school have trekked to tallahassee to here to to watch and bear witness as the florida legislature
rejected and assault weapons ban on wednesday
the third legislature however did declare pornography dangerous to health you'll be glad to hear any
they didn't manage passed that law the douglas students also appeared on television repeatedly demanding action for politicians including astonishing cnn town hall on wednesday night where they harried and grilled their senator marco rubio they are more organizing the march for our so washington dc march on march twenty fourth that is
already funded by george clooney and oprah winfrey there have been and are going to be more local walkouts all over the country
the the students are so successful they are also under assault from various kinds of internet trolls as well as conservatives who who paint them as professional protesters or as puppets liberal parents so anyway why we will do you think these students are breaking through the debate on gun control in a way that no one has
for a long time i think so the fact that they're so young fact that they're so passionate the fact that they aren't practiced at talking to legislate are the fact that there are so angry i feel like there's still a great piece to be written about how sandy hook changed dc i think it is really a turning point
for liberals but also conservatives there is this great feeling that nothing literally nothing whatever get congress to act on unless issue if you can go shoot twenty kindergartners and nothing will happen and so i think it's been really surprising to see these teenagers comment and really feel like they are shifting the debate and they're not
going to stop and there is now going to be this huge rally and there's going to be tremendous attention on all of these legislators and i'm not sure that i entirely understand why this has gotten traction and a way that at our shootings i'm like the one in las vegas haven't but i think it has to deal with they're very unusual voice in the fact that these these kids
are coming and i being such unbelievable advocates for themselves and other teenagers
john why do you think they're breaking through their a different voice in this they are the victims because it happened at their school and they're they're just in this kind of niche between adults who are written who kind of written off in the traditional back and forth grooves of that dead and debate on guns
but not so young that they would be kept off of television
and i think i think it varies a lot of contributing factors
part of it has got to be the frustration a lot of people feel more broadly with with president trump at this moment there's obviously the most important he is the specifics of the case or which are awful and but but it's and he was saying before the awfulness of the specific case hadn't kicked the a debate out of its right so within you
what's different here i think what is different here is that
in some sense a president who rushes to fill the emotional void as presidents have in so many previous instances in some ways allows release for everybody who's watching and there was no release here there was no
or that wasn't a part of the story so that's another thing that's different and i think also there's a lot of political energy about
this would be outside of of the florida but i think in the country a desire to push back against the larger president that may be a part of this as well that's a that's a really good point but the trumps
weak response or or his inability to show deep empathy and and sympathy
made it possible for this to come forward i do wonder though i mean the newtown parents after sandy hook shooting mean these are parents who had lost their children
and raised so compelling they woke up and they were tarred they were bet that didn't last like the there
them as as sanctify avatars of this issue didn't last and do you think that's going to happen with these these children i mean that we're already of course seeing some of it already where people actually know they're just you know their professional protesters hurts
have been programmed by their liberal f b i dad or whatever it is but
do you think it's you think the sympathy that they have garnered indoors i think that the fact that it feels like it's transferring into other forms of action and protest matters a lot so there is this rally plan for dc there's celebrities that are donating money to add they're all sorts of action and lie down
there's walk out there is a school district and taxes that told students that they would be suspended if they did anything i think that it is great movie
like it was like a dumbass
set up for liberals know exactly and it was also i mean having been a teenager once gosh nothing would have made me happier than meant to be told not to not he is my first amendment rights and so i feel like there's a way in which this is this is moving to a form of political pressure that's probably
really appealing ted to motivate young kids in fact that you're seeing other high school students get behind this and do the same thing students in dc have had several actions and you go down to the white house there's been and continue all protests
i'm not sure that has happened after a las vegas or after the orlando sheeting or even after new town and maybe i'm forgetting something but i don't remember it moving to this other kind of form of civil disobedience and and this other sort of area prevalent form a political pressure in trying to figure out where what soon what's on day one thing that has struck me is that we saw had both
and then town hall and we've seen some degree with the president that there was a conditioned response to these which is there are a response which is guns don't kill people people kill people and so there is the immediate effort in the president was part of this as well and in previous massacres where he immediately dealing to the question of guns from from the issue
here when the president first talk to my when others talked about mental health at seemed to be following that similar pattern but then the president in response to this has talked about everything from changing age limits to background checks to now those are are potentially they could be meaningful or they could be headaches
i mean so in other words when you're talking about background checks there's everything from the corn and bill
to what to me and mansion put forward and two thousand and thirteen that's a big difference the energy supports one the a worked very very hard to kill the other which they were successful in doing so
when their presence as he wants to do something on background checks there's a huge thing he could possibly do but the fact that he is that all talking about gun related measures in response to this seems to me actually is a something that is different and marco rubio when pressed by a father at the town hall and cnn who said or guns about fears and
yo gave him another answer and then he said no answer my question our guns are part of this and when rubio said yes then it becomes okay what are we going to do even that is a shift
the political process is usually what causes those who would like to see reform on any gun legislation that's what usually crushes their hopes and that's yet to come so one of the things that i think marco rubio ended yesterday was all of times gun control advocates say it's the array or blame put put the blame squarely on me
and i think people on the right thing
the enter a powerful because it represents actually a strong body have committed voters and the problem that gun control advocates have had is that there is not the same level motivation and commitment and ability to hold politicians accountable
our for gun control the way there is for gun rights is there any chance any that this
this movement
create a block of actually committed donors and voters who can exercise that same effect on the left that gun rights that gets it had on the right i think that that's really pressing and open question and when you get ten to policy when they are it note is that everything that people are talking about if you think about a minimalist her
maximum less spectrum whereas still kind of talking about fairly minimal last measure the american public broadly speaking it's very supportive of have gotten control either and seven percent background check yeah i mean and even republicans right be right there isn't a lot of demand for ad it's not people's top issue
yes they're heavily in support of maxima last second amendment rights and minimalist lies i would expect that what will happen is that congress will pass something that folks are not sure is actually going to be enough to prevent these in the future and you've seen in other countries i'm a thing as australia where they had one of these
it ends and they basically pulled all the guns back they said you have to turn all of these and now now he's talking about that kind of policy here and so even when this happens again when it happens again and i'll be interesting to see what the argument as than right like while we passed on to control and it didn't work because they're still is deranged mad men out there right i mean the on the assault i mean people
oh well you had an assault weapons ban and there were still massacres including but in fact they dropped a lot but there were still enough that people could say oh it didn't work right
notably there's not great evidence the government does not study this as closely as people would like even just doing something like that in and we need a lot more data while because because right are not allowed to start exactly they're not going to fund research at the moment in terms of polling in lots going to change and pulling is inaccurate of and let's not put too fine a point on this but
in the polling which has shown that traditional public support for measures and and blamed congress and president there has not been movement on the question of of an assault weapons ban and still roughly a fifty countries basically evenly split on that so it has not
what it seems like a lot of the kids would like is a full band and i'm not sure there's the public support for that just yet
i think i'll be curious if if we are in a world where democrats retake the house i think it will be curious to see because i would not be surprised if knowing that it was not going to be signed into law they started passing these fairly you know i think i'd be interesting to see if they started passing i'm bringing them up and taking that kind of high ground on that issue and saying well
there were passing a law that would have actually prevented some of these incidents and republicans are the ones that are blocking it do think that during this next eight ten months before the election
there's any chance of legislation or is it going to be i mean we have mitch mcconnell
there's anything that mitch mcconnell can do you can slow down
legislation if he chooses i think the
for something to get through congress and get to the president's desk would require an actual concerted endorsement from paul ryan and mitch mcconnell and the majority of republicans is there any chance that you guys see that that's actually going to happen
i think that they'll pass something actually i think that they'll pass something small they'll make the calculation that i would be better at to say we passed a sensible gun control mash are and to sort of neutralize that electoral he for them they're facing a very hard election in november i think that they will do something that will hopefully not completely and better the second man
mint voters to them
i'll be able to say that they did at least you know they pass something that's my guess president trump
you know which of course should be cautious about describing any intentional or a or thought or actual policy to anything that he says or tweets but his set of statements and tweets about arming teachers
there's no chance that this is going to become part of this is there there's no chance that can be teachers teachers teachers concealed carry in classrooms that's just an unseemly bad idea
there is more support for it than you
then you might think there was a story about of policemen in ohio who said he would offer teachers concealed carry classes and he then put out word that he had to stop enrollment at three hundred because he'd already in just a short period of time gotten three hundred people who had who had asked for that training the first of all we should note that that
in this instance there was a security guard with a gun so when the president talked about gun free schools where nobody can fire back that was not the case there was somebody there who could have you just didn't run into shooter so but also then you get escalation you get cheaters who will then take it take that into account and change their tactics accordingly which which
escalation in more potential catastrophic casualties got it made me sell angry president trump has this habit of suggesting is unbelievably radical policy ideas with absolutely no research backing no consultation with experts nothing a it's basically a troll right
it would be possible to study and to ask expert on this kind of violence you know how many deaths by accident would be caused by this how many more shootings what there be because some kid pulls the gone off of the teacher even just a question of like the parents have a right not to send their kids into a school where they know that somebody has a gun and might not be appropriately trained with that
what message are you sending their children if the teachers are armed like it's just so infuriating that you would kind of like toss this off them know i can't imagine that this is going to become an issue and also you know how many people at that concert in las vegas had gotten a lot at play here and also yeah and some of
he said his teachings hard enough without having to then have to carry my life and death decisions in your bed when when i interviewed will here he said you know where all it takes her to stop a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun in that one it
solution in in vegas like how does this play out your in the concert you you're carrying a weapon in somebody starts firing from up in the windows of a hotel what do you turn on fire and if you miss what happens you're suddenly shooting into hotel rooms like the the i don't get heather like as huge quite rightly said
las vegas
everybody being armed would not have settled the situation down and it's not clear to me that in any of these school shootings having teachers have a huge number of guns what if what have done anything i mean you can almost think about like support for more defensive measures that some actor say that schools need to make sure that their doors are bullet afraid
that's still kind of horrifying that lake anyway so no i would be i would be shocked if that became a policy proposal
i do think that there is going to be this argument for the expansion of concealed carry and for a general encouragement of people to to protect themselves you know the thing that bothers me about it just philosophically to is is that this like you know an erosion of the state monopoly on violence right i understand that this is supposed to be defensive but like don't you have a right
to or an expectation that you're not living in a violent society and that you don't have to deal with s while it's there's this weird conflict which is that you have also and an army of the states or the right rise of swat at the qualification at the police like huge investments in the military and national guard armory her and the second the purpose of this
amendment is to protect us against the predictions that militarized state rain but yet we're we're excessively militarize in the state bread at the same time
well they they need to have more arms it's just even stepping back further the countries in which this doesn't happen there's way fewer guns
like we know that that's that's one of the businesses but this is like a closure right right but you have conservatives that the conservative world view about this is that people have a right to be armed and the right to make individual decisions that will make they believe that will make themselves safer
and that's a whole world view and liberals have an opposite world view which is that there just needs to be at the escalation and fewer guns and me cops and britain don't carry gun know don't down and what's funny is i their crime shows in britain their crimes are always much more horrific because you have to stab people are like hit them with something in order to kill that me
can't just shoot them and all of this is because it has been there was when i grow up an grew up in west hartford connecticut there is a neighbor of ours and he was a defense like a criminal defense attorney and a gun in his house and we were never allowed to go in there and play with his kids in the house i had to come to ours like our mom wouldn't let us go into a house where she knew that there was a
gun and i was thinking i was like what would it would my mom had felt comfortable sending her kids to a school where all the teachers were armed it's so nutty it so well i don't yeah
i don't think i think that's excessive on your brother's part i mean if you don't know that the neighbors
gun safety he keeps it unlocked i mean if it's a neighbor is careful about it
like a perfectly reasonable thing i would let my kids go to places i don't check to see whether their friends have guns she knew how dumb her children were

the muller freight train shrugs along this weekend dated a dutch lawyer who was linked to pomona for and but gates gates
last week was even bigger news last week
or thirteen russia individuals and three russian companies charging them with various crimes but those crimes that essentially added up to you interfered in our election by using social media and other channels to divide americans and to promote donald trump and underwriting hillary clinton
the trump response to the indictment has been strange and troubling rather than talking about are worrying about a russian assault on the american electoral process he has been treating about how we were being laughed at by russians for per our investigation of it he's claiming redemption because the latest indictment did not accuse
i'm of collusion
john it's weird the way he's responding to it but is it to haul surprising given who he is well
well and me know as you quite rightly point out he is he has responded to things consistently with in paulson and without restraint and so you you you would expect him to and intact that's been the problem here the ban and said this decision to fire james kill me was the big the worst possible mistake that doesn't trump is ever
made and he basically did it
in bands view
external views because he couldn't he just couldn't stand it he couldn't restrain himself and that that's been a constant thing here so the fact that he's keeping and in the news against his self interest is goes back to that lack of restraint
so i guess it's not a surprise by he also has this indomitable will for self preservation we should argue for just moving on and doing something else and not keeping everybody focus on russia and why why is the focus on russia so important here is because these these indictments the twenty two
who were indicted last friday
and even the new stuff that happened this week is all validation of the authority of the of the muller process process both inform how incredibly painstaking in careful muller is but then also in substance that he is talking about here in these indictments about an effort to overthrow are undermined at the very least
american democracy and so you can't call it a witch hunt anymore when it is doing this important work and so the extent that that's continually in the news cycle and undermines the president's larger gold to claim that mahler's engage in a witch hunt
any there's a comfortable com a minor times that
people have been talking about this week which are use a trump either actively wants to help or is incredibly stupid or most likely that he is actually effectively being blackmailed that he himself has some information that he thinks that russians have on him
and that that is why he wants to shut this investigation down and treatment posits that it's probably some financial chicanery that he doesn't want to come out what did you find that persuasive
i think that are there is this russian nesting doll
have implications from white muller from what we know of the mother investigation what we now have these indictments there was like a lot of parts to that's right so there's russia interfering in the election there's the question of the trump campaign colluding with the russians in order to help themselves there's the question of whether that tipped the election
trump which i think it's not actually an important point that as something that they're saying there there's a question of whether the trump organisation knew what they were doing was wrong or illegal there's a question of trumps financial problems there's the question of jared kushner financial problems which i find very very interesting and and the truth
is that for all that we know about this there's so much that we don't know right it's really actually hard to tell what the heck is going on and because muller's keeping things so close to that to the vast and also because congress has utterly failed to deal it's investigatory to do its job and investigate this as well if we had a bench
have congressional commissions that we're going after that it's really hard there's would presumably be leaking more and we have more information about this but we don't write this is quite the iceberg so like i think that the friedman you know idea is interesting but like who knows what the hell is going on there it's unless you have subpoena power and all of these
tax returns and all of these emails all of which we know he has am a i think that the unknown unknowns are so great here and it's why it's and sell excited for whenever he wrap this up with his you know like murderers row of of legal talent that he's assembled it's astonishing and i really you know we're kind of reading tea leaves right
well one of the things about the tea that were reading is how not only painstaking muller is it just seems like he is operating in a level no congressional committee has ever operated on an average user has he said
such skill and also in in both men were manner for it was busted for working on that op ed that was supposed to support him and right and what struck me about that is man he pay or listening to everything you do and that was true in the indictment of this lawyer who lied to scan nerves lawyer who lied
they basically had his emails and phone phone records and like they're watching and they have watched a lot and they've been watching for a while and so the and which i don't think congress could have gotten that can maybe even those authorities or managed the way day
it just seems like of an operating seems to so wholly so much more competent and also not just competent but also just skills at the international investigators just don't have going back to the indictment of the russian individual than the russian entities i think there's a there's a theological dispute about the name
such interference on one side there is people saying this is the worst attack on the united states since nine eleven it's an attack on the fundamental integrity of the electoral process
any honorable president any president who was fulfilling his duty is in the office would declare a national emergency and be convening hardening all our electoral systems and and holding constant public meetings about it and and working as as much as possible to prevent out
side interference that's one sided of the other side of it which i think articulated by marcia guessing very well was basically this was a kind of the standard disruptive up of the sort that the russians and the soviets had been doing for generations against the united states now using new technology and new
mechanisms not done particularly well done done by people whose english was he and his methods were okay and that fundamentally what was successful that they just identified fault lines in american life and expose them but those divisions and fault they didn't cause those divisions and fault line says divisions exist and they do
they multiply they increase their power slightly but the fact is that we wanted to believe the things that they were telling us and these in these trolling false post so that rather than panicking about russia is doing me to panic about our own civic disengagement and end
our own civic division
which of those two the views do you have any or maybe you can hold both of them simultaneously you can say is both a terrible attack and also really divided ray i mean a i think that both of those things eritrea and ultimately i think that the russian thoughts in the face by terrorists and all of this is sort of our falcon out here
the theft and the release of the emails the potential back scratching between the tramp campaign and the russian government the potential financial ties between right man for a separate from a separate from the factory the yeah exactly i actually think that the damn as possible response to this is the people that have been saying like wow the us as this
til
what does that matter at all so yeah the i think both of those things are true but again it's just like sort of one perhaps less important set of is the i mean it's it's bad it's a really really bad it said something really bad about facebook and twitter that they've let this happen and then a i do i think that there
this this this way in which we're not taking seriously enough in fact that there's these foreigners were messing with our elections it's awful even if it didn't have very much on in fact and even if it was like ham fisted he has basically facebook and twitter in our whole lives and the attention shredding we allow into our lives and embrace as a culture is basically the
that was put into our culture and that that has to do both with the way we spend our time but also the way we spend our political time is that we've kind of hooked ourselves into this ivy of emotional
craziness in fast news cycle and cable news and social media and with the russians did was they just switched out the bag
they just put in their bag of bad stuff but there is a pretty bad
bad going into the ivy already and i worried that the efforts to change get facebook to to monitor stuff better and get youtube just stopped allowed trending videos that are total hoaxes that's all good and important but there is a huge part of this that is us not giving into our worst emotionally
impulses about anything whether it's politics or just the way we're think about other people and i don't want the reckoning that has to take place on that front to to not take place because people are blaming the russians are youtube or whatever
right right no it's like there's already
this technology
the way that we relate to each other the division of the country already cause so much doubt and dissension in misery and people and so much kind of constant anxiety and monitoring of of perceived wrongs been done to you are perceived bronx been done to people who support that work
we're incredibly vulnerable to it and yeah i think that's very well put on a and
any i think it's good that you're drawing a distinction between the campaign that mahler's talking about which is the sort of social media disruption and separating that from the theft of emails and the the shady business dealings which are which are have a level of corruption and potential for disruption that i think are
really profound i think that there's this this question of electoral hacking that again is is not exactly what we're talking about when we're talking about these kind of disinformation grain and and got serious hacking a serious truly terrifying right and could actually really have an effect and it is where we're in an election year
to my knowledge and correct me if i'm wrong congress hasn't passed laws to do that in like to investigate and to try to prevent this from happening it hasn't hallowed twitter and facebook accountable for their role in this it's a funny conference and a bunch of right everything from this kind of like question of motivated reasoning and a hyper polarized police
local environment to the way in which we are just emotionally involved with these platforms that are terrible for our brain instead to to than this kind of modern day watergate sorry just to review this just i because i want to get this and my own head so as i hear you talking there
four different potential or four different kinds of disruption that that russia might have practice in the election one of which which has identified her maryland this indictment is basically using the tools of social media to cause dissension and right that's number one number two is actually hacking election system's going to after voter rolls yeah messing with things which we know there were some
effort at what we don't know what i'm gonna be honest i'm again yep third is the theft of emails from protest from the dancy rain and the distribution of those at timely moments train cause dismay and election fourth is the actual potential collusion between russian actors and
people in the term campaign and then fifth is whatever sort of shady financial dealings there may be between people connected to trump and russians right
i think those are all distinct semi distinct and all of our are semi distinct and a lot of it you know and then there this question and there's there's multiple actors with hand right manner for was and is unwise and reckitt isn't was just enormously corrupt but really is an amazing unkind and
you know and the evidence that we have it is fascinating question relates to what we're talking about earlier that there's just so much more to come out what about this
man two things as you potentially clothes off this topic is on his me see if i can follow this line of thought
it seems to me that if you are mental some russians and we should point out that part of what them the modern day and showed was that the russians helped metal on the left as well and particularly after president trump was elected that they started trying to agitate on the left to become part of the resistance if you are russians in the wanting to metal wouldn't you spend
your mental some dollars most effectively by essentially ginning up the left allowing them to elect a lot of officials who then presumably get the democrats trying to impeach the president at the very least get a democrat elected to gum up the operations
the federal government but that that would be you're smart play if you're an ideologically agnostic russian medlar so if that's the case shouldn't donald trump have a new reason to really care about this and that's my one point the second is that he in the reporting the new york times is done and that the wall street journal did about the president's alleged
she affair with the porn star
with the new york times is done in general is done is sketched out a thorough and extent system for of pay offs and manipulating and managing unpleasant information okay so if you had a system in place that was an operating several different times and is that
the case then when the russians work as we know trying to break into the and not break into but find common cause with the trump campaign
that instinct for doing things around the normal system i can't imagine that it wouldn't have kicked in somehow
and we don't have any evidence of that but i just think that we one of the things we also learned this last week is just how easily the president and his lawyers and other people kind of had this off the books system of dealing with things i want to close with actually one final point because russia has essentially felt no consequence for
digital warfare it is interfered in the business the internal doing to the estonia it interfered in georgia i suspect it interfered in ukraine electronically
it is the country's very happy to to engage in digital guerrilla warfare and has really not been punished in any meaningful way for and i wonder if there is any way to punish them because one of the things about digital warfare as it's very asymmetrical you are the if you are the
her power sure we can go and mess with the russian electoral system but what good would it do authority a corrupt system or we could we could
mess with do denial of service attacks to russian websites but their denial of service attack to an american website called so much more damage than anything we can do to them so is there anything you can do when someone is engaging and asymmetrical warfare against you
that we almost kind of forget when you just go back and look at what obama dead expelling the diplomats and raising the sanctions that she has tons of leverage to poll ray like tremendous financial sanctions the us can really hurt the russian economy
it has huge amounts of diplomatic threats and and the current administration just refuses to to do that congress could be doing more as well and there's been a choice not to and whoever is president after trump it's hard for me to imagine that they would end as a policy matter began getting google of postman after trampoline
i was told me that someday we can't continue with us for seven seven seven years from now

the twenty eighteen election got started for real this week there was early voting in texas's primaries the start of a nine month slog that will only feel like it's nine years long
the biggest news of the week was that mitt romney for presidential candidate former governor of massachusetts
business man savior of the two thousand to salt lake city olympics will run to succeed or and hatch
and the utah senate
early american senate from utah
retiring after serving for one hundred and forty three years and the senate
if romney accepted trumps endorsement despite a mixed history with the president which we can get into he he sharply he took he took trumps endorsement back in two thousand and twelve and romney it was running for president he's sharply criticized trumpet during the twenty sixteen campaign when trump
was elected he talked to trump about becoming a secretary of state but was thrown over for a killer send in what was it really cruel seemed like a really cruel intentional way by trump he has been very critical of president trumpet since he took office
but
it's fun to contemplate the idea of mitt romney in the senate i love mitt romney i think mitt romney is one of the great public servants in american life and he almost certainly will be elected if he is elected any is he likely to be it an opponent of trump islam or as you just going to be you know your standard issue
conservative senator from a western state i have to imagine that he is going to take that seriously and he is going to relish holding that trumped white house accountable if that is that is my guess he has a very pure public servant senators our house members are always weigh less powerful than you imagine and senators are more powerful there's not that much
any of them and and they have some pretty cool superpowers i think that he's going to take this job very seriously and i think that you have seen this kind of craven way in which are republicans on the hell have refused to have been excited about passing legislation and therefore have kind of abrogated
their their duty to ham and the executive and to investigate the white house and to use the tools at their disposal to enact change with the trump administration and i think that romney just being romney is going to go and be romney john one of the things that i liked reading about as i was reading about run is candace he was as i
have you talk and separatism which is basically when people say that they really mean mormon conservatism which is pro trade pro export largely pro immigrant were looking socially very conservative but very collegial and pretty good manners
and it's to me like when i think about what is the last hope for rapprochement in american politics i kind of think that utah conservatism
on the right and maybe maybe
virginia virginia democrats on the left that those are the models were there's a possibility that there hope that there's still some kind of sense that we can work together there's some sense of collegiality some sense that
you know we're going to manage this
to share that hope i like that you know i'm basically share that hope for mankind but i like where you have them
where you you have placed it so the question though then is how does that really play how does that really play out and work because in order to utah democrat a huge heart republicans to convince the rest of their colleagues they have to really convince the voters vote for their colleagues and that my primary their colleagues
into doing in into not supporting primary candidate against their fellow republicans and the reason that's interesting is in this context is that watching mitt romney's behavior from now until
convention in utah will be interesting you remember that mike leigh beat out senator bennett of utah by being the conservative candidate the idea being that washington can pitch leaders had sold out there conservative roots
romney and this is why i think one of the reasons he's running this like super local utah campaign doesn't want to be a national campaign doesn't want to be a
at war with donald trump is he wants to get through his party's nominating convention and then once he does that then we'll see what you know how he changes but the big challenge for your vision is the difficulty with the primary system
that that hold so many other
he's colleagues and there's a there's a less very passionate version on the democratic side it just isn't it isn't the same and the political scientists who looked at it the two parties have gotten more ideological but the republican party since nineteen ninety four has gotten very much more ideological them
democratic party has moved left and has also instituted with the whole structure around it
a group
go way back to nineteen ninety two and bush's signing or nineteen ninety and bush's signing of the of
of the budget where there is a process in place for extricating from the party
those who have gone against party orthodoxy and doing so through the primaries to any there's one aspect of romney running that really troubles me which is that he is a seventy year old running proceed he's going to squeeze out somebody younger mcmullan forget about an over and was thinking of running but i imagine he was thinking of running
isn't that a shame to have somebody that old taking a seat
hatch is already hatches
he's probably eighty five or something rain from me
served two terms will be in his mid eighties bow tie me that of office right
he might be the healthiest man in america right yeah never touched a drop of alcohol doesn't drink coffee and in the most amazing statistic have ever learned the average mormon man that's ten years longer than the average american yeah that's amazing i'm not surprised to hear it they are at their have very clean living folks yeah i mean
and i think related to that point
congress looks nothing like the united states
it is not at all even close to demographically represented as it is older it is more male it is richer it is whiter there been at the same time just a tremendous number of younger candidates and especially women that are signing up to run for office and have been very motivated by the trump presidency to do so
so it's funny running is actually really out of step with that broader trend which i think has a really exciting one that's bringing all of these new candidates and getting them to to to sign up and so he will he'll come into a congress that that will be more female hopefully younger than this current congress has an exaggerated example
of what you see in other states i actually suspect he's just going to romney himself he's going to hate it i don't control what you were saying i'm mentally ill any i think he he's only been executive and his life
he likes being an executive he likes running things the senate is pure posturing it is and that's to me is what actually he's worse than reason why he wasn't elected president
but he's a he's a technocrat and he is a deeply principled percent and so where he i think it might be successful you can imagine him being like a real thorn and mitch mcconnell side and actually refusing to vote for things and last policy changes are enacted and that's the thing is republicans have generally lined up
vote for balance without it's interesting you know there is that that ruby only provision to expand the child tax credit that they didn't actually incest got on that legislation friend stance and i i think i'll be interesting to see how how maverick he he sees their done
can we turn to the overall twenty eighteen picture for democrats because there was a democrats had been feeling extremely optimistic about what was going on until about a month ago and then about a month ago i think there was a sense well american seem to like this tax cut that's gone through and the generic ballot moved back
slightly towards republicans although still heavily in the democrats favor
you know in the last week there's now been a retreat in the president's approval rating i think the generic it is looking slightly more democratic again what's your sense about about where we are
well i i think it's you know to preclude were long way away i think one thing that is still true if we look at the one constant in american politics right now it is that the president is impulsive and
and used consistently engaging in behavior that riles up and access it turned out mechanism for the democratic base and then now we have events doing that as well so you have there's the gun question which will potentially turn out younger voters it also is
it's a very tricky issue for suburban women voters both democrats as a motivator and then for republicans turning them off now you gotta go state by state and look at to places that it's going to matter
north dakota is a different kind of state as your indiana in terms of the size share and number of of suburban women voters so you're gonna be really specific and a lot of these these races the map is still very good for republicans on the senate side you've got a lot of democrats or income is running in red states that president trump one by
big numbers on the other hand it's easier to nationalize a race and a senate race and nationalizing and for democrats means basically using the president so but that's a constant is the extent to which has a turn out mechanism for democrats and they needed in off year elections because their voters tend to turn out and smaller numbers then republicans are it's harder to turn out democrats
the republicans nothing about the tax cut that i wonder about republicans based on the ones i've talked to think that this is going to be the message both hey we delivered on what you want to with tax cuts and don't like democrats because they'll mess everything up i think in and that will be the big counter argument to try to get republicans to turn out which is yes you may not
like the president but you really don't like nancy pelosi they use that successfully in the georgia special but i don't know how that all plays out
that's what i feel i can we actually it any can we dig into an antibiotic question for a second because i find myself genuinely ambivalent about which is clearly a politician of enormous skill she's she's served very effectively and honorably for thirty years
whoever is the democrats leader in the house is going to have a target on her back no matter who it is so obviously the people talk about the pelosi policies leadership if it were person why they would talk about appropriate person wise leadership conservatives denigrate it on the other hand a she's lead the democrats for twelve years i think in the
wisdom versus calif of occasion chart that we all go through effectiveness versus qualification like you know you can really get good and good and good at a job and then at some point you become less good because you're sort of qualified and you're walking away for younger people right i think she should get out she surely is not as effective as somebody who came in and had a great strong seven years and is why the new
york times cycle through its editors at seventy
get some new blood right yeah i mean i think that both at the things that true she is an enormously effective legislator when you go back to that really brief window in which they passed just really remarkable legislation and i think we sometimes forget that has also past can trade you know she she got that
approximately every last one pennsylvania and downs and the track of the guys left mothers
in and fans
every second counts
see the life
remarks on a visiting paid back size of the night
people with pennsylvania taxpayer dollars group of people to take them enormously heart valves they passed the affordable care act
the majority and they lost their but you already a porsche which was perhaps inevitable they knew all that i down
slamming shut be at it is true also that she has been there so long that you've repeatedly seen his congressional talent in some cases even just leaving congress because they're not gonna be able to rise up you know i don't think that she's going anywhere i don't know how much she is going to hurt the parties prospect by remaining there i do know how much
he will relish her role as as speaker and and that democrats take back the house i can't even imagine how happy she is going to be and also how fast and nothing that would be her but how fast donald tribes tax returns are quite a row
get leaked wasn't had happened and how can they do it all now
have subpoena power i don't i'm just guessing that that will happen and i'll be really excited in new york state of her force is tax returns and yorkshire it's i actually haven't liked because you know there's been a number of states that have sad that in order to run in the state you have to release your tax return i haven't followed up on what happened with that more broadly in terms of the economic
message i think that republican messaging on its tax bill which was enormously and popular when it passed has actually been really pretty axel and they're going to go to folks and they're going to say you all got a tax cut this year go take a lack the economy is doing better than i'd ever has been since the nineties or whatever and i think it's going to be hard for democrats to count
that message by saying while the tax cut was really for and this is this is completely accurate the tax had primarily benefited corporations and rich people economy is doing well right now in the event that there's any softening and at i think that that's going to be really catastrophic and i'm not sure that republicans are going to have a good answer for that they sort of relying on this kind of quiet
what great economy where people are really starting to get res as to save them some of these kind of controversial seats
let's go to cocktail shatter john when you are
sitting on a in a manhattan speak easy squeaking easily speaking freely what will you be chattering about to your bar side neighbor
i will be chattering about the new book educated by a terrorist over which just came out this week which i read and we had her on the show and it's just it's it's a fantastic book about a woman he grows up in the mountains of idaho her father is a survivalist she was sort of home schooled but mostly she work
to in the in her father's junkyard
it's very well done very well told and story of her essentially escaping from her family and when i found most interesting was it's obviously a super highly particular tale of a of a person who grows up in the house where you have go bags which were
full of supplies and ammunition in case the government came after them the way they did randy weaver it ruby ridge and yet the the crisis she goes through trying to extricate herself through this family which is a fundamentalist mormon family and the insanity she feels she basically goes she has a nervous breakdown
when she she goes to b y u and then ultimately goes to cambridge
the insanity she describes the the wagon the circling of her family and the group felt like it had a lot of echoes with the other stories we've heard of people who are trying to tell their stories about abuse of for form or another
ended up doubting themselves ended up having to fight through weather is the us olympic committee or machine stay in the case of learning answer the olympics doctor or hollywood or any of these other areas where where the media where where people circle the wagons that felt like this particular story offered insight into
that kind of crisis
anyway it's just it's very well done and and a good read any what does your chatter chatter i love the olympics so much and have been utterly delighted the story of elizabeth sweeney who has a member of the hungarian shame
as go after she has gripped her so she got to the olympics both his signing up for all of these half pipe skiing events in which suggest what wouldn't crash and therefore you know she would come in like eleventh or something manages to get to the olympics on the hungarian ski team after i believe they previously she a try
had to get their way with venezuela
mr forman to venezuela skeletons you try to get it skills and ten and how
he's amazing likeable and there's here she puts out there half pipe performance in which she just kind of like makes like a nice per apple and has absolutely no tricks
and it is so delicious and insane and completely crazy let's you just scammed her way into the olympics i love it so much i cannot tell you enough how much i recommend going and watching her run will put a link on the website so that everybody can take in the wonder and it's it's so much funnier
for the fact that she's just careful about it she's like not crashing she's not even trying to do any tricks or anything i cried laughing
and she's i think a despicable person but i'm not really sure i actually tried to run for governor of california wow
must have been a single actually a platform she's she's just somebody who who needs to draw attention to her so she was probably your harvard plus also she remembered as the worse she
definitely
any larry david floods
listener and possibly a little the swimming
i heard it's appalling i i have so many thoughts about that but i'm just going to save them
my chatter one of my problems
really small problem is that i have a hard time falling asleep at night because usually if i want to watch television television and so exciting there's only so much so much drama in anything you want to watch so it's
murder earth like a serial killer the pool with the that pick this week or whatever it is and i get very agitated and so at the end of the evening you want to fall asleep and instead your filled with to buy the the television you've just been watching i have found a solution to that fortunately which is that just happened on planet
earth to
which i never saw planet earth one which sure also get the blender to is the series married by david attenborough about the creatures the earth and divided up into geographical areas there's one about islands which one but desert ceremony but grasslands it is will calm the mind to the spirit
which the spider monkey that spider monkey little spider monkeys are going to fall out of the tree or it going to be rescued by a spider monkey dad is that snow leopard mom and that snow leopard mom and her snow leopard child her snow leopard daughter they can i have a family reunion one day or not what's going to happen
it's just incredible it's beautiful i mean other problems with it it doesn't kind of contemplation climate change it doesn't contemplate the human effect on on these animals lives
and i think it probably invents narratives that it meant story is probably aren't naturally there but it is just gorgeous and incredibly relaxing and hundred or two and good unsuitable for family viewing which is not always you know i mean it's good together the family around and watch that is a good thought
that is or shephard a day the earth is produced by joslin frank or researcher is easy road just and just gave herself a high five that's nice

president trump a zero sum mercantilist in his bones split the country and entirely new way this week returning to a favorite campaign subject
a big where he's actually been consistent he policy views that have held steady the nineteen eighties i believe seems to be his core fundamental belief about policy
i'm headed notion of protectionism and mercantilism us though he and now would you tell people it mercantilism is mercantilism is is is the
economic principle in a butcher this and all or economists listening will can correct me the economic school of thought that
existed really before adam smith came along before before the ideas of a freer markets and the division of labour came along which held that a country was richest by hoarding its own gold by making everything itself by trading as little as possible with its partners right being entirely self sufficient on
a to close closed system and then you have everything yourself you don't have to rely on other nation right right we don't make other nations rich you don't get them rich by giving you giving them your money
this attaches in goods and services in away with the immigration policy to in terms of just to kind of wall theory of the having a whale yeah yet
he really didn't obviously it is entirely at odds with the world order that emerged after world war two in which there was this notion that nations would be better off in a collective on
stable regime of treating everybody benefits remember all trading with each other more the world is like one giant producer and museum and it creates also in addition to creating economic benefit it creates political and
oh no military or non military which is that you're much less likely to go to war over the country where you have economic relationship right and in the wake of world war two we adopted the world adopted that system deliberately in order to try to prevent another world war so now we are going to that cutting and frame our ties so the president announced that he would impose twenty five per
tariffs on imported steel ten percent tariffs on imported aluminum as we were taping on thursday morning is planning to sign them today
president of course has said
most notoriously that there's the trade wars are good and easy to win
their reactions to his announcement about tariffs have come fast and furious and stock market dropped instantly after he announced them out some sort of spontaneously incidentally was sort of it was did not appear to have been a highly well thought out
scheme his top economic advisors the chair of his national council garrett cone resigned the european union announced that they may well be retaliatory tariffs levy against bourbon and motorcycles and orange juice which is wonderful set of things to love it
as meantime highly entertaining running at my house
there was a deliberate kentucky is the home of bourbon whereas senate majority leader mitch mcconnell is the motorcycles are like denials friend paul ryan's district etc an orange juices florida swing state and republicans and congress or see the over these corrupt so john
you just we just saw you interview been sas about this but this is the president's most consistent position isn't should we be surprised that he actually follow through on a it's most consistent position perhaps after immigration
what's interesting hearing with superintendent on immigration is that he can move unilaterally and there is a feeling going back to the gary cone and slapdash nature of the way to put together and i think you put this in when you're evaluating the nature of the president's leadership you put this in the basket with the trans gender decision on the military and also with the first travel ban which is a kind of
slap dash effort meant to show that action is being taken on key priorities
so this is something the president can grab and do and show that he's moving on his relatives and but both the difference with the gender benders that actually a trans gender and the military and on in this case the secretary of commerce is trade representative and is some of the key economic advisors do what do but then the treasury secretary and his top deck and i mean when they just don't
and the secretary of defense ends and state don't want it to unless we those particularly time because the justification nice anglia orange he has no new ideas and this remarkable this guy i mean the justification legally that wilbur asked the commerce and day and the president had put forward is that this is
our national security industry that we need to bolster our steel industry and get mad as our secretary of defense is saying actually there are national security threats for alienating our allies and this and attacking them and us my prison is using his section two thirty two of the trade expansion active nine hundred and sixty two
so that is a little loon corner of this trade law and will the idea behind to trade law and we want to get back to the economics the david and set up in the first place but this goes to emily's point and goes to the sort of really circuitous route to president is trying and using and this by the way using circuitous route to achieve policy goals by other means
used to be something that conservatives railed about with previous administrations because of course that's not what the president is supposed to do you of use laws in ways in which they were not intended in the idea is basically should the u s get into a real war with weapons that means a lot of steel and aluminum they don't want to be in a negative position
to not be able to produce steel and aluminum now are not be able to produce the weapons of war with these materials now the first problem is a mexico china and south korea who provide us with a lot of our weaponry
would be unlikely to stop doing so in the case of a war that's the first thing so it's not a real threat secondly those countries that we would need in client or those are the kinds of countries in addition to the european nations that are that are hurt by this who we would need in live war and third of all we still produce a majority of our own still yeah i instantly enough to take care of the needs of a war and forth of
all the president almost never publicly justifies his actions using section two thirty two he he justifies it on the grounds that david talked about earlier which he's welcome to do but he can't do it should or should not be available to you if your argument is you're doing for national security reasons so he's kind of giving up the game
sometimes he argues it on economic grounds he's giving up the fact that it's obvious that he's doing this for economic reasons and not national security reason and i think also i mean these tasks are not a major factor in the global economy or even the us economy and so the reason there's been a strong reaction to them is this fear of a slippery slope and the national security
justification vacation is part of that story of okay well then what if other countries start invoking their national security interests or trade barriers and what if we get sued by under the rules of the world trade organization and then the trump administration either pulls out of the w t o or ignores the ruling they're all these are we on the brink
of this kind of a large or a trade war questions that i think in some ways are overshadowing the actual all right
magnitude of these have encouraged me one political point which is this is speculation and so should be treated as such good if you look at the fight that the president is picking here and what he is doing with immigration in california and the fact you may travel to california to kind of press this idea that california is sanctuary state
essentially is you see him engaging at least in those cases him to public fights in which as the defender of his positions he can research is connection with his base so it feels like this is all based maintenance
which is shocking it may just be psychological maintenance i want to do stuff i want to be fighting the fights i came into fight but if it is to the extended his base maintenance then it suggests something that we haven't much scene which is actual erosion in the base that needs tending before you know there was the idea the base would never move ever if these are in some ways
offered his way to ten the base then that gives you some sense of really how tough his political straits are not his approval ratings down but even even having to pretend to think it's much more likely john
psychological reassurance for him rather than some grand political strategy i knew somebody who he just needs to be from
i think that
yeah way that i think you're right and also they they're not mutually exclusive
tending to his base also makes him
and i know this because he said it makes him feel psychologically up also there's the eighteenth district
special i yam pennsylvania ray were in this particular place seeming to defend the jobs of co workers is popular and so islander if that's that's strategic element here and then actually that's a perfectly smart thing to do that
it's close but it's seen as rad republican territory and if kind of lamb the democratic challenge or loses that race on this kind of pro union platform that he is running on that will be hailed as a bellwether for a tramp and republican so even if that's what he gets out of that's that's like a short term gain a good point why do you think it is
way to that question which she's going to answer himself first
trump has this view about trade because some people said oh trump has being dragged to this by peter navarro is
economic advisor and by wilbur roth
the trump has been pulled to the but no with is clearly trump has held the news himself for that that wouldn't have our and ross what he's done he's found people who will agree with him and that's why he's elevator them within his administration
in my view about why if it
that japan and nineteen eighty know when well
well that's probably part of it he is a real estate developer and real estate development as i think we've talked about on the show work differently than other forms of economic that and real estate only one person actually can zero some develop something right so if i get the right to develop the land you don't it's not something where we both mutually can do with animals
mutually benefit and and i think that that's not really had a wrestler global economy works the wrestler global economy has these highly interlinked supply change and and divisions of labor and that trumps this is a case where trumps own intelligence and his own success in his business i very rarely
has led him to make conclusions about economics generally that are completely misguided his business experience is the wrong kind of experience because it's based in this list
particular field where the rules of global economics don't really apply way in and of course if i mean he doesn't have to be banned favour by that feeling yet he seems to be he's been fixated on on the trade deficit for a long time rain and one imagines that originally it was this nice club that he was beating president
obama author or whoever was an office that he was angry and and now he's looking at the same numbers in a position to try to do something about it and so he's propelled by that same instinct and i think the other thing is this is an issue in which essentially almost every expert aligns in favor of free trade
and abundant global economy including most republicans sort of acquire conservative principal and he likes to take positions sometimes where he just says of all the experts are wrong i know that because i was elected netherlands that i was going to lose and use it of feel this like is shaking defiance of expertise hear what what's interesting is what he
goes to the mat for and then also what congress goes to the mat for and so congress one hundred republican members have written letter a with the president saying don't do this
efforts to try and perhaps perhaps block him with legislation and it seems to me it sets a benchmark for a presidential effort looks like you know so how hard ovaries he for this and then compare that to other things he says he's concerned about like say school safety and legislation in reaction to the the shooting in portland so as he throne
his back into that as much and if he hasn't why hasn't he and what percentage of energy does he do for these other things relative to this where we see him so active and engaged and then the opposite is true for congress here republicans really motivated and work and hard to press against their president so this sense a bar for the level of n
energy to exert now when they don't exert
that amount of energy for other issues and that gives us some indication how much they really do care about those other issues they say they might care about
do you think it matters that derek i'm left it his departure meaning fallen anyway it doesn't it depend who he is replay a strength and mean if he has replaced by someone who shares his pro free trade views than his particular president seems less important whereas if some you know anti trade web ask you don't allow tape comes and and that seems like a signal
again loss the see at the table i mean in terms of gary can personally and whether were supposed to give him credit for walking out the door it seems to me
you know when you take a stand of conscience about terrorists that you weren't willing to take in the wake of charlottesville are concerned totally disagree really why because charlottesville is not his business charlottesville is not that's not his department he is that his job is to be the economic advisor to the program his job is to give the present the best economic advice and to try to
get the best economic policy and if the president then like so willfully ignores what he believes what he thinks with right then you should leave the president says terrible things and is a racist and and a rabble rouser that's really bad and no one should serve him but the idea of the economic advisor has a special responsibility to quit after charlotte
but the stay after after his his his entire race on get her is is cut from under him comes to me crazy i agree that you didn't have a special responsibility but there was this sort of i think deliberate effort to cast him his troubled by the kind of both sides as and after charlottesville and
because he's jewish that seemed to resonate in some way and he didn't do anything so the fact that he's leaving now after by the way his cashed in his two hundred ninety four million dollars in stock options that you know he got a special deal with in order to serve which is allow we do have to allow a lot of people severed the government that taking a big loss i just in sort
what do you think about gary cone in the world doesn't move me very much
any might also have resigned not necessarily because he was taking a huge stand on trade but just kind of like he got gotten the tax cut bill helped get it passed he's kind of worn out and this is this is a way house when it's a really hard it ain't easy and so is kind of like you know why what's the benefit of sticking around i think the larger point though is of
course when you look at the total pace of departures from the white house it's extraordinary it's three times the pace of the obama administration twice the pace of the reagan administration and that was those no problem with their head their the number as tray and those numbers were even those are those are child low numbers because those numbers don't take into account who picks leading and also a whole bunch
people who have left so much quietly it doesn't take him when he does run porter burn a whole bunch of the blue kind of go in and been pushed down so this is currently clearance other and so are all the job they didn't fill right
that's it i can't leave and that's a great only ever been raided the turnover of a smaller bench but but you so the question what's interesting there to me as a back to this notion of businessman it was always misshapen appalachian to say that you have a businessman and the white house because he's not a businessman of the people meant when they talked about bringing business argument to the white house
a businessman from a huge corporation us to do with management issues and all of that that's different than what president trump is whatever company it was this kind of turnover in a company if it were a public company the share would be trading at about a half a nickel because it's a sign of chaos and the other thing is how do you recruit people i mean it was chaotic and the administration for
early days but there were a lot of people who said it's my duty to the country even though this is crazy i've gotta hang in there but now after more than a year and all this chaos and the what it's done with the reputations of the various people who stuck their neck out for the present only and only to have themselves undermined not to mention big legal fees is robert mother asks to talk to them
do so what what that is not a clarion call that people are in a rush to the employment office to sign up and so then it gets new are really troubling problem because people will get the white house and i think you can make a case if you look at what the president has achieved on taxes if you're a fan of tax cuts then he's done what you want he has gotten
some movement on north korea maybe it's not going to lead to a peace talks but he's gotten some movement on north korea you can make a case if you're apt to support republican candidates that he's gotten some things done and yes it's a circus but the problem then when you talk to students of the white house and you know people worked in previous white house is the reason you need a place to be organized efficiently
is that all presidents are surprised by some big crisis and you need to have the system in place and working so that when the crisis hits you have adults in place you have norms in place and even in under those circumstances it's hell so in this case you have chaos how do you handle that inevitable crisis when it comes
bernard
i want to add one final corner on the tariff korea which is what don't think i found so demoralizing about president this is consistent ability to alienate the people who should be our friends and a friend that people should be our enemies and he's tariffs are classic example of that which is the countries that are most likely to be hurt by this i'm in canada mexico have been temporarily
buchanan mexico to be hit very hard those are two closest allies and many ways certainly our neighbors europe is being hit hard by this or if not our best friends or second best friends and china and russia which are global adversaries are closest things we have are not really
damage at all and it's just and then this is crazy weird blow back around call i don't know if your father's that a lot of steel that has made overseas friends do you assess to his all planned this it's made using high quality us call and so if we are making that steel less attractive
that coal suddenly has value on a marketer their been less demand for that call and therefore the very people the trump has talked about endlessly these coal miners are going to be harmed by it
i mean i think you're going back to your point i might the beginning which is that actually is tariffs are really small beer and the real problem is if they spill into patel asian and there's a lot more of them but that even even within that and and like small beer
no made an incomplete my yes ninety seven percent of the american jobs that depend on steel and downstream industries they're not actually produced and is still a need the cheaper still that's coming from canada or mexico your at etc it just the winners and losers don't even line operate like if these were that forgotten americans and they were willing when winning you could say
but you know if you wanted to help the steel workers who are losing their jobs in pennsylvania in indiana you could have programs where are the government comes in and supports their salaries and some way right there like targeted aid for those people that is not damaging to lots of other working class americans of course we

this week's chaos update you make a care about
that's not for personally
you like to tape that they did it did it did they know you're much better
those inside
land was unclear what you want around men to the next thirty days or the lasers soon we it was for
something else anyway
but you know
under three sound right
so this week's cares update
did it did it
figures and talk he had legal action all kinds of friends all of it weird family family berg a former term campaign aide
of erratic
reddick behavior
under to get bizarre media tour to announce his plan now abandoned planned to defy a subpoena for special counsel muller
there this crazy story in new york times on today thursday about president talking to witnesses who have been speaking to mahler and potentially tampering with although it seems like a strong word enlist you're really not supposed to do that
actually can we will go was india and will get to and then and then probably oh i forgot kelly and conway was accused of hatch checked violations to criminal violations of the hijacked which nothing will happened about that but the main the main trump legal chaos of the week was around former president or pair more are pretty presidential para more store
daniels the porn actress who sued the president this week to avoid the ended and undisclosed argument she had with him to stay silent about that you know a fair the india which was part of an agreement but she was paid one hundred thirty thousand dollars electrically by the president lawyer michael cohen and they're also comes news that
the president's lawyer in fact one in arbitration against her to forbid her from from breaking that and beer and it's very it's quite hard to follow all of this but oh buddy of mine and i'm happy because it took me back to my contacts okay so mm that's grim when was the arbitration by
the way heard in my last week yeah and he won it
yeah he won that she wasn't supposed to do exactly what she did which was file public lawsuit on instead of going into a secret binding arbitration about the terms of the non disclosure agreement icy and so tell us about what this lawsuit sane and why if she's not allowed to file a lawsuit why would she fall off
and if it's one of the mean to not be allowed to file a lawsuit
and then to go ahead and file or well as her she and her later decided not to listen to the arbitrator they didn't like the answer i mean the lawsuit
is it's both a stand and it also is possible it's going to expose this contract as a total fraud and so i'm gonna live for the most part here on sat abramson who has this excellent long and twitter thread about our death so
it seems like if she was worried about the ending a being enforced she was worried that trump or or this fake el al see that michael cohen said we're going to sue her and make her pay a million dollars because that's that
the penalty then she would not be bringing a sausage she would not be talking about this affair
nobody would be doing that but she is banking on none of that happening because in order to enforce the terms of the contract someone has to come forward and say like we signed the contract and we have some rights to protect here so that sort of and then the other thing is michael colonies and south come forward and made statements about this agreement that would seem to also be in violation of
the endear then there's also this great concern to interrupt so she she's betting on there not being somebody willing to actually see her to to enforce their send in get a judgment against her because for trump to see her you trumpet have to say i'm a contract for cohen to see where he'd say i'm party the contract
and for anyone to they'd have to expose themselves to discovery in a lawsuit and bringing publicity more publicity on to it so therefore she would she thinks there won't be a lawsuit potential way and her excuse for find it is that trump are never signed that contract now that's really kind of on
not doesn't look like stone grounds to worry about the validity of the contract because and now i am invoking a first year contracts and lost all contact is off our acceptance consideration like some form of payment and then taking that payment and that happened in this case so the simple missing signature probably doesn't invalidate the contract however
there are many other potential problems at this contract that we can or cannot get into also forgotten also if you abide by the terms of the contract you take the money and then you abide by the terms the country aren't you essentially saying is a valid contract yeah the only ski ski lift tickets he lived through they at the and get same right how
it's very strange contract because of michael collins efforts to distance trump and really himself from this contract their these weird and or clauses about who is binding on and if and cohen is telling so it's also not clear that trump knew about this contract right so if that's true
if cohen never told trump about the contract well that's a clear violation of the ethical rules for lawyers in new york state you don't go around signing contracts for clients i don't know about and also of trump didn't know about it then there was no meaning of the mines that's an essential ingredient of a contract both parties to the contract have to understand what's going on what their do
didn't wasn't cones original position that it was just contract between ham and stormy day and yours he was jumping in front of this thread stormy daniels trump to know anything about it he went did it himself but then what was revealed this week i believe is that there's a side letter in which the pseudonyms used in the agreement are them attached to the actual
people in the agreement and that that's why that's the way in which the president gets attached to this process so it's not just between conan daniels that so the president trump gates and lane and then the signature lions have this additional oddity which is that they talk about the e c l l c they got set up it's not but but
no point is colin sign the contract as trumps layer so it's not really clear who he is and then the other underlying legal problem here is the idea that right before an election someone pays hush money to someone else i mean this got john edwards in dated when that happened right he also had an affair that the national
i enquire was interested in and he also had a supporter who paid off the woman he had the affair with and the you got in big trouble for that i don't really see why this is just friend that a campaign finance violation in his cares yeah but isn't this pretend to know a used campaign money or something and i felt there was sorry that i may be messing it up with no no i think it was
a campaign support array but it shouldn't really matter if cullen need this payment essentially because of the election your them until you can i take i take a very different on which is that i have been unable to determine what the staging of the contacts between daniels and cohen are and so
and how it happened i may be wrong or least slightly off his but to me story daniels is blackmail or terminals has blackmail donald trump and don't trump has done the thing that many people do and they're being blackmailed which is he's paid off the person was blackmailing him and he's done it potentially through which chicanery with
a way that violated campaign finance laws that was it legal but basically he was trying to allay risk about it a fair perfectly legal affair that he had with somebody ten years earlier when when he was president and and his own sexual partners which he didn't want exposed to the world
maybe because he thought it would hurt his chances for election maybe thought it would be embarrassing and so we paid her off and i find the sympathy for story daniels or the or the glee about what she's doing to be very unseemly and misguided like that it's that she is a villain in this to my mind like i don't see well i don't see why we should celebrate what she'd done or be happy
or to feel that this is even a legitimate path for public inquiry any more in maybe the he's ended up breaking the law and michael cohen end up breaking the law but the end up breaking the law basically because they were being black well being blackmailed and then also trying to silence a woman with whom you had an affair with that's just think to term is for the same thing right i mean stymied
daniels on you know hand doesn't leave she telling the truth valuable pieces of information and your rate that she sold them but also in this moment right now much were really rethinking of these non disclosure agreements and the social costs that they bring to bear because and this is in this is not sexual harassment that's it you're going to say that
was a consensual relationship so it's not right in the non disclosure agreement was not something she signed before she had the affair with something that she did afterwards as part of the blackmail agreement way but it also seems clear there was like an enormous power imbalance here she had a terrible liar i mean she should have first of all gotten the love or money from us
absurd
the words and she's gotten a lot more money because she had an affair with the present that she was threatening to reveal that it's it's it's it isn't as as voters as citizens the idea that this bit of information should be commerce that people should be allowed to use this to exploit it and to and to blackmail a presidential candidate over seems to me
disgusting like really
in the sense that it seems like it was worth a lot more on given the stakes bed when i'm also sorry go ahead newman
let me complicate things a little for further which is what if she saw it when she's learning what if there was no her yeah but don't think that like their pictures of them together there's some corroborating evidence is today
all different play i don't think anyone thinks she's lying does it matter if you liner
it's just imagine
our fearless and yeah insert your favorite candidate ever and then somebody comes forward and says i had this affair and you know you're trying to rid of it before the election comes i'm just trying to make it is sort of adding more sympathy to david's argument it seems meets and additionally sympathetic if you change the facts and now and then it's much easier to come down and eight
it's sad but i'm not going to do that
you're saying crazy things and why
encourage people to pay off the other people with him they have affairs right that's not i don't see how that's like some morally upright yes it's legal they signed a contract which was supposed to be binding though it probably only
the center because she blocked because while but i just think the term black now i mean i see why you're using it here but i it's this very morally loaded term for we had an affair i could go and talk about it you don't want me to write i mean another way of thinking about this is like this is a woman who has irrelevant piece of information about a president
talk hand at that could factor into how voter see him and we would have been better off hearing that story before oil election and then you'd say yes it would be we would be better off here it would be good if there were journalistic investigation of the idea that sexual relationships that people had before before there were president before they were presidential campaign
it should be used traded for economic value in this way
growth and disturbing and i think sets a precedent that we don't like i don't think john edwards
should have been prosecuted i think when you when you've done something you've done something sex i am baroness ambient light doesn't actually have a special power know they don't get a special have a lot yes but you also a morally loaded basically kind of yes if you've done something if you've committed a sin which is going to be hugely embarrassing it should not surprise us
people will lie about it and they will pay money to make it go away and then two then fine crime or to find criminal responsibility and that seems to me like like a shitty way to find crime it doesn't
this is the same problem that we will when work clinton gets nothing for lying to to to the grand jury about scaring different things by i mean it of course he's going to lie to the grand jury hush hush money though he didn't have a chance to pay hush money isn't an option or perhaps but but i do think it is
important here that there are campaign finance laws that fair rules about contributions and that's what as far as i can tell where we're wondering about whether was bad valid it and then the other thing is if you are going to signs to contract then you better make sure it's airtight and have good lawyers worked on it really really felt that time to i intend to
side and david on the whole initial blackmail as being the in the original sin of this but i don't but i don't think given where we are now i do think this is actually just fascinating and as a political matter it's it's it's relevant not just because it's the president but because one of the challenges for any republican candidate who will
himself so closely with the evangelical voters is there's a history of claiming that the president and his baby or in office but also throughout his whole life said tomorrow example for the country and so now that this is out there were where is everybody stand on that question they need to ignore it because it isn't their transactions interests to do so
the and then that's an interesting fact because we're talking years presumably about immutable virtues values and since now question for you and me this question of arbitration i'm just trying to figure out who's strategy went right or wrong
he was there an act that story daniels took before before cohen tried to
keep her quiet or was it just that she was talking and he was worried she might take illegal act was there a illegal act he was responding to all yeah i mean a month or two ago the wall street journal ran a story about this affair and this contract and then found the secret our see that con ed set up and then she started talking without talk
rage he started going on and saying i can't talk about this affair
gee now i'm going to go perform in las vegas do you wanna come right and she also said or somebody said on her behalf that she thought that because cohen was talking about it and had avoided the region yeah continental language and layers they're a part of it and the non sign but that was aisle outside of the legal around missouri anything she did in the legal realm to precipitate cohen doing what he
did i don't think so but it's all connected because it's an end yeah she by going going public not quite right
as publicity happened then that could potentially violates the end so then it was presumably yeah we know that it was cohen or whoever is representing this fake l see that went to the the secret arbitrator it was just trying to come to some conclusion about we know that the president has been either litigious or has threaten
nation is a strategy throughout his career and he sounded as president as well and they use and misuse and thread and not thread with litigation has been a strategy and and tool and cohen because it's his lawyers been a part of that and i'm wondering if in this case cohen lose essentially trying to threaten her by calling for this arbitration is using a well worn play
from the playbook yet in this case has landed him in it's a sticky spot because then to have it adjudicated in courts
answers those fact questions which are at issue here which just say was the president in fact involved and i mean rate luck i think it's a stand for daniels and her layer to take it at the courts they're using this lawsuit to publicize facts that pursuant to the end they're not allowed to publicize and a binding arbitrator told them that so in that
sense like you know that if you to take a step back and the way you're doing by invoking this pattern of trumps pro that his reviews of litigation when we go back to trump university he was incredibly aggressive about suing people who said they had damaged by that program their ideas you know
sturm und drang libel law suits that he's brought in the past he isn't it has been an aggressive use user of the courts and so in the sense that there's like a hoisted on your own that hired as this one hundred percent that i was a retard hunting the and also do you think that the the power has flipped on him that he used to be because he wasn't the
president because he had more money
he was able to use the courts in one way and now he can't now he's suddenly that got only medicare and we had seen that in the champ university where he had sat i'm not satellite am not settling on the saber rattling and then they came and they settled right so now we're seeing that again and then you also seeing what happens when you surround yourself with people who perhaps are not actually the best profession
that's where you have someone like michael cohen signing up a contract that than contacts layer goes through and finds like a lot of flaws with even if the problem isn't that you didn't sign the contract so where does this go next and don't so we had a stormy to his lawyer on
as this morning and i said basically using a judge can say to you
sorry to like that
off offer this and why does the country have to suffer through this ugly lawsuit because this is the country because it is the president united states and his his job will be somewhat interrupted just so your client can profit by selling your story which is what she wants to do he denied that she was going to sell it but not so sure they i mean look the gamble is that trump on in four
the contract that there will be ways first army daniels and this layer i think to make money from it perhaps though the indirect somehow maybe she will open up the line of clothing or whatever raid i mean they're all kinds of ways to make money from becoming notorious i meant to use the word notoriety which some like that different bailiff valence from notorious anyway there
many ways for her to try to use her notoriety and were seen some element of that again this is what happens and you surround yourself with the best people are one last question on trump we're going to leave fair number alone
i'm in a padded room
but there was this other weird story in your paper emily
about
trump apparently talking to witnesses who had
been interviewed by modern or in front of them all or grand jury about what they had testified to earth
in interviews
is this
no no no no if a witness tampering is it fine it's probably doesn't rise to the level of witness tampering because for that you would want some truth that trample is trying to change their story is however it's a no no because prosecutors who have lots of power in a situation like this are looking to see if if you have the potential
target or a potential target are trying to get people to coordinate their stories or another word in other ways influence them and one of the
allegations or whatever you want to call it about this talking to witnesses is that trump went toe white house counsel damn again and said hey you never did ted i never did
air jeff sessions are rad rosenstein raid and again was like no you did say that so in fact it does look like he's trying to get began to change his story in a way that would protect against the kinds of facts that build up an obstruction of justice charge and so this is another piece of the most
they're of was there obstruction what does a special counsel need to prove that both to himself
and the country
the also i guess and other than could be if the present ever thinks he's going to sit down with a special counsel he wants to figure out what are the people said so he doesn't say whatever he thinks because for him the truth is whatever has been said in the moment
that's right which is verifiable true because sometimes he says something in the beginning of sense that is different from the end and what he says of the end of a parrot their said and just take this particular instance now he knows that began if he talks tomorrow i can't remember and all this began and interviewed let ever imagine that he has them again let's say yeah trump did tell me that now that's good
potentially presumably mean that trump isn't going to lie about it
right and so then that changes the meaning fullness of the whatever answer he gives because he's he already knows maybe he would have blistered his way into this lie and now presumably he won but it doesn't mean it's because we know that so i can see why the hell with them
you're not supposed to go around like checking your story against other plymouth that he go from know i think this is her add discouraged and it gets prosecutor suspicious so whether it's formally illegal or not if you are a potential target you do not want to do things that make prosecutors think that your sneaking around trying to align
other stories and make your own single your own interests not because at some criminal with a crime it's about whether you're going to get invaded or not it's all that trust rain but also if it wouldn't the case be different if it's a murder and you're trying to get the story straight in this case the underlying thing that is being investigated is whether you were trying to extract justice and therefore
this seems to be closer him an obstruction of justice were with murder it wouldn't be me would be a new charge but this is called a prosecutor save this is evident
you know pieces of evidence fourteen fifteen sixteen in a long story that were telling you about that's way i mean we've been from months
zone of obstruction of justice doesn't mean that were there doesn't mean it's like a slam dunk but in zone and then they're all these facts that are accumulating and you can kind of imagine the kind of story and instruction and diamond could tell if such a document has ever created

attorney general jeff sessions announced in sacramento this week that his department justice suing of california to overturn three laws california recently path to limit power of ice and state
the third law it
two more controversial laws sessions or after one forbid state officials in california from sharing a key information with ice officials notably information about when someone might be released from jail and other information that will get into and the second model which forbids private employer
others from cooperating with ice and revealing certain key employment status information them them
accurate description on one yeah so tell us a little bit more about the flaws why california pass them and what california was hoping to do we get to it
sessions up and do all the first law has been versions of that have passed and other states and other cities as well and the issue here is that you have people have been picked up on relatively minor crimes because california exempted people have committed serious crimes are getting out of print that you have like you know the on driving without a lesson
since the shoplifting folks and they're coming out of jail and i would like to pick them up right there because the administration has been claiming they're going to prioritize getting lawbreakers and criminals out of the country so it doesn't really matter if it's small potatoes crime still counts the let's grab them and their there someone already has them in custody
but if you have a warrant from a judge saying that ice is supposed to take custody a lot of cities and some states have taken the position like sorry we're not holding on to them for extra time for you the not going to tell you when they're getting out and that's become a big bone of contention between ice and on state law and city law enforcement
and so this forbids state officials from conveying information about when people are gonna guess they're not supposed to give a heads up about when they're coming out and in defense of the sessions asked her to give the argument for it there's a federal law that forbids states and cities from with
holding information from the feds about your quote immigration status and so this is going to be a lawsuit that empire turns on what that phrase means it doesn't really seem to me that the obvious reading of immigration status is like when you're getting out of jail but that's the argument right into california said we will tell you information about their immigration stuff
i'll tell you when they're getting out of jail exactly exactly and we won't transfer are people getting out of jail directly into federal custody and what's the second law a private employers which i phone even more confusing yeah that one i know less about i mean i think what's going on here is what can try
that employers disclose to ice how much our workplace raids going to be something that the state tries to prevent by just making the federal government jump through hoops to get information about which companies are implying people without the proper documents had asked to do with like you know when they're allowed to turn over i nines and how that so they can only do it if there is a
a warrant or yeah more formal order that can just do it if someone shows up right exactly on what grounds to the just california make in terms of the federal versus state responsibility on immigration yeah that's a great question i'm in california is saying we know that ice is going to operate we know that's a federal government has the power to him
enforce national immigration laws we don't want our law enforcement folks to help and in defense of california there is a big supreme court decision from must be from the ninety is because i think i was in law school in which this was at the time kind of conservative triumph in which
the federal government was told it cannot commandeer the resources of local law enforcement and do it's work and the idea at the time was that that was very pro federalist pro states
and local government power but now california is using that as the rationale for its law and there's a difference supreme court decision which at the time liberals were happy about involving arizona which and the trump administration has invoked gang and that's the case there was like the show me your papers loss on arizona with it or
pio right
get joe how is he was enforcing at areas like
vehemently with with great excitement but basically arizona was trying to be more restrictive than the federal government and so the obama administration must have been sued to stop arizona from doing that and and then there's the line a helpful now to the truck administration line in which justice kennedy for the majority said that the states
not undermine the federal power and forests immigration laws and so those are the two kind of clashing principles be happier and then obviously we have like a big political battle that both you know jerry brown for the left in california is happy to be shaking his fist and jeff sessions showed up in california to say like
you guys are acting like secessionists in this is lawless and me on have it and so both right and the left in this fight are you know profiting from the legal battle but it is actually really interesting legal question to and the president is potentially going out to california to join in here there's a performance art piece of this between sessions pleasing his boss by
doing some jerry brown and than the president did so they exactly the can see the case for california path and flaws and i can see given the president you started from the nineties but
that said you can come and get the researchers of state and the state shouldn't be forced to spend all their time doing what the what
one wants them to do but
i think the idea of state government can be ordered not to cooperate with the federal government
on matters where the state has a different policy review is is troubling for a little weird and are we going to regret it if we if we may support the hell for a new legislation when this comes to abortion or education
the president is not a great president well so first all on his own thing rant like there's doctrine about immigration love it like is kind of in one lane and in that lane the federal government's powers or added seen it the supreme court said that really clearly you can see all the obvious reasons as the federal government that's responsible for our borders and operates
so yes there is that on the other hand is but the states are doing here really undermining our efforts to secure the borders these are people are inside the country there in the interior raid and the other thing and the add one more factor is the real a very literal meaning of
what the board like that
because doesn't mean it encourages people to come in if they can get into the middle of the country and saying well we already have a bunch of things and immigration law that create that in santa him so i guess you could argue there are problematic but what fact about this than i think is really important what's really at issue here is whether the local sheriff
our law enforcement guy has to hang on to the misdemeanor defendant for forty eight hours without an official warrant from a judge and now do we really want jailers totally hanging on to people for another two days for authority that they have to do that and then the i'll say about this and this is like my on
observation of what's happening in connecticut is ice doing things like showing up in local jails and pretending to be defense lawyers and connecticut and getting lots of information from people because they're trying to get whoever is in custody to inform on other people who may be an undocumented in connecticut there's a lot of like stuff going on with
enforcement
my state and other states they can't believe it's illegal honestly like they show up at your door they can lie about who they are they do all kinds of stuff that just seems like you're hearing about something that should not be legal under american law and so to the extent that states and localities are trying to prevent that from happening
i mean look if you really think that every undocumented person should be looking over their shoulder every damn be made as miserable as possible and that's how we're going to get them to self deport like okay that if you have any kind of hard about these people and their quasi status here and what it's like to live in the shadows this is pretty troubling
the i want to go to the private employer part of it which you said i'm way to your nose red reading about my but i do understand how it's very make sense for a state law saying what its own state officials can do i'm a little bit queasy about the due to the state is telling pro private employers
they can and can't do it forbidding private employers from her cooperating with federal officials even if they want to thing that they may not allow them to do this thing is that made him in his i'm reading forbids them current events them yeah i'm a you can say that that seems that imagine yeah
comply with an f b i and iffy that an f b i agent shows up you may not
you may not talk to them unless he presents this specific set of onerous documents that way i mean the children's occasion is we want to make sure that before workplace raids are conducted all the paperwork in order and that you know because otherwise if you have people knock on your door and asked to see paper as a lot of in players are going to me nervous than just kind of openness other and i was earlier
sure we all had so you can argue that's all they california is doing here i do think this whole question of workplace enforcement and and the role of the employers to the players ever get penalize as opposed to people working there like that's all pretty dicey area of immigration law

okay when
you are
talking to the federal official on your doorstep
and having a drink with a federal official what do you going to shattered our i am a god and amazed by a story in buzz feed this week by my case and candle taggart about a secret list of dirty cops in new york city basically what's happened is that there are a bunch of cops they've gone through internal disciplinary procedures
there's some of them have done some really bad things like slug some down the street or fabricate evidence or lamb the stand and they get a basically slap on the wrist and then they go on to a secret list the prosecutors keep that warns prosecutors against putting these folks is making as using them as witnesses on the stand because of
that happened then they're disciplinary records will come out and this is all possible because of a new york state law called section fifty that forbids the public each issuance issue and forbids the public mention in court of an officers personnel record without judicial approval i can't believe this is the legal and yet
according to the york times just last year a court found that yes this law shields police personnel files meanwhile in philadelphia where there's a new district attorney like krasner he came into office someone league the previous regime had created a similar secret list under court order krasner his office
least at this week and now we have a news story and you coverage in the philadelphia press about these officers and what they've done and it's an important moment of public reckoning of people understanding how poorly some police departments really on
investigate and and treat this kind of music have so much power that the police officers have the notion that cops lie would just go back to work on the next day and then there be some kind of secret essentially work around by prosecutor so that they continue to be out on the street it's real
really alarming and it's going to be interesting there was a press conference this week mer de plaza oh and the police chief commander in new york said you know we really need to get rid of the state law but obviously there are entrenched interests and it's really crazy i think there's gotta be some of our way to try and sue and this practice john what if your
my gender is about the extraordinary news delivered by a variety of people have reported it but hope picks the president's former closest advisors are both in proximity and also just emotional space he was with him for two years really it was responsible for managing his
variety of his moods and was in constantly woven into raising upset
often very regular
he told the house investigating committee the house intelligence committee that her email accounts were hacked and she told the committee that the the tool for accounts personal accounts
including the one she had for the trump campaign had been compromised and she can no longer get into them
so if there was however that way
well i don't know i mean it's unclear from the stories how long it was packed if it was hacked and somebody was looking at it while she was still using it and then what point she got shut out but
it seems to me that
if you were to want to get an email account of a single person in the trump orbit it would be the personal account of hope picks because she would have manage a lot of things on the president's behalf would have short handed things he had said and mrs to various other people i mean
this is just an extraordinary piece of news also obviously it has echoes of the president lampooned john podesta for letting his email get attacked or have during the campaign and get hillary clinton i mean she was secretary of states that that's different
this sounds like the campaign not her texas white house correct correct this is her her personal and different champagne and using her personally account during the transition and you can or even any other and one would assume you would even if you weren't engaged in various activity i mean there is of course the whole question of using the personal versus the private relative to your public job but also like
you know anybody who has multiple accounts like you can do all kinds of stuff inadvertently on one encounter another anyway the point is that like somewhere out there is somebody with an extraordinary trove of material which may have nothing to do with russia and collusion anything else but if they are a bad person then presumably these emails will show up in the
world someday and
the mayor was that even in the new brake know it's been in the news all day thursday we did we did we mentioned it on on on our broadcast this morning
just sort of
i wanted to like stop the presses but there are there are a lot of there was a lot a lot of other news and but i don't mind that i managed to completely miss it
or it might have two one three my self serving or at least rosen party thirty which is that my wife's pod cast invisible yeah
his back for the new season
newton first any drops on thursday and friday excuse me and amazing earliest ana talking about it is amazing
it's amazing i'm sure he says of your own ability is a great broadcast about invisible force as the guide us and honest just been working on some incredible stories her colleagues particularly are cursed at least beagles and working on great story so listen to invisibility a part guess my other chapters i want to flag
really interesting story by andrew romano and downs frankie ruta on yahoo news about a an anti gentrification movement mostly based out of los angeles pay particularly focus on a group called defend boyle heights which is trying to stop the gentrification of a largely mexican american abroad and l a
but this script different boyle heights and others
connected to it are incredibly norton so there's some folks in defend boyle heights who are just engaging than usual forms of public disobedience and public protest about interpretation but there are so group within them who are often anarchists marxists other is a very
sorts who are engaging in civil actions or uncivil actions are that are on violence so they they threatened a bike tour there was a real estate bike tour can go through the neighborhood showing clients how charming it was and they tried to be scrapped because violence was threatened
there are protests in particular
at galleries because they see galleries as being a marker that's placed in a neighborhood that that draws it starts to draw development and draw interpretation
protests caught hip coffee shops made unpleasant for for patrons to be there and it's just it's it's really interesting and i think these movements are like totally wrong headed and threatening and legal one
but it does reflect the incredible rage out there about inequality and about what's happening with thirty so

on this week scan this i would say and i will i will appeal to both of you that this was one of the news last week i can remember that didn't have something like absolutely catastrophic in a just unbelievable amount of news unbelievable variety of story so we're not could be able to get to all be incredible things that are happening to us to toys r us toys r us
closing the house russia investigation into north korea were not going to get the north korea
oh i'm sure john pick your favorite story
it's incredible you know you did a pretty good job there between venice and the toys are us
i mean it was an iconic brand and a part of growing up who didn't love walking down the aisle and seeing all the things you couldn't get but i also felt like
oh yeah they've been in bankruptcy for awhile and retailers you're taking a pounding from online sales and so are i knew it so you have to mark the moment but it wasn't like i guess i wasn't surprised by how crazy this week is that we're actually not talking about north korea and the impending will believe it
we see it summit meeting oh we're not even going to talk about britain exploring diplomats accept and panels it's insane anywhere and on thursday the president signed a letter finally after going to dragging their heels signed on with germany and england in pushing russians to account for that
what for poisoning and love the foreign minister of russia said we had no motive which is not exactly this missing we did
we have no motive but we did it anyway like i said it's like a cat
it's like why the hell the elections coming up going on
so what we will talk about we would like wet the short unhappy tenure of secretary of state television
what does his departure portend his replacement compared to a secretary of state then an extraordinary democratic victory or i guess a parent victory seems pretty pretty locked at this moment in a special how selection pennsylvania
and what that signals for the twentieth teen midterms
and then there is turmoil and american public education or teachers on strike in west virginia are winning a strike in west virginia threatening to go on strike in oklahoma where schools are barely operating to begin with we have students walking out everywhere and then a secretary of education who appears to know practically nothing about her job which makes her probably the fourth most qualified
cabinet member of the trump administration
plus we will have cocktail chatter and to live show announcements we have our portland show next week really excited john wayne i will be in portland oregon on wednesday night show is sold out to know more tickets there but they're still tickets available for a saint louis show and may second and i'm thrilled to say we're going to great gets jason candor

president from fired secretary of state rex torched by tweet on tuesday tiller soon the former ex on ceo never quite achieve the olympian heights of previous secretaries of state is it just like a tad short jefferson or a larger i had this is not allow
this is not original that i saw somebody suggesting that his autobiography would be present at the destruction who wrote president the creation dean acheson anxious and
he was an extraordinarily ineffective secretary across in all kinds of ways he was undermined by his boss who was constantly mocking and stepping on him
he had different views on foreign policy and then his both seem to have he was had by all accounts a terrible organizational leader which is surprising considering he'd been ceo one of large companies in the world but he managed to get very few senior staff in place and alienated the vast bureaucracy of the state department and oversaw
the shedding of probably half of the senior diplomatic corps while he was there and or a short time and state department morales apparently quite shattered towson will be replaced pending tend approval by cia director mike from pale the former tea party congressmen who has one president trumps goodwill by been in america first are like him and by
by been around a lot and giving present trump lots of briefings so ruth will america be better off without tiller then there's an argument that he didn't have authority that he couldn't speak credibly and but he ruined the daily worker but apartment and so will the state department be better off with somebody who shares trumps
views and might be a better better organization it so i'm reminded of the old joke i think it's about like that catskills resort were and guy is complaining about the food and he says the food is terrible and there isn't enough of it the portions are too small
that really angry at holidays
i thought an old jewish joke
delivered on ticker
now i said
my point now
try think
from this he will the accident is that
tiller sin
what really was a terrible secretary of state he didn't either m t is the language of corporate life that he came from he didn't manage up very well his primary constituent the president and he didn't manage down and when you do that you're just last getting nothing accomplished
and yet we may miss him when he gone because the question is whether mike pumping will rain in the worst excesses of his president or whether he will simply inflamed then as we go into it we weren't going to get to talk about north korea but as we get go into this
extremely delicate and potentially dangerous negotiation with north korea over that impending some it john you're a student of organization and of how washington works
do you do share with instinct that it may be dangerous to have somebody who is aligned with with trump rather than to push back or is it good to have the secretary of state been able to speak with authority which teller some coaching that was able to will i have a couple of
no i think that's one perfectly reasonable way of looking at and i think we have a depends which play they're running first of all to respond the focus on north korea's is important
president is about to engage in where he has a guest english in the first step of negotiations with north korea some people think he has done well up to this point getting north korea and a want to talk but he botched the first round of the conversation which is to offer himself as a as an interlocutor immediately usually had something you use as a prize and you get north korea
make a bunch of concessions to get the prize of meeting with trump and since one of the things that they may want to work out here is a gift of prestige in exchange for taking away the missiles the missiles are about prestige the nuclear power is a nuclear weapon is about prestige in north korea so you want to give it something to have a place that there is
already a problem in the negotiations so now you're changing the team it's not just tiller son it's also perhaps he term master the national security advisor who's leaving with team that was in place ran on a modified madman theory which was in part that you had the president being incredibly bellicose about north korea and then you had somebody working the diplomacy people you admire
mostly working the diplomacy was mad is and tiller son with a german monster doing his bit at the white house
the madman theory requires a tiller son like figure not a nother mad madman which is just shorthand for not another person giving the most bellicose version of this and this is not just in dealing with the bank channels to north korea but it's dealing with the south koreans and chinese and japanese and the russians and the germans and the brits
lot of people and you need coordinated work and you need somebody to go do the work who has an interest in it has an interest in international organizations
way that the tiller and nominally did certainly does more than the president so that's all a big problem and that's just on the north korea front on the organizational front this is one of the reasons why this notion that businessman can come and waltz into government and have this supernatural power which was in part with animated both the president's rhetoric
it's also about tourists and also people's general view who have this idea that if you've been successful in business it can make you successful in government there is a lot of evidence and the people who have studied lists like town like i'm dead harvard suggest and i talked to secretary levitt former secretary about this is that the success you've had in the private
sector can sometimes be an impediment if you're in a certain kind of business that doesn't elevate adaptation but elevates essentially rule following and hierarchy it you're very confused when you come into a place that has a whole new set of hierarchies a whole new set of patterns you try to do something radical and then you lack the the kind of sure footed nice to deal with all the
on the fly challenges you gotta face and that's just from the organizational peace the other thing is in terms of managing up its donald trump is an extraordinary hard boss to work for as the busload to busloads of former officials having left his his employer would a test
we're very quickly without a jacket most of us both local official so
the times made an interesting claim this week
that trumps rapid movement on methods replacement of course of compare reflect his job that actually what we see is not too many of us i think look at with administration think this is a man who doesn't know what he's doing it he that of control and there's certainly plenty of evidence of that but there's another counter notice now he's getting comfortable and like i don't have to
with and all these people who told me i had have a television in place i'd ever mcmaster i can have my own people and do what i want that so there's always been a little bit of that they're not the boss of me aspect to donald trump's behavior if they're lawyers tell you you can't do something that is the surest fire way to get donald trump to do something and we've seen that all along that i think you'll is maggie
hey agreements plane and this should be true of anybody who goes into the presidency that he was she said something along the lines of he was just scared out of his wits the first six months
and everybody grows increasingly comfortable in their job and i think this may be this may well be his sort of he's out he's out your fire well i'm not saying you're fired that can tell i'm going to tweet that you're fired maybe a manifestation of that it also may be a manifestation of that dumb
management of the guard rails around him and assertive trump nanny state is evaporating so hope hicks is gone rob porter who needed to be gone the staff secretary who couldn't get the clearance in the end because he abused his ex wives and possibly others
is gone and he helped make the process more orderly so when you have nannies leaving those with childlike temperaments tend to assert themselves john raised the role of defence secretary john madden he and tiller sen where this sort of increase
singly thin have served with this increasingly thin blue line to contain president trumps worst instincts when it comes to foreign policy whether it was on the iran deal sometimes they weren't successful
for example on paris
and on korea
that just leaves madness as far as i understand it and see it home alone
and that makes me extremely nervous because that thin blue line is like a very thin thread right now
john one of them weird and troubling phenomena of the trump administration so our secretary to doubt he will be replaced by the cia director
trump appears to be dank lane a secretary david shocking and wants to replace him with rick perry the energy secretary he appears to be perhaps dangling jeff sessions the attorney general and wants to replace him with scott pruitt that his his candidates for replacement of the few people have already agreed to work for him and the only people who are going to agree to go into this administration
now are people who are just venal and power hungry there isn't a lot of appetite to serve for public service and so the quality of people he's going to get in is going to get worse and worse i assume i presume
is there any reason that that these is wrong
i think that stands to reason
gina has poll about with whom there is some controversy because of her role in
in the the his rendition policy and torture is at least so them that's something that she's gonna have to deal with in her
confirmation hearings and we can talk about that maybe you know one another show but in terms of a person who has worked in an institution for a very long time she's a thirty two year veteran people who are supported hillary clinton like my morale was the former number two
i think she is qualified incredible person for the job so to the extent that in these is shifting around that we've seen there's been an elevation of somebody who has credentials within the bureaucracy
that's a person who is so that be the case
gonna like
really that war criminal torture as well at least we have an idea as torch now of it
but there were people that else but i mean there were people elevated the obama administration who had association with those policies as well so that us to do with us policy and the history of this hey in the war on terror which is a problem but it's different in the one that know identified and i just sent her a little bunny it is funny
be by clamoring to have the war criminals but the others that you mentioned
you're right they're having to shuffle people who are already on the team and to have no special expertise and those jobs they're they're going into and jobs require some expertise and if you don't have it requires you a fair amount of time to get your feet under you to act in a way that is expert like and remember anybody you might want to go to this white house
it's not just that it would be working for a difficult boss it's working for a difficult boss who will embarrass you in public and for whom you may have to go out in public and say things where it you undermine your credibility your values and you will end up leaving potentially diminish person and then when you leave it will be fine
heard by twitter the one of the thing i should say about tiller soon as we don't know his ability to manage up we never know the things that didn't happen as a result of tiller send in madison a charming master talking the president out of doing things he wanted to do so in in terms of the maybe nothing but i have been led to believe is fair amount that
they did to keep the president from going and certain direction so it's really only going to beef up until the histories are written that we get a sense of his real ability to manage up even though in public it on a b c looks like he didn't win that many fights so i wonder how long it's going to take for those history has to be written because
donald trump
throughout his career has managed to keep a lot of his bad behavior under wraps by having his ex employees and his ex wives sign non disclosure and confidentiality agreements and we don't even need to talk about stormy daniels in this context but these government officials haven't signed non disclosure agreements they couldn't be recall
to sign non disclosure agreements and then he did this i thought really extraordinary thing of death by twitter with tellers and and i understand that he really enjoys humiliating people and that was deliberate but it didn't seem to me to be very smart given that we now have tiller sin and any know
anger of others who have steep ban in whoever else who have stories to tell about this president and who you would think that the president absence the non disclosure agreement might have handled in a more gingerly way to try to at least secure some degree of loyalty and i'm curious
john her david if you have any instinct about why the president chose then to proceed the way he did with till accent
why on the key is able to fire people on earth person actually well i think is congenital generally are unable he's a coward and what that may be true but that just explains why he didn't do it in person he doesn't doesn't explain why he didn't have cali call and say hey you're gone here is that why he did it by twitter why he didn't call him for and
three hours because he did it in a way calculated to impose maximum humiliation until i suddenly you can see that until her son's face when he went to address the state department in which he didn't mention the president he didn't come off as a fucking funny how that happened now i mean but that's a really really interesting point especially on the question of john kelly your chief is
staff and your boss you're the president wants to do something that you know hurts his his interest having them president look like he is treating his former secretary of state this way on the eve of of this important north korea moment is not good for the presidency is not good for his image and his giant and john kelly's job is to go and make sure stuff like that does
happen so either a he didn't have the instinct to do this or he did and the president wouldn't let him
i want to close this were just making a policy point which is that one of the problem with that i think we have
there's a
a deep philosophical problem with american foreign policy right now which is that both schools of thought or
are incomplete you're going to fail so there's an america first school of thought which is basically what i'm pale and trump subscribe to which is sort of like screw international institutions were gonna pursue are selfish best interests at every particular moment and even if that undermines allies even if that undercuts things that we've done you can have it under
gerd undercuts the network of trade and other kinds of relationships were built up over a decade but is morally very satisfying
like satisfying because it allows you to say we're doing what we want and then there's an american gauged view which is the kind of consensus establishment foreign policy
which is to work through international institutions work with allies don't cowboy around abide by international agreements that you make and neither of them works that well anymore or well the american gauge model doesn't work that well anymore if you're in america because we're just relatively weaker than we were forty years ago and
less ability to push around these institutions and get the deals that we want and because china
is pursuing a similar china is creating its own web in asia and throughout the asian even into europe and africa and so our belief that we can have an american gauge whereby we get to push these institutions do more or less what we would like to do no longer holds so we're faced with either the process
active sort of saying well we're going to work with these institutions and just be relatively weaker than we were which one which is what i would choose to do and what obama chose to do and what tiller send more or less was choosing to do or we can say we're going to screw them and go alone and that creates its whole new set of problems but both of them are some
optimal because america is a relatively weak or nation in the world and we were just won't acknowledge it could point for relief here do you think there are other changes to come in this administration that are similar to this or well it's pretty seismic when you shift secretaries of state that it's very clear that we're getting ready to engage in sort of trumpet
administration musical chairs and i just hope they play the musical chairs on that ben carson thirty one thousand dollar dining set so at least people have good things to sit on and you talked about when they showed them to the door it will be to the one hundred forty exactly that
thinking this just goes to last about who would go into this administration the problem with that premise that question was the premise was that we had the team at the start and i think this just explosion of stories about carson about stinky that we're going to get to and her disastrous interview and all these
people who can't seem to engage in sort of basic common sense behavior of a government official and just suggests that as we lose some people who were adequate to marginal and shift everybody else around we could be in for a world of trouble
guy is just a question of your roof i have my own view and answer to this but i'm interested in your thoughts which is clearly this is chaotic kids obviously like no kuwait house we've never seen before there have been purges jimmy carter purged is cameron at one point but it was a single kind of unitary moment this has been a purge it's been going on almost as soon as the present
came into office the number and kinds of people has been extraordinary who been fired shown out the shown the door i'm embarrassed on their way out and so forth so why doesn't really matter
we're not engaged in any you knew conflicts of to president got his tax can pass people may not agree with it but he got something passed that his entire party all all in favor of he's slashing regulations which is something and republicans have been trying to do for years he's doing better at that than than previous republican presidents have done so what's the problem with all of this other than it's dramatic
not decorous so and
good question to answer is one that is something that you suggested earlier it matters because if you want to be effective in your job you have to have been doing that actually qualified to do it but also even if you're qualified to do it having that doing it for having done it for a while everybody learns on the job if you're there for seven months or eight months or a year and
two months it's not long enough to really effectively get anything done
you point to the things that the trump administration has managed to deal with a really a team in place
it should have been able to do a lot more given the total control of the branches of government some of us who disagree with its priorities should actually breathe a sigh of relief about that the second reason that it matters now is having the b team in place and having not people in place
in fact interestingly the president's been cleaning up the last couple days about how chuck schumer and democrats are blocking his nominees but as far as i can tell the vast bulk of the blame for their home alone government that we have with and especially like look at the people on korea and the absence of an ambassador in the absence of a senior
in the state department responsible for this
the government and the absence of people in the government and the wrong inexperienced people in the government don't seriously matter until they really matter which is when you have a potential crisis and blessedly for all of us donald trump hasn't really experience that whether it's on a foreign policy issue or on a finance
national economic so so that's that's where i get really nervous and as much as i don't want him to be able to impose some of the changes that he wants to impose really think that it's important to have a functional government
speaking of home alone down trip was in home alone to you know
i had if a cameo

connor lamb a lawyer and veteran a conservative democrat appears to have edge republican rick's a cone is that how you pronounce his name become i've never heard it i've just read it to to win the special election for a house seat and south western pennsylvania
the election was kind of crazy there was a huge amount of attention focused on a district that is going to vanish in a few months but it became a symbol for the state of the republican and democratic party in this district had a bellwether quality to it it was a district that donald trump one by twenty points mitt romney it went by seventeen point democrats had not
even run a candidate for congress and the last two elections their conservative group supporting an enormous amount of money outside money into the district to try to win the seat for a cone
although landed a raise and direct money but lamb one by just a handful votes remarkably the efforts that the conservative groups made to tie lamb to nancy pelosi and to try to to use the tax cut bill to make the case for their candidate and to bring true
jump in to actually speak on behalf of the kind and they all did not work
john there's a much brooded about fact that there are one hundred and eighteen districts were trumpet a narrower margin and he did in pennsylvania eighteen democrats want to went twenty three districts twenty three house seats to take control the house could democrats actually end up winning one hundred seats from republicans and is bet that scale
wave money well i don't think there are differences succumbs on an incumbent and there are there are districts that were you having company and so the the power of incumbency might help but
you know when i fixed fixate on here is that what we've seen in in all the special elections even the ones in which the democrats lost what we've seen is a constant inconsistent improvement in democratic performance that's well over what the district traditionally
reduces and so that is a wave that is coming there are also other pieces of evidence that waves are coming there's there's the generic ballad the chose a favor ability for the democrats over the republicans at the center of this is is is that the democrats have a constant energizing mechanism in the president and the energizes of them in two ways
one everything he does every day too because there is this feeling among core democratic supporters that area is a kind of impotence nothing can be done to stop this president and there's only one way that these democratic voters who feel this sense of evidence can fight back and that is through the electoral process and we've seen it time and again play out the know
to bad would be republicans running on one of a couple of things one the success of the tax burden its ability to get past a long time promise republicans have offered to their voters and that they have now kept the second being that the economy is doing well
third being i know i said there were only two but the third being it nancy pelosi is is a person and will be in control and she is a a boogie man or woman and so don't turn out well that didn't work in this race in a district that trunk borne by twenty points and it looks like it's not working in other areas so ruth
there's a or thought would that
voters are much more animated by voting against the part of it if faber than voting for their party and therefore you
if you really hate a trump really hate republicans you're more likely to vote and if you really are keen on your democratic candidate
one conclusion you could draw from that is it's good to nominate therefore
candidate who won't irritate people and the other side should nominate your most moderate candidate rather than your most progressive candidate and lamb fits that model lamb has a very conservative democrat either anti abortion is pro gun he was handpicked by party leaders he's not one of these progressive tapes resistant tapes he's our president told us he's a republican really
he's a republican so what's going to happen
incorrect by the way okay what is going to happen when we have this wave of quite progressive democratic candidates they're going to be districts where you that it makes sense for the party to nominate somebody on the left heel is going to be able to animate progressives but honestly those are not going to be that districts where you are
going to be able to tip outta republican income back for the most part you're going to need to nominate people who are conservative moderate enough to be able to attract those republicans suburban women and other swing voters who have elected republican members of congress all
long and just might be disgusted enough by donald trump and everything else going on this year that they're willing to make the change and so that john laid out three arguments that the republicans have the plus the argument doesn't seem very powerful to me that tax cut argument has not proved to its value to republicans luck it was
not popular when it was passed and it's not gotten very much more popular so that kind of least republicans with the economy and that's always a good argument but this is
most place the most common place where people vote against the other guy as opposed to for their side isn't an off year election so that just helps build the wave
with this much of a wave coming what what should republicans do should they should they should they bother to fight it made sure they attempt to fight it or they just spend the next six months just passing a bunch of stuff that it's going to be favorable to their voters and just prepare themselves to to lose the house in such a great it's such a fascinating question
or a fun question to roommate on if you're going to fight it
you need money
and so you gotta go down from grace and so you got to be the district to do it well as you can't be in washington
trying to pass legislation and by the way it's really hard to pass legislation because you're getting a people worried about being in primary races your got people in districts where the president is an anvil around their ankle and so they're going to try and do things
disconnect themselves from the president they'll do that through voting so it's not like they could come in like lickety split pass a bunch of legislation i also that it was interesting that lanham ran against paul ryan
saying that he was going to gut medicare and social security you know so that's a non donald trump argument that seemed based on some of their early analysis i saw seemed to have some purchase which means the more that activity there is in washington the more he can point to washington the republicans have no you can't run away from a president you just can't do it
just it doesn't work i don't really know what they can do i mean i think the best because it's also very hard to focus in this environment you know one of the goals that a that opposition party like the democrats will try to do is nationalize the election and again i mention this is kind of third element to the fact that don't trump is the best turn out mechanism for democrats he is a constant
attention grabber and in some districts that will be great but the transference between the president and the person he would be endorsing whether it's a cone or roy more than transit translated property has not been demonstrated and you know there's unknown unknown here before the election which is where the russia story is going and what mother is going to come up
with before the election
wait on now
but a suggestion
the answer is probably greater than zero we will hear from bowler in some way before the election again
do you think there's any risk ruth of democrats overplaying this
yeah i think there's any risk of democrats blowing it and car loan i speaking of which ruth please give me your thoughts on hillary clinton's remarks in india
i i get in trouble when i say this because people keep calling me a hillary hater i'm anything but a hillary hater but i'm a hillary sire actually s i g h e r
i just don't think she's helping her south are helping her party with this constant i'm going to use a bad word here whiny sounding we litigation of the results it would be better not to continue to do that both for her own reputation and for the future of her part
that's my view
john it's not fair to just ask the girl so what did you think about hillary clinton's comments i think is a i think you're i think what you say is particularly right for her party in the idea she believes him i think also when the most identifiable gaffe of the campaign was to lump of people into groups lump white women into a group
behaved in a way her argument was that white women didn't vote for him because of their i couldn't quite figure out something about their husbands under their their their husbands dumb they were under their husbands thumbs i don't think that you don't think you want to speak about women and their behavior down talk about air david
given some fresh air
play i don't think you want to speak about women in bulk like that
and so i think that's not good and under any circumstances and it's not good for the for the party in particular as republicans are searching around in the in the tool draw to fund try to find something that will be useful anything that gives them a chance to hold up an image of the elite democratic luminaries kind of looks
down their noses at a certain class of america i think is not to do is not a good things i mean them i mean just to play fares both sides here and trump to an outrageous thing about women were he said fifty two percent of women voted for me
while aren't the only women who cow which white lie and toss right why it is but it is possible in this world of this multi flavored world for donald trump to save things that are totally wrong and and offensive to women and fertile of shirt the same
i have not attempting to defend i didn't pay any attention to what hillary said i trust both of you are under saying that i should note the i heard be noted that trumps heard this sure sure it
far away from pennsylvania fifteen although here to india that were going to but way but their husband wears one yeah he related point about has with the eighteen which only quickly is the fact that currently am ran an ad in which he was a believe it was an error fifteen in the yeah but anyway it was a semiautomatic rifle in and said he still loves to shoot gives you some indication of the
faculty with passing any kind of gun control legislation or talking about it even in the year where democrats are trying to do well in district like the one that limb looks like he won in and it's just you know there's a tension between all the activism in the students that were the democrats were celebrating this week as they walked out from school and the candidates who are have
to run in environments that are receptive to that kind of the message about limiting gun rights
approximately every two hours one pennsylvania and dies from the dragons the dallas these loved ones mothers fathers
tuned in and fans
exchange for dallas
can count
the begins to locks
locks on a visit and paid back splash of the night
people with pennsylvania taxpayer dollars it has no surprise that public education has become a contentious issue in the age of trump there's profound conservative skepticism about bit federal federal role and public education
there are austerity policies and a lot of states that have limited teacher pay across the country but especially in red states there is a class of rich mostly right leaning philanthropists to have been galvanized by the idea and the reality of school choice and charter schools these facts are there was a rebellion
against what
note the national
it wasn't a national curriculum both the call but common core all these combined to make it a very fertile area for both conservative and liberal action we have seen off of public school drama and recent weeks west virginia teacher struck for nine days and won the race that they sought from republican controlled state government oklahoma teach
are threatening their own strike on april second also seeking a pay raise in a state oklahoma where i think fifteen percent of schools now only meat four days a week because they don't have money to meet five days a week which is incredible second lowest paid the country
and secretary of education bette davis the charter school in school choice activist elevated to the cabinet and whose experience in public education seems to have been limited to watching friday night lights perhaps is under fire for a very awkward interview she did with some of john's colleagues at cbs sixty minutes
ruth what was so bad about that interview
what was that about the interview is that decisions do it actually just watched it and you thought what were they thinking
when they being her media advisers and pr team in wow i would just push back as a as a human being i'm like any time a cabinet official in this administration speaks to and on fox outlet
in a public forum i am happy about it so bad really anybody out but now play but it's good for the public of as sure it's good transit currency is because the the public exposing betsy divorces capabilities such as they are is good for the public i'm just saying as a pr matter what was the education department
well i'm thinking with related this what was bad about so bad about it was that she displayed a pretty fundamental lack of understanding of it not just some of that complicated areas that her department is involved in but some of that
core beliefs that have animated her involvement in public education to wit the impact of charter schools on the performance of public schools who lose money as a result of having as students drained away from them on charter schools she wasn't able to answer really
basic questions and i have to indulge myself here by reading
a couple sentences from a parody that my washington post colleague alexandra peter i wrote about the interview and she says lesley stahl have you ever seen a school that the device a school i have well i hesitate to say a school we of course no school is not a building nor is it a bus to bus i'm pretty sure it's not a bus although one could
certainly learn on the bus and it was not that is parity but not that far afield from the way the secretary of education actually sounded the big critique of them
trump administration in these regulations that they're on winding in the policies they're putting in place at all these different agencies as they are animated by a set of beliefs that are basically taken on faith that there's it's one thing to have rigorously investigated point of view
the opposite from the point of view of the bureaucracy and whenever agency you're in or or the ideas of the previous administration if you have a set of theories the to be examined and tested and come to a different conclusion but what was interesting and i've thought about the interviews that there was also a lack of curiosity about the open up the educational process
yes
has demonstrated and so the lack of curiosity plus the unfamiliarity with the with the core ideas and a meeting that's a divorce in the past suggested a lot of proof for this critique of the broader critique of the of the trump administration which is that they're just doing a lot of things
based on and kind of a more of faith based approach them any kind of rigorous or even consistent reason behind them
i am no education expert and all you can
i was nervous you know sharpen your knives right now because i'm probably gonna say something which is wrong and stupid
but here's what i would say there are parts of divorces agenda which i find deeply concerning i think the fact that she's doing a lot of business with coasters and con men but the the her policies on higher education appear to be run by the for profit
colleges rather than by all the other colleges which are the vast majority of the united states i hate the rollbacks and civil rights that she was pursuing and i agree there's a kind of faith based has the right word or charters and school choice
it's faith based on the other hand we're not going to have a national curriculum and this country it just is not how we were we have a bunch of states
education in the state level activity so the federal education is limited and the idea that we we've elected somebody in president trump who wants to pursue this kind of agenda it's not going to massively shift everything that's happening in the country it's going to tinker with things on the edges
they're going to be more charters you can be more school choice and that's going to have an effect which may be bail for may not be be awful but i don't think it seems to me a pretty small set of experiments and to me divorce is not even in like the top five bad trump cabinet members if you compare the effect of what she can do to what's happening at the
yea or what steve minute windows or what the secretary of interior can do the seems to me pretty small beer and and i think the reason the democrats are so animated out it is that teachers are huge constituency in the democratic party and that really makes a big difference but isn't that just like saying that ben
carson can't cause that much damage at higher because he can just you know rewrite the mission statement and make and make it harder for homeless people to find housing and take anti discrimination efforts out of the department's mission but because he can't bring down the economy or bring us into war it's not that big a deal
i mean sort of their guys i think i'm a little bit of there's a little bit of that which i'm saying but it's also because they're fundamentally public education is country is a state level activity and so what the federal government does is on the margins and so the fact that she has a she has an ideology a faith based ideology about school choice and charters is
changes the emphasis of what the department does but it doesn't it's not going to fundamentally change how students are educated in most schools and the country
a lot of federal funding that goes to impact yeah way those local schools and state systems operate and you we're having this national discussion about arming teachers that is now a national level discussion sell it matters who is the secretary of
education i'm an insane and he does it at or under something that doesn't matter that much while compared to what doesn't matter compared to a defense secretary who's not competent which we do have a defence secretary is great and there are a treasury sick or an interior secretary or yeah create secretary where the update their like permanent damage that can be done this is going to be tinkering at the edges and actually like frankly
this certain amount of experimentation and this is fine dc is a city which i live in which has had this huge charter school explosion
which i think has generally been good for the city now i don't i don't have the numbers in front of me but certainly the attention and effort and public education has have been really interesting in the city as as a longtime resident i feel that and so i'm i guess i have some tolerance for the idea that this is a place you can experiment i would agree with that and but i think the question is
experiment and then but but if the experiments are based on
this kind of fades and also that's not so because it under your thinking david you do an experiment studied the results you figure out of their replica bowl and the new replicate them you replicate the good parts and doing or bad this the sense of rigor yes no yes no no faith is right and i'm one of the things i low
with and i don't think of off demonstrates this but certainly a lot of her allies do is this language of meanness towards directed towards public schools and public school teachers the covered schools government schools is this
vicious slander that i find really unpleasant i want to say one mild word in defense of secretary device and then i'll go on to criticize her said nobody panic
i've been very interested in class i support of of the education department's efforts to revisit the question of whether we've got the balance right on sexual assault and sexual harassment and that title nine regulations whether they've gone too far and diminished that due process rights of the
key is students slate colleague emily off he has former colleague emily happy has written very brilliantly about this so you know i give us got a cheer and a half maybe to cheers for raising this but then this is and this was an illustration of how problematic the interview was in it's got a lot less
attention then her comments about charters and failing schools she is asked are you in any way suggesting that the number of false accusations are as high as the number of actual rapes are assault there is one obvious answer to this question which is no i am not by that still doesn't mean that we don't need to be worried about people being falsely accuse that my yeah
answer this is the actual diverse answer well one sexual assault is too many and one falsely accused individual is one too many well that's true but totally inadequate totally town death and i'm totally illustrative of why she should not be in this job and why she was the first a cabinet secretary
to have been confirmed by having the vice president cast the tie break the tie that were going gee
no no i was just
just going to indignantly make
no mouth noises that particular route but i didn't have any
there were even words
well ahead know
the original point about west virginia and oklahoma on the show this week we talk to two teachers and one is the teacher the airfare oklahoma and the other was teacher the year for the whole country and when you talk to them about your of the ever whole country theme a lot better than that he'd year for
when you talk about and by the way the teacher from oklahoma moved to texas in part because of the pay issues in oklahoma
when you when you talk to them about all that has been put on their plate additionally you know it's not just teaching the students anymore
there is the the idea out there that there might be some places where there would be armed teachers which adds a whole new element but then there are the others which is teachers are now supposed to play a role as kind of first responders in looking at any kids who might have issues acute sensitivity and knowing just wanted to jump in
so that none of those those kids can someone with a day later get a gun there has been the increase in testing that has occurred in in all these different school district
and then there's just the general cultural interruption into the day the teachers now i have to deal with more all of which is not based on their core job which is to teach kids information so that i guess the point here is not only has the pain not kept up but the load that is on
is significantly more and obviously since they in these fights in west virginia in oklahoma and even in this national interview to some smaller my degree the message being sent his is as you said david calling them government schools is that the teachers are not valued and that sends a message to the kids ultimately about these people
that we're supposed to that we're putting all the societal pressure on to help shape more than just the brains of our children but also to to make them be good people are at last
question quickly on that because i didn't want to talk about oklahoma in west virginia route
it the interesting and i i think heartening for especially color them broke through low public schools and public school teachers that in west virginia and strike ended with a victory by the teacher june and despite the fact this is completely republican controlled legislature and and governor's office and in oklahoma
looks like the teachers are gonna have a lot of public support as well
why do you think why do you think they were able to win and west virginia
i think that there is public support for teachers people understand that teachers are dramatically under paid based in comparison to the function they serve to society i think that teachers unions can remain powerful even
republican strongholds and the teachers had a moral claim to more money and even in this day and age moral claims make some impact yeah i agree out
one agenda
about but i would i'd think there's such a long as there are so many institutions that are not working well
in this country and i think the idea for americans at public schools which are so important but all of us are most americans spend a first third of their life at the idea that those would be struggling and breaking the way that we see government breaking the way that we see health healthcare breaking that is disturbing to people and i don't i don't think people want
to live in a society where the public schools don't work at all

what's going to cocktail chatter
when you're on the picket lines ruth
having a beer on the picket line
would have a here on the picket line and probably very discouraged probably not encouraged should try it again i'm him and employment
two so i'm not a union member well if you were on the picket line and it isn't even a picket line with a night i would be wrong to want in hand cupcakes people on the route of thing to the picketers about i am really interested in the current issue of the national geographic which is about as my chatter go out with
i have a second one i have an hour while ago
well which is about race and i'm interested in it and a number of different levels one is the editor's note by susan goldberg the editor in chief which just talks about that
this mall and he just can't i'm getting is the word whitewash terrible word here you can't whitewashed the racist history of national geographic in the way it wrote about and they literally use this term savages quote was captain was sort of photos from aboriginal man it said quote south
australian black fellows black fellas been one word these savages rank lowest and intelligence of all human beings yeah nice so they and then i thought that was really interesting because it happens to come in the same week that we saw or video was last week this remarkable
project by the new york times which is to try to fix its past not racist though that may be sexist in terms of filling in the obituaries of women who deserved obituaries and in the new york times it didn't get them and are getting them now so i thought it was interesting to see
bad news organizations can find their own way to make reparations
and then i thought it was really fascinating that simultaneously this issue is and race is a fascinating compelling constant topic
and this issue include stories that talk about how race simply is not scientific concept at all and then it also tells us that race is totally central to various ways in which we understand the world and it has this absolutely striking image that i'm looking at right now on the cover of twin sister
black and white these twin sisters make us rethink everything we know about race one looks why one looks black they're fraternal twins they in a nutshell are kind of the new normal of america and the world and yet races tell front and center in the way we deal with so much i just want to has authors and goldberg and the historic
in your a historian john it when nathan who should commission to study national geographic racist history and which actually the other interesting aspect i thought was the notation to the horribly racist toward africans african americans most dark and people but then there's this weird
id elevation of polynesian of pacific islanders and polynesian beauties so there's a whole collection of their photographs of polynesian beauty to be they focus on right and you can see them evolve over time first they write about south africa and i write about virginia by the way as if they're
there is no problematic racist pastor racist present and then they begin to get a little bit more with the program in the seventy as i was just fascinating yes john what is your camera
so i'm kind of a double check first is just as fun fact which shows some of our lives changed me
already know but stephen hawking when he died
this fact came out he was born on the three hundredth anniversary of the death of galileo and he died on albert einstein's birthday
so for the renewed
physicists there is some order in the universe
my other is to recommend a book by katherine price called how to break up with your phone
so i'm doing a series from cbs about about attention
listeners know this has been something and i've been fascinated with for a long time in the relationship between attention and focus and all of the judge all talking and just
then i'll look into my email
all of the digital wonder that makes our lives so rich but that obviously we need to find some balance about and this is a tidy little book it can be read in one i don't know one as a seller ride if you're on the seller it's a short book but it's super tidy well written and it just kind of takes you both through the the reasons this has become such a problem
for all of us and then also some useful solutions which are better than the like turn your phone to gray scale and other things that are frustrating and not helpful
my cat her own quickly append a chatter to john's chatter for a few weeks ago john shattered up as terror west or book educated got this
the more of a young woman who was raised off the grid by barry crazy millennia
as opposed to more nail parents didn't go to school she worked in a junkyard starting at age ten
it's an incredible book i'm almost done with just as good as john said it was but i'm rhonda filler
deservedly so
and by the way david's even a room immediately leave this pod cast and go listen to my forty five minute interview with the terror to her about the book are not because i want to finish the book first i don't want spoilers are know there's i don't know what's gonna happen
but then i will
but my real challenge
bouche really fascinating new york times magazine story by bobby worth coming out this weekend and it's about the kidnapping of a bunch of qatar we royals and qatar nobility who were on a stupid dumb falconry trip in iraq they went to the iraq desert which is it really stupid thing to do for
several weeks and to engage in the sport that they love of falconry and they were kidnapped by iranian allied militias and they became the pond in this insane set of deals that involve the syrian civil war the negotiations to free them require
the emptying out of four different syrian towns to the population relocation of thousands of people the death of hundreds of people the theft of hundreds of millions of dollars and ransom money and the general humiliation of qatar qatar or you're going to say it a country that has made deals on all sides
it's and that region and found itself trusted and and liked by nobody it's just a crazy story
so i recommend that hey and one more thing
yes listeners there's an exciting job opening it slate that i think you might be interested in i know we have a ton of lawyers and legal folks who listen to the vest because they like to hear emily and ruth and legal wisdom from folks like that and there's a job at slate that might be for

hello and welcome to the fleet political gab fact that pardon me edition for march twenty nine twenty eight and i'm emily bath john and david are where they are off on vacation but who needs them anyway because i'm here with a two excellent
das du mal gooey who is the chief political correspondent for sleep page now
hello and jacket who is a co host of uncivil game let's amazing pod cast about the hidden history of the civil war which you should all go and download as soon as you finish listening to the show a jack thanks for joining a regimental okay on this week's show we are going to talk about three topics the trip
administration has a plan to add a question about citizenship to the twenty twenty census a bunch of states and civil rights groups are suing over this idea why is this a very big deal
our second topic the legal plot surrounding donald trump thickens i think maybe we could have that is like a tagline every week but
miller the new york times is reporting that trumps erstwhile lawyer john dowd dangled the possibility of a presidential pardon in front of former campaign manager paul matter for it and national security advisor for a nanosecond michael flynn before they were indicted and influence case pled guilty
so doubt isn't actually trumps layer anymore trump is looking for new lawyers we can talk about how much we think that we should care about that and then finally there is another whole legal subplot going on involving stormy daniels her accusations that trumps lawyer michael cohen paid her
hush money her efforts to get out of her non disclosure agreement and the entry into the story of her lawyer michael of a naughty who is a kind of enjoyable character in this drama which is packed with too many characters okay and then our third topic is the partisan gerrymandering case that was before the supreme court this week this one is from
maryland it's the second part isn't gerrymandering case that the court has heard this term why is this issue back and front of the court and what did we learn from oral argument this week and of course will have cocktail chatter commerce secretary wilbur ross announced this plan to add a question about citizenship to the census ross said he was prosper
wanting to a request from the justice department that the citizenship data would be would help the justice department better enforce the voting rights act we can discuss that rationale on a minute
there are a dozen states and civil rights groups who are suing and they are saying correctly that the constitution says the census has to count all persons and the argument is that by adding us question about citizenship the census bureau would interfere with this mandate to count everybody because the count is going to go down and the state
aids in particular are claiming harm because this if there's a diminished count and that law affect their ability to be able to get government benefits for their citizens jamal marco rubio a saying that this is like a big freak out by liberals like what's the big deal asking about citizenship it's just going to be the last question on the form on
your alarm scale how high does this register
i think this was a pretty pretty serious thing having cure
count of the people in the country is a recipe for miss allocating resources then when the people who were going to be counted or
fortunately hispanic or and american or low income this hers
andrew level stroessner because the everything the says huge for his reapportionment crush congressional representation
and needing assistance of course courtroom makes roy
there were given give him under term of those region groups which will in the in reapportionment shifting power away from urban centers or wave from put on with are more communities
the deal
from the idea that this is just liberal freak out with this was overblown
is isn't by the fair past census bureau chiefs people who are intimately familiar with the census have also been sounding the alarm and saying no we really shouldn't have in the courtroom the senses
right i mean that was actually a bipartisan responds by farmer census directors right and they talked about they called it highly risky to introduce this kind of questions so late in the process as part of the stack just like a problem of making this change at the last minute
well that's that's one of the arguments with the experts are saying but the effect this could have beyond what jumbos you saying about reapportionment zone
summit simply california might lose an entire congressional sued texas would game seven seats in the state house of representatives so there would be a huge shift in power and allow minority white districts to retain power in minority majority places the other thing is that new test
did this a couple of times in other kinds of census experiments and i was reading about one where not understand latino counts but estimates of good every census because of this panic so it went down pointed out to go over
is identified by the road and writing detained or deported accidently outing one of your relatives so there's a lot of people who are legitimately could be counted as citizens who are terrified that answer the question mood so we're now putting this question on the senses and then the question is are you a citizen of the united states it's that simple
and so they've done these tests and the accounts are amazing
one point in the middle of the census questioning the woman just ran out of the house and another case when they came back the family had moved away so it's clear that it's going to cause panic and it will definitely drive down numbers that are already going down by a big amount the other thing to say here is that like this idea comes from people
chris go back and other really radical right pepe mean loving republicans it's been promoted by the guy who was briefly nominated to be the head of the census by trump was a guy who literally wrote a book arguing against competitive elections he actually thinks like having no car
petition just straight up handing the seat to republicans is the way to go so yeah there's a lot at stake here so the sexes did a study and eight showed that there is already as you are saying a groundswell of concern about data sharing and confidentiality citing you know fears of a sudden and what's happening with the
dreamers right now particularly among spanish speaking arabic speaking residents of the united states
that makes me wonder if one argument here is like already people are scared and nervous and so leg so what so adding that question like we've implicitly made people think so much more about citizenship is a mark of residency or belonging is actually adding the question really it's own harm or to
ask this question in a different way has a triumph administration effectively already won because even if this gets tied up in court and the citizenship question doesn't go on the census there's all this news and fear and alarm about it that is already dead and depressed account to melody you think about that problem you know i think that's a get suffer observation
the effect has already is already there there will be like most likely a greater undertone of these communities
for the twenty twenty senses
yeah i know i'm not sure how one would prefer instead the it's actually interesting or have mrs extremely or door but
go for it
college classmates who are either four million documented and no longer and argument third or are engaged in one
however activism room and pictures are a very vocally say no we have to become for the senses
so my hunch just hmm
go loans is that effort to convince his communities to participate or already are going but normally of and you're right
the damage has already been done the consideration has been so successful instilling fear in these new news that when has come to room
why people are just american are just to want to participate in the us code it says personal information cannot be used against respondents the census by any government agency or court but if you're inclined to be worried about this you might note that during world war two the census bureau gave the names and addresses of japanese him
americans to the secret service and that was part of the information used around people up and put them into detention camps so you know one of the other rationales the champ administration gave as well we asked a question about citizenship between eighteen twenty and nineteen fifty on the census what's the big deal bringing it back currently we ask on the american coming
the survey which goes to one in six households we ask about citizenship there so i guess again i'm just asking like is this as big a deal as big a difference as people say what's the argument to kind of push back against that history will during obama is handling of this right and in two thousand and ten
and again you know the drill the republicans thread to under fund you know the census in his eyes
his emigration cohort rigorously pursued their jobs throughout the census and obama literally said like don't know that i worry the are they went ahead with the count so on some level maybe i mean we don't know just how big a freak out it's gonna be but we did go through this and two thousand and ten and ice was in full force and people get
counted maybe not
according to sampling maybe not at the levels that they should have been straight any money thing that struck me about ross's let our with that it was very carefully written right so here's this rationale that like we need citizenship voting age population data and order ten forest the voting rights act if you were going to take
that argument
he would say like it's true that there's a litigation around latino representation in states like texas and the questions is how do you make sure that you're not diluting the power of the minority vote you look at citizenship voting date and or to make sure you have enough people who actually can vote as opposed to just people who are latino but can't vote
and yeah it's just so hard to take out trump administration concern about the voting rights act at face value that is the greatest argument from the trump administration since they fired james komi on the grounds that he was unfair to hillary exact thing that actually we have these arguments that like seems a reasonable and yet
you know though it struck me reading this letter that the trip administration has come a long way from the travel ban and what i mean by that is like that roll out was so ham fisted on it was such a mass such obvious problem now and we see government agency is doing things that seem to have fairly sinister connotations
they do it much more skillfully so i'm also thinking of the news this week that scott pruitt the head of the said you know what we're only gonna look at studies where the dina is transparent we care a lot about transparency so what does this mean it means that studies that have been crucial to looking at pollution and chemical exposure often use confidential
health data that can't be made public because it's like people's confidential health data and so you have this seemingly very benevolent rationale about transparency being turned to this other use general do you feel like that
the folks who are running these federal agencies are figuring out how to do their jobs they're just getting more competent i think that's right
think more than the year into the trumpet and the mushroom this point in with the case of the political appointees especially be sympathetic beer her to move in third with administration just more serve the skill and what they're doing grown more effective
subverting the mission to the institution to that's cool that's certainly true the department of the interior it's true that the department of justice
the thing the thing i always think about is this is the stuff that's going to take a generation to reverse yes i totally have been thinking about that because you know the twenty two thousand census those numbers stay with us and tell when you're thirty that's a long time even absent the citizens of question we have a census with budget cuts
no permanent director and so there's also just like this erosion and denigrating of government going on there's another sort of diabolical feature to this particular question and it's long term impact besides sort of luring congressional seats on the democratic side and raising them on the republicans said there's another level in which you
can kind of gerrymander districts using the voting rights act so you can create a republican majority district by vote and a democratic majority district by numbers so if you put in so say you have a fifty two to forty eight percent democratic
the majority district but if you make seven percent of them non voting non citizens than you actually have what looks like a democratic majority district but in fact it's a republican so it's a it's another tool in the short of gerrymandering quiver totally and this is related to this on principles one person one vote
and how we interpret it and the supreme court settled this question very recently there's this case called evan well vs abbott brought by the way by edward bloom the same guy who is very good at challenging affirmative action in various universities around the country and this was this open questions i'm now that and never been saddled does one person one vote actually mean
like one human being or does it mean someone who is eligible to vote are likely to vote and the supreme court said one human being but one of the reasons was that the census didn't count citizens and sell the data of wasn't as reliable of the data we have from the american community survey and so another sort of like lingering
question here is whether there's you know in line with the crisper back agenda of require proof of citizenship and boating you could also go back and open up that president about one person one vote and change how can people i really see this as part of in the united states is becoming more
racially diverse this growing cohort of non white americans are more liberal booting even if the identify conservatives they have less conservative views on a variety of issues and really be only hope for the kind of traditional hardline conservative agenda is true making sure
sure that white americans a number two
a white americans and rule x herb and places maintain kind of a group from political power in all of this to me from not just gerrymandering congressional districts put this attempt to turn of the census to the occasional every couple years a republican long republican lawmaker summer
our focus idea of allocating an electoral votes on the basis of congressional districts
nice to meet to be like him actual effort to attempt to germans are american democracy writ large to ensure a kind of fake extend little dominance of a cohort of white americans in their to politics yeah it really struck me this particular statistic i found that in the twenty
twenty cents census for the first time people are predicting that the weight share of the population that's going to fall below sixty percent and maybe it's anxiety over and that shift that striving lot of that so i'm glad you brought that up to now i mean i think democrats are in a very tough place trying to argue that counting citizens is a bad idea it just doesn't sound good on television
one but also just watching pelosi some of the others react to this it's amazing how incompetent the democrats are at trying to frame account or issue so what did she do that you thought was lame so she said you know like this is going to hurt vulnerable communities
she other people's of all night exactly as she said trump is putting politics over the constitution that's precisely what they want to hear he's stirring things up
the other thing she said was like you know he's not listening to the experts
the three points that could not possibly failed better than those three so how what what
pelosi is crap message craft or what would you recommend a couple of things one is that there was this really radical right police chief and in los angeles named darryl gates from years ago member him yeah so he actually had this special order that he made to all the cops which is under no circumstances where there to enquire to some about someone's immigration status the reason being is
it would cause a spike in crime that if you drove people away from cooperating with with law enforcement institutions and other things like that that basically would make his job harder and so there's a whole crowd
a law and order argument in favor of making an accurate count of the people and not just citizens
yeah you could get caught to step up to that there are also a huge number of republicans who oppose this change because they're from states where their districts are going to be disadvantaged after the count made alabama might lose a whole new jersey is the republicans there are vehemently against the so i mean there are republicans
you could put forward so that it looks like an unfair change in the census ray and changed the complexion of the way the the whole debate happens rather than playing and specifically to the trunk voters worse desired i can
offer that advice other for an entity little see i'm sure she's that's your hand
oh i get to our second topic i just want a t s r deflate class topic today jack and to now are going to come up with an excellent food and cooking advice for me and for you to slay plath kinds of things that i don't have time to figure out myself they are going to figure it out for us and i also wanted to remind our listeners that the gap that has a lie

i second topic sell we have this news story this week about john dad champs erstwhile layer offering to pardon man for it and flan it's the took me reading this news potential say that dowd denied that it seems at once totally bizarre and not normal and yet i'll sell i could imagine
currently going on tv the next day and being like yeah we did that so why and in fact i found a tweet from july and which chubb said all agree the us president has the complete to power to part in so jack what do you think the political consequences of this story about this dangle of a pardon offer are gonna be well will there be any
i think the thing to watch for with of doubt lawyers up in the next couple of weeks because one argument hate when argument is that he was he quit because he was he was afraid the meal was coming after him
i mean the thing to remember here is a trunk and say all this stuff because he's the president of the united states he can probably get out of this but these other people they're living in our world where the law still matters
and you can't just buffalo your way through these arguments and endowed maybe one of those people to me that i'm not clear to he i mean the rumor is maybe he quit because of this pardon thing or that he was forest our out of the others
it's not clear why exactly he quit but it is clear that he's left with essentially a bunch of radio talk show hosts and sluggish blow hards like michael cohen to be legal representation yeah amount you have any thoughts about the dad store i do you think should we care how whether chunk has like a really top high quality
layer in his corner so i don't know if we should care
it is interesting rape that the press the united states cannot get good legal representation
some would who
you know you would assume they're at least some top show from would want to represent the president but it into them have them do the three of us on this whole could get better legal representation right now than the president of the united states
come and find just reverse mean for yourself nobody would ever line efforts represent the attack
i'm very due to fund such moments
i just find a remarkable may well there some calculations so obviously you ever does this is going to be super famous and gets lots of attention and yeah you have a client who doesn't listen to you i mean that seems clear right i mean another possible reason for down leaving with and he was telling tramp not to sit for an interview with mahler and champ is insisting like i'm going to do a great job but that
despite his reputation for let's say inaccurate statements
and bolivia nation so there's that problem and then there's also the idea that chant could turn on you on any second and you become the goat and restore story for two theories about this one one is in a lot of a prominent law firms there are a number of women now her partner level and they're they're not to go wash on this yeah interest and the other one is that it
possibly may be the least and legal circles we've reached the tipping point of trumps dignity racing as josh marshall as it were like people fear that if they take this job rather than amplify their resume it's actually going to ruin them what gary coleman i mean there's a number of people now
who just wandering the earth
shell's of their former selves and and it's know the atlas taylor said tiller i mean people see these guys and they realize like in all likelihood that will be me if i take this job
so should we be worried and i have of criminal or constitutional terms about trumps layer dangling it's hard enough right let's assume this story is trail said there is this interesting piece on the blog just security this mean by alex waiting was a harvard law professor and he was making the ah
argument that a pardon dangle is different and actually more problematic legally speaking that an actual open pardon offer and sell weddings argument is that dowd dangling an offer before an indictment and guilty plea was done in secret done to discourage cooperation with an ongoing investigation without any kind
public scrutiny so you're saying like a promise don't worry trying to early on cut off whatever cooperation flynn is giving and manner for it could give and that we should actually analyze that differently legally speaking in terms of its constitutionality and the possibility that it could become part of an obstruction charge against our
god or against tramp if you could prove if dowd could then say that trump encouraged him to do this to say it but everything i've heard from legal scholars kind of concurs agrees with trump that he had the power is pretty absolute and there's really there's no good constitutional law behind any kind of restriction of it and so i don't know
giving it or dangling it i think doesn't matter it doesn't matter at least it's not clear gym outlets what are your thoughts any i don't have any particular expertise here although my intuition
is also the department of the president's pardon power is absolute this just gets district of the way in which could have been people around him but being essentially shameless have completely confounded the constitutional order that someone someone from system only work
if the people within it has some true shame which is a signal from should have commitments be armed themselves or even a commitment to their own jan's like self interest in that just an extremely narrow below since because doesn't have that the system initiative and a loss for what to do with him
intuitively we all kind of think that dangling a pardon in the face of an investigation is room even if it's not illegal he shoot you'd would imagine that a different president with some awareness of what this rate due to his party with this ring to to his agenda would refrain from taking
step because i'm only really thinks about himself in his of animal is stick my immediate security sense those considerations are in their way i mean i have to point out as always do or it does at this point in the conversation that if we had a congress that was willing to think hard about
what it means to have a president corrupt they use its power that you know impeachment is not narrowly defined legally but because the republicans in congress have so little interest and ness we end up having a conversation about what strictly unlawful in either criminal or constitutional terms and
you're right and we totally don't know the answer to the at their unsettled questions instead of having the more sort of like reasonable or easier to attain conversation about norms and what's right or wrong we end up with this conversation about like the galaxy and that precise meaning of corruptly impeding and investigation and the extra
action of justice federal statute you get the sense that in certain circles there are these norms people in those circles are abide by them are alarmed when they're breached and them as the president one more thing that i found really just striking about the story was that leaked i mean i and maybe this is the layer and me but
there's all kinds of attorney client privilege that should be relevant here the layers for a man afford and flynn who didn't comment in the times they shouldn't be the sources for this doubt shouldn't be the source like where did this come from did it come from champ are magnified are flynn one other staff members know about that
this idea i was really confounded by that question where wouldn't have come from i guess is there an advantage for men afford or flimsy council to to leak this doesn't make it does it maybe encourage trumped up to the park or mean is that a strategy for someone who's out to get john doubt i mean obviously read or is the worst from dowd he's the only one is dirt
leon the huck yeah the whole thing like that part of it bothered me
other people in the counsel's office that we're trying for vying for dad's job well done things they that way no because the white house counsel is like over there separately right medina yeah yeah i ran and even ty cobb is organizing how much to cooperate with mahler and what to turn over rate we have to talk just a little bit about stormy daniels her lawyer and michael
i am really enjoying his entry into the job
a particular character and type i'm so he is being super aggressive he's having a great time with his moment in the sun he this week filed a motion he want to depose trump to take his sworn testimony also wants to take the testimony of michael cullen trumps layer and this is off course about this one hundred and thirty thousand dollar payment made to daniel
days before the two thousand and sixteen election
jim now some commentators seem to feel like stormy daniels this is a side shell and it has a kind of like monica lewinsky possible feeling to it of far far from the russia investigation all it out the president sexual pack a day although it's like beneath us is that how you feel about or do you think there's something more substantive
but think
beneath us to pay attention to this desert least one actually quite serious concern that this raises which is that if the president and his team have been willing to spend large sums of money to cover up an affair what else
he has the as donald trump in his past spend large amounts of money to cover up how black male level is the president but beyond that i mean just thinking politically
significant know just that the president is can have caught in this scandal like a like everything i mean really like almost every every scandal this one has had gross staying power that's in part because of the daniels legal team has done a great job of keeping the story the news of releasing tip
bit of the tripping out information and kind of taking advantage of the media's should have
obsession with appetite appetites i couldn't resist and giving the when you live
seems fitting guess yes exactly as is ongoing we learn things like that this may not actually prevent daniels from from speaking if there are other women for whom trump is done this that also raises a question about their in the and their ability to speak publicly do you think this hasn't real pretty
henshaw of snowballing and also does affect the political situation that the republican party which is then forced the kind of and least addressing this defending the president's actions yeah that's really interesting the flow jap the idea that stymied daniels as using a strategy that champion fell fell masterful adding kind of
key thing that er bits of information at our class reality television that's how i understand store me is not as a legal question but as a competitor in the twitter sphere and in the attention markets today it's about campaign finance reform or maybe it's about defamation that's the new angle
again attack or ads against her out are getting liking her daughter out of a car to the gulag and then she is dropping one chrome at a time and she's doing to trump trump is is doing to the country this twitter constant twitter feed constant turning the story back to her understand the sixty minute show got better ratings than
every episode of the apprentice he knows that and it has to be galling right and so if you don't follow stormy on twitter you really should she is brilliant
fending off trolls she corrects their spelling when they come at her with vulgarity about her about what she does for a living she's super sex positive and just come right back at them vulgarity doesn't shame doesn't affect her because she is coming to this in this wide open way at the same way that tromp was
you know teflon candidate back when jab and marco and all these guys were trying to hurl insults at him you know she is doing to trump what he what he did that yeah you know as as someone who has written about sex work at me it is so gratifying to see a an actress and a business while men come forward and be
frank and forthright and to me credit ball and just as you're saying like an embarrassed and yeah she's doing a really good job of representing herself and she reminds me a lot of characters in the deuce and david simon i shall reign of out the point industry in times square in their seventy's like there's just
kind of openness to her the way she's presenting herself that i think it's just like really good one last thing will change them
taking a page from trumps own playbook is that apparently you know he does now have a nickname just like he gives other people nickname oh really president spanky
hey and family or even republicans them and in dc year now i didn't know that you know and i should have because i've been waiting for the nickname i feel like that's actually have been a problem for people a chance that he has been found much better and nickname that's true i thought benedict benedict donald would catch on
but i think presidents bank he has you know better i feel like that marchetti i have accolade and see where that goes to
nordstrom has a special holiday tree for you for eliminate time on north him that can get free two day shipping and selected areas on thousands of items just in years they put on their site to see all the great items you can shop exclusions a plaque
very topic the lawsuit benefactor first known came to the supreme court this week this is a lawsuit over the six district in maryland which was redrawn and twenty eleven to boost the likelihood that the party would go from having on six democrats and to republican congress to seven democrat
rats and one republican and when he was asked about this redistricting plan in a deposition the democratic former governor of maryland mart no malley said yes i did my duty within the meats and bounds and maryland law to try it out my party he knew that this redistricting would be more likely to elect a democrat than or
public and that was clearly has intact so that america is on the record saying that just like republican lawmakers in north carolina have been on the record saying like yes we did political gerrymandering we thought it was perfectly legal so sue us and in fact and it in light of vaguely legal added has been perfectly legal exactly so jack should it content
due to be perfectly legal well so that's the question that maybe the supreme court is going to take up but even he has another line and there were he says of yeah i created this district to be more likely to elect a democratic and republican yes this was clearly my intent right so we're no make no mistake man no think about it he was saying what the supreme court said
which is which is distracting is purely a political act of political phenomenon and should be entirely handed off to the legislatures right he's also by the way in favor of reforming how we gerrymander but he's out of the closet saying yes i do it and which puts him a little bit ahead of some of the other guy
governors pretending like they're making a fair map by the way just to give you a sense of just how gerrymandered some of our states are doubly so pennsylvania which normally is a battleground state and the presidential elections meaning it's roughly fifty fifty is thirteen republicans out of eighteen seats north care
landis the same it's ten out of thirteen seats and republican in a battleground state so has huge effect this this case but the question is what can the supreme court do to change the partisan gerrymandering that goes on because it seems like fifty years ago maybe it was harder to gerrymander because there just wasn't good data
but the problem is now is that you can really fine tune the data so that you can actually move one house after another with these great computer programs and you can actually gerrymander every district to a fairly well i mean you can actually get precisely the exact vote it's no longer the voters selecting the representatives it's the representatives selecting they're on voter
wait and the answers your question luck in the supreme court do is the judges can use the same tools to analyze how much partisanship went into the gym and during how much this redistricting is based on party preference as opposed to that traditional principle is that some states put into law about you know how compact is the district doesn't respect existing
county and city lines are the lie are the district die in a manner that can take us out of said something that the supreme court can even solve i mean can you can you decide how much partisanship goes into a gerrymandering will doubtless like them i would say one a very few interesting moments in oral argument this week was this this question so in we have a long tradition of address
racial gerrymandering right but as i think chief justice roberts pointed out we don't say like okay a certain amount of racial discrimination enjoying district is okay but with political gerrymandering the courts are likely to say that as long as the district in many states remains in the hands of the legislatures and so i think
the hope if you want the courts to step in here is that they're going to start by saying well really extreme efforts of gerrymandering are unconstitutional and then you have two questions one is this question of intent which an alley was so nice to put on the record but presumably if the court start treating this and in marseille
aspect fashion future politicians are not going to say stuff like family said and then you just have like the various measures of part is any symmetry that different political scientists have come up with to look at and i mean to me it seems like you could wrestle through that there could be a whole bunch of lower court rulings and efforts to figure out which of these tasks or more
useful are you put together some composite of the tasks and not all seems like within the realm of the courts if they choose to do it to now what do you think about this from a kind of political as well was legal point of view because you know one of the arguments against worrying too much about part and gerrymandering as well
democrats or republicans have sorted themselves anyway and ten cities and rural districts and yes republicans have a geographic advantage but that's not something that court should worry about that something that you know the political system should address on its own are not addressed it could me isn't are you just doesn't take history and to accrue
the best example this is if you get actually the midwest right
and you get a map population
police reports and ship
you look at it
over them construed and cleveland or their country some temerity the
in chicago in milwaukee and so forth he sure you can say this just reflects care of the gertrude geographic for distribution of him their identities but if the overlay of our up over america population my race where you see is that all those democratic concentrations are mostly just black people the reasons why they're going to people cross train
the two particular census tracts in particular cities has everything to do with determination
violence and so and so forth for me at least that that raises a really important question which i do you want our system for district king to basically reinforce racial inequality
i understand that's probably not something that the court is terribly concerned with but as as politics and something to discuss of my public life
no we don't want that in that we should be looking for ways to make sure that it doesn't the narrowness of conversation divert gerrymandering i think frustrates me because
wilbur deal yeah are dealing with a broad question about that kind of democracy want to have for my part it is not great that if you happen to live in a city
if you happen to live in a good neighborhood
essentially begins to mean very little of the scheme of things can i just say that there is another solution or at least one kicking around which is that voters themselves even ones in districts that they like are repelled by the idea that they can't have they don't get a choice i going to give a shout out to a republican governor
larry hogan of maryland who actually filed an amicus brief against himself and his state in favor of and nine nonpartisan commission being created to draw the maps and so that's one thing this happening and some of the states is that the voters are demanding that the redistricting be taken away from the legislature
and given to a nonpartisan committee and i don't know if that solves the problem but one thing it will do is that will make those sort of like unsightly the the jerry the salamander portion of the gerrymandering metaphor
less likely so if you look at like pennsylvania
a bunch of a lot of these districts around say pittsburgh are these big rural was taking a small bite out of pittsburgh to dilute urban power it looks ridiculous if you just look at the current map and if you look at the map that the courtroom the pennsylvania new supreme court yeah didn't play the maps that they drew it's largely just like this clump here
this clump there it it looks right the other one doesn't look right in there is a visual component to this that i think would be harder to pull off if you had a bipartisan committee saying like come on bob look at look at this area and ridiculous yeah i mean the nonpartisan commissions and in some states like california and six ass fall
measured in terms of how many competitive races there are which is a pretty good way of thinking about their funding and can also think about fairness of edging toward proportional representation
one argument against the supreme quiet finding a way for courts to a gas parties and jay mandarin as well states should all have non tires and commissions and if the courts can't many this problem that will push mar states and that direction at an hour had strikes you to now i'm actually fine without a if you would asked me this five years ago
or eight years ago my inclination to say yeah this is this is a fundamentally win a prize in that it should remain in brooklyn and price but as the technology is true and more sophisticated i think that in itself is a very
important change that for me means that maybe we should take the center of the hands of politicians are at least take the hands of partisan entities and put it into the hands of i think ethel accountable institutions in the missile accountable to voters but it isn't
directly consumer product and personal concerns and asked want to add to this conversation is there seems to be adequate representation in general there are three hundred and twenty plus million people in the country but we have four hundred thirty five oxygen
viruses in the house and think that ratio makes these conversations over gerrymandering regular for british even more fraught this just isn't limited pool of potential representation there are a variety of schemes that would say increase in size by fifty seats are sexy see through seventy seeds
in those has been largely distributed pretty evenly across the country that's right and saying yeah and that's a nonpartisan obviously york i mean yeah it it would be it's a kind of situation or california we get like you know thirteen additional seats but texas bucket nine and in georgia would give three and it would all kind of bounty they are balance each other out taken nationally
and i have one my observation i want to make about the supreme court so one of the questions why did the quiet take this maryland case since it already had a j mandarin case from wisconsin and when the quiet check the case my assumption was think well if they're going to find that there's no way for cards to do anything
you don't need a second case sell it seems like maybe the idea was to have a case where i democratic gerrymander was being challenge and that would provide some political cover for addressing this problem but i had her thigh about this after all our argument so that the key vote on the court is justice kennedy on this case presumably
justice briar seems in favor of finding some kind of role for quarks and policing parties and giant mandarin he flirted a couple of times in argument the idea of let's kick this today calendar for next year let's hear wisconsin in maryland and the north carolina case and think about
all van together and what kinds of remedies we could have that would address the different kinds of gerrymandering the different kinds of proof we had a cases and first i was think rolling my eyes at this idea i mean really like we need to do this all over again and then i thought her if they have to do it over again that would be reason for justice candy to stay on the supreme court next year
there have been rumours as their had them for the last few years that he is about to retire in this is a big deal issue one that he has written about in the path and seems to care about ally and i wonder if just as by as a sort of alternative motivation here that's some serious triple bank shot
evidence suggests just like why did it
this conspiracy exactly
the thing about you mentioned kennedy
as i understand it his argument is it excessively partisan gerrymandering
disfavor favors different people's first amendment rights radioactive to express your political opinion as an association
if you marginalize a whole group based on their political association you violated their the first and emirates yes and she has a really cool way to to think about it yes and that is actually the main argument of the challengers and the maryland case that was another possible reason why they added this case the dock at you're absolutely right

it is this a strangely into action movie action movie
you can imagine the pig solution to make a thriller involving one of the biggest stars in hollywood but when it turned out to be as it's like very cerebral very tense film for the first hour and a half day in to conclusion
becomes a kind of late michael mann does is take of jason voorhees movie with tom cruise playing the monster at the end it's very strange in very interesting i would highly recommend it i also recommend man's follow up to collateral which which is two thousand and six miami vice film is extremely strong
change
currently deconstruct good action film where the action is incidental to the entire narrative and everything's about atmosphere and feel and mood and it also star is jamie foxx than him and and cone feral as though is the white guy in this case highly recommend them if you're looking for gestured of quasi experimental
mainstream movies that check out which is what i do when i'm sick jack are you going to need shattering about a very direct that's what i have been chattering about is this writer television producer
anthony horowitz i read a book by him
oh by the way back up and say like occasionally i will run into something that i really like like for instance when i saw mark or islands and chrome well i had read the hillary mantles books and love that show and then i found myself just basically renting every market islands movie so lately best us our been doing stuff so i read mag by
murders which is this sounds like a really dopey book because it's a book about him a book editor editing a mystery novel and then the novelist in the book gets killed it sounds as if you know it sounds super lucky i read it and us really enjoyable it's really good yeah and i thought he really outsmarted me
what i was expecting the narrative to go and where i thought like maybe this is going to be a little too clunky when he marries the the the fictional world with the non fictional world and a really really pulls it off it was really entertaining already the head and then i found myself a while back slipping into a british television series called foils war
which if you haven't seen is fantastic it's about a detective trying to hold loan or together in the middle of a or and right afterwards turns out every one of those episodes was written by anthony horowitz and then i just picked up my wife and i are sherlock holmes freaks and were reading together right now
turns out that that's also written by inherit and i really just kind of like a winner is at the same guy op and it's all the same yeah it's not like five people so this is an accidental sort of marker islands thing where i'm i'm suddenly wake up to minors and the but i will say that for this kind of middle brow kind of mystery plotting he he is better than average i mean much
better with them with the show of hands book the certain expectations you have when you're reading a sherlock holmes books like of sherlock holmes is not in the story then he's in the sky somewhere in the story right and he's already he's already messed with me on that one throughout the book he knows what you're sort of narrative expectations are and is fooling with those while you're reading
or watching the show so anyway recommend of course i well those are tough match my fan fantastic the nine i'm gonna play my usual legal nerd wrong
i am really interested in our petition for the supreme quiet by brandon gaseous sell branded as he may remember is that teenager in the documentary making a murderer and if you saw that documentary or just catch their spit on line his interrogation is desk completely terrifying moment in which he
she's this kid who doesn't totally understand what's going on and the police lead him to implicate himself and ness like murder and it seems apparent that he is powerfully confessing and yet he was convicted on in part based on this video tape deposition so his petition to the supreme court with rectify that
that injustice i mean to me watching the video tape it just seems so apparent that something some travesty as a current that i can't believe the lower courts didn't figure out a way to overturn the connection but they didn't and more broadly his lawyers or at least like that various friend of the court briefs are arguing that what the supreme court should really be doing it said
a standard for how juveniles can be interrogated one that recognizes the same science about adolescent brain development that has led supreme court justices in particular justice kennedy to worry about death sentence says and life without parole sentences for juvenile so i'll be really interested to see if the supreme court t
makes this case and also in law suit watching land maryland and dc got through the very first round of the monuments clause suit against top so this is the suit that says that because champ owns a stake in you know various businesses and particular at the trump hotel in the us postal office
building think that that maryland and dc have had businesses that have been harmed by this competition and that because the president isn't supposed to be able to accept gifts and arguments that this should be illegal sell will be interesting to see what kind of depositions and evidence gathering discovery the judge allows in that case
so far it's alive eleven my can simply create one of those charts who we have all the sort of zones of lawsuits that are going after the president because you've got a monuments you've good stormy is now doing this sort of a defamation thing but that was also defamation was also jessica drake has our call
yeah some are know some of the average dumber drake was a harassment right right and then you good schneiderman the new york going after some of these real estate things and then you've got mueller of course school and after whatever money laundering collusion something obstruction it just seems like pretty much every zone of the presidency
of legal pursuit somehow has a lawsuit diameter
and for all this we can thank of course paula jones who run your sued bill clinton the supreme court said no it is not too distracting to forest the president to be the target of us have a lawsuit while he's in office and you saw that storm has is now insisting on a deposition guess the best reality show

what political government a book that when he came the caravan get better addition i did with plot battles with your back from vacation which explains the in my voice was columbia south america which i strongly recommend we may talk more about that later
but man do i recommend columbia and john dickerson of cbs this morning in new york is also back hello john hi can you have path in your voice your pet in your step
oh i don't like a path in your voice
well i suppose you can but i just have always heard it when it's in your step and then leads me to the question of what in god's name is pat anyway
yeah it's my boy
my one of my kids try to energy during yesterday for the first time and it was crazy because he was so pepe it was those things are dangerous
there was pep that was in a voice that's another that yes sugar and caffeine
who knows what else that other voice that is of course and as one of the new york times magazine and was back from nowhere she home the good ship deb first brilliantly while we were gone through storms and whirlpools hello emily
and if pepe shirt for pepe then you definitely to have that in your voice so i rescind my previous man
that before we get show i learned an amazing fact on twitter emily i don't have you noticed with to someone with tweet treated at us asking john about his first career yeah that was at hari john was a member of the atari youth can now he's literally have added i believe i can help
john a can't just give us the ten seconds what do you mean you are on the atari
you cancel makes it said well i guess who it was actually called as the atari youth advisory board which sounds more corporate but the youth council sounded like we're all like little brat her shirts or something but when i was a kid you're all like introduced to computers i had a tear as eighty and then i exchange that for and atari eight hundred which is the first i think the four hundred was the
first model anyway and i was like a little computer programmer and because i was a little computer programmer with a guy named robert all britain who is now the publisher of politico actually we wrote programs
did some things with computer games which
may have a while anyway we played a lot of computer games anyway we worked at the consumer electronics show in i think it was nineteen eighty two when that was just starting and then they formed this thing
buys reward which was an effort to get input from their computer users it was mostly on the computer and not the video gaming end
and unknown
i got it as a result of doing that i got they flu us out too
california we had like three days of meetings that i kind of barely remember
and then we were given an atari twelve hundred which was like sleek new computer and then not that long after that there they were basically swamped by pc is an apples and
they took your advice
but i remember one of the first things we got in addition to the twelve hundred was a copy of exile for
or the atari and we were supposed to use it and make recommendations and do things like that and i had a a b s which they were called back and
which i guess would essentially have been my own web page that you could dial into that the amazing i went for too many more stories of that on this week's gab fest robert mahler has reportedly told the president that he is a subject but not a target of investigation what on earth does that mean
i can explain then president trumps impulsive fury tweets about immigration and amazon what impact might they have on public policy and then why does the administrator scott still have a job while through up cocktail chatter and a reminder we're just
four weeks out from our st louis show me a great guess and candor the former secretary of state of missouri for senate candidate now voting rights organizer and activists is going to guest with us
the shows on may second child concert hall and me with there's still some tickets left it's can be very very fun please go to sleep that com slash live for more details and to get tickets a washing post story on tuesday dropped two rocks and the pond of the russian investigation the first is that robert muller an effort to
suede the president to sit for an interview presumably told hammer told his lawyers back in march that he the president is not a target
of knowledge investigation is a subject of knowledge investigation muller secondly also apparently said that he was planning to create two reports about his investigation the first which might come out there might be completed and sent to rot steam in june and july would be about the possible obstruction of justice and the second would be more about
russia and russia and interference inclusion and that might come later so john first of all where did this story come from so the the answer seems to be moments he does not seem to be leaner leaking at all so that suggests it has come from the president law know that lanka so i one of the reasons we know that it's not i mean well
another development this week not to there were other many other developments but one of the developments this week is that the special counsel responded and the forty four page memo to the assertion by paul man affords legal team that special counsel had gone beyond his brief in charging man afford for crimes or
alleged crimes he committed before he ever was connected to the trump administration and he produced a memo that rod rosenstein had or the approval from rod rose and sign allowing the special counsel to go ahead and go after man afford it was almost a year old was august twenty seventeen dollars i'm going through this is we're just now learning about that authority from rosenstein the fact that that was never leaked even
when the president was calling this a weird hunt even when metaphor for it was first charge and the president and then affords lawyer said that
i had gone beyond his scope of his investigation the fact that didn't leak even when it would have been in the special council's benefit to have it leak in the papers that gives you some sense of how are strange he is there is some feeling that this could have company presidents legal team on one side of it or the other one being the president saying hey i'm not a target isn't that great
you see i told you know but he was suspicious about my behavior and other side sad or another argument was that this would leaks by the people who said no no it's a trap being told you're not a target is meaningless and it's just an effort by mahler to get you'd come in and talk and say things that will get you ultimately in trouble
because of your because of the tendency not to tell the truth about things that took place at first this was a bombshell and then as i thought about it and read more about it i was wondering emily whether if you're a target
like isn't being a subject to sort of a precondition for some day being a target and isn't being and sub don't you really want to be a witness not a subject just fyi away right away and doesn't this puts you like the difference genius subject and a target can be like two minutes yeah and and then finally also the reason this report is interesting
right is that there's an argument that you can't you can't date presents anyway so she could never be a target because he's a president and therefore if it's going to have to go through the impeachment route you would never say he was a target even if you had a picture of him with the smoking gun are and where john you've gone through like the in one question to let's narrow it first
what is the distinction between subject and target and why does it matter and is john correct that that one is it's on the road to be lend can be on to the other so being i think it's helpful to talk about as being the criminal target so like once your identified in that way it's the investigators and
whoever that prosecutors are saying like your our guy or the person who are trying to date and you're a subject of the investigation than they're interested in you they could turn you into a sure i get that they haven't yet made that decision so it gives you more incentive to cooperate norm i i like a normal person in the story and not the president in
this case the peril of that trumps legal team sees is that if he goes and does this interview and makes false statements are his mother or reason to believe he acted correctly that crush where and the obstruction of justice statute when he fired com year when he did like the twelve other things that could be material for an obstruction charge
the trumpet be putting himself in jeopardy and essentially moving himself from subject to criminal target zone so yeah i don't think it's hugely meaningful the champ hasn't been yet designated a criminal target if if he had been that would have been really shocking and we would not want to see that piece of information leaked
way there is this whole separate discussion about whether or when you can end date the president which i don't know if lot of talk about right now or not we we will get that second but let's continue on this subject target distinction first second and my i don't understand maybe maybe i'm i'm malicious the deceptive con i don't
by prosecutors need to tell people they are criminally targets are subjects why can't they just lie about it why can't they just be like oh we just want to talk to you
if i have kept why is it necessary to to give them a heads up morning by the way we want to charge and then going out the miranda warning where we say to you like anything you can you say can be used against you you have the right to a are all those things have to do with questioning someone in a setting in which they could be in criminal
jeopardy and sale it's actually really important that we don't let the prosecutors learn people into speaking without layering up without having a sense of what their rights are and what their exposure as and also isn't this in the context of in this might be useful side road to go down briefly isn't is in the context of the negotiating team about getting him
to testify doesn't have to testify of the grand jury has been impaneled or his only remedy in theory if you wanted to push it all the way to the wall is to plead the fifth but presumably mahler's trying to get something short of that and therefore is entered into these negotiations with his lawyers and so the first reasonable question a lawyer would ask is okay boy what is the con
text of this conversation that the president is going to have with you what is he is he a witnesses the subject is he a target
exactly of the things are too i mean i think the answer to your question is i mean i think that champ has to testify i think the supreme court precedents on the nixon tapes makes that clear but if trump or wants to challenge that he can go to the supreme court and we can get a definitive answer to whether the president has to obey
hey you know a subpoena or a request for testimony a special prosecutor now bill clinton decided to do it and didn't push the question to the wall and yes i suppose trump could plead the fifth and that would be fascinating given that we're not you know so to go back to the question of whether the present can be indicted what's going on in that context no clue
are supreme court law at all but a justice department memo from nineteen seventy three renewed in two thousand which says kind of briefly that the justice department has concluded that the president cannot be prosecuted and then i think just in a sentence or two it includes the word indictment in there that you know muller will feel bad
by that memo walter danger of former solicitor general for clinton min interesting argument a week or two ago that actually the president could be in day did because you have to you have that's the only way to preserve the criminal charges because otherwise like the time for them collapse and so you could date a president even if you can't force him to go through a trial but
that from mothers point of view indicting the president is not a by the books move and i think that's why we all think it's so unlikely that he is going and take it upon itself to do that
can i ask a question about that
the justice department memo office of legal counsel memo that you're talking about is that refers only to federal indictment and a federal prosecution state does this any of this apply to a state the state of new york take the evidence it's been gathered insofar as it applies to a crime it might have been committed new york
and and really london i don't think we know the answer to that i would have thought the reason or one key reason why the department of justice or by the federal prosecutors could not and date is that federal prosecutors work for the president and that's the executive the justice department as part of the executive branch which is supervised by the president and that's weird but state attorney general
i don't have anything to do with the president and so and also i don't see how the state department just as could bind what state attorney general's could do well in fact the nemo in two thousand from the office of legal counsel says very broadly that the department of justice concluded and nineteen seventy three that the indictment and criminal prosecution of the setting
resident when unduly interfere with the ability of the executive branch to perform its constitutionally assigned duties and would violate the constitution separation of powers
so i don't think that completely opposite and has chen it doesn't say federal only and the constitutionally and same duties i suppose could argue extend to stay prosecution but the idea of violating separation of powers would seem to be limited to federal and prosecution for the reasons you gave the president it seems to me
has three options with responsible or one use pound sand to use take the fifth and three is cooperate town sand is you don't have the right asked me on the president i can do whatever i want i have powers that are you know that you're infringing on to make a constitutional challenge about when
you can ask these questions at all the other is to say sure you to ask them but i have a i have a constitutionally protected right to defense against self incrimination and those are two different things right yeah and he had any could do the first in there he is some suggestion that he is at least noodles with the first by basically saying the version of
president nixon said which is when a president does it it's not illegal
and therefore if you're looking into obstruction under the power of the unitary executive i can fire my f d i a director for whatever reason i want and therefore you can't ask me questions about that because it's perfectly legal in there are no grounds to have a conversation the reason i think this is interesting is it feels like he could go down that road and i
you know people's responses to this they say no it's all very clear he absolutely has to testify as if that would cordon off his ability to try to make this claim kinetic the and it may not work but i still think it's a possibility that he might make that claim i agree with everything you just said can i ask you that guys a question
in is you have to negotiate with my lawyer
rather i've taking care of that you have to answer questions unless you're gonna play in fact okay so you know the part john mentioned earlier in are quite messy
the way through this about reports so we know from this news report that mahler's supposedly contemplating these two reports that presumably to rosenstein that's what the statute calls for it doesn't call for muller to make them public himself and also in this statute may or may not there's an interesting debate about this
discourage him from writing along ken starr like report in any case is to reports supposedly the obstruction one comes first and then the one about russian interference come second and get that like i had the same one i don't understand like i really don't understand so if the i mean maybe this is of course false but let's just go
go with the news version that we have right now
why are we going to be able to understand the evidence for obstruction if we don't know what the underlying crime was or wasn't i feel like that's going to be a big problem politically and legally and just like in my brain i how you know whatever charmed did or didn't do these commies firing etc
cetera
all these moments of interference depend on whether he was interfering with something that was like a significant and real or not so i just feel like that
the question of order there has been bugging well now it does this work a policeman's rushing into a house you don't know for what purpose them policeman is rushing into the house but you see him rushing and you tackle him do we need to know for the purpose of the reason he was rushing to make a claim about my obstructing him well
you don't need to i think for the purpose of making a prosecution
i don't know you may or may not need to know the reason there may be yeah think i had been certainly you would want new sure definitely will you run noon wanna know and and there's an issue i'm not sure why you need to rush into issuing a report about it and then we will and is chump that when least many no no and usually attack
caterpillar drug yes so then how come may want it now because of that but if the tackle or is tried and stop the policemen for me to see i don't really have all that incriminate ham right yes
well that's interesting yeah ok okay i know this isn't the analogy will put this debate and a minute but if i wouldn't necessarily be you would wanna know right because yes in part of this is also a not only part of it the central claim right is whether the present what was in the president's head so you need to know kind of the facts of the of the investigation mountainous
okay
so i i i i'm mystified that i share your mystery i had the same thought really wondered i was hoping you were going on my no i don't think it makes sense i'm hoping it's just wrong honestly or it reflects fact that we don't know i mean one thing about the nine investigation and i continually enjoy is that there are these parts of it
don't know about i mean that with clear the other thing i really enjoyed about the long report that we referring to early or with the information about for it and has these huge redacted sec yeah has clearly there are other people being investigated wow the people we don't know about that and connections being made so you know maybe we just chalk this up to the greater
damn of the team and we small models on the outside cannot begin to understand that strength of the or process will could very well be the president's best defender but it's also just great to see you know especially since there's so many other things in our lives where people are behaving in a way that is totally sham baltic and
against all the normal practices and rules to see somebody sort of doing the joe friday routine in a sustained and methodical way our last single point which is not really question which is emily just confirmed this is correct
going back to why mahler it you will report and if he felt he couldn't criminally in date the president the idea would be he would present something which presumably congress would get a hold of and congress could then make a decision about whether this these were grounds for impeachment or not to even if even if muller was
family and date he could present something which which would be evidence or a brief that might be part of an impeachment case is that right absolutely and that's the obvious constitutional remedy and that we have here is why the elections well there are many reasons why the november twenty right next to a members election
these are important and this is one of them
all right

and weird and fox driven on immigration he used the holiday weekend to go all in about a variety of immigration issues that he locked together
he threw together a group of asylum seekers a caravan of asylum seekers that they've been called making their way north from central america confided that with dhaka with catch and release with put an army troops on the border
and there seems to be public policy coming out of this classic classic trump impulse policy and then kind of on a parallel track it about the same time he has been savaging amazon and calling for perhaps a revision to and a deal than amazon has with the post office essentially because he does not like the wash
and post which is owned by the founder of amazon gift basis
oh
emily
well on immigration where does this all come from we're gonna we're going to end up with an entirely new public policy based on presidential bile and from what i can see it comes out of a mix of trumps actual own dismay of not getting funding for the border wall combined with people guess on fox and friends talking about
particular border things that they don't like combined with a story of this caravan combined with ann coulter a former ally of his really going after him on television combined with perhaps traveling tomorrow mara lago and been alone in a room with his very hard line immigration advice or stephen hill or so
is that mean that that comprehensive explanation is there more me to actually reflects some deeply held belief that he now wants to carry out and in policy for know i think it's exactly what you said it's that
turned to the base and also i fear of the base and i also think the news coverage totally changed then york times pack as the daily did a great like rundown of various news casters not just on fox talking suddenly about have the president was being strict on immigration in wanting stronger borders and he loves the idea of invoking the military
in our vast and i think it was very fact and from his point of view and that's the other explanation for like he did it the facts
certainly in that first tweet storm be damned i mean the facts of of the caravan coming because of dhaka which there was no evidence for and the fact that the caravan wasn't going to make it past the border for which there was no evidence now they're he does seem to be some evidence if you look at the border arrests that they are ups three times from where they were in march of last year
that's because of the weather
that's not a surprise if you look at the graphs of border arrest stay go up and a very very predictable time over the last many years why is this such an emergency situation it should have been one for which they had a long time to prepare and just a period of time for which they've been in office but also many
years of policy planning for hand over all border crossings are down in the united states and the ocean that there's a crisis here is psycho whipped up fake id i can't really take place i it's ninety degree angle no sense like the lowest level since nineteen seventy one area in precisely one of the things that i think it is a terrible thing that a government can do
something that authoritarian governments do and and even democratic governments do on the way to becoming an authoritarian governments are ticket or a government is to declare an emergency what is normal and i think we're seeing trump do a bit of that around immigration that it's not that they're orange prob
but it's the problems are predictable and kind of normal baseline problem and it's also not even that the solution and he's proposing is so terrible i mean george w bush than national guard troops the border present obama said national guard troops to the border
it's been done before i actually have no i'm not smart enough to know whether it's good or bad policy but if not radical policy what is radical is is to put it in emergency terms because that allows you rhetorically and then perhaps even in policy ways to to take liberties and
to impose
changes and draconian rules on people that are not good in the long term the other thing david bringing doc into a conversation about border crossings is a lamp tarnishing the dreamers and letting jump off the hook for having rescinded the order that protected them and for in my view early is blowing up the negotiations at the democrats
which would have given him the law funding that was his original ask so there's also illness you know there's all these insinuations here are you whip up people's fear of border crossings and kind of uncontrolled migration and then you also try to implicate the people who are already here with you on that has been an actual pub
sympathy
we got a letter from listener
sorry i don't have her name in front of me but she's i think a kind of liberal listener and and are questioned us was look i'm a i'm a liberal but i'm in and patriotic american and i don't think we can't have open borders we can't allow everyone who wants to come in the country
country and if we have borders we have to enforce border law we have to
make sure that people aren't getting in here illegally and benefiting so what does a generous hearted but concerned liberal like me supposed to think may be president trump is right and that we do need to to be more draconian about this what what's your response to her
well til know look open borders
very different from what we have now that they would be changing a huge earth shattering change of thousand we had there's a whole really interesting debate about whether the united states should have open borders whether they're yes it will be there be lots of population shifts that it would eventually kind of even out and couldn't the country i'm still are
you know many tens of millions more people who live here certainly we have a lot of space
the pace of that if you can totally you know you'd have to think through it could it all just sort of like work out in the end i don't know enough about all of that to have a strong opinion one way or the other however what we have now is so far away from open borders we do not let their many people in we send people back all the time
and what we're talking about doing if trump makes the legislative our policy changes he wants to is a system in which we afford even last due process to people and then we currently do and there is precious little for many many people they never have layers they get detained they spend years into
attention if they don't leave immediately
you can worry about open borders and think that you have to have an answer to that question thought through or you can say like in the reality that we live in we already protect the bard are strongly in that debate right now is whether we want to ratchet up the pressure or even further in a world in which as john sad
overall immigration level illegal immigration is down
what it was nineteen seventy one and also of course we do have job for a lot of these people they are doing jobs that wages that a lot of native born americans don't want to work for and that is like another whole part of this equation
think i mean i do think like on practical terms you want to do you want to prioritize your own to prioritize getting rid of people who are dangerous so that the people who end up staying are the people who are the hardest working and most likely to contribute to society you want to attract the brightest people you can services for students so focusing on things that that are that are
magnets for people who are likely to come and create good job and build businesses here
i do think you want to worry and this is where i think liberals have failed i think you do want to worry about pockets and ghettos and and and non english speaking areas of the country actually think that i don't think that conservatives are wrong to say that it's reasonable for people to worry about about town
and cities that change very quickly
and where the long time inhabitants
you face a whole new set of of migrants and that change the culture of those cities i think it's a perfectly legitimate thing for people to worry about the country should be concerned about
so that's what i would say
let's turn now to the other target briefly of president trumps i heard this week which is amazon so he has been savaged gene amazon as he has previously savaged c n n and in fact possibly even derailed the eighteenth tee time warner merger because at his attacks on cnn
and now he's going after amazon and alleging there's amazon's getting
unfair but beneath us and treatment from the post office is part of its package delivery deal with the post office
and clearly the only reason he's doing this is because he doesn't like what the washington post is writing about him and he's he is displacing has anger on the washington post on to just be those the founder of amazon he's hoping to get you use this pressure on basis perhaps to change the coverage in in the post which is terrifying
that is dictatorship one on one you get the media class to do your bidding by threatening their pocketbooks
basis so far seem unfazed but man i do not like this
no don't like it at all but also and also i think you can add a second to that which is that it used to be the case bad
conserve is particularly and republicans criticized the interference by president and the private market full stop period for whatever reason is now the president has already this president has already done a number of things picking various companies and putting his finger on them for various reasons based on his view of economic
but in this case it's based on his specific this goes in this isn't a new category and so there is a philosophical reason for why even the president allies should be alarmed by this in addition to the underlying first amendment
reasons you should be alarmed by he had the other thing is it's just so on
too bad thing for us to have to wonder about whether that you know eighteen team merger is being prevented for because the president doesn't like the news coverage and cnn and we should be able to trust the government to be looking into a very complicated questions
about anti trust and let our emerge are while create a monopoly are a threat of a monopoly without the fear that this is all being influenced by the fact that president doesn't like the way cnn is reporting on hand and the fact that congress is allowing this that they're you know it's sort of like alarm from people like us them
people in the media world and you know plenty of well meaning commentators out there but there's no consequences for champ in doing this and the more non like gaffes the worse it is for the country
right and the flip side of the think claire
conservative broadcasting network which is rolling up tv stations around the country and it's getting really have no look see from regulators about it
possibly possibly because at the outlet for president all propaganda for conservative propaganda and propaganda as a strong word but i think you could and it may be that that that's allowing it a regulators are not paid much attention in a presidency that's really rife with corruption and insurgents rife with corruption we have a president and a family that
getting rich at the trough for expanding their businesses and the way that jared kushner seems to be where you have people like wilbur ross possibly benefiting from work that they're doing and government and certainly advisors what's his name the lead advisor i've forgotten man who was getting rich and you have then penny ante corrupt
one of the sort that scott pruitt and tom price this is a kind of parallel which is the the belief that present of can use his public office is public power to exact private revenge using the power the presidency to do it and that's as bad as getting rich off of it it's a form of corruption at the highest order
an hour
the possibility that he is chilling negative media coverage and making it even more likely that cnn will cover alive his next rally in a sling stay on which they did again recently and then when you think about sinclair kind of rising alongside fox and having another right wing tilting
on television network with a lot of info and that is changing our media landscape and away and that may have real political implications and at all is just kind of happening right in front of my and sinclair is is seeking to buy a part of her strain which would give at seventy two percent control of the market so there is a
there's a space in which the federal government will have to rule is a are in the eighteenth tee time warner case about consolidation and where you could imagine
sinclair getting favorable treatment if this narrative plays out
the narrative that says basically sinclair as incentive eyes to do the president's bidding or at least do things that make him that please him because they basically want that deal to go through and not have a government get in the way

box of the night
people with pennsylvania taxpayer dollars if you're donald trump how do you solve a problem mike scott pru it scott pruitt has become an ethical headache that's a funny term that's funny term for this administration but even by the gambino family standards of corruption that characterized as administration pruitt is starting to stand out for is gross
behavior
whole series of stories really lay down and gushing that just doesn't seem to stop so there's the fact that he until recently had been getting an extremely sweetheart deal and as washington a combination to paid fifty dollars a night so that he and his daughter could live at a fancy condo one block from the capital
which is just not market rate for those folks who are thinking admitted to watch not going a fifty dollar a night hotel by the way in the dc area what would your room look at home
yeah imagine otero so of course that was from the wife of a lobbyist
top energy lobbyists to is seeking a pipeline deal that indeed was approved by proves he has also spent a huge amount of money on his own security he spent a ton of his office with for bugs to a sound proof phone booth installed he has twenty four hour security security he's which maybe thirty people and
many at least two million dollars a year on he sought although didn't follow through on renting himself a private jet for one hundred thousand dollars a month
he also this week it turned out used a provision of the safe drinking water act the only provision of the safe drinking water act he seems to care about he used to give to of his young aids a huge raise after the white house said he couldn't give it a raise under normal circumstances he was like well i'll just use this obscure provision to give people
a higher salary
yet of course skype heard it a policy dream i think it is hard to argue if you're a trumpets probably the most effective of trumps cabinet numbers are doing what trumped and conservatives want he has just announced that with a clean water act he's going to make all decisions about the clean water act and presumably it's going to side with him
industry more he's he's limiting the use of science essentially in making determinations about things he's limiting the discussion of climate change in a role of climate change in any decision making maybe this week he announced that the administration's zero a rollback higher mile per gallon standards that the obama administration put on car
lawmakers to he's doing great actually
i forgot one example of cruelty and grotesque which is just the most amazing one he forbid staffers from taking notes and meetings with him presumably because he wants no record no record that people can say is accurate of things that he says
he is projected a ban on a pesticide that link to nervous system damage and children he
is repealed a rule that gave me a p a broader authority over water pollution he's done a really good job in doing the bidding of of energy industry and other industries in ways that a lot of conservatives and term supporters like the all of that stuff which you might violently disagree with on them on
policy grounds easy at least connected with there are no surprises there right that's what donald trump was elected to do and if people don't like that then they should elect somebody else but but the first set of things you put your finger on is exactly the opposite of what donald trump was elected to do the president repeatedly on the campaign trail in concert
campaign trail and then and in his inaugural address he talked about the people who'd come to washington to benefit themselves at the cost of the forgotten man and woman when you give the staffers raises which as ed henry of fox news pointed out in a in a very pressing interview of pruitt the raised was larger than the median
income of of americans mean this wasn't just a tiny little cost of living raises these were big raises for for people or twenty six year old and a third home with i am from atlanta yeah so i think that's what sort of takes this i think to another level
now at least got to republican members of congress who have called for him to step down because of know on the grounds of course stewardship of federal funds
emily
david and know the a secretary returned to earth secretary who a minor league graft her like a thing the labour to learn both in for free and equipped to up though he has been ousted and pruitt is still there what's the difference while i'm in a crane to sulk and media to our after he was fine
tired he was trying to prevent that from being privatizing so he was not on board for that tramp policy agenda that seems like a crucial difference here and you know from the point of view of the champ white house for all the reasons you both gave pru it is doing what he was put there to do
he's an acting the policy changes you know changing the pay lots of career people the are leaving are in despair and not like blood trump one it and so you have this conflict between these policy achievements and success and this corruption which makes the administration look
terrible and then the other thing is they have a problem who are they going to put in there to replace scott pruitt who they can confirm who is going to continue the quite effective policy mark that he has been on but you know the corruption is just so much a theme of this administration and they wonder if either of you have a theory about it i mean i don't really get it
some of it seems so small bore and i mean how much money did it really save with this deal from this lobbyist i mean i guess tens of thousands of dollars is the answer to that he has someone who supposedly had presidential aspirations and wanted to replace jeff sessions as attorney general why would it have been worth it
pam and the only thing about the fancy travel on the private chat and like the super expensive sound booth i mean is there something just bitching about the trappings of government for these people were it's like here's what you get to do here is the sort of
sure add that like the american federal government has to offer i fear i had of one of these agencies you get to kind of wrap yourself in this cloak of having a huge security detail that's another strange to me part of the pruitt story anyway i just wonder what you guys think is going on here as there's just something that makes
people who are drawn to chomp prone to drifting is that just like kind of part of the dna of the administration show your noodle and off his and somebody in your staff and it's kind of hectic dick and you know you work for a disorder
chief executive which has to say the president and one of them hurly burly one of your aid says oh you know as treasury secretary you're allowed to fly military aircraft and so you say i and so you just don't follow up now so that's the way in which you don't necessarily need to be a drifter and hard but you don't do the extra double checking
of wait a minute are you sure that's right to i think prude it's clear that pruitt is benefiting from the overwhelming volume of stories about corruption the sheer number of stories about penny ante drifting in this administration when one person has a criminal it's a problem for that person when everyone's a criminal the problem for society and
i assume with this that as long as there's not another round of these stories in the next week this what kind of all subside as an entertainer and how long does it sustain itself is a new story to i am just in order to be safe i'm just checking the news for the is not to fire wall we've been taken it's like know he seems
at least as of today so let's leave it there

john dickerson you're looking back at your old atari youth advisory board memorabilia with the
nice drink brown liquor and hand thinking back on those old days of playing did gergen ms pac man
what would you be chattering and the t to mrs the english game to mr stickers and it will be the only one company me definitely
she will not be listening as exactly
so my chatter is about the story of of one nick virtual he was a naval reserve us from nova scotia this comes from peace and boring boring by the way and he was in british columbia for a work related conference seventeen years ago he was at the fairmont hotel
which is very pricey highfalutin joint and he had brought his fellow reservists friends he brought them some pepperoni sticks which are much loved
from these pepperoni and sticks from nova scotia the he didn't want them to get spoiled and so he opened the window of his room so that the cool air from outside could could keep them in pristine condition i can't wait to see where the healing slow
he then went out for a four to five hour walk and this is what he returned to upon entering the room
can i guess i guess coming up
sure no i think you can guess reckons a years how he recounted nick said i remember walking down the long haul and opening the door to my room to find an entire flock of seagulls in my room
i didn't have time to count but there must have been forty of them and they had been in my room eating pepperoni for a long time he then discovered it seems to me to be an axiomatic point but anyway he discovered that spicy pepperoni does not agree with the sea goals digestive tract and so they had been while he was out on his walk
covering the room in guano
as they reacted to his pepperoni he then entered the room which i suppose because he's a reservist he's he's condition to go into dangerous environments anyway in order to try to affect repair upon situation and in doing so cause the birds to lose whatever remaining guano that day
had because frankly a day were freaking out that there was a dude in the room
he wrote that the resulting chaos was a tornado of seagull excrement feathers pepperoni chunks in fairly large birds whipping around the room
anyway at one point he tried to get a burnt out the window by throwing a shoe added he went out the window and nearly bring somebody on the on the ground below the reason going bowling was writing about this is that seventeen years after the incident
nick was finally allowed back into the fairmont emperors hotel which had banned him as a result of this as a result of this event and his inducement to get them to allow him to return was that he gave them a pound of chris brothers pepperoni which was i think the offending pepperoni and the original case often
emily what does your chatter i have been thinking a lot as i and many other people have been doing about martin luther king this week it's the fiftieth anniversary of his assassination and memphis and and if you want to just like read intellectual material that his legacy i recommend when there's been so much good writing that i really
and the staff man newkirk has been raining in the atlantic i want to actually recommend a book that i read this week that it just was so special and excellent it's called reading with patrick it's by and michelle cool oh and it's a book about michelle's experience she was a teacher and the mississippi delta es un
she went there with teach for america and we sort of
have a stereotypical notion and how that story goes but that's not michelle story her story is about leaving the downturn and learning that one of her former students had been arrested for killing someone and returning to the delta just essentially to be with him he was in jail and she laughs
wound up spending a great deal of time with han in jail kind of going back to their teacher student role but also moving into a of and it really is like the books called reading with patrick because it's about her discovery of poetry and other literature that they're reading together and he write some just
amazingly beautiful things himself that are included in the buck and probably it's most powerful passages that i had just learned to read this little bit the michelle rates about herself and she is trying to decide about whether to return to the delta or not and at the time she had graduated from law school and she's like wrestling with decision and she rates and then you laughed
you justified and you're leaving by saying you want to learn the law because it was a powerful language to now and perhaps you could make some broader change that maybe you forgotten the language you started to learn in the delta the one that allows you to connect with people from different circumstances this is a powerful language to and maybe you forgotten it maybe this is the only language that matter
it's not shameful to be motivated by the feeling of being needed don't block out your desire to feel a part of what is raw and vital just don't think this really spoke to me i for reasons and my own life of feeling more and more like these personal connections be make a cross boundaries of race and class are the most important things
the things that change our own world view the most just wake us up to human potential but also like to our own
the limitations of our own world and it's hard to do this kind of connecting you make a lot of mistakes along the way and this book is full of michelle cools insight and reflections about that and i just really took it to heart and recommend it

it was just happened to be looking at some books in my house and i saw on a table my favorite book in the world and maybe even shattered up that before but i want to just recommend this book to people it is a photo book it's called ancient trees portraits of time by photographer and beth moon and it's black and white

have the girth ago a train practically that both are pope's oak the majesty oak there's the bleeding you have never around the neck hill weeping beach and then my favorite tree of course which is the general grant which is a huge sequoia in california
so ancient trees portraits of time it's a beautiful book was will suit your soul whenever you open it is the loblolly lollipop known as the eisenhower and tree in they're probably not i don't think it is the palm beach k park isn't the cape actually a palm beach that's that's a good one if you want in a good american tree

and already planning in fact of you have great ideas for things that we can do during our day and st louis tweet him at us let us know where to go where to eat what to visit where we should hang out we'll see their on thursday morning doctor ronnie jackson presidential doctor running jackson withdrew his nomination is be a secretary
jackson was of course nominated a few weeks ago
rather impulsive quick action by our president donald trump who seem to like jackson who'd been his personal physician and given him a clean bill of health checkup not so long ago jets and had no experience with the v of speak of and no experience running a bureaucracy and no experience managing a large organization
but trump like liked the cut of his job as it were jackson withdrew his nomination after reports came out that he did all kinds of stuff right emily yeah
he was candyman prescribing drugs
for folks i don't actually hold that against him all that much bigger us knew that supposedly crashed to government car because he was drunk and then he sounds like he was just a total nightmare to work for the opie lloyds the handing out near the park
like a rug gone up by giving out provisional and ambient on long trips that if there was the pounding on the young female staffers door late at night drunken we on a presidential trip and twenty fifteen be rivalry he had with another white house doctor sounded terrible i both felt like they baby badly so john
is this a case of a qualified candidate been wrongly taken down for
personal pocatello that aren't really relevant earth there's something deeper going on here i well i guess we don't know we don't even know if some of these charges are true been for to me they're actually kind of beside the point the to bigger larger points which is one this was this was reminiscent of when president george w bush although arguably he's less call
fyi than the analogy i'm about to make but i own eliminated nominated harriet minors for the supreme court because they're at least is a theory you may not agree with it there's a theory that somebody is not a judge can nevertheless be on the supreme court and make an argument for how that's good and beneficial people didn't believe that in that specific case but at least there's a there's a fear
agree to that was involved anyway that turned out to be a total disaster for the president for harriet myers in this case being a doctor does not mean you can manage the the a's it gargantuan management challenge obviously a doctor would have lots of interesting in
sites but it turns out that has a lot of doctors who can have interesting insights and could inform whatever he needed to do to manage it the current problems for which the new a secretary needs to be put in place are not ones with
our ones where somebody with management skill would have the relevant expertise it's funny one of the problems for the da is because of the hiring problems in been hiring there's been some questions have the qualifications of some of the road for some of the hiring they've done so it's kind of echoing it so that was one big problem and then the second is and it seemed from the
learning to be that this was just sort of more line of sight hiring by the president which is like oh he looks like a doctor he's my doctor make him make him the head of the just like you suggested having his personal pilot be the head of the
so the second problem and seems to me is that the vetting was so awful
that they were not they didn't seem to know about any of these problems or and then be didn't
you know if there are allegations against you
that doesn't mean necessarily should torpedo your job but it means that we should have an answer and you should have prepared the way and this is obviously not the first time they've had problems with vetting or had the problems with a slap dash approach show it's just another way in which the chaos of the presidency
this particular president he gets in the way of even its own objectives so that seems
to be the two big problems
i mean there's something so screwy about what's going on with a generally because the the last the secretary david choke and who was an obama hold up already yeah
and it was unanimously confirmed i believe but shock and had had the standards the this ministrations who commit an extremely minor active graft and corruption but no doubt
an act of graft and corruption with with for which he did after he fired scott crude and ben carson probably there to be fired for their act of graft and corruption
and yet they linger on there is a young us but because shogun shock and representative of the which is not as popular among conservatives which is that he was not so keen to privatized the bunch of of its functions and and essentially shotgun with sacrificed his his corruption was found to be
found to be a fireball offense because the koch brothers and allies and even people who work for shock and wanted him out they could push the privatisation agenda and so the real issues at at the have nothing to do with randy jackson and his lack of qualifications and everything to do with with the huge shift that apollo
she's policy ship that's being proposed and that the kind of personal disgrace even randy jackson is just is is a minor side show for what's going to be a huge remaking of this bureaucracy there and it's and i mean i do feel bad for objects and he's somebody who probably has a perfectly good doctor
earned it perfectly charismatic person who who indeed has built a great relationship with people in the white house but then he just gets and just get a second
and he let's say that some of these allegations you just then he didn't have to play his name out there and also right now you're wearing get will remain the personal physician of the president through two and a half administration's if you're behaving in this manner like the idea that some if they passed out drunk and has
to have white house officials come in like tip toe in and take things they need out of your hotel room i know i find that really mysterious like did not seem like he should be in that job from what we know if it is true well yeah that's the big name we also don't want to world which somebody gets allegations surnames them end
they're not true in a dense torpedoing their life
the question is i thought were you were going to go with this is how does he get to still have the job now because it seems like this would these would be problems you'd need to wrestle to the ground because he is a military person in interest in keeping with what you are saying david is you know he has had a career and you know
there is no suggestion that his service
for the military and overseas
was nothing but honorable and so by doing is bad
having his nomination go through in his slapdash way the administration that elevated him and the president particular who elevated him has now by throwing them into the meat grinder without proper vetting or protection has now cause that portion of his career to be the smaller port the defining characteristic
then then them all of these allegations it's another way in which it's not a favor
to him
the in another way in which they chant administration really lake
no breaks that people know it is supposedly elevating that there's a real risk worth taking these town i can i just say though i'm just going back to your point
honestly like the fact that he got drunk a few times that assume that much of what we have has been alleged is true we don't know that it is that may or may not but let's just assume for the sake of argument that much and it's true
hey you know handing out ambient and provisional people taking presidential trips seems totally fine now and middle east
self prescribing or prescribing you know to cover cover up prescription that i i know plenty of doctors who who do that and i think there are some of the ones i know are great doctors been having a drink while on a trip or even getting drunk while and trip yes okay your job as you take care of the president would be shocking of the present moment had a heart attack
and you were drunk that would be really bad and that's just say but they in the case but it doesn't do direct space
not these did not do not seem to me
the problem with jackson for this job was that he clearly was a terrible manager of the office well that's true ten that i don't act and i'd honestly i don't like getting drunk passing if that's true if your age
passed out drunk when you're supposed to be available in case the president has out the emergency come on you don't really think that's okay i don't think it's i don't think it's okay but nor do i think it is it is but it is like the worst sin that a doctor and they get ten finally i don't think it's a fire loyal fans i don't think it's a qualification to run the air
i think that disqualification to run the he's never run anything now and i am a as i value the health and saying well presidents more than you do that's not that's like all these people who who invokes national security would like than the national security risk with profound know it's not that profound with a minor okay when i would say
say is that
these two things are combined which is to say if he had no great if he if he lacked know mean you get has a staff of seventy
he wasn't wearing he wasn't great manager but even if he was a pretty good manager of seventy it's a huge leap to go and his main job
would have been management and so okay he hasn't doesn't have the relevance to experience but he's a great doctor that could be an argument you could make except that these go to whether he was a good doctor not so it kind of undermines kind of the only thing yet like he had to stand on the part and whether it undermines what a doctor actually does i am safe like lane
out that many ways in which it was not the right person for this job is like shooting fish in a bear
it's not hard to see and so to me it's actually saying he was drunk when he was shooting and what's wrong with being drunk when you're shooting the then i know there's no it's a small barrel they you to psych turned my manifesto
negative that acquire a when you have single barrel but she before shooting and small barrel it gets to be a barrel of trouble
i had an actual point i was going to make and it is this what actually think this is all set aside show but there is something that interests me here and it's because of the calf and the slapdash and know like oh you're my doctor your my pilot i'll pick you to run a major agency because of this lurching way in which champ is making
payments were watching washington have to go through this very
this weird the objects in which privately republicans do not want ronnie jack's tend to be ahead and give the a but publicly after john tester the ranking democrat on the relevant committees comes out with these allegations champ turns this into another set of political
oh another it turns it into political red meat as like the democrats are railroading this guy and this is all about my fighting for my people as opposed to any kind of
common shared normal understanding of basic standards and then you know a few republicans have spoken up and i'm sure there are relieved he is at an arab but there isn't the
bipartisan on we affirming of these norms and this broadway that really rejects the notion and dad until the moment that jackson withdraws you have this question of like okay so how where's the line like how low are you going to drag these republicans in congress down with you because the how are you
make them go in supporting you i've been feeling this way about scott pruitt to as more and more news triples out like now he have his main sponsor oklahoma senator what's his name gin in half as any say that you have a harmless and energy and in half expecting some reservations but this is after so many the allegations about pruitt
spending his ethical lapses it's it's distressing to me to watch washing ten kind of sync to this level but i think there is something so jumpy and well let me let me throw it back a un nuevo and take the case of my hey
a director who present trump was nominated to be secretary of state and who's having them just barely cleared the senate foreign relations committee
both gonna party line bowden will he will be confirmed with a couple of democrats voting for him i don't think look there are plenty of things that up i think company his views on a lot of things are troubling
his views on to be t que issues are bad his views on iran i think are bad but muslims but you cannot like credibly argue that he isn't qualified but he hasn't been a person who serve the country well and he's been a perfectly adequate cia director and and i think the the the fact that democrats are are
having such a fun time delay in him and making a fuss about him put puts a little bit on them to yeah
this is the guy who who under normal circumstances
just to go through on a seventy thirty boat without a lot of us i guess although there there's something odd about his point in may which is usually secretaries of state have a mark end of august resume than palmdale had before he became this day and director he was like kind of a back bench and congrats right so there's that word for for
trump and minnesota originally little if he's fucking movie brand a few well
rape but then exactly leg him bar haft yeah the bar has shifted has become lower and but i know i think you're right the democrats are responding to the you know parts of his record that they find defense and then in the ski like in the world in which we live on palmdale well
get through and you know trumps should be able to choose the person he wants for secretary of state and yeah i mean i take your playing with that i don't know do you think i generally think that will get you going to reactions one is that what we're really trying to figure out here is what the what the standards aren't for these jobs and night to lose our
sense of the standards in the pell mell craziness of the moment so the chaos of the white house create situation which somebody not qualified for the job has all these issues which which capture attention because they're not drunk driving in a car passed down a hotel fights inside like be the hanging on pills and being called the candyman that of attention
grabbing that's all attention grabbing and it's not impressed by any of that
are they are is over minor and that's all it that's all attention grabbing and and we've all been doing here is saying wait a minute there's this bigger issue here and what the job is and he was totally unqualified for that but you find yourself trying to pull the conversation out of mock and to what the actual standard should be for the job than anybody in and him whether they pass
that feels like what what were you know what's going on with pompano and and again the standard is keeps shifting and sometimes you say well he is he's he meets the standard and you realize the standard you you're saying he needs is one that's even lower from where it from where it actually should be so but then i have another point about pruitt which is that
he's going to testify on thursday and defend himself against these charges of the profligate see in his in his office
and and
strikes me that one of the most extraordinary things come out about him this week he's going to have reportedly he is going to blame his staff for some of the spending and things like that which
we're going to get santa those we had our dealer he thought that's the lobbyists house in oklahoma the only thing that and off seem to be distressed about because of his in his own state stateside both but what was what he has to answer for his is in washington he had this and this apartment he was running from the wife of a lobbyist and
on good terms fifty dollars a day and he said that he had not met with the husband of the woman from who's renting the apartment
and in fact it turned out he had met with him and novel and it wasn't just a random meeting
the sidelines of a soccer game but it was a meeting
and the lobbyist was representing smithfield which had business before the now
so that was a direct contradiction to what he said about a central tenet of the trump candidacy which was that they were going to drain the swamp in washington what is more swampy than a cozy relationship between a lobbyist for somebody who has business before and agency and the head of that agency and so they said well this was a this was a person
no matter it wasn't really about what was before the agency but in the emails that cbs obtained
from the lobbyists to prove it
it's clear what he's saying is you can trust this guy who's coming to this meeting with you so because he's kind of sees the world the way you do on this matter that's before the day so it was using the relationship that they had the existing relationship they had to vouch for somebody who had business before the yea that's like that's what that's what influence
and access is all about and that thing that the president supposedly came to washington to fix and so you have this situation where this isn't just like tiny little tricky tacky stuff this is and that's also true of the the president campaign repeatedly on the idea that his special understanding of the business world would make his administration
one uniquely able to solve the challenges inside the and then he named somebody for the post who lacks the qualifications on the central thing that he said he was going to be able to fix about the the i mean this is like goes to the heart of what he supposedly campaigned about that then did there there is an ex

strictly speaking at her arguments over the legality and constitutionality of the third trump travel ban which is levied unfair different than eight countries or maybe seven now six of them primarily muslim maybe five have been because chatted out now to get at seven with by primarily muslim country
your remember that the first early twenties seventeen ban the chaotic ban was suspended by judge pretty quickly after but not after causing a huge amount of distress at airports and in other places around the world and a second ban also was docked was also eighty six by a federal judge the third ban
it was repaired less hastily and was not so clearly targeted muslims is hoping to skirt perhaps the biggest problem with it which is the animus that president trump demonstrated during his campaign towards muslims than his his stated desire to ban muslims from entering the us while we straighten thing that so
emily
what are the key legal issues in the case both statutory unconstitutional
the unless ban
this is a doubt whether the president had the power to issue this kind of sweeping indefinite ban sell it very much a case that separation of powers and president authority and limits or not there of especially in the immigration arena and then the relevant stash it here is the immigration and nationality
act which on the one hand on a allows the executive branch to suspend the entry of a class and aliens i really hate that word for immigrants but that's a legal term if the president find the entry that their entry or the entry of any class of aliens and the united states
been detrimental to the interests of the united states there's another part of the flaw college we call the i a for short and and that part says that the government may not discriminate on the basis of nationality or religion and so there's this question of which clause gets priority here on
in looking at the champ travel ban and then of course you know this of all important in my view sub subtext for that's our trumps promises of the muslim than during the campaign and then more importantly because like let's set aside that campaign statements maybe but then things trying to send in
hafez about wanting to kill muslims out of the country treating virulently anti muslim videos and of sense we have that on a kind of red meat to the base on about muslims and muslim integrate immigrants is truly what's fueling this ban especially because although it's true that this particular order
was much more organized it's still not clear what the government's national security rationale is for choosing these particular country is and then you know having such a blank get on policy against admitting their residents right so so the conservative justices certainly found a lot to chew on
yesterday for example were very big on the point that how long do we have to hold the president's present statements against him how long the do the things he say in the campaign have any bearing on what he does is present in are basically a break and he gets a clean fresh start
and even if even if he has demonstrated some animals this president does he get a break as long as the his cabinet and people and his administration have legitimate reason to think this ban will have a beneficial effect on national security
that's one big thing that they that they focused on yeah i'm new agent start with that and then the then i mean i thought that neil kayla who is arguing for the state of hawaii and the other challenges in the band had a really good answer to that which just like well the present could disclaim these statements he made and one of the conservative just said okay well if he disclaimed it than than two days later
arkady issue that taliban order and chaos said yes and what seemed to be encouraging about that moment is dead
chan this and this is why i find this case so on
do i find it infuriating temp is getting to have it both ways right he both gets to be a this anti muslim president who is signaling all these things to his space and he gets to have like all the trappings of regular presidential authority where he gets to part
stand that this is about national security and that point that your made about the about not claiming is like the perfect way to at all has to do is be like know i renounced those views now i'm doing this for national security reasons but he hasn't done that the other one of the other points of the justices made is that if you the
islam band with the pretty bad muslim man that it's a very small number of countries that are majority muslim or affected it's only eight percent of muslims in the world live in those countries
so therefore it's unreasonable to think of it as a muslim band and offs of course it also encompasses north korean venezuela
clearly tossed in is a sop but now that word had john later
well did you guys find that point convincing that way of framing the question which way the won't let you just sounded like if you are yeah this was just as elitist big point like if you were trying to and nathanael francisco that solicitor general
china and you know ban muslims he would go ban all the muslims from saudi arabia allies advise where he would never do that right i what i find it i guess is that i'm sure that this is it has no real national security justification they have been way come up with any the incredible
they went back knowing that they had to come up with the justification and they manufactured something which i don't even think they've ever made public but they've just it's just sort of said we have a finding that this is will benefit national security and no one knows what it is and we're supposed to we're supposed to just accepted on the other hand i'm pretty troubled by the idea that the the courts are going to
tell the president and tell the administration
if they're going to go to second guess finding an administration is going to make i mean with this administration
it's a troubling but i just like don't like it to the person i'm really troubled by congress's failure to be involved here that's the the troubling part like this is an area where congress could very easily
come in and clarify and tell the president here are you pass laws that say here's what we want you to do or not want you do and course congress is unwilling to do it may give that gives the executive enormous amount of latitude to make decisions like this and an absent an absent the legislative
absent legislative action i don't think that what the truman administration is doing is is that a balance i think it's completely immoral and criminal and wrongheaded not criminal i think it's completely immoral and wrongheaded but the be the solution is basically political which is that you vote them out of office or do you think it's wrong i don't think that what they're doing
is on it's face like goes against any laws of the country are completely out of bounds i just think it's wrong and did the court emily
and i apologize for not having a means
not knowing this but did the court raise that issue because obviously the cord pays attention to the president is overstepping bands in the white house originally and defending this we all remember the slightly amusing way in which steven miller defended it which is that on issues of perceived national security importance no one anywhere in
any coach or in congress has a right to ever questioned the president which is obviously not the way it goes but did the courts wrestle with that idea of whether the white house or whether the president was overstepping is bound to the court i mean not to court yes i mean i think in some ways it was it a famed more and know first my david play at which is
with the court be overstepping it stands to question the president's authority right and there a i mean the more abstract the more kind of thirty thousand foot view intake of this case the better it is for tramp because then you're talking about these lofty principles of not just presidential power but the authority of the president
has to protect the country and end yeah we know here that we don't have any public record of real findings about why the government thinks that restricting a travel on immigration to this extent from these countries is really necessary and we're being asked essentially to take it on faith
and so to me the idea that you know the supreme court couldn't find some a narrow way to say wait a second this president in this instance has gone too far in light of this shadow of anti muslim prejudice and also this as continued lack of real on public evidence that this is necessary that just seems
fake of course the court could find its way to writing that opinion if it wasn't until you're thirty thousand foot point i'm always a really good one and when you get into specifics of what's actually happening it's so dire we know the moral wrong or committing there have been forty four syrian refugees admitted in the united states since october of the left
what if it six months yeah only eleven and two thousand and eighteen there are hundreds of thousands even millions of syrians the overwhelming majority of whom are people who are simply victims of one of the worst wars of modern history and who have no recourse and would be perfectly
the good contributors to american society and even if they're not that good to contribute to american society their people and terrible suffering and need and the idea that we as a nation cannot welcome them in significant numbers is disgusting and also we've seen this huge drop in tourism or seen an enormous drop in applications for student visas
the closing off of america by the trump administration partly put through bureaucratic channels and policy measures but also through rhetoric and and their vital vile rhetoric towards people who are an american is is the problem here and that's what people need to go out and vote on i just i guess
i think that we have a system where there's enormous latitude for a president to make decisions about things and i would rather have congress making law to restrain the president or the people restraining the president by voting in a new president than i would having courts stepping in every time people are upset
fair fan of that i don't think this is like every time people are upset about something i mean the other thing i just think we need to mention his car and moxie feel i mean we have this stain on the supreme court and on the presidency because of franklin roosevelt in the order attack you know detain japanese people of japanese descent during world war
to the supreme court signed off on ad in the name of president ah authority and national security is this completely and discredit add kind of horrifying present in that has never been formally over but that we all want to think we understand was immoral and is supposed to be part of
america's past not it's present and there's this sort of irony smile irony here in l k l who argued for ally in the town does as i mentioned used to be acting skills that are general under barack obama when he was in that role he issued a statement on you know
i can't formally overturn komatsu but he was not a chain that it is a stain on america's past and we are kind of that hovers over the court here when the justices like it or not so i want to make one final point there is one place where i think legal intervention is certainly justified which is that even under the terms the band their supposed
to be a notion of waivers that gap people that are certain refugees under certain circumstances ought to be herb or immigrants are people seeking pieces ought to be allowed to get waivers and that decision can be made by the state department on a case by case basis and what clearly happening is that those waivers are not being granted
there that's basically a blanket and isles and so that effectively we are completely banning people with almost
just a minuscule number of exceptions to to buy one to people who have gotten by these other the solicitor general said they were actually foreign it and forty people and argument yesterday so be interesting to see what that figure really amounts to but i guess my point is that if in fact this the government has set up a process and is not fulfilling that process
less than that seems to me a standard for a moment for legal intervention and and action if they're not abiding by the the terms of their own policy which i don't like very well i mean we should just end by saying it seemed clear from oral argument that the supreme court is going to allow the trunk administration to have the stan that
all the arguments we've been making the unsettling arguments did not seem to be on winning the day for the five conservative justices so that is a likely outcome one just side note here in the context of what the president says out loud and how it affects things in the courts gym pseudo of shannon is reporting that on
thursday when the president went on talks and friends and said that his personal lawyer michael cohen only did a tiny tiny for a little fraction of his legal work the new york prosecutors asking for expedited review of the seas documents from cones offices and home have used those comments from the fox and
friends interviewed to say that cohen's claim that his work for donald trump was so voluminous that will require a long and complicated process of trying to untangle what's protected by privileged privilege and what's not they are saying well if it was just a tiny tiny little fraction of what donald trump
it needs from lawyers then obviously it won't take that long to review the documents so it's yet another way in which the president public statements are affecting use legal standing although was a job offer the people who are around ten and continuing to work with i would say and trumps defense of a tiny tiny tiny fraction of trumps legal or it's still probably an inner
with them out because he hits causes so much legal distress everywhere
that the word legal i mean it doesn't seem like legal work was a lot of let michael cohen was doing though he did draft poorly draft to connect and given the two of his interactions with people who made these at least we know too many more than he was really a specialized in a special case although i was watching bad i was looking at the press conference and president
held in new hampshire about
barack obama not being born in the united states and cohen was at that a press conference which i had forgotten that was a long time ago our lives

for the last year in between the facing the nation and the cbs this morning and the whistle stop pod cast and the gab first and the kid raising and the brushing of hair and brushing of tea
the unstoppable force that is john dickerson was working on a titanic piece for the atlantic that story has just come out a cover story but the hardest job in the world the american presidency
this is a concept album that will be familiar somewhat familiar to get fifth listeners because hit some of the theme to john has strong doubt over the years ago first and it it is an enormous important and persuasive piece of work john i give you the next forty five seconds to summer summarize the work of the last year yeah thank you
why i think the party impossible hardest job in the world is i think a better framing than the impossibility of the presidency mean the presidency is impossible but we can only have one president of the time and so how to best manage that impossible job there are ways that the job has gotten significantly harder in the recent period
and this causes some of the difficulties we have in our politics today but three big ones would be the change in the national security picture since nine eleven
supine nature of congress which we've already talked about in this episode in and talk about all the time slash the rise of partisan politics and also than the change in the way we elect presidents and with an emphasis on performance
over other things
so that formative net not performance and i knew mean like rowing were forming of profiling were doing well on stage yeah
and they're all you know that's not the whole list but that some those are three big reasons
that are a part of it and then the peace ends with an attempt to say those presidents who have done well in various parts of this or people who thought about the presidency and would prescribe fixes to it
you talk about possible solutions to the unwieldy newness of the job is this a piece about president trump in what ways is that repeats about present and it is not a easier than right well that was something in the writing of it that we really really really really worked on a lot johns i right he has been asked a quaint wow
god love you thank you john spawns was my editor on this and we worked on a great deal because i think can we say as same the piece that president trump clearly elevates a lot of these questions and depending on where you sit depends on where you stand i mean obviously for his supporters he's blowing through the norms of the office the way you should and use
gotta crack this score attic system in many and he's exposing many of the horrible parts of the presidency that make it impossible to be efficient any of you are a critic you say well this long piece which is described how complicated the presidency is is like saying the presidency is like brain surgeons so boy we better have a brain surgeon in there
and so by detailing the complexity of the office
presidents critics would see this as an explanation for why the current president is not up to the task and also part of the piece also talks about the myth of the idea that you can have a businessman come into the office and just kind of with everything in shape
i think there a third option which is available which is that if you see a tweet that says the cover line about the impossibility of the president you can without actually reading the fourteen thousand words of peace think that it is an attempt to make excuses
for the president but the idea was to try to look at the president see and and break free of the idea that each president equals the presidency there is this institution that isn't well you know well over two hundred years old that has grown and changed and gotten out of shape and and sometimes to the great benefit of the country it has changed other times
and in the current moment there are these parts of it that need to be kind of stuffed back into form and the misreading is in the itself kind of though this is not the intent of some who were critical upon seeing
the title and not reading it it is in a sense praise for the article because one of the things we talk about in the article is the inability to see past the current moment in politics and how everything is essentially sorted through partisanship and team allegiance
which he has a lot of were that reaction comes from which is anything that suggests the presidency is hard is somehow an excuse for of the current occupant and that was really not the the intent was to look at the presidency itself this president clearly from the lead if you see it
his
is addressed but it's really looking at the the whole she bang i wanted to talk about the last action
a number of suggestions about how to make the job easier and less than pass a bond and how presidents structurally be in a better position and it struck me meeting them that you were in the motive exhorting like they were things like urging more centrist candidates to ran in the primaries
on or are urging us to change our unreasonable expectations and i wonder if you feel like there is more of a real on structural change we could make as a post asking for and the system to produce a different outcome people are just like thinking about it
currently at which in other parts of the peace i think you say are unlikely because to pave your is so hard to change widely last systematic things you could change for example so one of the things is we've gotta find a way to get the partisan lock out of our politics because the partisanship does two things it affects the selection of presidents
lifting people through the nominating process who are able to appeal to the passions of the most ideologically strong people in parties and that that ends up being a difficult place to govern from but it also affects congress which is you know again for people who didn't get a chance to read it a huge chunk of the pieces about the fact that
one of the reasons the presidency is so much harder is because the other branch of government is in is receding as denis mcdonough the chief of staff for president obama said anytime you talk about resonance you have to talk about or the eight eight about the difficulty in the president you have to start with the difficulty with were wise congress difficult congress is difficult because and this bedeviled
republicans more than democrats but it's because the primary process weeds out centrists candidates and you have parties where where the purity tests
in the in the parties require people to be less flexible nobody's and send devising compromise
and system used to do that in the past well if you believe that then one thing people would fix on his they would say well you have to change the role of money in politics
because it has too much influence and it creates the conditions
it make the parties this way so that would be that would be one specific thing you could do the argument about having more centrist candidates in primaries is another it's not structurally changed but the idea there just for those who hurt a fly by is joe california who served reagan and and and l b j argues that if that if you get
more moderate candidates purchase painting and primaries you will a sorry moderate voters participating in primaries then you would have a group of voters who witnessed not necessarily vote for the candidate who is most inherent to the extremities of the ideological spectrum now of course that that a
a lot of these suggestions require group behavior including group behavior on the part of the media that is just basically really a lot against a lot of our instincts as a country right now
two point one i actually don't believe that money in politics of then you're going to do with partisan divide i think the partisan divide with financially independent of that i'm not saying that there were no money in politics doesn't usually pernicious effects but i don't think that's the source of hyper partisanship or even in particular if you will love but i think would been a lot of these tend to do well they weren't in surgeon campaigns that actually are
money depended well that okay so that's a really good point that's true but the the money that is raised and that goes to keeping
i mean two things one how do you raise money you raise money by scaring them the jesus out of people and you do that by making relieved severe claims about the other side or about values issues which tend to be on the ideological ends of the parties
and so the need to raise money
his encourages a whole set of behaviors that are very extreme in order to keep raising the money secondarily and this is not related to raising money but the rise of interest groups that participate in politics and who keep who need to keep themselves funded and need to keep raising money for their own institutions do so by making sure
that the debates are set always at the extremes because if they are that makes it easier to raise money so those are two of the things that i would say would lead to the to the more partisan atmosphere but but but bear definitely not the only one as we as reality
one other point that i was thinking about i was asking myself why is it been president harder than being prime minister of great britain or chancellor of germany and part of it of course you know if it's the greater country than either of those and the much bigger country but part of it is that in contrast to a lot of the european democracies and even to a country like
china thing that we don't have a very strong civil service tradition it and
those are a tradition but we don't have the same kind of built in permanent government and the way that a lot of develop other developed nations do and that when they're transitions in government power and the united states had actually there's all this patronage it there's a huge shift in what government actually does day to day in ways that are much less extreme and
countries and that that's because we just we have weaker bureaucracies and more political appointee use and i wonder if there's that in a way to to weaken patronage and make civil service dog or which is of course go out runs counter to everything that conservatives want these days i will never happen but that's something i've thought about that's the structural kind of changed and family was seeking for
first question and i talk about bad engine and yoyo has an entire book he wrote about this which is like in praise of the bureaucracy and the ideas centrally is short
and what i talk about as shrink the number of political appointees from four thousand down till much smaller number and then actually make the political appointee process easier so they don't have to go through congress and have the kind of hold up but then you would obviously quickly you have to add to that that the ability to
kick them out of office would be made easier to and other words so you get a bomb apple him in a position it was gonna be a way that they wouldn't be protected just by the majority party if they happen to be an illustration of the majority party if you're going to lower the standards for getting them in not lower the standards but lower the amount of time it takes to get them in their posts because one of the problem
you see is that because you don't have as many bureaucrats who have the expertise and who have the knowledge of the issue and a lot of these issues are super super complex and they've gotten more complex and there's some great scholarship book
meltdown i like so much it has a great a lot of scholarship about the fact that the more complex we have made things more we've created these catastrophic the possibility of catastrophic events
with this increased complexity so if you if you increase the bureaucracy that weren't more expertise potentially the handle these kinds of things and if you made it easier to get through the confirmation process again not getting rid of accountability just getting the team on the field faster it would make it so that president's could in a in a functioning presidency and then decide
he wouldn't have helped with the with trump presidency because he has fired people so often and also a lot of the judge aren't filled but in somebody who sought to run the presidency and a more traditional sense you would have everybody kind of in their jobs able to start coordinating and working with each other and that made it for those who believe
leave that that would lead to good outcomes
that that would mean people would be more coordinated and actually be able to get actually on the field you can make a really good argument as stier does the trump presence he still isn't really on the field because there's so many jobs that are either unfulfilled or where people are still getting up to speed because the previous guy is now gone my class and as did you sell your
super engaged with this be thirty i'm thinking about it creatively do you feel optimistic like does it make you want to roll up your sleeves or does it make you feel like oh my god this is like this crashing monstrous wait on the country and it's going to like poll asked and nathan the old alternatively both i feel
there are a lot of people who think about these issues and how to make them better and if you look at the romney transition document of what mitt romney and his team were trying to do were at one time like six hundred people worked on this one of the suggestions is in the book is that we should allow candidacies to set up essentially
shadow governments early during the campaign even and not then not suggest they're measuring the drapes but actually use the transition and how they're preparing for it as a way to measure whether they're fit for the job because what's the job it's anticipating big complicated stuff and you come up with solutions for it so allow canada
once they get the nomination to set up a shadow government to run the the exercises that the me folks ran about how you coordinate because what people don't realize when they campaign and what they find out when they govern is there are all of these collateral effects when you make decisions the president is still engaged in a tussle over his travel ban is a perfect example of the collateral
effects of hastily made decisions
and if you look at what the romney team did you would be made optimistic by the idea that like every other human ever since the enlightenment the product of reason and considered thinking while not perfect and while nod eliminating all grief and sorrow from human existence never
less does overtime lead to positive outcomes and that was the thing upon which the the transition was was created when you talk to people who are engaged in the trunk transition
basically the opposite of that so the idea that there are people systematically think he may have how to make the system better that gives you optimism i think also in the reaction from people who are engaged as citizens there been a great deal and great number of people who have reacted positively to this and that the idea of trying to step
back from the current cut and thrust and the inability because of the shredding of norms that's happening in front of our eyes that keeps us rightly focused on you know what the captain is doing and the captain's tower that there is still a big ship of the presidency that has gotten a lot of barnacles and that even people misunderstand it some people wanted to be a kayak some
people wanted to be a barge and engaging in that conversation is necessary so that we don't repeat the mistakes that may have got us to the current situation that we're in or if people think this a current situation is just peachy that van allow us to know why does situation is better relative to the norms and standards that have existed them in the presidency before
yeah to the extent that people have got mad both of whom support the current president and those who don't have that's incredibly encouraging so those are two places of optimism john one of question your given all that you've learned about the presidency given all the challenges that you've outlined who in the american theme do you think is well prepared for the job who was
who could take this job and and do it adequately incompetently given all constraint well i have an answer which has a big caveat
so we don't really know i mean it's both the disaster and the genius of the american system that there is no kind of test that you have to take for the presidency
the genius being abraham lincoln which is that if you looked at him on paper
and the kind of paper test that i've you know either implicitly or explicitly advocate for you would say and he doesn't make it and he was one of if not the greatest president there are other presidents of course who might look like their qualifications and weren't a great president so you have to have lots and lots of humility my argument is
basically engaging in this question is good for on its own terms and brings us closer to the way the government actually works
it focuses on solutions all of which is good not that we can achieve some sort of perfect answer here i think that some of the mitt romney as a presidential candidate obviously leaving aside people's ideological preferences on policy
he had two things that it seemed to me were useful in the in the in the presidency one was he had run an organisation beforehand and there is some benefit although as i point out in the peace there's also a huge downside to coming from having run a large organization which is having successfully done so you develop patterns and blindness is that unless you come into the presidency
the huge dose of humility and say yes i have patterns and arts about ways to do things but this is going to be super different there's a business book called what got you what got you here won't get you there i think that's the title of it which is basically everything the got you to disposition you now in a sense have to forget because you have a new set of challenges when you need to use for your so a person who has skill in the
but sector are running a large organization and the public sector as to basically forget some of the lessons they've learned so that they're not blind to what they don't know but secondly and the specific case of mitt romney part of his job was taking over companies that all had different
contours to them and so we had to learn quickly about things that were not similar to what he had just done before and so that's pretty good training but again as i said that is in the presidency is the abstract you could imagine a situation in which events that took place would require or would oh
overemphasize one channel of the presidency perhaps you'd need a great communicator because the nation is going through some huge emergency and huge national rending of its soul and the communicative aspect which i think has been over emphasized in the presidency for that particular emergency might be crucial in required certainly the current efficiencies of president trump is a national or
order have exacerbated some of the problems in the nation that he might even want to try to fix but because he lacks the tools he can't so i don't want to over state the case for romney but i do in an attempt to fumble it your answer that so i'm giving it all right so the pieces the hardest job in the world by

no i'm sure you do unfair to poor doctor get from what will you be chattering about john dickerson eye for the purposes of the series that i have been doing
for cbs with the producer cure and cleveland
i'm paying attention why as went to tulsa where i checked out some scholarship about floating and sensory deprivation and did a piece about it this week and then came back to new york and went to a place call in brooklyn
called lifts where are you can float and you basically float insulin in water
i'm and sensory deprivation and is very cool and i encourage anybody who is interested in meditation or
or just weird experiences to go try it out man i don't want to do that is you're enclosed there's something totally are in close so adamantly and dated at tesla nope when i did it
when i did it in tulsa
the tank was
it was a huge open tank and so you're in a big room
buddy
you're not it's not like closed off and that's because it's a brain it's they're studying the brain science what happens to you and when i did it in brooklyn you're into like a little pod which is exacerbates the feeling of claustrophobia you maybe you may be talking about feeling just cannot would not
and why would you do nothing and say now anyway what's your cocktail chatter my that does added this week comes from one of our listeners and i got a tweet from halima marquez telling me to look at a story on electric lit it's by matthew berthold is a law and literature professor and it's about the women
authors who judges tend to save in their judicial opinions and it's really this lovely meditation on jane austen so it turns out that there are very few female authors who regularly or even and all get cited in court opinions but jane austen is strategically deployed
in for quite a delightful reason according to professor burke called it's because she's so good at talking about like the complications and intricacies of life
so
i like this part in particular that she gets say that as a reminder that appearances can be deceiving so there was a california judge in a malpractice case who said something about how sometimes you have to have the whole story to get an accurate picture of events the seemingly hardy and pride fault darcy turned out to be a pretty nice
guy by the end of pride and prejudice
that touch happened to misspell austin's name but i think this sentiment is great and the idea that there are just these incredibly iconic characters from jane austin and that you could imagine them caught up in litigation because there are so familiar to us i really like that so electrical it
will post the link my or
going broke through the theme of shame most most about
we have not talked to the show and we should talk about the most appalling senate in the country who who's not getting enough attention
a war and more level horror unfolding in west virginia where of the republican nominee for senate to freeze
democrats draw mansion
fall may end up being don blankenship a coburn he's the former ceo of mass the energy he went to prison for a year after he was convicted in to mine charge related to mine safety after of course one of his own minds had an accident that killed twenty nine and minors and accident but many people think was caused
or was not prevented because of amenities very nice attitude towards mine safety to loose mr blankenship certainly encourage blankenship is just a piece of work
he is his election
they're all about obama judges and officials who prosecuted him he is not made a financial disclosure you know that's illegal because he realized there's no penalty against him for not filing he's like i don't want people to know what i have and so does not bother to make a financial disclosure form he spoke factories running west virginia his chief or evidence is in las vegas
not in west virginia he's talked a lot about his admiration for authoritarianism he's actually on parole while he's running
and he's a nightmare a primary it's he's not leading in the polls there but it's one of the things you can imagine there's enough anger and the republican primary electorate that blankenship who's running as a trump acolyte might win the nomination and then and then republicans will put
themselves in a very bad position to hold onto a seat that the to take a seat that they ought to win because mansion
easily the most vulnerable democrats running for reelection because he's a very red state so blankenship was a nightmare and
you would really be terrible for the country became a senator he's just a bad person that bad record and he's a criminal man

president announced tuesday that the united states will withdraw from the joint comprehensive plan of action and the agreement forged by the us and other major powers including the u russia and china
to restrain and monitor iran's nuclear program for ten fifteen twenty years the exact duration stretches depending on which part of it you're talking about while ending or easing international sanctions on iran and returning billions in frozen assets that that we've kept of iran and other countries that kept him around
jumps announcement was met with i would say massive sigh of disappointment and much of the world france had practically begged him to stay in iran supreme leader
khamenei to clear that the us cannot be trusted we are joined to talk about this
diplomatic flurry by max fisher who are three interpret call him for the new york times he has been writing about the collapse of the iraq deal and implication three us foreign policy hello max welcome to the fist to guys so what is likely to happen now that the us has pulled out of this deal
i mean there's no american strategy that has been articulated are planned so if we assume that kind of we just project out the last twenty four hours out into the future
the two basic outcomes in the short term that kind of unclear and then there's like a long term very certain set of outcomes in the short term
one possibility that the iranians in the europeans and all the other party since the scream and are trying to hold in place is basically keep the deal with out the united states
and that at least in theory is not impossible
united states is going to be impose sanctions on iran that american sanctions were actually never the really tough ones that was the one from european countries from the un security council and from asian countries that we basically asked as a favor to limit trade with around all of that came away with the way it's going to stay away
the iranians are saying that they're going to continue to stick with the agreement but the big issue that that sets up is that in in the term administration saw this coming and he knew that the europeans knee running for basically just going to ignore their exit so with their threatening to do now is to impose what are called secondary sanctions against any and
it does business with the iranian banks and institutions retargeting which sounds like a drag technical matter with that actually means in plain english is that we're going to start sanctioning the europeans which is actually is crazy and extreme as it sounds who are already threatening to cut off
a airbus steal that is worth about twenty two billion that is obviously got airbus executives and european leaders pretty upset the american ambassador to germany yesterday basically threatened any german company that continues to do business in around saying that they were going to face american secondary sanctioned nothing links that has ever
ever happened before so it's really hard to tell where that's going to go but even if the european an iranian plane works it can introduce this enormous economic conflict between the europeans and americans and hurt you know at least the american and european economies by creating this distance between them and the other
version the one that the trump administration's really hoping for is that they will succeed in killing the deal out right and basically forcing european companies not to do business in around just by creating enough uncertainty for say it's not worth it were not can invest in the iranian economy
business doesn't materialize the iranian say we're not getting our end of this agreement so screw it we're going to continue on the nuclear development and enrichment that we were doing before the deal was signed they've finally to deal which they would be within their rights of doing because the americans walked away first and we end up back where we were
in two thousand and fifteen with the iranians racing pretty quickly towards a nuclear capability
now they would be much closer because they have to know how and also their missile programs would be a lot more advanced so it's hard to see how that's a win but it's definitely we're headed to one of those two max one of the things that i find so distressing about all this is you know it's far as anyone can tell and it seems
like actually we can tell quite a lot the iranians were doing exactly what they said they would do and they were failing their end of the bargain in terms of the way in which they were stopping their nuclear program and it seems like it's the iranians economically who probably stand to lose the most here and let the moderate leader of iran on you know as the new york time
sad when the deal on our part the helix
like a fool and that that's going to weaken the forces in iran that are for moderation that want to open up to the last the trend administration is saying no no it's all good regime change on we're going to topple the hardliners what do you think about those claims
i mean we tried this exact play book once before in two thousand and two with north korea and it was actually with some of the same
administration officials then that are kind of pushing the around policy and how john bolton was a really big architect of this we walked away from a nuclear deal that we had with north korea and north korea was was cheating a little bit around the margins in a way that the iranians are not hear the iranians are everybody says complying with every aspect of this
steel but he kind of american argument that the bush administration was making is that this government is north korea is not one that we can ever trust it's one that's implacable hostels the united states so what we have to do is to walk away from and deal that were limit their program and instead you know impose maximum press
sure to destroy the government but that didn't work
it's actually hard to point to really any example in history where economic sanctions especially ones impose just by the united states lead a government to collapse instead it tends to do is make that government feel and battled empower the people in government that say we have to prepare for the possibility of a war rather than
emphasizing diplomacy and also create a real sense of threat which is exactly what north korea did they went ahead hadn't developed a much more sophisticated nuclear missile program when they had before the deal and they're now using that to great effect to compel us to the negotiating table and you sure seems like where we would end up pushing the
so you you wrote about i think to really significant long term issues that arise from the joint action on iran and north korea this week one is that there's a message for the world that the united states can only be trusted to abide by agreements that the current president has met
there is made and then and that therefore especially in the absence of an ability to actually pass treaties the senate seem to have lost its ability to pass treaties that the idea of getting in two thirds approval of a treaty these days seems farfetched not impossible that given that that international agreements have no long term weight with the united states
and present trump is just validated that by withdrawing from one or and also withdrawn from paris to the climate accords and then secondly this notion that iran with plane by the rules restraining it's program and now it's getting screwed whereas north korea
which was ignoring kind of the rules building a nuclear weapons is getting in a summit and negotiations what are the kind of to what of the long term implications those two too fat
right
thing that the united states now saying our policy is than any international green is only in forced through the next presidential election
it's really easy to understate how seriously that is taken abroad
i mean brian hook who's a senior state department official he came and explicitly said this he said the a play was an agreement signed by an administration that is no longer here so we don't take it seriously
other countries hear that especially because the way that these agreements work is that you know
people always talk about oh how could you sign an agreement with iran how could you trust them what we don't the agreement assumes that they're going to lie and imposes all these inspection built around that assumption but what the agreements do assume is that the united states is going to stick to its where he's agreements and never have provisions built and then say well what if the americans cheat or to domestic politics become real
volatile and it turns out that they don't follow international agreements anymore because that is not an assumption that people have had to operate on but i mean we've given them so many data points now suggesting that that is in fact the case and not just during the trump administration that i really do think starting with this north korea agreement
starting you're going to see that built into how countries do with us that they're going to assume first of all in agreement unique is only good for a few years so i'm only going to offer concessions that are good for years and second of all that i have to assume you're going to cheat
violate break it off and then become an overwhelming military threat to my country it's easy for us to forget how threatening we look to the rest of the world because of how much more powerful we are i think we're going to see that with north korea and sure we'll see them offered a gift things that may maybe some other
missile facilities but not in a way that permanently dismantles things the way that are granted i mean that you can only break that once which have just done and ask a country to do that again
max in that context about north korea something that just struck me and i wondered if you had a reaction on on thursday morning with the return of three americans the president said very warm things about kim jong on vice president like penn state around the morning broadcast shows said very nice things about the north korean leader
her and then you course you had the secretary of state meeting with kim jong on and the picture looked like you know what we might expect from a cheery meeting with an old fashioned us ally lots of smiles lots of deference we're a long way from rocket man and fire and ferry what do you make of all that i mean i think on some level that
that's effective diplomacy
the case that the north koreans have always had in mind his mouth and nixon and that's that's what they want to reproduce so i think it's not a mistake that you're seeing symbolism out of these that look very similar and it's not a mistake that they're asking for one on one meetings which is what mao caught with nixon right now didn't want to meet him
nixon and khrushchev one on one to show that china was you know appear of the united states that's what north korea is pushing for if that brings huge dividends and concessions then i don't know that seems like smart effective diplomacy to me but the downside is that if we give him all of this symbolic imagery
at the front end without getting big concessions are promises and returned which of these prisoners so far we have not then we've given away what is one of our biggest one time negotiating chips without making sure we got something back one thing i wonder looking ahead then north korea negotiations it just seems like trump is going to be
credibly eager to declare victory no matter what this is going to be the meal that he did good deal the only good deal and i just wonder how that dynamic plays into these negotiations as we anticipate i'm starting max
right now i think that's a great point and that's why you hear you talk to former diplomat about the way that these talks are being structured they are just pulling their hair out because the way that this is supposed to work as the months or years of pre negotiations with a low level officials who don't have anything to lose politically if they don't
back with something if they have to play good cop bad cop if they have to walk back some demand that they make
they can hammer out the agreement and then you bring in the leaders at the very and that's always the way that this has work to bring in the leaders at the front end first of all introduces huge amount of volatility to its second of all trump is because he's the president and this is so public really constrained as a negotiator in a way that you know whatever low level state department
whoever is not and the he said he's built up such enormous expectations for this they are going to be real political costs for him if he doesn't come back with a good deal and that's going to be obvious to the north koreans so we're already setting the table in a way that privileges them max one very quick final
question about this do you think that trump and trumps advisors
in their heart of hearts believe it was the right thing to do that sort of believe it or anything to do but they really a want to fill a campaign promise and be are engage in this process of of tearing down off the previous presidents accomplishment
aliens are very telling you what i think and then just because i'm here in europe how it scene and maybe that will be interesting for you the i mean what i think in terms of why it's happening it sure seems like and trumps part it's personal
animus towards obama but also that they have been really significant staffing changes in the white house where he used to have kind of you know studies center of the road more pragmatic foreign policy hands running things who did not want to do this and now you have more ideological types like john bolton who have always wanted to
you break up the cream and psych this and we're a bit more extreme and militaristic in their approach these kinds of things so i think it's both of those and you probably need both of those together
although again the fact that there is no articulated strategy a long term plan here
does give one the impression that it's less about foreign policy per se than about kind of domestic politics or like weird into personal issues in terms of how it seems here actually hear people very little talk about the particulars of trump or his administration and what might be driving it
almost always hear discussed as part of people here and an asian allies as well see as a long term american pattern dating back twenty years i mean people are bringing up treaties that i think most americans including people in foreign policy don't even think about the ab and treaty that we backed out of and two thousand and one
he agreed framework and two thousand and two with north korea and people are starting to get the sense that this is not a like one time trump be aberration but rather this is a kind of true face of america and this is kind of who we are which i don't know it and it's happening enough that i think it's worth considering the fisher price interpreter calm the new york times max thanks for

so michael cohen president's personal lawyer received half million dollars you may shady russian oligarchs shortly after paying off stormy daniels then he also received millions of other dollars from a pharmaceutical company know artists from a t and t from a korean arms manual
sure i think presumably as part of some sort of pay for play scheme and twenty seven thousand and to get access to the president we have been reminded this week that the potential corruption involving trumps inner circle potentially enormous that we don't know a lot about it it's not visible to us often and suddenly became
visible and it seems outrageous but it's also really complicated and hard to follow emily
what it was shocking if anything
about the revelation coming from michael everybody who stormy daniels stephanie clifford's lawyer
what was so shocking about has revelation that that cohen's imaginary company essential consulting with receiving millions of dollars from weird sources including russian oligarchs and companies with business in front of the trap administration eight i'm going to define shocking as like should be surprising even if it's not and
in that vein i think what is riveting here is the notion that the very same shell company cohen set up to pay off start me daniels was also raking in money from at least one company controlled by or invested heavily and by this rash and arc this you know
new character and our drama his name is an addict or vic sober that
i'm having trouble they're just so many proper nouns and names to keep track of strain to i knew it's totally vessel burning
effects of arguing yeah anyway that part is
amazing and interesting and it just makes me want to know where else this is going to go i feel like groping blindly right now where there are these variants eric schneiderman her
i feel confused are at least like i can't see all the different pieces of this and how they fit together do you guys have that feeling too yes if for no other reason than one detailed that struck me was that these special counsel knew about these payments
two companies back in november and so therefore presumably the banks over months and this this hasn't leaked till now second point is he knew that all that special cancelled it and still did the new knock sweep of the house hotel and office which means whatever they were going for their
was even more interesting more potentially explosive because the way it was done and because he already knew this stuff of that the special payments that were made so it suggests wow there must really be some other big big thing out there and that's just one new reveal it of this otherwise fast story that has
you know flows into all kinds of different areas the what we should point out though that it wasn't mahler's team did the no not that it's a whole separate set of prosecutors so low because he gave them the information to create to no knock wrote
emily just to go back to it but i think you were when you were using shock in kind air quotes there it is as goes may remember i'm sort of less exercised about corruption
then that i think you guys are probably most of our listeners are that you know whatever trumps getting rich as a businessman use shady and
that's never felt to me like the worst thing in the world but there's just so much of it there's so much of this this unbelievable
self dealing and backdoor dealing there was right
wrath out there was this it will end in exactly that they needed drain the swamp suppose
if let mean just just just to the one one that we didn't even talk about and last couple weeks episode with cutter which has been under a huge amount of diplomatic pressure and
it's gotten on the wrong type the saudis and gotten on the wrong side of jared kushner and cutter just bought an apartment very ostentatiously in public which is bob
five million dollar apartment building an apartment in one of trumps buildings they just basically gave five million dollars directly to a trump property and made it very publicly known that they were doing that
that's kind kind of pain of influence is so disturbing in a way that i didn't know that i get disturbed but i even hi i'm bitter by it
influence peddling is usually more subtle than this but according to the boarding michael caine was basically going around saying hey i can get you access and influence and these companies were desperate to find some inroads to a mercurial an unknown and disruptive president what is so central
it seems to me about this point is the one you're making which is he was all of those things not of washington not familiar disruptive impulsive and those are the qualities that we're supposed to be aligned with what he actually said which is that he was going to drain the swamp
and so they ours and so they are engaging in high level graduate level swamp behavior in buying off his clothes
attorney for the purposes of of trying to get access to him in so the question is did michael cohen not believe the stuff that the president said when his campaign because of you believe that the candidate really believe these things then you wouldn't dare engage in this kind of behavior right because you would be offending the person with whom you are so close or he thought that the president wasn't really
serious when he said all of that and then finally i'd like to raise this question should a t and t in awareness and the other anybody else feel shame for having engaged in these behaviors or are they doing exactly what they are supposed to do which is maximizing shareholder value by playing the system by the well known rules that it exists because obviously
there's an entire system of lobbying where this is where this would be considered of of a fashion sort of best practices as opposed to something shady yeah that's a good question i think actually again because maybe i'm a cynical person i think what eighteen of artist it is totally okay
by the standards of of the day that it's that it's their responsibility to try to whatever way they can whatever legal way they can influence the president and influence administration and if if they saw this as a way to get access what's wrong is that we should have people in public service
who reject it who refuse those blandishments and we don't have people in public service who actively are seeking and president trump has made it known that he wants essentially to be her doesn't care if people in a circle or being bribed been he himself wants to get the benefits of of public service in his pocket
also what about an incline was not in public service right part of what was going on here was that he had been passed over he didn't get a job and the administration and he was going to cash in on his relationship with the president in a different way so now we have this conversation okay which laws did he break seems like he broke some law
here and what what lot anyway well there's money laundering there's campaign finance violations on and i also feel like there's no reason to think that the payments coming into this particular shell corporation are the only ones to michael cohen and the administration since the trend administration started that seems unlikely doesn't it yes
seems very unlikely themes exceptionally on lately
and really do you think that anything materially has changed for the legal cases this week you that you can tell superficially birth of course sure that muller and investigators are looking at different facts and things them we're looking at but just from a problem with that interested me i mean i do think michael caine is in more trouble than a minute before not that he was
in any trouble but it just seems like they're just the plot sickening around hand that's a figure and given how tidy is to trump on that seem significant also of course there are other kind of still unresolved accusations that he was having meetings with people and the russian government or intelligence service
you know in that summer of what was that twenty six team that still sort of floating out there that the steel dossier allegations and that could of course connect cullen into the russia investigation which leads me to my next question if they're connected wide and muller refer out the colin investigation to the southern
strict of new york to this other set of prosecutors and then i thought that was a smart move and mellor made it because it means there's a us attorney's office involved and nason it takes some of that political heat away from milan and spreads it out and it could be that you know that they can dissect best way to make prosecutor can talk to each other the southern district can do that
corruption money hunkering campaign finance part and they can to hand the rest back to mahler but it is interesting that these stories seem like they could connect and yet they're are divided in terms of which prosecutors are in charge did you see this crazy amazing piece which i think was a new york magazine
the most exciting peace i read this week i'm not a person of believe in conspiracy known the jonathan chait crazy conspiracy theory
crazy applies only to one point six million dollar pay off that was made to a apparently to read playboy playmate who had an abortion after having an affair with a random republican fundraiser and embryology authority a person no one had ever heard of before hand and know i'm over here from again that brody apparently using cohen funneled one point six million dollars is this
playmate who had an affair with him to buy her silence
this may be wasn't a payment from brodie but a payment from trunk
the notable facts years at the names in the the names and the deal with the playmate are the same names that would have used in the story daniel deal the same l l c that used to pay it off no one had ever heard of birdie trump obvious has a history of playmates already has no history at all this kind of behavior
not clear why party would want to pay that much money to clear his name and finally that brady had a lot of government business a lot of opportunity to get government contracts that he was waiting for and which he got after all this payments went through suggesting that maybe he took a fall in exchange for getting some better deal later you say
i did that how he had actually bribes am a government official and now related way involving his girlfriend and hush money before also that yeah so there's a lot of lot of a weird side evidence who knows does he bring in the john edwards i'm yeah
added to do to get this and this story was written by paul campus
it's a crazy story and also there's the fact that ban and told michael wolff they're probably i think something like i think i think this is right that ben and told wolf they are probably hundreds of women's been women being paid off suggesting that the daniels probably wasn't the only woman being paid off and given that this is cohen this is the same time period it's the same mo
this woman quite possibly is is also a trump associate can ask any sort of journalistic methodological question that was like a way too many fail samples so i also found myself intrigued insect into this story after resisting reading it because it is entirely speculative and
i sort of feel like look maybe to be true but i wonder if it verges on the kind of irresponsible conspiracy riven thinking on the laugh that the left is so scornful up on the right yeah
yeah i think that's fair having said that do we think not having said that having acknowledged now do we think whiny this is not this is an unrelated but doesn't want to assume that in the materials that have been picked up by investigators that this that the truth of the matter would be
verifiable or could be identified and they're basically the answer to these questions are in somebody his hands right out of blaming assuming those communications between call and greedy and whoever else we're in the records that were seized in the rate of khan's offers i suppose you could think these people and cover their tracks and destroyed their communication
who will say yeah you'd think but then again but then again sixteen burner phone sixteen phone so things weren't destroyed
the way you might expect
and it's it's it but i but i don't want to go to quickly pass the good point about engaging in conspiracy theories i just think i'm losing my own contest to some degree because if something is plausible and you can kind of create this neat
if paul campus had no leg to stand on yeah well the problem is also there's been so many lies told to us and so many so many things in which it's turned out that the the conspiracy has been kind of true we should have learned at least from john edwards that turns out even seemingly squeaky clean politicians
with knows specific history of lying outside of the normal trade craft to politics can engage in bald faced lies in crete baroque coverup attempts and that with president shampoo the martian and post as catalog as having said three thousand things that are in one variant to or another december
ling to all the way to lie that that the press should change its way of thinking about things because it's in a new atmosphere and were in the process of figuring out the new standards while still trying to do the assessing

people with pennsylvania taxpayer dollars the new york attorney general fell hard and fast on monday that day the fearsome journalistic do over on unfair on jane eyre
as an aside can you imagine a more terrifying phone call to get run and pharaoh and jane eyre on the line
that would be terrifying
they published a blockbuster peace in the new yorker detailing at least four cases of violence against women by eric schneiderman often in a sexual context according to the peace schneiderman a democrat and a politician with great ambitions often while drunk would slap and choke girlfriend
women he was dating he would belittle them with abusive language called one his brown slave allegedly schneiderman resigned almost instantaneously denounced by practically everyone who could denounce him including every democratic politician and est one woman in the peace had mentioned her hesitancy to two
reports determines disgusting criminal behavior because he was so valuable to democrats but once he was once this story was out and moralists accepted as truth he was done and dusted and moments and why with he'd gone so fast this with this was definitely the quickest exit i think we've
seen anybody even know think spitzer spitzer took a couple of days
yeah i don't know if you guys were like online watching in real time that it did seem amazingly fast you know first of all jane man run and far from minimal and they had now down the details it just seemed credible and also the women were speaking in this set of specific there are lots of specific date
tales and it had this sense of like more insight than an anger it wasn't like they had an axe to grind it was this like as you said at least one of them was kind of reluctant to come forward and then i think the second part of this is just the me to movement and desire particularly of liberals to be on the right side of it and
to me it was and
reassuring that action item and indeed is expendable as basically like everybody should be expendable if they behave and then an abominable fashion and i don't know what to make of the chasm the time
these validly outwardly feminists champions like schneiderman then we can try to harvey weinstein in this category and then this private behavior which seems utterly at odds with that that seems like sherman's going to have to go figure that out because i addressed
but it's important that everybody be held to a standard way you're not allowed to hit people who don't want to get hit john we talked about eric wright and last week for governor of missouri who's also subjective extremely credible accusations of sexual violence as well as blackmail groans is a republican he remains in office
there are certain and republicans who wish she didn't why why is there a double standard is there are there are two different forms of behavior here between the parties or you just cherry picking to consider it it depends because there's the standard that is implied from the outside and then there's the standard felt from the inside the which is which i guess
contributes to the sense of shame or not shame in then i was trying to think for a republican politician were caught having had an abortion or paid for an abortion whether that would change the internal assessment of shame on shame it's it's it's viability within your own party and we've seen the swift departure
of republican politicians who were engaged with abortion with their balances
so you're saying that they're presumably our sins that conservatives and republicans would find as a parent as democrats are finding
sexual harassment sexual assault sexual violence but it's not it's not necessarily the same sentence as a different set of twins and an abortion i think it's unfortunate since one of them it doesn't mean that they don't care about him at all just met it's just a question of whether
again this combined fang whether it's both
they care enough to kick somebody's out of office or initiate the messy proceedings to do so
when they initiate that and whether the penalty is is large enough for a politician to want to resign and for this
what gentleman's accused of his violence he's not really he's not been accused of any sort of sexual harassment and the officer or and he's not even been really been accused of literary the problem is the violence and then he tried to confuse the picture by talking about role play but there was nothing consensual sounding or role play like in the account
these women and it's really important to think keep those things separate do you guys think there's something wrong with a new york so that's one of the lions that people are making that line the people are doing it's like spitzer wiener schneiderman there's something in the water or is it just that there's an abundance of reporters and journalists are relatively open
culture in the state the one of the amazing facts i found on the new yorker story was one of the women was helped and moving out of schneider mints apartment by another new yorker writer yeah there's so much more interplay between the journalistic world a political world that allows the possibility of being caught maybe is that
or is it just that new yorkers are civil rights and villains i don't think it's of those things i think that these are men with enormous he goes i mean just i did a little bit of reporting relating to schneier ends office a couple years ago and i got that message loud and clear and it's certainly true of wiener
spitzer and so there is a way in which the fact that the city is larger than life or the state i guess
another way although not quite can attract men with these like even bigger egos and there i it to me that's like a common thread here and it's obviously not specific to new york i mean brightens john edwards we can come up with lots of other examples bill clinton can you think that this case has any long term
political impact does affect anything goes
there is going to be an interesting election though in november i mean there's going to be a six month interim appointment i should also say the woman who has the job right now barber underwood is an uber competent liar
new york state's likely to have her but there is like you for your grand oh yeah she works a clip from my grandfather there is this interesting interplay going on and there are opportunities that are opening up and and this is a big job someone's going to get to fill it and it may very well be a woman there a few qualified women who have signalled their interest

let's go to cocktail chatter
not really appropriate to make a good cocktail joke given the context of sherman so i will not when you're hungry only i about drug and enrages that don't have a a non alcoholic beverage a maybe just too
glass of juice emily scholastic i don't actually have be children
who don't juice person about t y would drink juice to really hand that's interesting i don't have a feeling about two years ago
i want to chatter about this wonderfully amazing rube goldberg contraption video that maybe old i may be the last person who noticed stand on the internet but i watched it this week and it was so fun it's by joseph her sure he makes comical chain ring
action machines and his it's called joseph's machines his outfit and it test is whimsical and late fall involves a baby and i phone but are melting the delivery of a piece of cake it just has all these lovely touches we will put up the link to it if you have not already watched that you should it's
amazing it's all basement kitchen or some kitchen kitchen like place the baby's behaviors incredible my question to you know who's do think that the
the attraction to rube goldberg machine and wired into the dna but if you showed a rube goldberg machine to any person on earth
they would instinctively understand how amazing and koons or is it it is it is it a learned behavior i kind of go with the universal on also i bet you a lot of monkeys would appreciate it to it just seems like something that a fan of oh or a champ and a point also really groove to is it impossible there's a third option which is
but it's only that it's a learned behavior for some people who like that kind of stuff do you think there are people who don't like goldberg machine oh i totally no way think there are people who look at that and think like was born oh my car so the thing goes to the thing that know i know but that's because we're into process and the wonder enjoy that comes from cork
key things i totally think there are people who would look at images like who cares if the hiring spill i'm interested in anyone who was willing to own up to being such a person is like a little bit like well like and hernia
some of them some of them were perverse people any anybody out there who's and in the audience who doesn't like recorder machine machines not the case against them i would be interested please please the tweet enough that i played benefits
also if i may to say and you can shoot me down from i know you will but i feel like in this case the room
goldberg a new sub this is actually at a higher level than the normal one it's not just a thing crashes into a thing
expanded it has a kind of whimsy and cleverness in the way that it proceeds through its machinations that that i found really particularly so does that mean that if you don't normally lake rube goldberg contraptions you would like this one or that it would seem kind of well over the top to you if you are anti generally
a well this is also further further things to pose to our audience i guess what i would say is if you are hearing this conversation like oh i gotta check that out some day because i'm mildly interested in it i would suggest that perhaps it's worth checking out even before you know you might forget about it because it's really quite it's quite
however and whimsical john what does your chatter
china was inspired by the extraordinary sale of the art collection from the rockefeller the david rockefeller art collection that went on sale this weekend which there were
good yeah monet's man is hoppers picasso's when i was struck by is the age old question of you know
artists who toiled in anonymity and struggle and then there are pieces so one of the moon is when for eighty five million dollars i believe it was a water lily so that's a lot of somalians and do cause me to do some some research at the end of his life money who apparently had some renowned while he was living and and
money and but in in one thousand and eight after three years of working on a new set of paintings and right before they were ready to get packed up in their crates with the straw in the horse hair and sent to paris for the opening of a new exhibit of his work he decided that fifteen of the canvases just weren't doing it for him so he took a knife and a paintbrush to the camp
mrs and basically destroyed them and he decided my life has been nothing but a failure and all that's left for me to do is destroy my paintings before i disappear
it is in addition to the fact that he is a water lilies of which there are two hundred and fifty were totally denigrated and dumb
called awful by critics at the time and this is failing eyesight was blamed for them so i guess what i mean when i feel is that at this point the dollar value placed in the current market is nuts
but it did remind me that your money thought he wasn't doing very well and things have turned out okay for human in life
not for him he's dead my chatter is a fantastic book i just read just came out i think it's called theory of bastards by audrey gentlemen if you like station eleven or he like the road if you are into post apocalyptic kind of road movies poster
the books
this is the best one yet
well it's up work station eleven is probably my favorite book ever read and years
then it really get up there it's the story of a scientific research or who who's doing research on bonobo speaking of been earth which emily was a minute ago in a near future slightly this topic near future america and know she has an interesting back story shows that interesting college is working with them then there are these bonobos
is working with and trying to study their sexual behavior
developed theories about sexual selection my bonobos and then and then they're kind of things go awry and she ends up
to give away a little bit chand the traveling with the bonobos and it's it's just you
it's incredible i cannot recommend it highly enough aldrich almonds
of bastards we gotta we a title weird it doesn't look it looks like some pretentious english book that covered on don't look like a pretentious english buckle it's kind of trashy i just bought it yeah it looks it looks trash it doesn't cover recover and the title or not a match for what it in their the book is the book is beautifully written and to really thoughtful

joined by jared kushner and a trump and blessed by some very controversial american pastors bibi netanyahu the prime minister of israel
celebrated the opening of a new us embassy in jerusalem on monday as the celebrations were happening israeli soldiers were firing firing live ammunition and fire and tear gas on thousands of palestinian protesters who were assaulting are protesting at the fence separating gaza is real sick
the palestinians were killed nearly three thousand wounded in the one sided battle there was not a single is really casualty i believe this was just the latest in a series of increasingly tense protests
in gaza someone instigated by hamas or but not entirely stated by hamas which rules gaza
presumably to draw the world's attention to the to conditions in the gaza strip which has been allocated by israel for a decade
generally very unpleasant place to be and live to use the technical term what's going on israel is a fucking mess and if an american jew married to an israeli jew i am gutted by what is happening emily this is just is a terribly complicated and awful story
but let's start with let's start with this question of whether there is a peace process anymore and there can be the us has always been israel best friend but it has also been kind of a potential broker in whatever peace process was going on is that
days over basically pick sides were with israel now and there's no potential for negotiation with the palestinians i think that champ station yes has abdicated the united states traditional role of some kind of but are so previous presidents administration's made clear that a way
our israel's friend and supporter but also maintained enough critical distance to have some kind of credibility as a neutral arbiter and convene or and now that's no longer the case i mean to me and also gutting to hear the white house spokesperson just entirely blame his heart
das en masse now obviously like hamas does bear some responsibility but that just seems to be such a terrible over simplification of what happened all the underlying tensions and currents that led up to these confrontations at the border fence and gaza
you know i think israel has i think the most right wing militaristic government ever had and the united states is giving israel more leeway to act with impunity then i think the united states has ever done before and it's that toxic combination that is leading to the end of
the peace process already was in terrible trouble on again they're all these underlying factors but it does feel mired and hopeless and brutal right now in a way that i am i don't remember being this way before which isn't to say that the intifada weren't terrible on their own right but this guy now
nick feels really awful to me
there's one of the things that i find so disturbing i suppose it's not different in israel at news and a lot of the rest the world is that no one seems to be playing any kind of long game but there's a hamas for short term reasons and to to draw the attention the world does want to provoke israeli retaliation
cause and even cause death of palestinians i mean that is clearly part of the goal is to provoke israel to respond
excessively israel is feeling impunity and no longer has any interest in any kind of peace process of negotiation doesn't isn't there's no punishment or the world is going to carry out against israel i think so
felt free to act however it wants the other arab states are largely indifferent to the palestinian cause not the not that people don't feel sympathy for the palestinians are going through and one should the conditions and gaza on the west bank or horrible
but they don't really they're not invested in doing anything about it it's just
the looming demographic crisis which is that they're going to be there to hugely growing populations in a very small space and one of them has no rights of citizenship and participation in society and that's in his past and and his pals em and that's that's
it's both a moral crisis and a political crisis that is the case and the second group you're talking about are orthodox jews right right to an increasingly right wing increasing the religious israelis who are then facing off against increasingly numerous and disaffected an alien
aided palestinians who are no longer integrated in any meaningful way into the economic life of israel are also which is another problem which is it used to be that palestinians
and israelis had a lot of connection to each other because they to me did a lot of the work and that's less and less and less true it does not like south africa where the foundation of the south african economy was the labour of black africans israel has one of the facts of separation is that separated its economy from of health me
so they don't even care it's like there's no they're not tied up in an economic future together either which is terrible at all it's all back every part of his bad
wait a minute seems like there are moments in this game no one hundred seventy year however you wanna count conflict in which international and domestic and regional forces push toward moderation and then there are moments when they divide and empower the extremists and right now we're in a moment in which extreme
this on both sides are being encouraged and and whatever taken to reach that point like however much you want to say that gardens have been manipulated into this position by arab states by hamas by their own leaders is that it doesn't matter like that it is such a terrible circumstance that the notion that then
israel's responses to open fire just feels a wildly unjust when banks your original question david whether the us is given over its traditional role of is moving though
in the old days the reason the embassy he was in tel aviv was to keep as a part of the future negotiation that the us with her broker the status of jerusalem up in the air by choosing to move the embassy to jerusalem and cells to the palestinians that basically that's been taken care of him even though they think they should have a capital in jerusalem that that's been
settled but the second thing is that what used to pressure you as governments was that the arab reaction to doing that would be so violent that they would be you know the americans didn't want to court battle that outrage from the arab world and that seems to have diminished so if you look at three medical pressure on this continent
duration
obviously there's a lot of strong pressure from donors in in the republican party to do what the president did and so i believe shall nails and was actually at a ceremony so you've got that pressure to do what he did and then the other pressure which would balance things out is going away which is to say that there didn't seem to be much outrage from
the arab world
directed at the united states either for the move or for the israeli reaction to the palestinian protests so it seems like the pressure to get something done is
his moved away conservatively that's that's a really good point john and it's because there's basically now an implicit alliance between a lot of the sunni ever have been gulf states and israel so that the saudis
in their circle and to a lesser extent kind of the jordanians in the egyptians basically are allied against iran a rising iran there's this weird the thing i know maybe you can explain the someone that israel's chief enemy has somehow become iran even though it doesn't share a border with iran and they don't really have any they're not really
at odds they don't allow any conflict with are lacking in funding has blah so i and you know and has ties to other very anti israel group so i i mean i think that's that seems fairly obvious but i think dance point is it really important one and it's always that the middle east like lots
really complicated you have to take into account all these different actors and the way in which these international pressures matter just as much as what's going on domestically what if then suddenly in the trump administration said okay we moved the
the us embassy and now we're going to recognize palestinian claims to be eastern half of jerusalem
that is not going to happen
my no danger
yeah to show an and then why would you ever extend yourself to the palestinians and there's also this problem which which is there there's no lift remaining in the country there's no left for peace that has any influence in the country way and that is domestic arguments going on about you know laws that discriminate against women there are these questions of the rise
power of the orthodox fat consume a lot of energy within israel arguing internally and it's i think easier to kind of block out what's happening in the territories but when you actually like like what's happening in the territories i mean you know in nineteen sixty seven when israel took over the west bank
they could have pulled out they could have prevented jewish settlers from settling they didn't it wasn't some like big deliberate choice in which israel's leadership at the time really thought it through and understood the implications it was a little more i'm an accidental is too strong but it just kind of unfolded and now they're all the settlers there are you know daily battles of our palestinian
plans in which the israeli supreme court rulings that give palestinians the right to plant crops or live live on those lands within the confines of this militarists to control our like shifting all the time on the ground in terms of how the army interpret stand chill man who is one of the and of remaining israel
real doves was writing about this this week and so you know when you read accounts like that it's almost as if you could see like imagine want to be like in the united states if native americans we're currently losing their lands as opposed to like this original sin that happened years ago that you know is a scar on the nation but for better or worse
worse
is a piece of history it's not happening right now there are places in the last bank or it is happening right now
i don't think
leona know you and are both american jews who spent time in his own
i certainly have really relatives and you i don't know if you do but i i certainly don't think it is my place of an american to spend a lot of time trying to shape is really domestic politics
israel's business like my job as an american is to try to influence american decision makers to make better decisions about our foreign policy and foreign policies are listed to israel and as it relates to other countries even when israel is doing things that i find terrible and tragic and believe to be long term mistakes i don't really think is my business telling them not to do
well i guess i wonder what the distinction is i mean sure like then concentrate on you know american government leadership and an america we have such an oversized influence in with israel and in that region that if you trained to the trump administration's policy that would carry enormous weight and so you can chat
all your energy and that direction that feels better to you but i feel like these things bleed into each other that's not the right word to use something written word
choose the right word maybe it is i mean these things the these two issues of like how and whether american jews are supposed to directly comment and have an opinion about israeli policy or whether we just take our feelings about israeli policy and then try to get are jewish organizations or you know that whoever is in
the white house to respond to them it's it doesn't feel that different to me
last question we've we've moved away from the particular tragedy of the week which is the death of death of scores of people
seems to be largely unnecessary slaughter didn't seem to be the groups threat to israeli national security
was it was occurring during these protests
why do you think israel's pursuing such an implacable strategy why why are they shooting to kill people and what do you do in the face of thousands of people seeking to kind of breakthrough offense and broke through border
indeed you do you think their claims bed basically members of hamas are into trading these
protests and that those are the guys you're being shot do you think that's a totally made up or do you think they're over
it was their theory of course right and i think it was probably oversold i doubt it is totally made up i've always thought that the palestinian mean
the palestinian stupidity in all of the protests over the since the first intifada the the way in which they let violence infected if had been simply remained and been able to persist with a non violent strategy and drudgery of violent protests in this case where you just simply go and walk peacefully up to this fence
it would be so much
then what they pursued and i do think they probably did the crowd with people with weapons or or people decided autonomously on their own you know what i'm going to use this opportunity trying to sneak through and do some damage to it so i think that hamas clearly
i was happy to have that happen
have have the crowds be infiltrated but that still does that justify the new the new and of responds by israel i don't know right well that's no i was just trying to figure out what the how to calibrate what happened
hamas has dug the tunnels and we know they have shot the rockets and all that but but that doesn't really tells about what happened on the specific gave sixty people died
by it i mean i think there were other means of crowd dispersal that israel could have used rage shirley i mean water there
but i also feel like
in some ways focusing unless like mrs fletcher picture i mean i agree with you david i think the palestinians would be much better serve with nonviolent protest i also think that is like such a huge thing to ask of people have to her hands on her hind of statesman likely or ship that the palestinians have not had and it demands kind of or
seeing their own feelings that like the violence is justified by well at this point by the power and balanced but before by this kind of historical i'm feeling of of losing their land and losing their place and i don't know like
i look there's so much blame on both sides are all sides in this story but i just feel lonely pan on the palestinians for not having a better strategy at this point when you know we're talking about an israel that is dominant it just feels like it's not a satisfactory answer to me this episode of the first

dot com slash gap first plus to become a member political washington distracted itself for far too much of the past week
with the story of kelly sadler someone i'd never heard of a mid level white house press aide who cracked a morbid and cruel joke about john mccain and his opinion about a director and hospitals nomination i think it was about that didn't matter because he's dying anyway
and a private meeting and this was leaked out and became publicly known that she had said this so there a couple of stories here first if the continuing persistent refusal of the white house to apologize for anything and second the fact that settlers remark leak so quickly
at the white house was way more upset about the leak them the joke
and the meetings about leaking were themselves leaked and then a bunch of white house sources talk to reporters about why they leaked so a lot about leaking so first of all before we get the leaking question i'm actually going to rise to sabotage defense i don't want to belabor at it with a joke in poor taste but honestly
it's a kind of people in politics cynically say all the time it's like that it's the dark cynical joke that political people say all the time privately to each other
all the time when you can hold up neglect lana to sam's sorry but and there's so much sanctimony because it involves mccain and mccain is is has been amazing american leader and he appears to be dying and so there's a there's a kind of holiness surrounding him and so should make a joke about mccain who i am sure has made similar jokes in his life about people certainly fed salt
things and private himself
well okay so there's the question is the is the joke itself wrong or simply the fact that there hasn't been a public apology from south the wrong she may have she i think she did reach out to meghan mccain to apologize i don't know whether that was where the she handled in from of just a purely human standpoint i think you don't you don't i mean you
i mean people are should be free to say stupid and cruel and morally gross things which is to is kind of dilemma but delight in the impending death of someone but your point is you know people in the impending death i you think he was delighted in the impending death i wasn't there
i don't well actually i don't know what is implicit don't think it's not the lighting it's more like it's it's it's a kind of like throwaway line
he's guy and wasn't matter and this was objectionable enough for a few people in the meeting to be so repulsed that they felt they had to leak which is so also once it gets out their view as a white house or a kind of steward of norms and this is one of them which is you respect the dignity of other people and you
maybe respect the dignity of a sitting senator and by the way you've got good news on north korea so why have this be a multi day story
wanna just apologize milan and have everybody focus on the big success you had this week on north korea
right
tactical point which is you make extremely well which someone should have said to them which is that they they should have posted along and that's the reason to apologize and also because it's the humanly decent thing to do i guess i'm still i still would say that it's a completely forgivable excusable
remark and moreover it's just that there's a level of hypocrisy it's a kind of thing that i know because i hang around political journalists all the time i used to be a political journalist and except for a few who are who are quite big hearted i would put you in that category down like every
one says things like this all the time and politics all the time that i i'm not the point like nobody the point is they're kind of to principles at stake there's a basic norms of decency and severity you at john has done an excellent job of napping because he thinks a lot about this and then there's the principle of not upon
isaiah for anything like even when you're shooting yourself in the foot and that his character trait of president chant and now we're seeing it permeate his administration and is that what we want from the president of course of course we do so
let's go to the leak john you are such a student of this kind of stuff does this white house leak in fact more than its predecessor
it's it's not even a water metaphor big enough to contain the way in which this white house leagues so it link ocean will learn and can jam i think an ocean is is too small i think
news about a symbol fall in the in the container we need to and and what is drinking and but the leaking here is obviously there's leaks there's the leaks about leaks and i love the leg long explanation
that a lot of axioms printing of like while the league well and also we have never lets say this we have never had a president who has thrilled so much in leaking himself as a private citizen certainly and perhaps even even as a president now we should we should know that for a long time
for woodrow wilson held that first public press conference
you had presidents who and then even for a long time after that and presidents who leaked in one of the definitions of it which is they tell you something and you just don't attributed him you don't attributed to them and the you just attributed to the administration or to an administration officials so we've had a lot of that with presidents we've had weird things were bill clinton wants to talk to a bunch of reporters and then they cited and in new
illustration official familiar with the president's thinking
but i think is most important substantively about leaking and this administration is that leaks are the sign of a corrosive system inside of an administration and there's the sign of of several different things one so much chaos then that members of the administration feel like they can't get their ideas adjudicated
in the normal channels and so they have to go outside to try to create a situation that fixes the policy debate second thing is it's so corrosive that the president and only listens to things that are put in front of him that have been printed in the new york times so that if you say something and a meeting you will be ignored but if it appears in new york times in front of the president at sea
only way that they see it
those are short of doubled related but then the biggest corrosive part is that this long into an administration if everybody is not rowing in the same direction
it means that there is not the lift of inspiration in the chief executive or in the people around him that makes it a place where you wouldn't dare leak not because somebody to take your job away or punish you are or because it's impossible to do because they've locked away your phones but you don't want to leak because you believe so much in the mission of the person or in the dude
you have to the american people which presumably the executive is trying to carry out that duty
it would be and almost on patriotic thing that you would stop yourself from leaking if that isn't the reaction and yet and in fact we've seen quite the opposite it suggests that people are not policing themselves they're compelled to league because of the corrosion and that is not healthy
there was a really good set of stories about how the clinton administration
shut down the leaking it occurred during the first year and one of the main points was so i think you already amazingly green over the atlantic
and largely if that leon leon panetta came in as chief of staff and he didn't do a massive investigation to root out the the lakers there wasn't there wasn't a kind of public humiliation of the lakers and and a ritual honest execution it was we're all together on the team were going to find
the pride to all work together to believe and what we're doing and we're going to act professionally because it radically because of that sort of the positive approach with what worked and then negative approach oh investigating locking people's phones away threatening people just perpetuates the kind of paranoia
and i'm going to get shift attitude that causes people to to the anyone meant can i mentioned in another kind of leak we had this week ronan taro had an amazing story this week about michael cohen's financial dealings which are connected to the stormy daniels payment but but or even more connected to these pay offs to him to gain influence and
the new administration mm an investigator talked to pharaoh because he was worried that the system that had been flagged several times the banking system that have been flying several times in noticing big payments to cohen and he's moving money around which flagged the the system wide process for
transactions that might be suspicious activity
back in the sack
the watchdog for suspicious finance
it it flag van kind of unrelated not knowing the facts of the case just huge amounts of money moving around and the official that talk to feral was worried that the information was now being withheld from law enforcement because it was disappearing from the database so that's another leak that happened this week which is the another basket of leaks which is not necessarily inside the administration but in the
son of aid
oh kind of in various investigations going on not not any leaking by the way going on by muller but
nevertheless in the various lawyers and on all sides of the various investigation going on related to the president and those around him
emily going back to to jumps very clarifying
deception of leaking at this administration and whites so prevalent is there any realistic hope that as
a trump gets more more of his people in the white house and fewer people he doesn't want which is something he appears to be doing and be he just becomes more comfortable than a job that the culture of leaking will stop i mean it seems like the factional as asian and the fighting it out has been how he's always ran his operation
so why would we expect that change and if anything you might expect it to intensify as more and more i mean i know it seems like he's the people in the white house artists people said i'm really know what that means that done do you imagine this coming down or do you imagine a continuing so many people when we are well into an administration
and the president has not been shy about firing people
getting the way he as fire them or had them fired or exerted pressure on his staff or force them out
his by leaking make the league super of old jeff sessions is really on the chopping block cures to nielsen at the secretary the department of homeland security all she might you know they're looking for replacements now the leak is used as all administration's use them but this one in hyperdrive and also in this specifically personnel related way
to kind of either flow trial balloons or knock people off or prepare the way for their dismissal
you cannot suggest that well once he gets his team in there and this is you know then things will get better i think that this is a this is a byproduct of the way the place runs we've seen so many people change and and yet the leaks continue
going to the apology question emily trump appears to be literally incapable algae
not apologize to any of the people he said disgusting
things about for the last couple of years not to mccain not to carry their con not to judge carry yell
i other people he is impugn and four hundred
that a quality of narcissism or is that that method not necessarily an arsonist this quality it's just something built and to him
i think it's narcissistic i also think he it's part of his whole know yeah right that you have these brawls of people that you revel in the brawls that you never back down and why should he changed that way of operating when it has served him well from his point of view
you know he is all about the idea that he knows best and that he is best served by following his gut instincts especially right now
i didn't it's really amazing to me that he's gotten as far as he has in life without being able to apologize
made me think maybe there's an entirely different way to live and i just don't recognize it's related to the difference between leading through fear and leading through right like it's all
if we want to believe that leaving for your fear doesn't work and when you know when you are my boss you didn't lead that way and you're really good at apologizing and is it served you well so the idea that there's this alternate path and what you never back down and like you get to be you get to fail up to be the president that's depressing well it leaves you know there there's there's collateral damage
edge that that is left when you pay that way and so usually your
you know your conscience kicks him and says i don't want to leave wreckage
i think a piece of wreckage year by the way is kelly sadler she has become an herb her issue is talked about
on and on she tried to make it right called meghan mccain who knows
know whether whether and how she was whether she was any good but it was she did the right thing you say something stupid you apologize
if the administration had apologized and perhaps the president in his world view would see that as a knock against him or something new and heard him but if you're a leader you take the hit yeah your person did something stupid but you take the hit on their behalf everybody who works for you sees you take the hit on their behalf and says you know he's a stand
a guy he's done the big thing and that's a kind of guy i want to work for and that kind of culture then creates a situation which you don't leak because you say why would i want to do something small for my own self aggrandizement when the person i'm working for set this example of doing something big at their own expense
that's not this like exhibit three thousand two hundred and thirty one in human wreckage and shame are not going to in any anyway really affect the current administration and what matters are election results like no other avenue all these kind of small checks civility and norms and decency that we've
lie on in previous presidents to get the president or he calibrate they seem to have almost zero power
you know certain that and seems to me the case now
the question is whether there's any
you know how big the damage is just one one more thing on on the morality of apologies g k chester to him as a great quote about apologies
even apologies and fake apologies he said a stiff apology is a second insult the injured party does not want to be compensated because he has been wronged he wants to be healed because he has been hurt
the front that was a good reminder of why we apologise that can get lost here in the political debate
right

nordstrom has a special holiday tree for you for eliminate time on arts him that tom get free two day shipping and select areas on thousands of items just sent to you is that cut on their site to see all the great items you can shop exclusions a plaque
the district attorney's of brooklyn and manhattan
well i'm not going to i'm
even to introduce a i'm afraid that whatever i'm going to say m m
going to tear it apart for emily wanna you introduced the topic
okay so new york is a state in which the possession of marijuana smoking marijuana remains illegal and so we have this interesting situation in which particularly in brooklyn africans are so i've been doing some reporting on for my buck inherited a district attorney's office and much twenty in two thousand and fourteen his
predecessor promise to reduce the prosecution of marijuana possession and so at that blaine forget about manhattan because that day and and hadn't saved answer is not on board for this at that point the idea was that as a way of countering stop and frisk prosecutors in brooklyn we're going to declined to prosecute people who got stopped for
son potentially bogus reason by the cops because a lot of bogus stops were and racially discriminatory and desperate stops were like driving stop and invest and then if if the cops found we it in your pocket you probably wouldn't get prosecuted so it turned out that that policy only sort of went into effect and i think laughed
fall debbie when my did a big story showing that in more than eighty percent of the arrest in brooklyn the cops were still prosecuting for marijuana and the reason for that was there are a bunch of exceptions to this policy that brooklyn days off it as put in place and it mostly affected people who had open war and so are out on probation or
parole or had a criminal history and there was also an exception for smoking in public so and when w n y c that report it turned out that almost everyone who is still getting arrested for marijuana possession was black or hispanic that is true city wide that is a huge problem so fast forward to
now what happened was that the end my pity was claiming that the reason for this racially disparate pattern of enforcement of marijuana is that they're more nine one one cause complaining about weed from predominantly minority neighborhoods and the new york times when it did this analysis were on a precinct
level they compared different places in the city and they found that that explanation from the my he just doesn't hold up because you see the same rate of complaints about marijuana on the upper west side as you know and our neighborhood in harlem and you see many more black people arrested in harlem this predominantly black
fuck place so what the city and in particular guns are since i have bands are wrestling with and let the n y p d really needs to think about is what is the point of this so i'm the one hand it's a funny question for the cops and prosecutors to be asking right because if the state still says marijuana possession is illegal
how do you go around just essentially a deciding not to enforce the law
but the other side is like if they don't act we're going to continue to have her new york will continue to have this racially desperate pattern of enforcement and so i think what we're really seeing here underlying this is that the police are reluctant to give up marijuana arrests as a way to essentially police people they think are bad
guys people who already have records people who are doing things they don't like it's a tool for them
and then the sort of push back when you look at you and you think about that top deck
what exactly like if if the city is coming around a contented few that marijuana enforcement for white people is not something we want anymore why are we still doing it for black people who have these like vague suspicions attached to them especially because we know we really know from the researched the notion that marilyn
arrest reduce serious crime is just not true so that's the sort of underlying situation here
so if if someone's arrested and and it's just on their record for six months and then it gets wiped for their arrested for marijuana and so on the record for six months and it's just wipe so what's the big deal but it is a big deal right because people lose how's a lose jobs they're there they have to go to court and it can we not at all it means they can get in bigger trouble for something
else in that intervening six months like it is attacks it is a tax on poor people it as a tax on black and hispanic people and it leads to the is some of the neighborhoods i've been reporting and in brooklyn you have this funny situation in which i think about it you're like a black had your at nineteen or twenty years old you see that people are not getting any more i mean
all over the city you smell marijuana in a way that i have used to notice that just a few years ago it's true by the way where i live in new haven to so you smell it
people around you are smoking like in the hallway of an apartment building or outside and then the cops come and a big make guess they're responding to complain or they just see people and they come over and they run the names and then they only pick up some of the people that people with these open warrants the people they see is like the bad guys for reasons
you know are a black box like is that feel like to you if you're that that teenager that feels run an unfair and new york which has supposedly ended stop and frisk like this is a vestige of stop and first for the still causing a lot of unhappiness and unfairness
i have a question about whether how this connects to the broken windows theory of police so we heard so much in the nineties about the idea that if you stop nuisance crimes fare dodging minor disruptive chaotic crimes that you put a block against bigger
crimes later
is this part enforcement an example at all of this and be did it turn out that the broken windows theory with nonsense the broken windows theory at this point is much disputed and i would say largely in fact i mean people still make those claims by then so let's talk about new york mark because it had broken windows and also
has become as there's a book that this u c berkeley criminologist name franklin zipping called the see that became safe so new york is had tremendous success and reducing crime and then the question becomes why do we credit broken windows policing for some of that drop and when the criminologists go in and they like try to look at this question it is a
complicated question there is no simple answer for why crime dropped in new york or across the country but giving a lot of credit to broken windows policing looks like a big mistake because broken windows policing was not shown to reduce serious crime and the other amazing thing about new york the headline at least in my view is that new york reduced crime
at a great rate while also reducing mass incarceration at a great rates and the notion that like you pick up all the smoke smell fi offenders you get them off the street for a short amount of time that having some bigger deterrent effect that seems to not be true and now we're having a kind of another test of that he can the city stop enforcing it's marijuana law
without having crime rise the cops are worried about it but it looks like the answer to that is probably yes i mean one thing that has happened in brooklyn since two thousand and fourteen is that the number of arrests for marijuana possession has gone way down so there were still having some of those cases prosecuted when people do get arrested but the idea that we're just like pig
people up because they have waited in their pockets and that means that you know that's going to prevent crime more broadly like that does not look to be true at all because crime is continue to drop in brooklyn and across the city
evidence from to like dc ten temper which have crammed marijuana the prime change and anywhere
crime has not risen in those places as far as i know i should note also though i was surprised when you're reading up for this topic so colorado which is mostly stopped prosecuting people from marijuana also has a problem of racially disparate enforcement when they do arrest people there are three times as likely to be african american and so
look like this is racially desperate law enforcement is just like
a constant nagging problem in our criminal justice system and the question is like how much do we care about it how much does fat fundamental unfairness drive how we shape how we think about our policies and and i would say that it's important to ask those questions against the backdrop of you know recognizing just how
massive mass incarceration remains in the united states i mean it's quintupled are rate of incarceration since the seventies were still way ahead of other developed countries for example in europe and it's just we're causing tremendous destruction especially poor and minority communities and it's really not clear
we're getting from it
either complexities here are the
some of was some suggestion that aggressive enforcement minor league started shooting actually insights
your it's worse in the thing is that time york
broken windows was being informed students here who's being followed by brandon the forty percent reduction them in an employment in the state and so you had massive sociological changes going on there would also contribute to a decrease brought him in crime and then also the thing is that there was there was a drop in crime in other states
they want following broken windows theory about the same time so it's just more evidence of this mess he knows the him
in the data the ground yes good point
you know i'm don't know this data and i'm emily are you obviously are deeply expert on it it is just the lived experience of the cities
broken windows always felt intuitively you write to me though why would you credit those things as opposed to what john just explained about unemployment to climb and these larger social the horses there's a whole social fine earns about her no social cohesion in neighborhoods and how non profit organizations can contribute to that all these things and of
nothing to do with law enforcement that can really affect how safe a city feels like whether people go to the park where of the park it already have any hot lately and that is an honor i mean those are all things
police i think you know i think you're right i know you're right i know you're no you're right on the data
it is very hard to reconcile the idea that this had nothing to do with it with the fact that to me the huge difference in living the american city
twenty years later is feeling the chaos has been diminished and therefore it is safe for is safe in all places at all times in always okay whatever whatever just thinking about this like if you live in a mostly white affluent neighborhood do you want the cops picking your kids up if they are smoking in the park
if you don't why one of the clubs picking up someone else and i lagged no need to know no no totally it's totally right
it's completely fair point
also can on people sitting on her porch you did my neighbors sit on their porch and have a drink
my wrong with the exactly i mean one thing new york has already wrestled with his it's open container laws and why not deal with that through a summons like a ticket right they're all these infractions constantly it's true obviously with so many driving problems right like you get a parking ticket you get a speeding ticket you don't get a criminal record
you get a civil summons like are different ways of dealing with the kind of behavior at are describing the don't entail giving people criminal records that have is negative consequences for it's possible to that there is some contributory
broken windows is just not as big as people claim i mean of there's the spectrum from it incites more violence to it's the solution don't crime grey and one other thing to think about is like why the police and law enforcement or an answer as opposed to a kind your landlord or doing something that has that soft
that's a a way of problem solving and dealing with the you know and i even want to use that were deviant the dealing with behavior you don't like if if you're in an apartment thousand and there's like the smell pot everywhere and you don't want to be there like who do you call and why do you live in a place where i like the cop seem like you're only resort

let's go to cocktail chatter when you are sitting on your porch
as i'm sure above on for dickerson and rose and parts of do occasionally with a cocktail
what are going to be chattering about john dickerson remove first to be chattering amount of comes from daniel pink news letter daniel pink gives them a great writer who has a wonderful news letter that includes things
link some suggestions to burst of the things in this came from that and it is it
the story about something that i have a reaction to like this
jani or moral ordeal thing where one person years one thing and one person here a mother to me this would be a life of doom
for the person engaged in it is a life of happiness and this person is engaged in his living on royal caribbean cruises mario so say do good two decades ago two decades ago retired from his job and went on a cruise from which he has never
returned for almost twenty years he has been a permanent resident on the royal caribbean cruises
he has spent more than seven thousand consecutive nights on cruise ships and learned all of this well from the link on danza newsletter but it was in a new york times op dark and little film about consumer super mario life on these cruise ships i suggest you go watch it and
also contemplate what life would be gone a royal caribbean cruise hunger and strangers just don't know he was a for twenty one years i think he was a involved in the corporate world think he did
he traveled a lot to latin american in financial services company or something
when is like a millions or hundreds of millions or billions of million to be millions my brother and my rough the number in my head is two point eight million dollars
so interested to see what when actually if that's fascinating he one thing that's very poignant him at the end of the him
like is he talks about he doesn't want go die and some land hospital so you things when he and i hope
i thought you might attached to this david when he feels as though is at the end is near he would just go scuba diving into just keep going down just kind of just go down and then that would be the end of it once was
and of oxygen ran out or the or the pressure became too mature that would it doesn't go go on land
anyway and nine hundred fifty cruisers oh my god
yeah you like and don't were horrified i where you are well that's my point is when compared to that the audio mean because mean this is obviously great happiness for mario sell say he has achieved the singular thing in life that he wants to do and for me
this would be
like that how honor yeah like that play no exit i mean it would be it would be really not something i would want to do in any possible way
oh my god it looks like know it looks like less than two million dollars
oh my god
getting anxious and asked about author you only get an interior interior cabins which keeps has caused him to there's no way oh my god
i'm not sure you can keep saying i think he may have maxed out with this is really it's like somebody will get upset by are so many worst thing is to get upset by and here i am upset both and living the dream by being on a cruise
i feel worse than and dave think down and when he went through
it's definitely not as penance that so in the long list of things that we should be paying attention to you that are getting lost in the den
there was this really promising bipartisan effort to have federal sentencing reformed have congress passed a law that would address some of the over enforcement problems me were just talking about on a federal level fewer low are mandatory minimum sentences for people who are non violent drug offenders
there were other reforms i was like put a dent in the federal prison population and chuck grassley the republican his head of the judiciary committee in the senate was very much behind this there was a list of bipartisan supporters they had been hammering it out for a couple of years attorney general jeff sessions opposes oppose this legislation
in the face of groups you know including like the koch brothers who had style themselves as criminal justice or farmers and he has succeeded in having it off and so what congress has now considering instead is extremely water down del called the first step act that really only address is like a little bit every entry in a little bit of prison can
auditions like they're no longer going to shackled pregnant women in federal prisons if this law passes and they're going to give women and tampons and tampax and stuff like okay that's good but
really getting all thousands of people out of prison it is small change and that some democrats seem to be basically like going for this to the dismay of groups like the sale you in the brand and center for justice and so and just watch this like to my surprise one of the new york city representatives
kim jeffries is gotten behind this bill sell some other democrats or at least stave voted out of committee i don't think cory booker has spoken out publicly on it yet he was has been one of the main proponents for on bigger criminal justice or foreign but like right now it's like chuck grassley is carrying the banner here and
an idea that you know the first step the first steps there will be future steps but it seems entirely likely that will not happen and all of this energy will get dissipated and kind of dribbled away and to quite a small bill
my chatter is a study published in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences this week and was written up in new york times which is where i thought about a research project led by andrew wilson who an archaeologist oxford
a expert at the desert research institute in reno nevada name joseph mcconnell and what they did is they got in a score from greenland so there's often
as a way of tracking climate and tracking snowfall and precipitation these huge ice cores and greenland and you can go back thousands and thousands of years to serve
debt levels of precipitation other things and they found one they found an ice core which contained ice from the entirety of the roman empire the years of the roman empire and they melted and analyze the water that came out and make a track the water to particular year and they looked at the lead levels and
water and why would you look the lead levels of lead levels in water from the roman empire correlate incredibly closely to the economic activity of the roman empire because wow that's so interesting yeah so lead is used for making pipes and also for making ships and lead is also used when you're when you're making silver coin
the way they'd mind
i guess lead lead and silver were coming you to burn let off to get a silver which you were going to use for your coin
during the great packs romano period lead levels spike in this greenland ice and then because this is all the made the atmosphere it falls as snow falls as part of snow thousands of miles away agreement and then after periods of plague or during periods of chaos and the empire that let bubbles drop precipitously so it's just a cool
cool little bit of finance and i really enjoyed it neat

about your we're we're lucky i know why i'm not a good mood
like two minutes ago we are now that's a smiling only available on a new haven
john dickerson in new york
this morning hello
oh david who i'm laying on the streets gap as president trump latest extraordinary claim that he can pardon him self and other legal shenanigans of the week then how big a deal with the masterpiece cake shop or lane from the supreme court
then could former president bill clinton please shut up
whilst we will have cocktail chatter
and before we get started a reminder that we have a live show coming up in philadelphia and why eighteenth wednesday at seven thirty pm slate dot com slash lived to get tickets to the keswick theater in clan side were hoping to have a really great guest which i thought you could announce today
but we don't
yesterday announced but hopefully
so but i'm guarantee they'll be a great guest come and join us in philly on we love to see the like dot com slash live for tickets present trump who loves nothing so much as the imperial powers
the presidency has he asserted several emphatically this week
and in early two thousand and eighteen letter to robert moeller the president lawyers had asserted that he could not obstruct justice because essentially he is justice that since he supervises the department of justice
he has absolute unitary power to start and stop any investigation for any reason and therefore you could possibly obstruct any investigation
later on twitter he asserted with supreme confidence that he has the right to pardon himself and constitutional scholars agree with this this occurred against the backdrop of other interesting developments
the mall or asking and paul man fourth bail to be
i wasn't exactly sure what he's asking to his house to address house arrest to contain yeah because because metaphor
is accused of tampering with witnesses against him and also against the backdrop of the president pardon mean the next to sousa and handy it other person's of celebrities convicted of crimes similar to those muller's investigating
so let's start with the the to astonishing claims about the power of the president that the president made what is the consensus about how true claims are does the president have those powers is is does the president have absolute power of all department of justice investigations and must can out of struck them and does he have the power to pardon himself the consent
we don't know the answer that these are unsettled questions anti american line the formal sense the supreme court has resolve them i think we all thought that we knew the answer is politically that a president would not dare to even broach the topic of doing such things that because it presents the president as being
above the law and that no president would want to put him in south in the political position of courting this question at least since watergate and we didn't have to worry about it the now of course it's front and center and i think what we're seeing is chump quite successfully controlling or at least trying to
controlled the terms of the debate
making the question about what is legal and what is like clearly the law versus what his behavior obviously should be under any set of no arms that we would want to live by
one of the more amazing developments and my mind was later in the week paul ryan said that he didn't believe in these allegations that trumps been reading about that the f b i spied on his campaign
and both he and mcconnell have taken the position that obviously the president wouldn't department himself as this way of like pretending there isn't a real controversy but anyway what amazed me and so ryan i think was showing a little stein and then not gets freshman republican congressmen immediately when
on fox and excoriated ryan and talked about removing him from the leadership and so there's an argument going on within the republican party about whether the party stands for trump pure trump or for rule of law principles that are broader than that and it's pretty astonishing that that would be there are
monster i i think
new
trying to separate those two things because i think you can tell me if i'm crazy about this but
the debate about the unitary executive has at least some
scholarly adherents they people may argue that they're right or wrong but there is there is this theory and jay secular has been offering that series since the nanosecond the whole me saying coming question and the and the debate over what was center wasn't settlement fourteen to february in the oval office the media i came out secular
was pointing to this notion of the unitary executive and the fact that the president can find her anybody wants to is to getting something within the executive branch because he's the executive sense that the the idea and not that fat right right
use it has some again you mean i agree with that it has some group of adherence who have law degrees and read the constitution away when i think is important event with paul ryan said about this
what the president's calling a spine other we were going on the phone and but which seems to be a complete fabrication
is not only has ronan seen some of the information the president has not been ryan is part of the gang of aid was given access tray gowdy saw this information from behind and both said there that what the president asserted again because it hadn't looked at it he was just basing it on
well who knows what he's basing home but he was not basing it on the fact assorted something that that is that is untrue and so ryan has said this isn't true tree ghandi
you know who determine the government oversight committee has said that not only use their own no evidence of what the president was claiming but that in his estimation with the f b i was doing with respect to this specific informant was looking into whether the russians had tried to meddle in the election which turned out he said on cbs this morning
was in fact doing exactly would present and trump had supposedly said he wanted when anyone that his conversations with james call me which is that he wanted if there was any evidence of anybody doing anything in his campaign with respect to the russians he wanted it investigated mcconnell looked at the same information and said he had full faith in muller's investigation
this is three leaders on the republican side in congress all saying that this assertion the president is totally untrue didn't richard bear throw and his allow them to their
i hadn't seen that but that seems consistent with his behavior so on one and you have a debatable point on the other you have been uncovered as a fiction a fiction brought into the consciousness not by anybody other than the president now that's been knocked down by three or four big leaders that's a big deal so back to the quest
the unitary executive emily is it in the star case with clinton was it he couldn't assert this even if you wanted to because star was appointed by the judicial branch based on a legislative piece of legislation night so you so he was outside the executive is that why clinton could never have claimed this guess it is true
that at the time of the star appointment we had the special counsel act which came out of watergate which created a three judge panel on that appointed special councils and so they were still kind of partly in the executive branch in the justice department that they kind of had one foot out of it on there
all these questions about whether that arrangement was constitutional on this arrangement was the one we've devolved to after members of congress past administrations got tired of special councils and started seeing them as like these creatures run amok who were just causing a lot of distraction so mahler is
both feet planted in the executive branch and the justice department and yes that is why this theory that of the unitary executive by which i think you mean that the president because he can hire and fire everyone in the executive branch he controls everything that's where it comes around the problem with trumps a theory of i can do whatever i
i want is that it assumes he can do whatever he wants no matter what his intentions and so you're seeing that kind of dismissal of all the parts of the statute that talk about corrupt and ten like if you're trying to block and investigation of your own campaign of your own family members of yourself that's not a reason we would want you to be exercising this
hire and fire authority and there is certainly attention now it's really hard for me to believe that
the supreme court would come down on the side of the giuliani hypothetical trump can shoot james me and he has to be impeached by congress before he can be indicted
it's so i thought usefully and clarifying really extreme there's just something wrong with that we shouldn't want that to be the answer that a political consequences of impeachment has to come before any kind of criminal consequences for an obvious crime
do some go to will continue to believe believers through fundamental crisis in american politics which is that you have a congress
which has extraordinary powers to investigate and pursue and punish members of the executive branch who misbehave including the president and members of the additional brains because impeachment as available as this
method of control and investigation and monitoring and that congress has simply abdicated responsibility and then in that into that vacuum comes a president who's like yeah well i can do what i want but in any normal system you would have a congress which would say you can try it and we're going to impeach it right
or were they would threaten to and that will be restrained somebody
inflation ryan and mcconnell and change county and
presumably hopeless going to happen that speak with that they did enough in that direction to constrain champ but it's not at all clear and one of the reasons it's not at all clear is that there are lots of other members of the party not to mention fox news where this all just is seen through this lens of know
release mart packaging of with china no collusion and mean we have sean hannity on tv telling witnesses to go chopped their phones up into little pieces so that mahler can't get the content and stare of i mean there's just something kind of crazy going on about seeing the mahler investigation
in such a partisan lands that you don't want to know what the answer is did you that i see david clarke wrote a piece and another john's this speak it was sort of like the atoms are peace that's kind of overall framing that at least i liked that we talked about earlier and he was just pointing out that on the side of the investigation is this lake cacophony of reporting
he caught and i think of fuselage which is a good metaphor were predictable which peace we find out when we're are constantly trying to keep all the strings together he had this great metaphor that it's like i'm carrie mathison wall and homeland but like gone crazy and i feel that way about the details of this investigation
on the other hand you just have trump everyday saying witch hunt
that's all you need to know and i think there is a way in which that narrative is just eroding some american state and the investigation in the f b i etc and if you're a term partners and that's all fine with you your your down for that i want to turn to the other grand claim graham legal claim
the president made the hit the road to pardon himself
which i think is nonsense but that's not the real danger in what is happening with pardon the president's been flaunting pardon power this week
in a way that american should it should make americans want to weep for two reasons one the purpose of the part of the partner generally to show mercy to correct excesses to buy upon which the president did with this one
alice johnston and conquest brought are good for kim kardashian for sure but the idea of the partners a treat for celebrities or ideologues aligned with the prisoner is disgusting
and what's more disgusting as the idea that the president is dangling the possibility apartments for all of the people associated with the mall or investigation for the metaphor and the papadopoulos zoos and all these other people
it is a way of signaling to them to say stay strong as a pure mob move that's what the mobsters do it like this signal to you if you take this of you stay silent will take care of you and me i did the person is is using the pardon power and that way is much more troubling to me than the idea that he's talking about how we could part himself which isn't saying he won't do
i totally agree with the nothing that's been interesting to me and lacking in that kind of law professor commentary on on this so there are lots of law professors who are troubled and all the way as we've been talking about and it seems like trumps actions speak for themselves in terms of corrupt intent when it looks like you know you're sending the
signals you were just talking about or your stories this week like yes i told jeff sessions that i was furious with hand because he did recuse himself and i tried to talk him out of that like all these ways in which the action suggest that chant has tried to stop and block this investigation every step of the way and then you have these of
chickens stroking i'm not sure about this yet
people jack goldsmith of harvard law school for whom i have a lot of respect he's a former bush department of justice guy super smart he was making the argument this week like well maybe the fact that it's also blatant and brazen suggests that it's not corrupt and intact like that the president is just doing this because he thinks it's a big distraction and now i have to say it was driving me crazy
week because it just seems like how could you ever pass the test of in ten without you know the literal truth of like trump handing over hillary clinton's emails to the russians like i just worry when it starts getting framed as we need the president actually committing a crime
in order to decide that there's a problem here will also isn't the and ten more relevant to the destruction and the collusion
yeah and also seems like if you have several associates doing things that are illegal for a variety of reasons that that also should be something that reflects back on the president in a way that congress would care about for impeachment proceedings and that mahler my care about to trump has been very successful at raising the bar
about what would constitute grounds for impeachment or for an indictment
i want to go to turn to one other thing john witches
in the in the fuselage of this week and the the battery of new stories and new evidence and new developments was the almost passed over fact that the president's team no came to have admitted that he wrote the statement that dumb trump junior made following
the trump tower meeting with russians peddling dirt about hillary clinton and and this is something that had been denied vehemently by all parties to to to trump team all his supporters all who's spokespeople i think even his lawyers
yeah totally secular jews anyone and i turn on ancient green umbrage at the suggestion exactly
so what do we do with what are we doing it like that
you know know that that was all lies
well it's a it's a great questions when i was it was when i was to circling around was also the other one about claiming that there was a spy inside the campaign put there by the obama administration is also not true which also which which arguably is a more corrosive untruth because it affects the department of justice
it affects the behind this is the official word coming from the president's lawyer and the official word by the way the president's loner and his spokesperson who spoke with the authority and either implicit and explicit authority of having talk to the president i don't know i don't know what you do but it is worth sometimes stopping and taking a look
the dangers that everybody become so used to this that that's no longer shocking it should be really shocking and i founded clarifying and and conversation i had with some with newt gingrich this week to go back begin with you by the way says the idea of self partying use some is not a good idea and doesn't think he suggests
he didn't think it was possible even but when you go man can look at what he said in nineteen ninety eight to all of the various claims that the clinton team was trying to make to block secret service people from testifying of the things they were trying to do basically gingrich said there to principles i'm prepared to live and die on the first is that the american people have the right to know
no about basic facts and the second is that we're a nation of the rule of law and new person including the president is above the law
and that seems to me to be the basic question hear about this investigation is that the president you can you can come up with all kinds of hand waving and exciting readings of the constitution but the bottom the bottom line is use the president the law and do we know the facts and when the when the white house and the people employed
the president are actively saying things to push people away from the fans and to diminish the it's already have federal officials that's a that's a big problem what would you think
ask you to speak for the current true you host or
but i guess there's a question about whether the tv shows and radio shows that have trump administration official on administration officials who have a history of peddling lies whether they should stop having them on and i don't i'm not sure there's a good answer to that either but
it is to me troubling that that so easy for top level trump administration official to get on and to spew enough lies and cause to so enough confusion
that that people interviewing them can they can do remember every single furniture mean i have sounded very useful to have tray gatti on and newt gingrich in order to use people who are not considered fans of the left to
shape what is an agreed set of facts or at least bring them back closer to reality then from what we're we're hearing from the president of the united states on some of these issues
asking the vice president about anybody who had contacts with the russians getting him on the record and having video of the vice president saying there were no interactions with anybody in the administration and the russians is a useful piece of video tape to have in these debates i don't think not having them on at all
good idea i think you have to refresh and put on the record things that people say not taking what they say at face value after a pattern of this
one just has to keep that in the forefront of people's minds i'm not sure that completely banning people from television it's the right where you know why i've been thinking about is the way in which we we give the president and his people we give the government the benefit of the gap time at you and yet increasingly that thing is not too
true and that benefit of the doubt mean spreading lies inadvertently and i don't think the press has a way to respond to that i mean the that you were just saying like it has to be true rain and but it relies on a marketplace of ideas theory of that information that you put true information out there and then that competes with the false information
when end but i don't think we live in that universe necessarily right now at least not for a significant segment of the american public and i don't know how the press is supposed to adjust to that like how the press comes into the way it has breathing room with the assumption that it is being lied to and then proceed
seeds from now assumption like how would that possibly why will i mean i don't who
anytime you walk into the white house briefing room maybe lied is too strong word but i mean it's obviously you you're always going to get spin but
obviously this is something much different that we're living in the world we're living in now
i think i've noticed a contractual as ocean of official comments certainly old since the beginning of this administration
we don't just allow statements to go out without putting them in the proper context or noting that there's either contradiction by official sources or no evidence for the claim but i think also part of it is you know
press has an eighteen percent approval rating impart and non non did that was that was the case before donald trump was president and in part it's because of a lot of behavior that the engaged in and over the years
hi being stories that don't deserve the hype and making broad claims that don't will stand the scrutiny so there are contributory parts of those that
our fault for as well
one my thing that us thing i
this is unrelated i carry this scott pruitt just amazing array of stories of like were little daddy corruption just like junk and yet the manifesto an office i mean like three scarecrow it cycles ago i think david you asked to predict like what do you remain and i thought
okay health l survive that particular cycle but the next one you have begun no no no it seems like it does not matter what story is published about got through it he just remains there and that we're not even talking about it it's not even one of referee topics are rude or we should note that at least one interesting development on the proof
friends is the joni ernst the iowa republican senator and this had a little bit to do with of ethanol subsidies and i will but never never mind that joni ernst said that prove it was as swampy as it gets talking talking about in she said
yet he remains at me head
but but isn't that right so let's we should come up with the fast sorting technique which is one yeah that is amazing especially for a president who who's arguably signature campaign issue was draining the swamp so there's there's the acknowledgment and then there is the what we recognise last time we talked about
those which is that because he pursues a certain set of policies that the president prefers and the many of the president submerge prefers that's why he's not in many political danger so that's that's the answer i just don't get it they like approved the deputy guy like weeks ago was go that i can to step in and he'll just keep doing soldiering on

mastery of cake shop emily go
mean back to the case made her that him
this is one of their highly rated cases of the tan jack that a baker in colorado did not wanna take a wedding cake for a gay couple who came in and ask for cake for their wedding
the couple complained to the colorado civil rights commission because colorado has a civil rights law preventing discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation the couple one at that stage feel that all jack philip sued and jack thirds has now emerged victorious in front of the supreme court
and yet it a decision that both sides saw something to celebrate and it was seventy two there was a lot of compromising going on the ruling itself is very fact specific to colorado in a way that disappointment a lot of conservatives so
generally injustice candy for the majority said it's absolutely clear that colorado can protect and gay people from discrimination there are a nice language and if you're and gay rights percent about how odious that far of prejudice is however a desk and he said this colorado civil rights commission to nachos
efficient respect for jack philips as religious beliefs there are few quotes from the commissioners candy pulled out he just thought they were suspicious of religion and didn't mean phelps would necessarily when below but it meant that this particular proceeding was unfair to han that's the way in which he won but sick
jazz that if you were a civil rights commission in colorado or another state with a case like this in front of you if you just said nice things about religion along the way to making a finding of discrimination that would be good enough candy certainly left the door open to that and then jeff kagan wrote a concurrence in which he
like really invaded that kind of outcome
in some ways i feel like the politics of this ruling are pretty good for the country it's not going to be a big rallying cry on either side for the mid term elections it doesn't look like a liberal supreme court is abusing religious people forcing them to do anything but on the other hand it looks fake wow
certainly wasn't a clean victory for gay couples who want service for their weddings it didn't shut the door to that either i didn't find it all that intellectually satisfying because to me in the comments that the commissioners made about religion they can't he took such umbrage about seemed like they were just saying it was bad to use your religious beliefs to hurt other people
that does seem like a bad news that religion but if you're able to look beyond that i think the majority decision has something in it for everyone and months and i have lots might have se me ha garza just concurrent but i'm going to stop talking and let you guys get a word it would like to hear what you have to say but that but i'd like to ask this question more broadly which is most every decision from
the supreme court be momentous or can they just issue
decisions and actually it turns out it's very near and small and when we should move on i'm not saying that's the case in this case i'm just in general it is the case in this case and yes there is a whole argument that this is like a good thing for the court to take a smaller role especially with an issue that is recent and just playing out i mean to me
one of the most significant senses and the kennedy opinion if he just says factually early on in two thousand and twelve when this dispute with happening between the speaker and this couple colorado had not had not yet legalized gay marriage
marriage like it's early days everybody we're all getting used to the idea the state was not even protecting this rate at that point and i think there's a language this decision just let this bubble up at the state level they're going to be lots of other cases and it's also just really important to remember that these cases only arise in states that
i have statutes that protect people from discrimination there is no federal law like that so this is only happening in places that have shown this particular kind of concern for gay rights that makes me hopeful that these these conditions are going to be able to come to conclusions that people can live with and then you know from the beginning they think one of the responses
this case has been look they're not that many merchants were refusing to sort of gay people let the markets sort of take care of this there's a counter argument which is like we didn't say that in the nineteen sixties when black people were being denied service that worse we did not let people use their religious beliefs as an excuse to continue that form of racism
and it's important for businesses as places of public accommodation to be serving everyone calls are different because i mean i think room
the
the institutional support for kind of racism was deeper for me institutional support for not supreme gay couples in particular where's the establishment of jim crow
the legal and crown nation or been was much more profound than what this now not to sit there are clearly wrong has been done to people so does this mean the two questions first of all so in states that don't have these civil rights protections for for gay people
that means you have a right to get married because married because that's a federal road but you don't have any wrote to get anyone to make you a wedding cake
or anyone to do anything provide a service for your marriage
for your way
in those other states in mississippi say yes
like you would lose this case in mississippi and there are other states
i don't know if this is true of mississippi but remember the hall like religious freedom restoration act is states were passing what are called many references these laws that has showed special solicitude for religious people who had objection so you can have the kind of reverse of colorado's laws were a baker would be
specially insulated and from having this cake and the couple that have no right to set to the other big question is the to the supreme court avoided the first amendment question to they did not get to the question of whether the baker had a right to express himself from the way that he chose and therefore to not be forced to make a cake
that would violate his his artistic desires are we going to get a case which is going to address his first amendment issue
yes i think we will i think it will take awhile at kind of percolate below justice thomas's descent is all about as he thinks this is like a straight up violation of freedom of expression of the baker and oral argument this turned into one of those like an angels dancing on the head of the pen problems for the supreme court how do you draw the line
nine the a lawyer for the baker memorably argued to the he was cake artist with protected rights of expression but a makeup artist was not a real artist and could be told by the state to provide her or his services to this couple at it just think the lines between conduct an expression don't really exist
i'm more talking about this kind of service and i don't know what the supreme court is ever going out what to do about that a baby it just is unresolved bomb because someone who relies on components regularly and i can totally screwed are distributed month to do
can i can i talk about the the concurrence work for a second you so i mean bungled essen it's like confusing but there was another case in colorado surely lake deliberately provoked in which another man his last name happens to be jack's ordered
a cake from three different bakers that was in the shape of a viable and it said things on it like homosexuality is a sin so it's like the anti gay marriage cake and those bakers refuse to bake the cake and those bakers unlike jack thoughts one in front of the colorado
civil rights commission so this comes up isn't a majority opinion as like another reason to be suspicious of this commission
justice kagan says about this different scenario and this is different than jack philips because these bakers didn't want to make this cake for anybody this was just they were objecting to the cake the the anti gay rights message of the cake not to the people
who are paying it and then justice course it says no no no this is totally equivalent because what what matters is the cake had a message to jack philips the anti gay marriage baker that was supporting gay weddings and so he wouldn't have baked is pro gay
wedding cake for anybody either and then gossage goes down this whole to me it was very tangential but it's like very ardently argued passage about levels of generality and how the colorado commissions mistakes were just and curable so unlike justice candy
i think he's basically saying if you profess religious beliefs and you don't want to do something for religious reasons you win because we're not going to be able to really interrogate whether you're religious belief is sincere and not like he takes at face value that this guy who ordered the bible cake did that for religious reasons and therefore was being discriminated against
based on the basis of his religion and then he says well you know this commission because it imputed prejudice to jack philips but not to these other bakers is has like committed this fundamental incurable flaw and like you lose forever anyway it was i thought a decision
that had real implications suggesting that course it sees this case not only in terms of not being sympathetic to gay rights but being very sympathetic to the rights of religious people there's this interesting piece of our camera who wrote it by a lawyer who has spent his career dealing with abortion and followed for row
oh and he's an abortion rate supporter
and the point he made in this piece is it's incredibly it's been incredibly deadly to abortion rights to have all these little religious exemptions in the law because they have just increased and they've gotten broader and broader and broader so it's no longer just that if you are
a doctor you can't you for religious beliefs you can decline and to perform an abortion which i think of an exemption we can all understand but it's gotten to the point where where fewer
a hospital with some religious affiliation vague religious affiliation you can decline have anything to do with any abortion and can can decline to talk to people about it
now it encompasses contraception this is creeping quality of religious exemption where that is so privileged that idea that you have religious belief it trumps every single other thing ever even the the of
taking care of someone who isn't in need and who who who seeks you're a professional advice and expertise and it's very disturbing but it has become so prevalent so i don't think we should insofar as the masterpiece decision is one the privileges
carves out yet another religious exemption or makes it clear that the your religious the your religious beliefs trump everything else i don't think we should be to gleeful know

the president is missing
many liberals wish were news report they also know may wish to do with applied to president bill clinton with all to present to begin
bill clinton's back he is now novelist he has written a novel total the present as methane with james patterson it sounds like an absolute terrible thrower
it was about a president named jonathan a link and duncan and compare the name jonathan duncan to william jefferson clinton
familiar but the president goes and some thriller adventure and their celebrity celebratory i haven't read the book i'm not going to read the book james patterson with terrible right there is a very funny review i think it minute who who's review is now completely blinking just just tears apart how poorly written the book of anyway the present is missing is made news because
be fascinating the disastrous book tour that clinton paterson are currently engaged in which involves interviews that quickly veer from the book to clinton's place in the context for me to moment
and the picture went off the rails almost immediately when recording born on the today show
last week and he really botched some questions about the lewinsky scandal and monica lewinsky it has now become a part of every interview
john was this been so bad for clint we think have been so fluent whole is so good ready to answer any question why has he been so terrible well as you get this specific case here and him and i think the most interesting piece of this to me was even called there when he had clinton on after he her
as to show appearance and kobe actually for those who want to
look at the art of question asking it was it was really well done so he first he said do you want a second shot at that so that was an open invitation to get it exactly right and what the president then said was this wasn't my finest hour he suggested nbc had condense the his response
and he said i apologize to the monica lewinsky men and i apologize to her now
he said i paid my i've paid for it over the last twenty years
just stopping there for a moment i think what this demonstrates is both a specific problem with respect to the mean to move in and also one that people attached to the past behavior of president clinton in the specific with respect to the need to moment there seems to be an inability by anybody caught up in any of its various forms to issue what sounds like an actual
apology
and so everybody knows what an apology sounds like and every time you hold something back and give a stiff apology people know it
and that's not going to pass in this moment and you know an apology is i was wrong so that's one thing i was wrong period that's where you start to suggest that any i deeply and here here apart yeah
i'm really sorry i am sorry and also by the way you don't talk about it being edited out or condensed and you don't talk about i'm going to suffer because it turns out that this is about other people suffering and you know i was wrong and i'm sorry and i caused a lot of pain that people are still feeling which i understand and i'm trying to learn from this as much as i have been over twenty years
because i recognize that this wrong is one that last more than just the moment it was in and an apology like that which people would recognize as an apology would put you in a place where people would see that you had grown and instead what people concluded was that he was basically not really sorry and
men what i think call bear his follow up was was
pretty amazing when he basically said you know you don't you don't seem and is said to bill clinton who was sitting inches away from him he said you don't seem to understand that you were asked about this but and then he called air said you are the most famous example of a powerful man sexually misbehaving and work in my lifetime
which as a questioner you want to you want to set the stakes accurately for your audience so that they can understand the context in which the interview was taken place
in clinton's answer was not didn't meet the stakes that called their had said form clinton's answer was look i'm paying
been attacked more in my career than anybody else i've given you a pound of flesh and you want to yeah
bear with very well fed
yeah i was very also
family here's the question why
george w bush with a disaster brother he brought us into wars that were catastrophic for the country
he presided over an economic collapse that kaufman the people their jobs
myth handle the katrina but derby bush you shows up anywhere people treat him with the respect
that would be treated with is honored and and respected basically by all why this bill clinton rule book written who was a more successful president but don't have this it's mark against it why does clinton inspire much more irritation them but i mean i don't think that fair
i think bush gets plenty of criticism on laughed and people are abandoned our heads five but i also think bill clinton wants to be let off the hook for his
his misdeeds because he wasn't more successful president and that is just not washing for people in this moment anymore
so two things struck me and honestly like the first just amazed me it seemed like he was totally taken aback of course he was going to get this question the notion that he didn't have a well rehearsed sincere sounding apology available to him in the moment with nbc was incredible to me
and suggest that he's living in a complete la land like this is going to happen to every man with any kind of me to baggage and bill clinton had like they have the suitcase of the mall and the second is that done that wonderful apology a descriptive for him i cannot imagine hearing it from and so i was shocked or he was unprepared and
then totally unable to imagine him coming through and that moment and it is because that clinton is both of their but you know let's focus on bill clinton because hillary clinton's issues but they're flake are left there and my view
he met his conduct like his defensive brittle well i'm the one who's been persecuted way of thinking about any criticism that hand has been one of his defining traits and that is really irritating especially when everyone else is being forced to confront the l ways in which they treated women
and to make it all their him as opposed to the fact that he has never privately apologize to monaco and ski was pathetic and so you know he has been someone i've wrestled with it like as a leader and struggled with and about done left for a long time and this is just a reminder of the worst i mean study i think liberals and
particularly liberal women feel really guilty guess they feel really don't need it they blew it the first time at the he did such wrong and they now know where the context of twenty years later the conduct of me too oh my god that was really any more modern favorite i don't know and then a fancy embark right the defence the defence they would
never amount today and that they're ashamed of and so what are they do they take it out on quinn which is that actually i don't know your formulation suggests there's something unfair going on i thought rebecca traced me and an interesting point related to that's when she said that feminists have been apologizing and accounting for themselves and going through itself scrutiny and remorse for their treatment of monaco
oh and scan excuse that bill clinton for the last twenty years at least like the last two or three years and so the notion that bill clinton himself with think that he was above having to have such an accounting was particularly and ferrying emily and if you'd like you wished the garbage with vera
yes i i wish to you would vanish and then i remember him twenty twelve dern obama reelection campaign clinton came back and gave a speech at the democratic convention new to thought man that guy has a way of framing issues and presenting political issues that it's so persuasive when he turns it on it was in credit
cool and and so every time i think i never want to hear from the sky them then recall actually he he's better than any democrat at framing the issues that they care about or was he used to be maybe you have a name or i don't know if that's a good or my i don't like presence to disappear in any way because even to the extent that they show themselves to be less
her them the heavy hugger fee or more them horrible reviews they may have when they leave the office
it gives us a more complete picture of the president and presidency and since we have this warped version of the presidency a more complete and complex picture of it is better as far as i'm concerned that of grown up answer john john this topic
john more just gravitate president and and
i think i think it's my my high horses i'm you know you guys have no simply put a foot the step stool right in front of me you've given me some guardrails to get alive

delicious
it's like a beer bloody mary
i'd like a mitchell otto was some tournaments a lotta and for tata
well what will you be countered actually before we do that
listen great listener shatters and i want to talk about one with no chatter from
we're we're inviting you and will continue to invite you to submit your shatters to us about things that you think we should chatter better things that you're going to be chattering about and by me mean three treat them at flip get them back and minnesota that we have a great tweet from wake underscore eighty one about the college board or had a conversation
my daughter about with independently
word which runs the advanced placement programs is slashing the a p world history curriculum and half so it is now removing all content from before fourteen fifty so if you're going to take world history and you're gonna learn advanced placement world history it's only going to cover essentially the renaissance on so there's no
an african islamic or muslim american history before the arrival of europeans that's unsettling i think they did it because it was tons was the curriculum is too vast it was too much to cram into an entire year but maybe they want it to tests instead yeah they didn't they did not do that
her fingers and thank you to wake underscore eighty one so send us your chatter treat us at flake out fest
emily what is your chatter
we i think correctly decided not to talk about that equals being disinvited i guess to the white house this week like the latest on dating and black athletes die president but i just loved that malcolm jenkins response he he's this incredibly committed
criminal justice or former on the eagles and instead of taking the presses questions about the whole white house like made up drama or created drama jenkins had these big pieces of wait for it that's not the right post white poster board with facts about inequities
unfairness is in the criminal justice system and as reporters were barking questions at ham he was showing then on camera the facts and these questions about mass incarceration and then every time someone continue to bleed out some question that he was not interested then he would hold up away poster board that said you're not listening it's a really great like minute and
half a video and made my celebrity crush on malcolm jenkins which was already strong even stronger
we can get an employee
the chance to meet malcolm jenkins know i got to meet him a couple months ago that so it's like actually in in person and crash wow
john what does your trailer
your celebrity crush muslim country
crucially tim howard taft
no although my celebrity crush recently is jennifer lawrence and her appearance on the late show called there
which i didn't see in the moment but it's a wide ranging interview
good chase a china is about anthony ray into who is many things to he was he served thirty years in prison for a crime he didn't commit he was on death row and his book that he's actually been selected by o'brien's her book club pick he was on the show this week and for somebody
who has served thirty years on death row wrongfully to be in his presence he he's just a shining
person no bitterness and full of forgiveness and his book is fantastic and it's not only a great story which will infuriate you it will make you enraged it will then bill due back up
sounds great but these great one liners he is kind of a born storyteller he wrote it eco wrote it with a woman named laura love harden but you when you talk to him you see what storyteller he is his imagination is so acute because for thirty years in prison he basically used his imagination to ca
instruct worlds where he could basically get through the fact that he was off in solitary confinement and that he was in prison for crime he didn't commit anyway his story about his mother about his friend lester who i won't spoil it for you it's a great book great read and he's a wonderful person it's called the sun don't shine and so i recommend it to
recommended to people and i recommend you actually watch her conversation with them because we had a home back half of the show planned and we just they just the producers and everything just blew it up and just let him keep talking and our conversation keep going so empty ran to the terms of awesome yes
by chatter speaking of x president's is about a really sweet little video i saw the week on dead spin dave mckenna an old friend of mine
i think is a good writer and used to be my colleague you to wash them city paper he's just as wonderful sweets fascinating sportswriter lovely regard he does videos for goods been in several years ago back in two thousand twelve its mother died after terrible illness
he was heartbroken
he was working one day and a coffee shop in washington we just gotten back to was just gone back to work after his mother's funeral and was just kind of recovery unit and sitting there and sitting there with five other people in coffee shop
secret service guy comes in and sort of sweeps the room and says i have to check everyone's bag because the president's coming though it coffee shops like what's going on
human fighter the president shows up and walks over to dave who has been pointed out to him and spends a minute consoling him and same i've asked my mother and i know what it's like him
your tell you it will get better and was this moment of consolation for dave and had all been needed because jay carney who is i guess builds them obama has press secretary or communications director something was a very close friend of mckenna must have been talking about him to the president the president decided
because it was coming by was it was going to be in the neighborhood where date lives he was just going to drop by and say a few compelling words and it's it's a wonderful little story and dave tells it beautifully and with great emotion so i was looking at this video on dead spin by dave mckenna

anyway emily your bet it's nice to see you back
you you guys are both in aspen at the if that's
on this week's gab hoof what news what a week news justice can be retires and the supreme court delivers sweeping victory is to conservatives on every legal battle field and probably a bunch of others me even forgot but especially on the travel ban then a democratic socialist stamps
a top ranking and still quite liberal democrat and a primary does this indicate that progressives are headed for domination of the democratic party then civility
incivility anything is it worth fighting for what it's it let's use our best
plus cocktail copycat or incivility mode you just to add rate toward it i'm so civil that's not really i'm in favor of civility and yet i'm not a particularly civil person it's ironic or something
maybe contradictory paradoxical
but before we get to the meat of the show remember we have a live show philadelphia we are coming out you philadelphia weird can do a live show wednesday july eighteenth at the keswick theater and england side pennsylvania just outside of the city of brotherly love at seven thirty pm slate dot com slash live for tickets please join us
and there will obviously a lot of news that will be a lot of stuff to discuss and it'll be fun to do with you there so it's like dot com slash lived it tickets to join us on july eighteenth that because wick theater
a monumental week at the supreme court triumphed after trying for conservatives culminating with the sweetest victory of all the retirement of swing justice anthony kennedy
essentially guaranteeing has a replacement by justice almost certain to be more conservative
so the court ruled in favor of the trump administration and of conservatives in the travel ban case in the public sector union case and the texas gerrymandered case the crisis pregnancy case they all five four decisions with that usual split right yeah so emulate this is
you you are not appearing on seventeen different television and radio shows right now so that you can be with us so who is more inclined to be you at the ah yes okay so what does candies resignation mean for the court is roe v wade dead
candies resignation is just a huge thunder clap of an event for the supreme court it probably means the supreme court as been delayed will transform candy has been the swing justice for twelve years since their attire man sandra day o'connor and in occupying that santa role he moved the court
the right from where it was before but he didn't move it always to the right and you didn't lose giant steps to the right and his exceptions happened to be causes that liberals deeply cherish so can he will be remembered as the champion of gay rights in a way that was deeply important to civil rights
and you know progress says in the country he also protected the right to abortion into really important ways he was part of this compromise with connor and pharma justice david souter and ninety ninety two when it he had the vote either overturn roe or are fundamentally change he didn't
i opted to protect its core and then in two thousand and sixteen there was a big case with what's called whole ems how fucking set of texas where lots of state restrictions were purporting to protect women's health and kennedy joined the majority in seeing through that and seeing that the notion that closing clinics helps women and protects their health is
or text her house is just not that has no factual basis so he has stood there is a bowler in that area and then his other really important progress as set of moves have been in the area of criminal defense where he helped and the death penalty for people who commit crimes as juveniles and for people are intellectually disabled
old and there were other opinions to recently he called into question the constitutionality of prolonged solitary confinement and ted importantly ruled against california in a case about their terrible overcrowded present conditions so there were these set of concerns he had that mattered a great deal to the left and me
made him seem like a kind of pays the phrase guardian angel and i was reading about this yesterday i mean he was super fickle guardian angel because most of the time he delivered the kinds of fifth votes that we saw this week you know where we're talking about the electoral process by to make the vote harder or easier
to access kennedy sided with the conservatives consistently for example in helping to got the key part of the voting rights act a few years ago in gerrymandering case that was a racial gerrymandering case out of texas but he is there's just no question that a trump aplenty will be
more reliably consistently conservative than he will be and so guess roe vs wade in the right to abortion is on the line
it could change in a couple ways the court could outweigh overrule row or perhaps more cleverly and more and that kind of candy style of chief justice john roberts it could just whittle away at row and got it in a way that may be wed create last of a political backlash but we are in for a real sea change and american lives
going to be a roller coaster ride when this new justice get appointed and of course that means we're going to have a huge fight over this nomination so maybe john
that rollercoaster ride implies it goes and more than one direction and that this is just going down this is the down part or the apart and and i mean maybe i should say like from my point of view it's going to be a very rough rough ride to watch to live john looks actually talk a little bit about the political machinations here so
famously in probably the most successful political game but if our lifetimes mitch mcconnell kept that seat the new course which occupies open he refused to allow and in here in three refused to allow a senate vote and twenty sixteen to be election and to happen now there's an election coming in only one hundred and thirty two days there were two hundred and sixty seven
days when scully clear dud there's no chance that mitch mcconnell is going to delay vote in this case is there is anything the democrats can do to stop or slow were in vegas
meant have a supreme court
justice the donald trump wants i think the short answer for democrats at the moment is there's not there's not much they can do other than to deny unanimous consent for anything to go forward in the senate
what you mean shuddering every i mean they would think that's the
that's the like burning the ships move i mean i'm not that maybe that's not mean that said that would be like you have the center would have to just stop functioning period
i can relate do i not well i mean you but then the senate couldn't they couldn't do anything in the senate ever so what needs to be done well now and november
i'm seeing well i guess he needs to be down and doing well i guess what needs to be done as your guide and tidy hide camp and john tester and claire mccaskill all running in states where democrats think they have a chance to hold those seeds and then electorates earl or more conservatism they would be and that electorate would probably not take kindly to show
down the senate completely the benefit you would get from rallying democrats by taking such a move would in those red or states the nine that are red states where trump one it probably would backfire on those candidates and you probably have been some really camp put would bold and then then the story would be
democratic and fighting i just i don't think it would be politically it's not politically viable and also they do want some stuff that they you know the democratic senators and particular on things like appropriations bills and things like that i do want things that are a part of the normal quote unquote functioning of the senate but also let's assume they decided
to deny unanimous consent and they were able to delay thing such that nothing was able to happen that presumes that the senate composition would change and twenty seventeen enough the democrats controlled at which they don't do they think that's going to happen
they don't think they're going to control the senate and twenty and twenty nine thousand and two the
not not anybody who's i mean
it's like one hundred one shot because they'd not only have to hold all their seats they'd have to then beat hell are in nevada he looked vulnerable and the balls
maybe i mean i'm just i'd also right so you bet you'd you'd have to you'd have to run the table and we should note that this now any republican who is needs to be encouraged to turn out this is a turn out mechanism for republicans if the seed is not dealt with before the actual
election if it is dealt with before the election it still is a tidy reminder to republicans many of whom voted for donald trump
only for this reason that he could name people to the supreme court that he has a shot to name people to the supreme court in perhaps to other instances of ruth bader ginsburg or just as briar retire so he'll need the senate to confirm that and they'll need a majority in the senate for those years twenty nine thousand and twenty twenty and so would even further lock in
conservatives control of the senate republicans will turn out in strong numbers if they follow the behavior that they followed in twenty sixteen where they had doubts about the presidential nominee of their party but they overcame those doubts for the purposes of gaining control the supreme court that bad paid off for them is paying off quite handsomely and it would seem to help of have
either way an offense that democrats have already been energized and so now this is the kind of issue that traditionally republicans have been more energized about that's a really yeah that's a really great i mean i i would hope that democrats would get energized night
whether they do or not they were already like you know kind of i guess i'm not sure i necessarily agree with you about that emily in the sense that if if i think if there's no justice confirmed by election day that's a huge turnout mechanism for republican than almost certainly help them in the election particularly in bread or states and hide
can't race or and claire mccaskill race but if there isn't a very conservative justices who is put on the court in the next month and it's perceived to have been jammed through yes democrats already motivated but they can bet it will become even more motivated i think that will surely surely be helpful
yeah i think that's right i think that's right i'm going in and then so i don't know how we'd play this out but given that it's likely to go through how then if you're chuck schumer and the democrats do you play this politically in a way that kind of allows this to move through the bloodstream and even other words there isn't a fight if you know you're going to lose have no fight now
i'm actually to have because of their main thing obviously that lava them my fiance i mean i'm not sure about shutting down the santa be agnostic about that but if they don't put up a fight their base is gonna be this is the supreme court here
yeah yeah
generation
emulate let's go back to kennedy for a little bit what real practical difference you think his retirement
make them
certainly on abortion rates it's a huge shift because undoubtedly whoever comes in will be much more opposed to abortion rights and then can do it but on the other issues i mean he's been very conservative on almost everything else so is it is his last going to make that much of a difference because he's basically a very conservative on
on most of the other kinds of issues that matter
so two things it matters a lot what the reasoning is behind votes not for the outcome in that particular case after what happens next and candy was a mediating kind of slow like a simmer he was not someone who like to make everything happened rapidly
and mike turn up the water
fall boil immediately in the way that you know justice scalia famously was he was an incremental este and so there are ways in which behind the scenes he tempered that kinds of rationale is that the conservatives used for their five to four votes so for example he did though to uphold these
racially j mandarin redistricting maps and texas this week but when neil gossage and justice thomas wanted to argue that the voting rights act doesn't apply at all in redistricting which would that's like a question was originally sell in nineteen sixty eight the court has assumed the voting rights
act matters to redistricting for all those fifty years and there's a whole body of law and if we just decided that if the court just decides that is now no longer the case that's like a huge seismic shift in law instead of just like a decision against the plaintiffs in this one case that a different majority of the supreme court could easily move away
from so that's the first thing that i think matters deeply and the second is the abortion part of this if you care about that issue is a big deal i mean i wonder what you guys think of their staff to then and mr
wu i'm i see was saying this on the radio when i was on the radio with them on wednesday
you can easily they were arguing that you know between twenty and twenty four states are going to outlaw abortion because what was standing between them and having that outcome was the presidents of justice candy the knowledge that a district court would stop that law from going into effect because the supreme court would strike down and now that is gone
on and so you know jeff an alley were arguing that like within a year and a half or two years we're going to have a country where there are huge swath of the country where there are no abortion clinics and women have to travel vast distances to have access to abortion now you know because roe vs wade has been such a divisive issue for so long
aung i guess you could are that may be you know that kind of traveling and that kind of lack of access well either galvanized people politically in a different way or he'll this breach in the country but on the other hand i mean at least to me i just don't know how women are supposed to live in this is
society without a right to end their pregnancies and still be free human beings on the planet like i wish i could come up with that idea but i can't and so that part of it alone
seems worth really thinking through and i wonder what you think about the politics at that like are in those states that now have that freedom to make this move in those legislators how many of them will it really be politically popular to ban abortion i mean certainly there like a whole bunch i wonder what the camera end up mean just to
john before you enter just one data point which is something i learned is it was doing the research is that they're eighteen states that have automatic triggers such that if the supreme court
overturn roe abortions automatically outlawed most students so there won't even be any process it will just happen so so that's eighteen states that we already know if the supreme court expensively will bar abortion so couple things one just to your question earlier day that i was struck by the number that
and then tell me it's is right that of the thirteen cases in which there were five four decisions kennedy voted with the conservatives in all thirteen that's you're talking about this turned his term just it is a very funny moment for liberals tomorrow can into he delivered nothing for them this time and you know to me the most important things the supreme court is doing
the cases that affect the electoral process and the chances that we are going to have a free and fair vote and on all of those cases and not just in this term he voted with conservatives and this year he had you know teed up with great fanfare back in two thousand and four a challenge to partisan gerrymandering he looked like he was just waiting for
for some social scientists to come up with a valid measure are so that he could intervene and stop both parties from redistricting in a way that turns like of partisan advantage into an extreme sport then faced with these cases from wisconsin in maryland which we're well positioned for a big decision he totally hunted and
there's just no question that his replacement is going to close the door and a partisan gerrymandering challenges i think so to your question day that i don't know what the answer of had to it is i mean you just put those factor most interesting fact on the table which is those automatic mechanism
if local effort start to feel like an overplaying of the hand settled if what a lot of people for a lot of people the fact that abortion is not talked about all the time it's kind of they don't want to look at they don't want to have to deal with it
the mechanism that forces them to deal with it
comes from they may they may not like that it's coming from the conservative side so and if it feels like a general overreach that attaches to the court to president trump you could see a way in which it motivates liberal voters but i think they're going to be motivated more by the president at them i just don't understand
and i mean emily
you can speak was better than i can
we live in a world in a country where increasingly it is incredibly difficult for women to get access to birth control that at every turn someone is trying to prevent them from doing it the pharmacist is declined to fill the prescription the employer same they have religious objection to it sure won't cover it and now it's
the constraint on abortion but country on abortion drugs
do want an abortion been delayed having to sit through some nonsense lies about the effects of abortion on you i don't know hey i don't know why women who have to consider the possibility of childbirth of child bearing either because they want to do it or they don't want to do it why they're not enraged and every single one of them isn't voting on this issue
it's insane to me well i mean some women are in waves there are a lot of women who think abortionists and fall and they don't support access to it and sometimes when they're confronted with you know pregnancy and unplanned pregnancy and their own lives our family as they change their mind and sometimes they don't so you know i don't think
our united on this front at all i also think that they report
not just abortion or me and since birth control
yeah make a borderline illegal but let me have birth control so that i don't have to get pregnant
right and if the people who i mean there there is almost no space to stand and in this country where people say i believe in outlying restricting abortion but i want to make the most effective forms of long acting contraception as available as possible like please yes let's make it really easy and cheap for everybody to get i d's and
long acting get know that consistency doesn't exist i mean look you're right
women sexual freedom is on the line and there are ways in which the trumpet administration has been nibbling away at it in terms of reducing funding for planned parenthood the non abortion work planned parenthood does and also you're also right about contraception becoming harder to get are harder to pay for
maybe this will produce a kind of groundswell of women more women seeing that you know it's our lives that we need to be thinking about in voting on but i think it's complicated i think people's ideas about all of these issues get baked into their more tribal identities and
the women who are supporting president champ the like he is in battle they feel like he's their guy of their culturally alienated from a lot of the people on the pro choice side of the equation and i i don't know i mean in my change people who you know the kind of the people who stay home might feel like this is really a reason
to go vote i just wish i wasn't so worried about the ways in which we're making it harder for them to your point about the cultural emotion from the people who were on the pro choice ah it is a very is a really astute one and one the applause more broadly to probably something we'll get to and civility conversation but as the sense of the trump team being
embattled and
the argument that the culturally powerful figures who are on the side of trump create a rallying effect and so that's a larger version of what you're talking about on this specific as you can we just tally for a moment
oh the possibility here on the court and what it could mean depending on the way in which the twenty two thousand election rolls out and we'll get to the more in the twentieth team conversation but just if you think that the president will get his nominee would confirm which seems likely then he will his name twenty percent of the court the court will be a locked in conservative
the court that the president who sees and who came into the office with with his own theories about executive power that were beyond you know arguably any other president then the modern era who continues to get even more expansive it is feeling about what he should be able to do as president and who has
utterly transformed his party and the leaders in congress to be in accordance with what he's doing and not fulfill other their their traditional role or their constitutional role but who are really foursquare behind him use a president who has unity and power of a kind we haven't seen you know i think he's certainly about to johnson but i mean
johnson's democratic party johnson was making more deals with republicans them mean in some cases he had a split democratic party that he had to massage and deal with and handle there is no split like that in the republican ranks of any consequence for president trump so this is really a potential for an extraordinary historical consolidation for the president if his
his republicans retain control of the house and the senate
john just to continue on the team i do think there's a way in which the council vocation of the court as a conservative institution it's been seen it has very strong approval rating than it's been seen as a fairly neutral orbit or even though it's been fairly conservative for a long time but it's been seeing largely because it can do is presidents and so as a counterweight to a lot of what
people see if the excesses of both left and right and i i do worry that the congregation of the court as a conservative institution is going to be pretty damaging can people sense of democracy is a hold on the left that people are to be very skeptical because you have this incredibly expensive executive you have a totally super
and congress that will not do anything and then court which is a from mean that which the president and that which conservatives want to do and that could be quite disillusioning so i worried about that and that leads to the first of my last two questions which is one of the things that here democrats talking about now and i don't quite understand it because i thought this was
the new deal failure and it was illegal is expanding the size of the court so that it's clear the democrats cannot overturn the conservative majority by bit unusual me and because unless they can they can force justice thomas to retire with a democratic president they're not going to be able to do it so there's discussion about making it a bigger court is that right
realistic
how does that happen they just could put more people on the same way yeah
the hamish doesn't well the constitution doesn't specify the number of justices i mean even to be a hugely out of order
yeah that's i mean
the theory but other than having a magic wand know that is what mitch mcconnell dead i mean you think of it as a counterpoint you think of it is like mitch mcconnell broke all norms played constitutional hardball by refusing to give mark ireland to hear and the only way to attain to restore balance on the card is to add some new just know i guess
that but that requires retaining control getting diaz said if it's like slow but okay
because the ashes
as if you have the presidency in the senate is it a trivial thing a trivial thing when it's highly and trivial do you mean if it's possible is it possible as it just going either be pressure just a matter of that i nominate are temp supreme court justice emily basil on our eleventh i guess i'll join you in i lifeboat
i don't see what the legal barrier is to it and maybe there is one that was put in place after after hours car packing but there's no constitutional amendment that specifies a number of justices so i don't think so i think we're just talking about deeply embedded norms and expectations and politics and look this in itself this conversation being
live is a kind of check and restraint on the court because chief justice roberts wow
his while a far more conservative figure than justice kennedy cares about the image of the court he does not want his legacy to be the car going down in flames and becoming this holy partisan institution and so what he is going to try very hard to do when he gets his reliable fifth though is to write the kinds of it
onions that do a lot of change without seeming to do a lot of change so i don't think that roe vs wade will be directly overturned i don't think those triggering mechanisms in those eighteen states will go into place i think he will open the door for states to pass laws that effectively
close down clinics and and eliminate the right back row has preserved but i don't think it will be the kind of direct acts of aggression that would put the court so out of sync with the country that you end up with something like car packing i think as a political possible political cudgel out there the idea that is if you lose the center them
and democrats when the down guys when the senate and the presidency which you know that's a lot of hurdles you going to clear it seems like it's soothing it's a message to the court that you just articulated but then it's also it's some reason to hope for democrats
and organize and rally and all of that to turn out in these elections in the interim because the promise of it is whether it would be possible or not is not just elect a bunch of the senate democrats and and the dominican president then hope conservative satire it's actually do something affirmative and do something so that as a just a purely pull
medical turn out mechanism even if you believe that could never work it's more energizing then well let's get everybody in place and then just hope a conservative retires emily
very quickly last question is we haven't talked about some of the substantive huge substantive cases travel ban case with a big deal and i think a lot of people including me were struck by the contrast between the masterpiece cake shop decision and the travel ban decision were in the one case in the masterpiece catch up the court found that the comments of a single person on the civil rights commission color
oh so poison the well that this baker
baker victim of religious prejudice and then the other hand they found that the president's repeated absolutely clear crystal clear targeted comments about muslims did not poison the well when it came to the policy about who to restrict coming into the country so
contradiction get reckons old or didn't they did not i am not going into a square those things i do think that was deeply problematic as just a set of my are pointed out in our in my view enormously effective descent and the taliban case the travel ban case is the beginning of what you are laying out a few minutes ago it's cord not standing up to a
dan who put on the record his anti muslim prejudice and not protecting people for that reason now there were a lot of high minded sounding legal rationales for that all available and chief justice roberts majority opinion and we're talking about the area of immigration law and issuing visas that there's
no question presidents have a lot of power that's how congress designed it when they pass the immigrant and immigration and nationality act so in that context on in terms of the pure underlying power of the executive roberts was on strong footing the problem was that in order to stay there he had to be only
at the taxed of this third version of the travel ban instead of considering all of the presidential rhetoric that had gone into ed beforehand and afterward right i mean president chomp as set of my are pointed out had many opportunities to take back what he said and he never has so
that was what the conservative majority went for they held their nose candy was part of that decision both he and roberts basically said without naming trump it will be nicer if the president shut up and stopped expressing this like a horrifying religious prejudice but we're not gonna do anything
about it and so the beginning of a court that is willing to go along with the president of its party
who is a certainly out of step with many of us think our core constitutional values even roberts and kennedy deciding that they were powerless particularly justice kennedy who's been such a judicial supreme supremacist in other contexts there's there's something hard to take about that part of the decision who will

a battle his regime blue america between teal and navy sky blue and the deep deep blue of the ocean this week
the candidate who is so blue that she has red had her night on tuesday night progresses head maybe their biggest victory in in this campaign a democratic socialist twenty eight year old alexandria cause a cortez i never heard her name spoken so i hope it pronounce it correctly a leftist outsider defeat
added ten term incumbent in queens and queens and bronx district joke crowley he was also the chairman of the house democratic caucus that made him the fourth ranking democrat in the house it was it's a very safe district so the of cortez will be elected to congress she will be the youngest woman ever elected to congress certainly the youngest latina woman but there's something about her
a bartender a waitress recently a bernie sanders volunteer and just was galvanize to to run in this district and crowley who was at fifty six with the youngster in the house democratic leadership of
progressives also had a good night elsewhere been jealous former head of the and double a c p
one the democratic nomination forgotten or in maryland other that will be a tough race to win there's a very popular republican governor
so john why did cause the of cortez who is a novice who was quite young running against a very respected and quite liberal member of congress why did she win
well i'll give you what what appears to be the case and i don't want to pretend that i was covering this racers one of the nothing you hated more when you are covering races like this then somebody who wasn't covering her face opining about it
kidding but it appears to be what happened is that she had combination of things one crowley was this is a plus twenty nine district democratic district i think it's as democratic a district as maxine waters as district crowley's started as a part of the older democratic machine irish paul
all active in the district in a way that kind of old time new york politicians were so when people have said well he kind of fell asleep didn't see this coming
i think that that's clearly part of it there was a there was a debate in which he didn't attend she used ease and a surrogate she use that to say he wasn't awake he wasn't participating but he was not that he was active in new york politics and active in his raised interest as money in his district yeah
and so anyway but she was she was local
of the district connected to
that portion of the electorate that she could energize she wasn't just sort of an are is east and she was she's very good and very compelling and makes a very strong case for her policies she's coming out of the district which when crowley started was not minority majority and now is redrawn the lions and twenty antagonists and since first
contested primaries yeah i that's and first contested primaries in a year maybe yeah so she was a great fit with the district the district was a very liberal district and you know to be a white establishment male is not the thing you want to be in democratic politics right now
oh and she was very effective in using that against him
and then i guess we can address the question of whether this means what this means outside of the actual district
but you know she was a good politician and ran a good race to emulate key good run as a democratic socialist she ran for on medicare for all abolishing i think a federal job guarantee maybe free college and i think it's a classic case of were running as a really strong progressive make sense because it's a safe distracting
they're going to win it do you think that these issue the issue she represents in particular read medicare for all
more expansive jobs guarantee from the federal government or those actually winning issues
he had such a good question so that job scanty i find really interesting i mean it's tied up in conversations about raising the minimum wage and expanding the earned income tax cut it in a fact i'm agnostic about which of or how many of those levers to paul how but the notion of addressing inequality and that problem of stagnant wages which we still
have even know we have such low unemployment that all seemed super compelling to me i really wonder about medicare for all as the hell to die on for democrats and here's why
there are other ways of addressing the problems with our healthcare system that seem more incremental and thus less scary to me the medicaid option seems like a really obvious thing to try where you know a lot of the complaints from obama care people who have insurance they get through health care
exchange has made possible by obama care complain about their high premiums their high payments you look over at medicaid you see you know much lower are nonexistent copayments and you know a smaller network of care providers it's not fancy health insurance but it covers the basics and so i wonder
would be smarter for democrats
to be pushing that less exciting that more feasible alternative
unless i was sweet us to say less expensive alternative because i've never heard a good explanation of exactly how we're supposed to pay for medicare for all given our current healthcare costs i mean if we want to figure out how to like really really bend the cost curve and the way that other countries you know in europe and canada have and spend much less of our resources on healthcare than like fine
but in a world of you know exorbitant american health care costs i really wonder so anyway that's my two cents about that and i also feel a certain sense of like to read about having the next election cycles be all about health care policy again it's just not my thing but this is setting up a really interesting debate inside the democratic party
it goes something like this which is if you look at the seventh district of texas where the democratic establishment back to the more quote unquote moderate candidate over more moser overlord moser who is the sort of sanders type canada and all the the distinctions were pretty thin but most was of medicare for all floods lizzie fletcher was not least fletcher one democrats backed her
the argument being in these districts that are up for grabs that will give us control the house we need to run as more her moser put it the more liberal candidate you know people who were slightly less objectionable than republicans but we need to people who can win in their districts and can hope to deliver us the house and that's where the battleground is in these districts that are close the alternative
argument is we need candidate says democrats so the argument goes who are like most moser or who are more liberal who can turn out the vote stand for something follow in a sense the trump model which is stop worrying about like fine tuning your politics have candidates who really believes loud and proud and something that turns out the democrats
and that will deliver democrats to the promised land and that debate is ongoing and just got another into the extent that moser was her loss was idea an argument for the strategy of the establishment washington democrats this victory this week is establishment has an argument for the oh so should we also think of medicare for all as expand
need a possibility not necessarily being where the policy out room mates
right
good for you know with the overton window precisely when i think of it in terms of the overton window and expanding less billion people with yeah well the overton window is like what's the realm of to be that gets consider it as like normal and regular when i think about it that way i feel much more comfortable as i do have a tactically as you throw open the window because you never get me
get it but to get something less the and if you taken off the table right away you won't get him in close
just to wrap this topic up so crowley's last takes out hilariously the junior member of the democratic leadership in the house the other three nancy pelosi it's getting harder and james clyburn or i think one hundred and sixty eight years old three hundred and twelve years old and two hundred and sixty four years old respectively
no they're they're just ancient they are ancient they're all
these have been there forever and it's and
so crowley who is fifty six was the junior member it is it to me is a really terrible sign for democrats that a i i'm not like i'm not a congressional junkie by any means but i had basically never heard of crowley so the fact that the me they're never be that i can basically not name i can name adam schiff
and ted lulu and but that's about it you're and i think oh no you don't have a congressman eleanor home and orton pitches jamie raskin over the border that i can name barack i can barely any democratic members of the house is i suspect a big problem for democrats as they think about what's gonna happen when they take over the house
so john how to democrats fix this a problem the just naturally fixes itself that that that one pelosi doesn't get isn't the speaker somebody will become the speaker and that person will be elevated well again this goes back to this conversation with him the democratic party so when when there was
push and you always have to wonder about these pushes the same is true for republicans when they were the quote unquote pushes to replace john boehner nobody could have asked the second question which was with who and that immediately stopped all talk of pushes to replace john bain are now ultimately he was forced out by movement but that was because he resigned rather than there being an actual alternate
and i had the point here with policies there's always there's never been an alternative crowley was not an alternate he raised a million bucks for democratic candidates policy raised eighty eight million dollars for democratic candidates she's both very powerful inside player and knows how to raise a great deal of money for democrats and to the extent that democrats have enough money in their coffers which they need more
more according to their strategists to compete in all the places that they can possibly compete in two thousand and eighteen
they need nancy pelosi like crazy but for this long term problem they need a whole fresh batch and alexandria kazuo cortez one of the things about her that her moment onstage
here has shown is that she is dynamic talented did not swing at a lot of the pitches thrown into or that that offered her chances to attack the establishment in washington when dave rad be cantor and one his race and when you know rand paul was elected to the senate they said you know where this is a message to the us to
i wish front of our party which creates additional infighting younger candidates like this all of the women who are running and winning in democratic politics they are the new they are that they are the future of the party some of them come from military service which is also another really interesting piece of this story but how that gets from the moment you have now where
you have a leadership that's very old the crowley thing always seemed plausible to me not because he wasn't a good paul and wasn't working towards it but was the democratic party which is really now has more minority members than white male member minority and female members than white male members really going to be represented by a white male i just didn't think that was plausible than away
now yeah i think we have to rule out all the white man i just feel like that that to i mean that don't have a party needs to be having the face of it's generational on demographics chef right that's the much more pithy way of putting it it's interesting if you look at women women and or cause you know cortez of this generation lean democratic sixty eight

people with pennsylvania taxpayer dollars so if i had a restaurant
i would serve anyone who came in because it would undoubtedly be a bad restaurant and i would be desperate for customers but you have such a good restaurant that as total understanding of your cooking and your judgment about food both of which are acts well thank you for tonight do you think that
it was lighter teeth i was just it was self deprecating disarm and self deprecating the purpose of advancing the discussion
in any case the red hen of like in virginia became internationally famous this week when it's owner at the behest of her staff evicted sarah could be sanders from her dining room because she and her staff were uncomfortable with sanders his culpability in an administration that is doing such wicked things too
immigrants and two children and others as well the standard episode followed steven miller being geared at a mexican restaurant in d c and also homeland security secretary nielsen also being heckled and jeered and basically driven out of a mexican restaurant in d c so there's been
there's been other things that have followed it has prompted a huge debate this week over civility in politics
and let us i think posit to begin with just to get the way this is such bad faith hypocrisy
from those on the right because the president is the most uncivil politician have any of our lifetimes and he was he is a he's a made a career of being uncivil and rude and cruel and vicious to people and so so the idea that that it is
that civility is is in question because democrats are the ones who are who are violating it is ludicrous that is clearly the president has gone much further in this than anybody else and also i would of course there are many other examples that people have pointed out that there was a baker who refuse to serve vice president biden a few years ago who was
himself lionized by the right and with call you introduce paul ryan at a reality but it that he would refuse to serve them or refused to take or didn't want to take a picture well they refuse to be what they wouldn't let him come to the bakery essentially said we don't want you to a bakery but it wasn't the same as providing going in his private life that's true was a pub
click event
so i think it is clear that this discussion should not be at all framed around the issue is this democrats have democrats violated rules of civility it's really more like is this a problem overall and and clearly both sides have their people on both sides who have done this and i think that the misdeeds the instability
he is far greater on the right because of the president than it has been on the left do you think this is is this a crisis is civility is civilly value that is important in politics these days
feel torn about this on the one hand i'm not so excited in the rudeness and cruelty of president trumps way of doing things becoming in any way normalized are like baked into the fabric of our politics like that is relief disastrous and bad on the other hand i've
have a problem with any of these incidents because i think that we have precious few ways to express our disagreement right now that are actually meaningful and so i could understand the frustration and kind of level of objection that these
incidents all reflected end and why people why it took specimen this way and you know asking sanders to leave a restaurant isn't the same it's like throwing tomatoes at her i mean we're talking about a peaceful kind of protest and so that matters a lot to me and once anything starts to cross the line into like physical
confrontation or for threats of violence than i completely shift and maybe the problem with that position i'm taking right now is that your opening the door and walking a few steps down that path and sell that line i'm trying to draw won't really exist in a clear way and i should be more worried about that here's the one other thing
i also wonder about it's the power of social shunning so you know when i read about like parties on the hamptons where some you know democratic social aid is inviting jared and vodka
to calm and like schmooze and rub elbows with chuck schumer that i find absolutely enraging actually because i would imagine that it would matter to jaded and vodka not to get invited to those parties and it seems like that upper crust world
has a chance to enforce some social norms and impose a cost on policies that are hurting so many people i feel like if you believe that the trump administration is really hurting people you should not be including people on your guess you are crucial to that endeavor
this other kind of particular kinds of incivility were talking about of course are a little different from that on and more problematic although like i said they didn't really bother me but john they prohibited you well as if there's so many different pieces of this i think that
i just as a human matter i tend to want people to be several i want to be civil to other people and want them to be civil to me in fact you're either
you live that every day
the the thing of it is though our government and our politics first of all our country was founded and we will celebrate next week in an active incivility when you throw the t into the harbor you are not being civil revolutions not civil and then the founders created a government that embedded in it and was designed within
civility in mind they knew we would behave like dogs they knew ambition would fight ambition and so they said let's separate the powers let's have everybody fade out but create a system in which they can fight it out but not resort to force of arms fight it out without shooting each other so incivility is baked into our system not because we think it's awesome although
i think you can make a case that the zigzag pattern of progress of the american story is a result of occasionally people say being in civil the other expression that comes into play here is when you wrestle with a pig you're not supposed to wrestle with a paid because you get dirty and the pig enjoys it it's clear that that president trump is highly skilled at using
ing diminishing nicknames untruths and so forth to act in and uncivil way against his opponents so why would you engage in a battle on the exact same terms that he has been successfully good at so any active incivility whether it's at the donald trump maxine waters level or the restaurant her level or the chanting at a rally level
or should have some theory behind it that to the extent that it is just purely an act of impulse and active wielding power and act of domination eat strays from the seville the incivility that was sanctioned and in fact designed by the founder i want to make three grip point first of all to your last point there john what was interesting about the
restaurant or the red hen owner is fitted with a private at this was not something she'd probably thought she it with publicized
an employee of hers wrote something on facebook and then thorough standard publicized it but it was not it wasn't committed as an act of of public disobedience or public incivility it with it was it was a private so i do think that bet she deserves
but deserve to be noted to put your other points one is
one reason why tactically incivility on the part of democrats the towards trap administration officials is an effective strategy was on display this week which is that the cause about which this instability occurred the separation of children if a wicked wicked crime that our government is committing towards
the most vulnerable and innocent people on the planet right now it is disheartening that we spent the week or much of the week and political journalism is but much of the week
moaning and distressing over the fact that sarah could be sanders at a different restaurant
and that was a huge distraction from the thing that we were all exercise drought last week and it is it is manifestly the case that much more effective act of disobedience would be if you want to change policy would be related to these children would be at the location where these children are would be aimed at
helping these children by by making our standards at least a partial victim making her been able to portray yourself as a partial victim it's a complete distraction from that what you want to accomplish which is the reuniting have children with their families i met a humane treatment of these migrant families so i mean
the customs and border patrol did back down this week i'm not saying it was because of i'm sarah sanders and harassed with an authentic hundred thirty enters in a restaurant was because of other other light been shined on it that is now less less bright
but i think also the country has rejected this approach i mean not universally he but the public are the children reunited well that's yeah there's like five hundred of them they're working on the other two thousand i believe me i mean i am completely with you on wickedness and are and it is really kind of unspeakable what we've
dan and on what it's been done in our name to these kids and families it's terrible
i am interested doubt that the champ administration has backed down off some of the worst parts of that and i wonder it's hard to know exactly what all the factors are that went into that change but it is one of the only times that we've seen them back away like this to your tactical point day that i think that and tell me if i'm wrong but i think it would be useful to explain that to say
do in private act and public leaving aside the morals for a second tactically a there's a difference between what you do privately in a restaurant and what a a party in the minority should do publicly as a matter of strategy to gain advantage
so i want to make one other finalists or separate point which is that one of the reasons why i think the left is cotton this bind around it and were why incivility of so attractive if it essentially the institution that the left controls and this country right now is the culture and read
restaurants are part of the culture
and you know your hollywood stars are part of the culture
and as a result
the the forms of protest that liberals are using most vociferously are ones that are cultural forms of protest where you have people griping it might but not great
belittling where people chastising my pen for the performance of hamilton or sandy same be and it's you know i don't think the people who are two are committing these acts are wrong headed and i think they're their heart is in the right place and there certainly their ideas and right place as it happens when people don't i think the public at large does
not really want to hear celebrities doing this and i totally agree and when we talk about cultural alienation i mean i just keep going back to interview as i did with republican college educated women who voted for donald trump them are so pissed that katy perry had been telling them to vote for hillary and they just felt like the trade and
also just irritated that she had any kind of opinion
yeah and that becomes it's own it's pushing on and that's a more powerful governing factor in their behavior than anything else one of the thing i'd just like to throw in there is people i think rightly bemoan the over emphasis on sarah sanders being on disinvited from the restaurant i get it makes perfect sense to me as something we can all participate in
have an opinion in we kind of feel and and recognize those feelings in with members of our our own family by you have to recognize that part of though formative design of what is going on here is to bait and debates people and create those kinds of conversations that lead to the culture
all positions that emily's talking about so if you're a tactician who is has the interests of the democrats it hard you have to basically begun to your analysis it seems to me that these kinds of these kinds of ovary over coverage of these kinds of stories will happen
you can't rely on restraint in the culture and therefore this is yet another argument for your point david it seems to me from a tactical perspective to keep the focus on the underlying value that has been challenge which in this case was the separation of children from their parents and not expect that the press won't cover the shiny object of the moment

what's going to kill chatter when you guys are at your fancy szymanski fancy pants as been idea festival cocktail parties and don't try to pretend that they're not cocktail party is because i've been there there are cocktail parties
what you're going to be chattering about to your fellow thought leaders john
i got a cocktail parties are seven dollars
cocktail data is designed around
i say there
i'm sad you're not idea i chatting about something i learned about last night which i didn't know existed and it's one of those things where or how can i not have known and so perhaps people hear this and say oh have known about that for ages and you more on anyway it's something called z i p kid which is a chinese company that has signed up twenty five thousand teach
teachers in america and they're not all not all of them are current teachers not all of them are even accredited teachers between five thousand and teachers people in america who teach chinese children how to speak english and it takes place over sort of essentially like skype a or two classes to two to three twenty five minutes
sessions each week and basically there is this army of teachers helping chinese kids learn across the globe
just seemed fascinating to me that you'd have these connections with somebody sitting at their computer table in the middle of texas somewhere and then a young kid in beijing somewhere learning to learning english and it felt like something there's no i don't think there's a it now operates and thirty five countries but i don't know if there's an american
an equivalent but the distance learning thing has always seemed kind of more promise than reality and the chinese seem here to have been able to company now has the three billion dollar valuation they seem to have figured out a way to have this work
at some level anyway in hooking up resource to need even when it's all the way across the globe emily
i feel like i can't let the week pass without some mention of the supreme court decision which is seriously diminished the influence public sector unions am this is add five four decision their opinion unless by a samuel l e et al
really fitting because the lido essentially called for this case six years ago and what happened was that the court overturned a precedent from the nineteen seventies called a booed in which at that time the court said luck unions can charge dues to all of the people they represent all the people who are going to benefit from their collective bargaining
and they have to give back or they can't charge of the part of the dues that would go to the political activities of the union because the first amendment protects the rights of people not to have their not to be forced to speak slash contribute money to a cause i don't believe in but all these folks still have to pay the part that goes to pay for collective bar
running and that's just been part of how public sector unions have funded themselves and have been able to represent everybody and in particular
profession or field and and i should also add states have chosen to do it this way we were talking about twenty two states that affirmatively wanted to give public sector unions this power so the supreme court over old to booed and said that this issue of compelled speech extended to all the dues that unions were collecting and
and mattered more than what we think of as the free rider problem with you know which is kind of obvious here like once your you can get all the benefits of union membership without paying for it
some people are not going to pay for it because they have other things to do that see more pressing with their money
you know their couple of things here in an ideal world we would not be relying is heavily on public sector unions as we do for a lot of like democratic party liberal cause making we would have more powerful private sector unions since that's the area where you know unions are going up against big corporations but this is the
world we live in and in given that is the world we live in what a leader and the conservatives have very successfully done is strike another blow another partisan blow in the political arena with this decision and you know this decision it's in combination with all the other moves the supreme court made or didn't make this term and laugh
the term and all the way back to siddons you citizens united that have just changed our political process in a way that benefits very wealthy people and tends to benefit republicans and that is a pattern which if you care about democracy should disturb you because it is going to make it puts more
pressure on the fairness of our elections at a moment when they could not matter more
much better

david i remember your son was that a love gives us to couple years ago with that new called on him first which i thought was definitely the right move and he had a great question and the hit that's right he did a yeah
heart ache of mothers you think of
all jacobs
my name's sake
we know we don't like publicly
all right
let's start president trump who love
nothing more than a public audition and spent much of the last week very publicly contemplating whom to nominate to succeed just as anthony kennedy and supreme court
trump has been working off a list of twenty five names largely compiled by the federal society which is entirely compound
early
that has become for republican judge picking what consumer reports has become for liberal
and he's cutter yeah with the wire cutter
if don't log role for emily emily company company
there were seven people that he has interviewed oh look i phone or and person two or three people who seem to have risen to the top the list
brett cavanaugh who's an appeals court judge in dc a mechanic barrett who is a newly appointed appeals court and the second circuit
and then catherine
atlanta ga counted legends
yes
kevin on barrett who seemed to be the the front runners are both very young cat nothing's early fifties parrots in her mid forties
i used to play spin on the quiet much longer than she has she's only and then on non and quit for like eight months i think he is to play and used to play basketball with per capita on the late ninety here is an excellent jump shot a very nice guy and a basketball court don't know what it's like
the other court but emily why are those two folks in particular at the top of the list like can't tell if they're really at the top of the list or just if they provide all of us with a useful way of thinking about the different the slightly different profile so amy county there is a recent applying to of the court interestingly she's not
from an ivy league background she's not from harvard or yale which that would be a big refreshing addition to the court she is deeply religious she's gotten attention for this particular catholic group she's an which uses terms like head of household for men and handmade i think they stopped but they didn't tell reason
also i don't think it's catholic it's not it's a moose harris had a randy which is moving and i right
which actually when you read about sounds kind as that sounded like a kibbutz yeah except that i think they're super and to men being different tale and lots of ways in the head of household way which made me slightly nervous i've been watching too much of the handmade its tail so anything that smacks of that right now gets me agitated unnecessarily said
apps and any case and bad had this well publicized exchange with sen dianne feinstein at her appellate court on confirmation hearing is in which finds time was going after her over an essay she rode in which barrett said she thought that some catholic judges like justice brennan he was
on the court previously should recuse themselves from some death penalty cases because of their catholic beliefs and this became fodder for feinstein saying to her your dog my lives loudly within you is really unfortunate phrase and i think it was all just like a very clumsy handling of this question of on
how one's ideological or religious beliefs should inform ones judging on you know berets think the choice of the religious conservatives because she seems perfectly positioned to be totally determined to go after roe vs wade and other presidents and
then back cavanaugh is the guy was on can stars prosecutorial team then the clinton era he has more of an established rack or and about deferring to executive authority on and i think he would also be an anti abortion vote strongly and that these are basically manufacture and differences for the most part i mean
i guess there's someone something slightly interesting about whether a temp isn't really going to pick another white man on or we'll go with a woman or there's one indian american on the last recently appointed to the sixth circuit amo far so i guess there's a slightly interesting question about race and gender and whether chomp really wow
wants to a point another a white man like me al gore such but i don't know this i find this stage of the process to be always kind of tedious because it's one thing to go through the records of the appellate court judge or whoever it is after you know who that person is in another to go through like three or six or nine
twelve of them and try it
parse out the slight differences one point to note about cabinet which i
from shocking upon discovering it is that cavanaugh is fifty three years old grew up in suburban washington new course which i think it's fifty two years old grew up in suburban washington may went to the same very small catholic prep school too pricey
and they're both of
nice looking white guys from very prosperous middle class upper class backgrounds and in suburban washington that there was a prep school notable i would say for having a campus which is unusual even by prep school can or way so there's actually some things interesting about that which is that this a narrow world that
a federalist society has drawn from i mean this makes a mechanic berets you know notre dame rose college resume stand out but again in terms of what these people are actually going to be like on the court that's a different question than in terms of been reliable hard line conservative and votes i think everybody trump is considering appears to fit into the
that frame marc jacobs barrett has
says hospice non ivy league background she has seven children including two adopted from haiti she very religious and
eloquent about it
why on earth wouldn't trumpeter she seems like a no brainer given all the most there's something or mental she does seem like a no brainer but i think we're getting too quickly into the hair splitting about the anomalies in the close reading of the law review articles and who would do what i think that's a more primary issue here which i wish the democrats
go back to which is they owe us a seat
they stole seed for america and when they wrongly blocked a nomination by barack obama and democrats should have fought a retaliatory fight core such but they didn't and they should do it now with this nominee and they will lose that fight almost certainly but i think they will
benefit from making the i think for benefit from several ways one i think it's i think it's valid and there's a strong argument and it's just an eye for an hour a day to one of ours were going to take one of theirs until until the scores even to i think it's something that's going to energize the base and i don't think the conventional way of fighting which has to
try to find chinks in the armor of the nominee
strategy where you try to find personal stuff or you simply try to argue conventionally the nominee is too extreme and outside the mainstream and wrote this one more of your article or gave this one interview where they said something that sound stodgy i mean all of that is really pretext for what democrats mean which is we don't think there should be another
conservative republican on the bench and in particular that donald trump doesn't deserve to nominate want and there is a can they can they can at least block someone to after the election right i mean they're they're only one vote down in the senate i think there are a couple of republicans who are vulnerable from democrat
challenge to susan collins and lisa murkowski in particular who are amenable to persuasion john mccain may not vote it's not impossible that they can block and nominate i think you're right
lot of reasons one is that extreme sophistication and skill of the vetting process by the federalist society so the days of rag oh david souter what a surprise he betrayed his core conservatives constituency this is our over and so the chinks in the armor are likely to be relative
a few and not all that compelling i'm in now is what happened with me i'll course sets from the point of view of the democrats and so i think you're right that it is the over arching argument i'm skeptical about how receptive cons and murkowski will be that argument i mean listening to collins and last week
if you really want her to be a champion for anything other than confirming trumps nominee you'd want her to be saying stuff she's not saying i mean this is a person who voted for every single trump lower court nominee and she said last week which thanks john roberts when overturn roe vs wade which made me think all she cared about was like the technical
question of whether it was actually i've returned to had no interest in whether it's gutted because robert voted for the
send a few years ago in the case out of texas with all of taxes is regulations that would have effectively ended or close to ended access to abortion and a whole bunch of states anyway but i think you're right that the democrats need to rally for their own political sake as balls the substance at issue here and
no and put cards and murkowski his feet to the fire
usually argument at hand i mean it's definitely use would use row with wisconsin murkowski it's going to what's going to sway them they're not going to be swayed by having argument that republican shouldn't get to pick the next supreme court justice until after after the election at least but i just think what i mean is that they should have a hammer and tongs all out fine
i'd in which they're unified position is we will not support trumps nominee and they can say that nominee for very nice person qualified that's not the issue but jager game out how that actually works as a practical strategy i understand the rhetorical desire
in fact for democrats do not control the santa paid
now essentially majority vote in the senate so variable are unable to filibuster their their capacity to resist is simply to delay by refusing unanimous consent
cent of action which i suppose that can do and to make here in his last as long as i can make them last but they have no capacity to stop of vote no but they they could possibly winner
i mean if john mccain doesn't vote and if they pick up to republican votes and lose no democratic votes they win the i mean this is the argument against any equipment that that's that's a that's doing on the substance that are doing on the reason you say which is trumped does not deserve to get know nothing but if you want to be if you want to make an exam
parallel you have to prevent vote you can do that but i think you can vote no on the basis that america island didn't get a vote right okay but but that's different from saying we're actually going to
stall i guess
voted the argument a critic than but should they try to reject the nominee quickly or try to reject the nominee slowly is it better for this to last pass the election and be it be something that galvanizes republicans to vote or for them to lose have a new conservative justices supreme court by election day and use that to get democrats are too
and and do what they really need to do which is when back part i think they should try to win i think there is a chance that they could defeat a nominee i think as you try to do that and they should make it as long as painful as possible including withholding unanimous consent which were like and other it as as i mean that's the sort of nuclear well hey is in that time because we use it for other things
but that seems to be the only real structure of our they have but i don't know what you're talking about this little last week and john thought that balance like a bridge too far i'm all in favor of that i mean i don't know exactly what gets held up when but what's more important than this you know i mean this is so it's going to hold up the budget for homeland security for another
month i think they can deal with that you know i think they've gotta this is the kind of tactic that republicans have been so willing to use and the democrats have always defaulted to put their public responsibility on and i think if there's ever a time to make a stand this the to me the long term golf congressional democrats to regain a congressional majority if they recognized
they don't have the votes to stop a truck nominee
try to lose quickly or should they try to lose so you're not hearing me i think they shouldn't try to lose it all i mean i think i think they're likely to lose i think that's a that's a valid prediction but i don't think it's certain they're gonna lose i think there is a chance that with people in the streets with with with the base energize with people as upset and angry
the about what's happening in say should be that they can defeat trump first nominee
at least push the issue until after the election
do do you have a sense about whether there are get a bowl or convert
i'm pretty pessimistic because this is the like this is trumps best play it's the thing he's done the most successfully and smoothly and his presidency and i think the pressure from the republican base to have this victory is going to be huge and i have yet to see says and collins like really a single time
time and the term presidency actually stand up to republicans a block something from happening she gets a lot of mileage out of gesturing in that direction and claiming bipartisanship but in terms of actually doing it she talked about trying to come to san diego to save parts of obama care and in the end she voted against obama care and the affordable care act
like she has voted for all these lower court nominee she voted for gore said i just that isn't to say that you know the democrats and and pressure our or that she couldn't lose her next election if that's i mean if you are a pro choice person in maine and susan collins votes for the person who effectively takes away acts
yes to abortion or much of the country like that is a broken promise me she holds the right to legal abortion in her hands yeah and those steak should be made clear to everyone and she she in the end of the issue will make whatever choice she makes about that but she shouldn't be allowed to slip out
the news by saying oh with the judge assured me that he that he or she believes in precedent they and what we seem to be heading toward his her child to head off a nominee like amy county barrett who's going gonna make her snake kirk's collins look bad and hypocritical from the start that someone like back haven't is in my view just as likely
to do the work of gutting row and so you know the fact that he's not quite on the record in such a clear way should not be the thing that makes a difference even though she's going to claim that it is i mean that just shows you the correct haven't i've been thinking about being on the supreme court for the past thirty years and he's not even all that clean i mean the dc circuit
just had this case are cases of undocumented immigrants in the custody of the office of refugee resettlement and there were a couple under age girls at least a couple who wanted to have abortions and the current administration was refusing to tell sarah tate their access to
doctors there was a lawsuit and cavanaugh said that he didn't think that these girls should get these abortions he just didn't go quite as far as one of his colleagues who also decided to rattle her saber about how well is unconstitutional but like as you said jake up that was a smart strategy on his part and also
pointless to go on about that in a moment where like row still is the law
if you took emily nine relatively intelligent lawyers from around the country even nine that had just gone to harvard and yale law school is that record and you briefed all the supreme court cases and courthouse would they sort themselves ideologically the way that justices
sort themselves were there in fact if you just took any random sampling of lawyers would you end up with a conservative block and a liberal block that voted consistently together across most of the critical cases or would that not happen is that that is it that there really are two species in lawyers generally or it's just that the ones who end up going to this
hurt or have to be in one of these two species all sell remember that most of the cases that go to the supreme court t not divide five for conservatives to liberals sprayed i mean there are a lot of cases like thousands of federal cases in the country and even dozens in front of the supreme court where there is an answer that often comes from the text of this
statue or precedent
earning prior case law that's pretty obvious and they mostly agree on it it is true that goes nine zero like a whatever people just lately but it doesn't divide in his ideological way the problem are two sets of cases one sat are cases in which there is just no clear legal answer like the right to abortion it is
not written in the constitution now we have the right so you have to buy into some interpretation of either the right to privacy which is what row is based on or equal rights for women which is what ruth bader ginsburg wishes and i wish that row or based on rape there are these capacious phrases in the constitution due process equal rights
they can mean a lot of things or they can mean very little and then the second area of cases that have tended to divide this way and this is perhaps more troubling are cases in which there is just a statute it issue and yeah we see this ideological division which does seem more suspect so this term
the ohio case about what ohio can do to purge it's voting rules that was based on these two laws it was about how the motor voter law lined up against the subsequent law that congress passed to regulate elections i tried for a while to look at those provisions and decide how they
together didn't go together it was really hard i couldn't come up with like absolutely this is the slam dunk answer and so what the law professors on both sides who are like following long were doing was arguing which side gets the presumption should you should you basically like defer to the notion that you kicking people off
rolls with a process that starts just with them not voting seems out of the spirit or do you say no i don't care about that and just like look at the statutes and say well there's no clear answer so ohio can do it at once and that's where you see people play a more partisan political farm on the scale and indeed that case came down five to four it's evidence
versus liberals in favor of ohio's voter purge no constitutional principle at stake just statutory and didn't really answer my question know it
well then let me take another stab at it which is to say that increasingly we see a core that behaves ideologically in cases of just like reading the text of laws in addition to filling in effectively like the blanks in the constitution but you would every republican who requested to every problem
appointed to my shadow supreme court and voting for her yeah i think they would because they would have a choice right you can if you can make a plausible argument in two directions then it seems increasingly and or maybe the increasingly is not quite right some con la scala can argue with me but we are certainly seen
evidence right now where if there are two possible interpretations the republican appointees the conservatives pick the one that favors their results and the democrats pick the one the favors their solved and so yeah i think that any of your lawyers who got appointed unless they had some really well developed a theory of like judicial modesty are some
thing that got them out of making these decisions would be making similar calls so post members you get bonus arguments on another so i pod cast

abolish ice is a new rallying cry on the left push by alexandria causing cortez in her and surgeon campaign adopted by christian job brand a couple of other sitting democratic legislators
become both a slogan and a great divide for democrats on the farther progressive left
there are those who would eliminate immigration and customs enforcement and reset how we handle those migrants living among us who don't have a legal right to be here who make less para military what's vicious on the less progressive left but still the lift there are those who had merely reform ice by basically doing the same things but by eliminating the organization i suppose so
where did abolish come from and is it a good idea from a policy perspective in and it a good slogan for me slogan perspective
it's i think it's a terrible slogan and a slot idea i think it's a terrible slogan because democrats through the party that upholds public service and government agencies and it seems to me that we don't want to get into the conservatives game of saying whole swath
of the government are unnecessary or do something or malicious in some way i think ice badly needs to be reformed as does the c p b which actually guards the border in the division of labor from what used to be the old i nfc immigration nationalization service but fundamentally is an issue
policy
left problem is with donald trump policy of deportations separating families of everything he's doing around immigration it should not be with the individuals who serve the government in any capacity including law enforcement and i just think that's i think it's a mugs game for the democrats
i do think on the just a bit on the other side of it that
positive phenomenon here is the energy and ideas coming from the last of the party the democratic party i think now is is increasingly coming to resemble the republican party in the early eighties and in the reagan years lots of those ideas seemed extreme excessive
beyond the pale of of the political discussion
and you know but they drove the party and a lot of more bad ideas
but they captured the party because they captured people's imaginations and they won't get people excited about being on that side that sort of abolished isis is typifies in a way the same phenomenon the liberal side and the phenomenon is good i mean the democrats need that energy the
they need those ideas i think they just don't need this particular framing but in the overton window theory of of policymaking is it good to have loose extreme and in your view bad idea out there so that makes it more likely you get the less extreme and better version of reform ice or should they not even raise it because it is
in itself so bad that what if they catch that they catch that postal truck
and may do have to apologize they should just in different slogan six i do abolish sounds like you don't believe in any immigration enforcement which certainly hasn't been democratic policy and isn't democratic policy that very few democrats like the democrats who would support the idea that there should be no verge
the device that there should be no deportations and all that there should be no immigration enforcement and again it just it's the democrats attacking part of part of the government i don't think they should be doing that i think they should have a slogan that moves the debate the moves the argument but i don't think they want to move it in that way
i take your point about that bars part but on the other hand i never thought the department of homeland security was a good idea like the history of this is after nine eleven it looked like it was true that are bore borders were a frighteningly porous and you know everybody got together on a bipartisan base
says and created this new agency and it's always been kind of an alarming power center and the fact that ice is it's own bang which is doing mostly picking people up for you know dealing with detention and deportation within the country but also gets mixed up in the border patrols with c p
has insulated ice from a lot of the kinds of reforms that we want i'm not actually sure that this governmental structure that was created in two thousand and three is serving the country's interest while and it was of course created to prevent you know terrorists from coming in and now it's like mostly this weapon that we used again we use
against people from latin america so there's like a more thing of the mission that's been problematic to so for that reason i wonder if it really is such a problem for progressives to be complaining about a part of the government i mean you know the rule should i can see before d h s i n s i mean you listen to this shitty was it or was this like
i was going to use the word well positioned ones any under obama either there's was pretty bad but not as did you read that an interview with minions who who supervised it obama and edwards
had different directives it was less paramilitary yeah
exactly they a the years and that's it that's their job is david immigration lawyers the issue is policy it's not it's not the agency per se and it's certainly not the people who work for the agency they will follow the policy said at the top what they're being told right now is to be arbitrary aggressive
brutal unfair
and now the it's like it's like attacking the police for enforcing laws you don't like the police the police will follow the policy that said wait a second thought because police unions and this has been true also of the organization that represents a lot of agents are also lobbyists who take
political positions and affect the debate and the ice like representative organization was a big trump backer and that and i mean i can't remember the name of the had a vet who was on tv a lot but he was out there back in trenton so yes it is true i mean i'm against attacking individual people who work for the government including law enforcement but i also think
i have to recognize the way in which these groups of government actors are not simply doing their jobs they're also a political force well that's true that's true
i don't think you could say the same thing about the firemen and police and emergency workers in new york you know who are the backbone of giuliani support them and it's not that these people don't have political views
and don't and don't represent them but they they perform a function that we are generally uncomfortable with a mean even when it was the ins with this was never a beloved agency of government they were sort of in a way saved by their incompetence and bureaucracy they weren't good they weren't good and
warning people but they weren't very good at helping people with their legitimate immigration problems either and i'd rather go back to the kind of i n s three d h s model where you have something that is that is more oriented toward helping people
come to the country and become citizens legitimately than it is focused on the random enforcement of of deportations to so triggered gone back to your original framing of this
one thing that conservatives had enormous amount of success with the years is the abolish the iris
idea
like an insane idea which most republicans don't sign onto him to they still want taxes collected in some way most people want to be collected roto with fairly but as an emotional pull on people that was very effective
certain on a certain class of conservative ideologues who would then get out and why isn't the same argument true here for abolish ace setting aside your point like the democrats should support government and government institutions working well but since attacks on their parents were absolutely disgusting i mean these people who work they were from the iris they are
they were they were totally disgusting but they were lose on politically effective for republicans well i mean i think i think a motive i think they probably were you know in the show trials these hearings they had with i i r s agent supposedly testifying anonymously behind curtains i mean they created or you know all of the theater around the idea
what the i did was fundamentally unfair when what the as does is fundamentally necessary and good to any civilized society i mean i just don't see how you can say well that worked so it's something you want a copy in may have worked lots of lots of forms as demagoguery work i think demagoguing against the pay
patriots who worked for the federal government is not a form of demagoguery the democrats want to touch i'm not saying they shouldn't try to be political and populist and figure out how to frame issues but if if they start picking off the parts of the government data like and attacking them i think you know you're just going to create this this pitched battle that is
even now at an acceleration or an escalation of the kind of political fighting were having any even essentially you were having a similar conversation the me or talking about before an overarching theme of what does it mean to fight and what are you fight like how and i think the left is generally full of this conversation right now
how far you go is exaggerated rather act perfectly fine as long as it presents a tactical advantage because all you're doing is expanding the overton window you don't really mean abolish ice so who cares or as you're arguing do you create a snake really corrosive set of rhetorical points you're making
you know erode the quality of the democracy and the government in this way and that has longer term ramifications we don't really know the answer and you can see different commentators on the left kind of trying to figure out or like flirting with ideas that a few years ago i think they would have been really uncomfortable and part of it is this moment it feels like extreme extremity
he is like throwing anything the spaghetti against the wall is helpful and aware that we could wind up feeling really regret about heard democrats thirty learn this lesson i mean they know that you can you can criticize the defense budget but you don't attack the troops you know or you don't attack the idea that we should have a defense budget or the three
and i think this is a version of that it's not quite it's not quite the same trigger but it's just it makes things too easy for republicans trees it's too easy for donald trump to say what you don't want border enforcement you want open borders and you know i think some of the some of the people on the left thing as do one open border though not
the elected representatives right that's more like you know people lefties as opposed to like people in congress but it lets the right associate would really have fringe marginal position with the mainstream of the party that doesn't hold that and for that reason i think it's a bit about idea
i mean it is telling that be focus which for a week because good strong week was really on camera separation but the attention of families through the grotesque wicked enforcement of policy the refusal to accept asylum seekers
all of the things all of the truly horrible crimes that are being committed in our name on the border is now that it's been defused to there's some still some discussion of that but there's all this there's the apologize part of it there's trumps response to abolish it doesn't feel like the democrats have a cogent message about this and that they had lost the
we're both moral and policy advantage they have when they were talking about the really wicked things that were going on and which are the things that need to be stopped
i agree with you that's that's exactly right if you were going to have a slogan that was to abolish some federal agency
today
richard neither of you people will take up as against the argument about holidays gonna ever keep the secretary keep the department of commerce is a promotional of a wilbur ross's investment interest department
yeah i mean you know it's funny every agencies even even the crummy ones contain stuff
hundred and yourself it is i mean you know the department of commerce does you know is the
the eno a in the senate sense
i don't believe so much and all of the businesses stuff that does that if there's a lot of other stuff keeping gets new can pick a small agency you can pick you can pick the department of sugar substitutes just to drive you crazy david i'm going to say nasa
i don't really i think that that c'mon

on the record it is not take was often scott who must have said some kind of guinness book of world records for ethics investigation is out there is a p administrator who were subject to at least a dozen possibly as many as eighteen separate investigations of his chiseling cheating and chicanery
this grotesque corruption is misuse of public funds as misappropriation of employee time is nepotism
he is finally gone so we actually caped a segment on thursday morning
emily grey up and i all about prude but with the assumption that was continuing to be paid administrator that he left and so emmeline i have come back this afternoon to quickly grapple with the news that it is gone
family is on a subway as we take this so please excuse any audio quality issues and and please excuse the absence of jake who who was not able to join us for this emily are you surprised that got hurt
finally finally finally finally left is a vindication for journalism or just a sign of how incredibly lower standards are since he should have been gone months ago i right
current that he added all or negative it either
we are leaving are wrong and i know about you
yes i agree with that and i think he hit become he was no longer that useful because andrew wheeler his deputy has all the same good qualities as far as conservatives are concerned or bad quality far as liberals are concerned and will be just as effective a carrying out the the policy
that it was but he doesn't as far as we know is not a chancellor and and a cheat in the way it is so why he was no longer necessary my character and
finally went and on nightmare
arctic that happened
why do you think
you need a problem
i mean
i think that the over well mean corruption in his cabinet and his administration will be a problem so it's obviously not simply peru peru is the most histrionic example of of a cheese learn a cheat and the cabinet but there are others wilbur ross is currently
asian the largest active political insider trading probably the largest political corruption in history in the history of a cabinet member and so you have ross you have devolved there are some shady stuff ben carson their shady stuff everywhere you look in this administration there is swamp penis and i think democrats will probably
people to run against it even with gone
he right
had a general want in a while he meant that out
at any rate i don't know andrew wheel or who succeeded him
his
no was a huge lobbyist for coal and gas i think an oil company so so it's very much a fox in charge of hand house situation still wheelers wheelers very much in the same school of peru it and i don't think we're going to see in policy terms i don't think is going to be a better place
but i guess but i suppose yes yes it's it's good that the that the manifestly corrupt person has finally been driven from office and presumably will be a to your low bar yeah what of all the kind of bit of corruption that was implicated and from the chick fillet franchise he tried to get for his wife to my
favorite recent one they putting of personal expenses on his junior staffers credit cards and they're not paying them back
do you think there's any one that broke the camel's back to think there's only one that made trump say it like you know what this is a bridge too far you could have you can have three point five million dollars and security but you can't have those commemorative tens
it up
tried to get a job
damn and bad people who are either
i mean
nobody could right
about you i think it is the enlisting in security staff to go around to go to hotels to get lotion the special brand of reroute motion and that was that was a doozy i mean the worst with the one that i felt worst about the one was worse for the public spending ways to money on security so that's the worst for the public yeah but the one
the one that reflected the loan this of character was the making his aides put things on their personal credit cards and not paying that back i mean that your current credit
and getting the matters and the term hotel to the pathetic and cute more than i found that damaging that that was just it was just weird and pathological it was but it didn't hurt anybody in the same way those other won't hurt people
i like our part emily you're on a subway and it's very hard to have this conversation with glee and length would like to sew
cut it off here

people of pennsylvania taxpayer dollars let's go to kill chatter when you're sitting overlooking a superfund site near you watching the sunset have been a post pruitt cocktail jacob weisberg what are you going to be chattering about david i was just going to mention a magazine article i loved which was by jacket in the recent issue of the york times magazine
which was a fantastic gone about this renegade james joyce scholar and this was a guy who became a huge on font reveal in the literary world on because he said basically the big addition that was published of ulysses with with it was supposed to correct all the mistakes with
filled with all these mistakes and he wrote this devastating article i think in the new york with books or something and he got an academic appointment out of the sky was like the star of joy studies and then he went missing like he went off the map of and honesty failed to write his own like complete definitive list right i never get nothing
for he was going to work on the definitive critical edition which he disappeared within right and jacket the writer of this piece sound him down and brazil and has it's a great i won't i won't spoil it sounds great
it's a fantastic story of a magazine long form magazine writing is all about emily what is your chatter i'm a big fan of the fiction pod cast the new york or puts out said this is the one that deborah treatment is a fiction added our does where she asks a different radar every month to pick a story that the new yorker public
best buy another writer and sell deborah trees man has and conversation with the invaded right are a kind of start they introduced the story then then invaded raider weeds the story on with more or less scale but plenty of scale and my view and then they talk about at the end and i don't always make it through this
stories some stories are actually hard to list at least for me hard to follow on the audience but when i get into it i love this pod cast and recently the writer a m homes read a margaret atwood story called stone mattress
head and hands is reading the story it came back to me so vividly it's from two thousand and eleven i know that i read it at the time and it's one of these stories that was written in a slightly different moment but resonate so much with this me to champion moment we're having and resonates with the show the
handmade talent i think i already brought up embarrassingly but anyway it's just really cool story and the conversation that treatment and homes have a it to affect so it's the june episode of that section pod cast for the new yorker that is a great part guess they'll of catching up on those on long drives exactly it's all about what people pick the pair that
choices are so interesting lane or see i completely agree and you can always go back to old like it doesn't raid it's not something that's perishable my chatter
to to quick things first of all i'm reading bad blood the john kerry you i think whatever you say your name
book about the thoroughness long con
it's a best seller many of you probably already read it if you haven't read it it's wonderful
absolutely delightful book about
some con artists and how they got away with a with an exceptional con for many many years and
it's great it's a deep inside portrait of this the silicon valley darling and how it was completely corrupt from the start and criminal psych give all of our at least i felt so much respect for john kerry i mean elizabeth homes
founder and erstwhile ceo of fairness was getting just such amazing media coverage and carry less skeptical and he took her down and it was not easy they get fairness when after han just isn't a real story of like basic incredibly intelligent
analysts on and you know get so much a risk or brought to justice and yes precisely and it has had actually his and his employer rupert murdoch
a huge investment
and yet care you went forward and and murdoch what the peace corps for or deaths so that was also brave anyway the book is just fantastic i left my reading and haven't quite finished year and then my second conditions the opposite so i watch a lot of television and there's a bit of trashy leave the probably none of you and maybe none of our listeners
wash but if you were looking for a sex and the city
suitable air to sex in the city there's a show called the bold type which is a show about three young women who work at a magazine which is basically a cosmo and edited by basically a cold can executive producer on the show it's unbelievably trashy and yet because i have a teenage daughter and so watch it
it is such a pleasure to watch it is it's just very very funny about journalism and about magazines and then it's about the mores of young women i love it
the whole type with on some some cable network that i shouldn't even
family guy
it's under
that is i show for today the political office is produced by estimable just than frank a researcher is the beard it easy rude i'm no longer bearded so is he has the only beard and the true i didn't even know ness i just got very frustrated yes fez really it's so hot i just like
scrape it off but i'll probably just perfect

oh and wasn't a flight what hippocampus for july twenty sixth two thousand and eighteen
pay with cash edition i'm david wild the battles euro i am currently recording john dickerson phoebe if this morning in new york hello john record you oh you are oh yes well secret then
in cash but no a check or no cash no no no no no i'll pick up pay with cash
and have an air time to the new haven hello
hello not secretly recording yeah connecticut the two party consent state i think you're right though i'm totally sure you know i just never turn on the tape recorder without asking permission to seems like the wrong thing to do yes it does on this week scared first michael cohen secret tape and what
if anything it means
then a trump indoors conservative wins the g o p primary in georgia and sets up the most exciting governor's race of twenty eighteen than a truly does mall stand your ground case in florida plus we will cocktail chatter
michael cohen present lawyer this week released a surreptitious and cryptic recording of a conversation between him and then came in at donald trump for i think september twenty sixteen in the audio recording which was probably legal under new york law trump appears to be going along with a plan
and to pay one hundred fifty thousand dollars
to the national enquirer to buy from the national enquirer rights but the national enquirer had recently bought two a story to the life story of karen mcdougall a woman who claimed to have had an affair with trunk shortly after it gave birth to their son in two thousand and six that it's very soap opera it does not appear that trump ever pay
this one hundred fifty thousand dollars
so not clear to me at least what cohen is trying to accomplish by leaking the tape
john based on what you heard a new thread is it clear what is happening on the tape or it's not clear i don't think it's terribly clear what's happening on the tape other than that donald trump who's spokespeople previously said he knew nothing about it and in it that that he knew nothing about this arrangement is heard on tape
intimately discussing and coordinating the details of the thing about what she said or his spokespeople said he knew nothing so that is that's clear enough
one that one of the reasons is difficult to figure out what's going on is they've clearly had a previous conversation he understands the code words that cohen is using the president does because the conversation without any previous knowledge would make no really no sense at all because cohen is saying i'm going to set up a company first of all about just stepping back one
or sentence it's a very relaxed conversation about things like setting companies making a hundred and fifty thousand dollar payments if this were a new information or a complete out of left field
attempted extortion you would imagine many other people would think what's going on what he means set up a company like you'd be a gatling gun of questions none of that as there really what we don't we don't really know it all of the things that the president knows that his head whether he there's no question there is no i didn't hear any evidence
one where the other about whether he agrees with the underlying charge which is to say is he arranging the payment because he knows this is true and he wants to make it go away or is he arranging the payment because it's extortion it's totally untrue but he doesn't want to fight it because it's september twenty sixteen and if a story comes out
it'll be damaging so this is just it's a big sunk cost for him i couldn't tell any of all of that and then there's other weird he seems to be on the phone with somebody else at the beginning which is somewhat interesting the washington post
has some speculation about that i don't think it's only it's worth being highly speculative when we don't really know but
he has another side conversation the middle of it so that all contributes to the fuzzy and us and we'll let them pay with cash line what did you guys did you guys think that was clear are not clear what i was gonna ask you that that was basically my question of about ask you which i am asking way because they both have years
well
well okay so there's the there's the question of is trump same to pay with cash that's number one question number to question is if he is in fact same to pay with cash what are the legal implications possible legal implications of that so look i'm not an ideology just and order that exposed month that you can lead to an allergist from
studies hearing
studies hearing okay like you take your kid to an ideology if you're worried that my know why i joined her nadal adjusted it's they listen to this i mean i think out
just the term i would just using a term to imply somebody who's not learn on time and suggesting that we have to have a medical degree in order to just listen to this day what i'm saying is i did not done forensic analysis on this very cursory to me it doesn't sound like he is saying don't pay with cash but now but i
but beyond that i don't really have an opinion also isn't the big issue whether this is a violation violation of campaign finance laws and whether he pays with cash or pays with barter system or drachmas or whatever that's the issue at hand not this side issue of cash versus credit rain well except that giuliani said that trunk were saying don't pay with cash
ash and is not at all clear that that somebody said so in the same but it in fact that one more timely right but that's less important than whether this is illegal and he can be prosecuted for it true that dog the skating and lying if i mean just on the lie scale it there's the big lie which is that he didn't know anything about it but i'm interested in your take heavily on the campaign finance
challenges i mean i don't think that it is in itself evidence of a campaign finance violation and because as you said we don't know where did this payment got made should they be like closely looking into this yes absolutely they should be you know one question is whether even packer and that national enquirer and american media to called i
it's time and my heart rate and and american media incorporated were acting in their press function or doing some other thing which could be and now he called campaign donation and i certainly think that this whole catch and kill arrangement if it was for the purposes of how
paying tramp when the election looks like it could be a campaign finance violation whether trump south contributed to that immediate happened that's trickier you have to know like have to follow the money and then i think the hardest part for prosecutors is going to be intact how are they going to show that the rationale for killing catching and
telling the story was the election versus sparing champ embarrassment or you know helping him and as marriage i know the we are not doing ourselves any favors here because we're talking about this as the first topic of conversation but i must say that this story is strangely uninteresting to me this
it doesn't tell us a single thing that we don't already know about him we know he's an adulterer we nobody pays people off we know that he a shady finances
we know that they were plane close to the line on campaign finance stuff to begin with it's not to say that it's not scandalous and immoral and disgusting because it is but it doesn't is not scandals in a more on disgust me in ways that we weren't already aware that he was scandals and moral and disgusting and so it's sort of like
it feels to me like something which were spending a lot of breath on and is is not adding to the to the common stock of knowledge and a world where i think when you allow your time when you have audio tape of a have something like this that makes it slightly different because you hear him talking about a thing they said he knew nothing about
so that's another other things you have you don't i mean sometimes you have his own audio tape that he contradicts later when he's audio tape player like things he says at a press conference but
but i think that changes that a little bit is the kind of fact that this was recorded in secret and the biggest point of course is what it means for the legal case which is that his fixer the person who taped lots of phone conversations whose job it was to manage these kinds of things and who given the tone of this conversation obviously you did this enough
so that they had a kind of shorthand for how you make things like this go away if the guy you employed to make things go away is now has now turned against you which is of the context in which this came out than that so that's a big deal because he's got the keys to the to the kingdom and those keys actually aren't even in his hands anymore they're in the hands of prosecutors
so it isn't enough if this is the best he is god that's good well we know you know that you know on who the hell are and or what michael cole and decided to do next and whether what he is really doing is fishing around for a pardon
is going to be super significant in terms of the legal on investigation i also felt like this having the tape was part of a week of on trump asking people not to believe what they were seeing or hearing and to believe him instead and i know that this also is finale or the lying and
playing and stating of falsehoods but it was just a head spinning week for that
you know
face accord application comes out explaining the carter paid surveillance and it completely contradicts the devon nunez republican version of what this face application was based on and supports the democrats interpretation and trump says the opposite and there were other examples
that the sweet and i felt like we were back in the moment
right after the inauguration of the pictures of the crowds and being told to believe something that was not what nationalist front of in front of our eyes on so i guess you can say that's nothing new either because we did know it but at the time that seems trivial and increasingly it's just flake part of the core
on approach of this presidency
same john
unlikely to be something that will move home recent a significant way
perhaps helsinki good given that what should
what should the media to do with this and also watched the public do with the story
there's so many other things that are happening but the terror of stories sort of attacks on obama care of an endangered species act threats against iran there's a lot of there's a lot of both substance and and smoke going on with this particular story what should we as citizens and we use media do with it well i think you should come around
those things
we even though you can't cover all those things even though depends it depends the venue right i mean so we met we just in what we do every day we've mentioned all those things except for maybe you'll go with the obama care
thing and
you mentioned it but then don't
don't dwell on it except to the extent that
i think there's a moment a i think one should always take note when when the president is caught simply saying something that's that on true you know where they words the situation is this start i think i should always be something that we flag and so we don't
i think well this is just the everyday this is the everyday thing so i think it's i think it's useful to do that i think it is it's also interesting just as a part of this larger drama the but i think in this narrow the venue i think actually the monuments ruling that came down on wednesday the the judge decided
i think is this right emily for the first time basically defined what the monuments clause means the president justice to party those aren't were arguing that it means essentially a straight up bribe and the federal judge decided know it can mean essentially what what those who brought the case the attorney general's of maryland in d c or what they
i think it could mean which is basically foreign countries
doing business with trump hotel for the purposes of trying to gain favor with them in fact that that's going forward is a huge deal a in and of itself the be again
to the extent that michael cohen is a is a can opener into a hidden part of the trump world the mayans clause case could be a can opener into the finances of the trump organisation a much of which have been hidden by the president great point yeah
how do island was great it it does feel like it's real significance i mean emily
just lingering on that for a second i'm know if you'd looked at it legally but what is likely to happen with that case going forward to in the administration will appeal it
the ninth circuit i mean the dc circuit somehow but what will happen i think is actually in the forest arquette because the cases in maryland and yes it's going to go right up to the far circuit and not be an appellate court ruling and i assume this case going to the supreme court and the question will be whether it goes right away and this kind of you know pearl
seminary pre discovery phase or whether it goes back to the district court and discovery happens and then it goes up which is a huge distinction in terms of you know the kind of financial information disclosure thomas just talking about what's so interesting is that we have this part of the constitution that's never been interpreted before by the fat
courts until we're going to have a very historical inquiry about what the framers intended at the time this is truly an original list question in terms of interpret the constitution and the judges argument that and an argument must have meant something separate from bribes because otherwise
what's the word doing there since the meaning of grind was commonly understood at the time and the framing that seems kind of common sense all i haven't studied it seriously so maybe there's a counter argument i'm not thinking of but it's pretty interesting slate plus members get bonus segments on the gap
most other sleep pod casts you can become a slate post member by going to sleep dot com slash gab first post them this week
we're going to talk about a very sony and flip plus topic
question is would we all be more productive if we work four days a week instead of five of a weirdly for john it would be like if we worked six days a week and seven
you know john john adams said i'm day and a week instead of eight yeah
john and like to imagine a hypothetical and any it's going to god complex get as close to sign up and here
but on a segments and get all sorts of other slate plus goodies

the gubernatorial primary or the run off this week camp had started his campaign with a deportation bus tour
he taped an ad in which he pointed a gun at a teenage boy interested in dating his daughter he proposed to round quote round up criminal illegals and his pickup truck
and he coast to victory over casey cake old lieutenant governor camp was the secretary of state of georgia cagle lieutenant governor camp one upon receiving the president trumps endorsement and also upon benefiting from cables stumbles
op here both bumbling and scheming a series of secret tapes this a secret tapes week
and now camp will face stacey abrams in the general election stays here to win the democratic primary earlier would be the first black woman governor in american history is shaping up to be a fantastic and fantastically interesting race emily
early polling has this race even slight edge to camp but it's so early in the hell knows but how is it even possible to to envision a democratic governor and a state that has been quite bright red for the past twenty years
phil stacey aprons has this really interesting
theory about a path to victory and i don't like i've already disclosed fast bragged about the fact that i know stacey from law school so you know her theory is that there is this emerging majority in georgia of young people and women and people of color and they are underrepresented in the electorate
look at the percentage of than in the state versus the number registered to though it's too low and if they were registered to vote and they voted they would have the power to carry this race and fill seats he has been working for years on a project to register people to vote in georgia and for the kind of crazy underlying
themes and best as you said like totally fascinating race is that can the secretary of state for jar well as the person who was purging the roles and blocking a lot of these radio stations are going through and really making and just much harder for people to vote in georgia so the underlying dynamic and these questions about
voting rights and how you register people and who they are and what kind of rules the state has to follow it courage people from the roles those rules in that fight could determine the outcome of this race and i really hope they talk a lot about that because that in itself is an issue i think that
democrats in particular could raise up on in two thousand and eighteen and twenty twenty and this question have access to the ballad
i only read this one place and i don't know whether it's correct but it it
also have suggested that abrams who set out to register hundreds of thousands of people have only managed to register forty six thousand people still the and that's because can rape but that's all in large part because camp was not accepting a lot of these registration applications there's been a lot of litigation over this going into the jar to court
it's a tangled web that this story on and so that's all part of it right but just going to the electoral possibility so i think african americans are about thirty seven percent of the georgia
electorate and abrams presumably well when overwhelmingly ninety plus percent which means she needs about thirty percent of the white vote with my back of the envelope calculation and maybe even a little bit less and yet it's very likely she won't even get it which is just incredible to think that the democratic party
among white georgians are so weak that it would be as low as that we will i think this is my it's going to be really interesting that the republicans have a candidate who is such a model of the champ era and whether what a fact that has on the white vote there's also this question of to turns out how many more
people get registered at whether that has some impact on reshaping that democratic electorate
john are you what's your sort of like immediate ted you think it's too early to know how this race shapes up well i
i do i like
it's one of the fascinating races out there in another thing that makes his race fascinating to me is that both candidates are really interesting to watch kind of outside of and separate from from georgia
and so it's the kind of thing where something they camped does it's already happened but will will potentially reverberate outside outside the state and obviously that's why we're talking about abrams his approach to to i guess when i'm interested was connected to that is the extent to which values and identity are wrapped up in the all
these symbols now in ways that are a part of trump but also separate from trump and how that plays out in the gubernatorial race so national senate and house races you can kind of you see a little bit of a closer connection to donald trump it's democrats take over the house can investigate the president they can best gays and and
castration they can clog up the actions of his administration to advance a kind of national democratic message the senate obviously has extraordinary power with respect to judges and so forth so you get the you get the understanding that action between trump and the candidates the into the gubernatorial race and the issues are different there's no there's no real relief
russian ship in the ways i just described on the other hand
when a candidate plays to these identity
issues the way can certainly has with guns and immigration
it is it does it have a power that essentially does connect him to what donald trump has created and an energy he has created in the country and so is he able to access the same trump base the same trump feeling and that's one of the things that will be interesting to watch in this which is going to be different than
we've had in previous some in previous elections were gubernatorial races can kind of not be connected to the national message there's this phenomenon
i first became aware of maybe two years ago called rolling coal and know if you to remember this which is that people who basically conservatives who hated no environmental movement and this country created trucks which spewed as much pollution as possible and it was to create huge amounts of black smoke coming out of
or truck and it was people were thrilled about it never took great joy and it was it was really just to troll liberals and troll environmentalists by doing that
feel like what's happening with the republican party is just rolling cone and kind of political levels that if you look at what camp is running out abrams has a very substantive campaign i mean there's there's a strategic out part of l a tactical part of it around registration but it's like there's a lot of substance there's a lot of policy positions that are interesting and she talks about a lot around
around education in particular
for camp there's nothing it's it's it's an atavistic it's symbolic an atavistic it's just it's all this merry christmas crap that's respecting our troops were going to round up illegals that pointing a gun pointing the gun it is it's weird the way it is it has become it is
evolve into just tribal symbolism
and i gotta hope i mean maybe maybe i'm wrong here that it's certainly there's a huge portion the electorate that's going to vote that way because they are republicans they believe in what republicans do and also because they respond to this this dog with line but at some point the lack of have any
substantive positions are is going to come back to haunt republican republican politicians i wonder though if in democratic politics
policy carries us some of the identity weight and that those appeals and the republicans i do which is that democrats like to some democrats do anyway self identify as serious policy government workers make government efficient so that it can help the maximum number of people i met that sends an identity message to democrats in a way
that i'm not saying that the motivations you're doing it are the same but that it may have v ultimately a similar effect
with democrats
yet and i think democrat there's there's an identity
the strategy my democrats to around a lot of civil rights issues and marriage equality and which for mere human rights issues and so i feel it but they do have that same kind of identity component it it feels on the republican side it feels particularly backward looking an empty and just about fucking
with liberals slow yeah and isn't imagines and imagines this hostility like who is it that goes around nobody goes around saying don't say merry christmas nobody goes around disrespecting our troops that's a completely conflicted
illusion and yet it becomes this thing that people talk about him obsess over and make bill campaigns on the
two two things in connection with that
well three things i guess so
right
whether donald trump indoors as a candidate or not is i think doesn't have much power i think if a candidate is seen as mark sanford was as an active agent working against donald trump i think that can hurt people but donald trump saying yes or no
much power that has been a candidate who mimics his appeals to fear
think can be successful and what they are successful in part in doing adam hamilton a pastor wrote a methodist pastor wrote a great a book that's just out which is great about living in in fearful times and one of his one of his arguments is that in politics trump has
so freaked people out about the rising crime rates that it creates a national anxiety that's that's not verifiable by the facts and but if you keep everybody hopped up it has it may have a political benefit and this that clearly seems to be what campus trying to do final point on your you're rolling coal
which reminds me a little bit of the expression on the lives and trolling which is what paul ryan said the president was doing by saying he was going to revoke the security clearances of previous intelligence officials is doing something that is basically just to make your opponents exasperated nick
hayley and the un ambassador gave a speech to young conservative high school students in which she said you know owning the lives might make you feel happy might make you laugh mean me please you to do things just to make the other side uncomfortable and embarrassed but that's not the right way to behave that's not the right way to persuade anybody of anything and it's not
no sign of leadership so that's interesting because that's not exactly the strategy that the president she works for or a number of people like camping in georgia that's not the strategy they're pursuing however there are still some republicans do you think that's the the dead end strategy for the party ultimately am just going back to
the point you made early on about secretary of state they're just been extraordinary amount of of
incompetence and negligence involving georgia and it's voting systems
significant evidence that secure data was left exposed as left exposed even after the state was warned about it
that voting systems couldn't be compromised that there's like passwords
available camp has dismiss this there was i didn't follow this exact it it seemed like there was a lawsuit filed and as soon as this lawsuit was filed the state wiped the servers that contained the relevant data for the lawsuit
yeah it was a it story started a new yorker by to help her in the start of was not yeah i mean so what mechanism is there maybe there is none to it's to me it's kind of surprising to see the secretary of state yeah but doesn't matter that are voting systems are compromised it's it's february me it seems weird that that that that isn't something
secretary of state even a republican secretary of state democratic secretary of state green party secretary of state isn't up in arms about it feels like a basic part of the job
i mean yeah and luck there are many and secretary of state of all parties and persuasions you see the way you do end there are good reasons for that by there is another kind of greed is state secretary of state right now
like in the mold of chris kyle back in which you're not thinking about it that way you're thinking interns perhaps of part is an advantage or if you wanna just like take on can't rush now at face value what he said the data was he was preventing federal and cheers and he was refusing to let
you know there be any kind of help from the federal government at a time when the obama administration was in power analysis excuse for not accepting the help of federal election
officials or just like dealing with this in some way that seemed like it would be about protecting the integrity of the system as opposed to
letting it be so vulnerable i hope that he gets asked a lot of hard questions about that during the campaign because it seems dangerous and increasingly dangerous based on what we know about you know how the russians are trying to influence the two thousand and ten elections i mean now we have dan coats you know trunk
one of his main security people saying we have red lights flashing and this example of camp leaving these vulnerabilities in the system and then wiping it clean rather than investigating and and fixing it just seems like really kind of mind blowing in that context

so let's turn now to a tragic and appalling case in florida where sheriff this week declined to push forward charges against my draco after he killed more keys mclaughlin a convenience store parking lot to emily the case with people behaving badly an overreaction then a man ending up murder
in front of his children so talk a little bit about what happened while there's a very brief surveillance video clip of this altercation so everyone can watch for themselves but on a woman named britney jacobs of was in her car with her little kids and she was parked in a handicap space outside the store and michael j came
her and we can't really can't hear what he said but presumably told her to move or complain that she was in the space and granted that mom in her boyfriend marquee mclaughlin came out of the store heard what was happening when over at a drake that and pushed him and it's a hard place straight guy falls on the ground
blocked in takes a step backward i think and drake of pulls out a gun and as mclaughlin is backing away drake and drake i shoot ten
and he died in front of his children as you said and the notion that florida stand your ground could mean that the shooter that draco could face no charges at all i think we're all trying to figure out
it seems like this just can't be the right answer at least to me so i'm only actually to a moment where we can all take a restful two minutes when you give us an incredible position on three really interesting legal concepts and now merge to an ancient ones a duty to retreat
i'm a castle doctrine and now a third one and that has overtaken them a distinctively american one called stand your ground so tell us about each of those right wall so
you know traditionally we have a in the american and british law a jamaican law comes out of we have really strong notion of self defense if someone's attacking you
and you think they're about to kill you are really hurt you you're allowed to fight back
but we also have what's called the duty to retreat and so the notion is that you don't wanna world in which people in a kind of vigilante like self police force way
we act aggressively when they're being threatened if they don't have do we also have an exception to that rule that comes out of british law called the castle drops much to tap just talked about which but if someone threatens you they come into your home and threaten you then you don't have a duty to retreat and you can kind of understand that too because there is
the idea that you know in your own home you shouldn't feel attack that if someone enters it they've kind of lost the right for you to have to get out of their way or move back to avoid confrontation what florida has done is take this step further and now effectively you have no duty to retreat anywhere so this parking lot
became michael drake as castle and effect and let the law says is that the person who's using deadly force the shooter has a right to do so if he or she reasonably believes that using are threatening to use the force is necessary to prevent death or great bodily harm to himself or others and so on
that's the standard in the law it's caused all kinds of problems for our florida prosecutors florida police also tend to really hate this law because it has escalated conflict all of that said as misguided as a thing could take and removing the duty to retreat in public is i also think that the sheriff in pinellas county
any is just completely i'm misinterpreting the lot here because it appears from the video that mclaughlin was backing away and so the notion that drake felt like he was an imminent risk of death or bodily harm i just don't see that on the video and see and to meet so to me it just seems like an even broader interpretation
of this stand your ground law than is necessary
know it's he did not have a reasonable fee or that moment my own earnings healthier weight and when this has gone on tv he's talked about this sort of subjective fair he's basically said well we'll take a says he feared for his life but like that should not be the standard it should be what a reasonable person have feared why isn't the stand your a defense rather going to read
not a charge shouldn't be something that you can
into you're charged with murder and you use that as a defense company which prevent to charge the beginning let's agree that is not how the law works in florida and i don't remember if this is in the statute or it's based on how the court for interpreted it but instead what has happened is that the state has to affirmatively prove that
that you did have a duty to retreat so the burden of proof here goes to the prosecutor as opposed to you a starting out as a defense after your charge that's part of the problem could john one of the extraordinary things about standard around is that it has gone from not existing of two thousand and five season
florida passed a law to both and to twenty five states have been a burgeoning was staying around more why did this happen why is it been so relatively easy for the and are a bit concerned about hours to get these walls
well because i don't know the fate the full picture of it
i about to the the details of the case because i want to get your murals take on move on as the racial makeup have been different of the participants
whether the rulings would have been different
but i think that it's become a
the growth of concealed carry as a
has a movement has been very successful for second amendment advocates throughout the country it has had and it's now obviously coming up is a potential federal issue with
concealed carry reciprocity legislation that sponsored by john corner and others
so this is this is a part of that and it's a part of legislators who believe it advocates from me and or a who and other groups that that are promoting it and it's a part of the connection and over tiny out of the previous issue which is it's a way to signal the voters that you are over
you are tough on crime that you are supporter
gun rights you know their ways you can say i'm a supporter of guides but then you can say and i want concealed carry and i won't stand your ground it's another way to show action on a core issue for an active set of voters
who have shown that they will reward you if you act on their issues and obviously reward you with votes but also reward you with money yeah i think that's totally random in that has been very effective it not just defending existing gun rights but pushing for more of them and nice stand your grandma's the energy has lobbied heavily for and alec the american led
slate of the exchange council which on laws help right wing conservative lawmakers draft laws and pass legislation they've been a big back or obese stand your ground laws that's why they're spreading actually leads me to do i thought was wonderful pizza know i can remember who wrote it but making the extremely persuasive to me
point the standard ground walter anti conservative that there was no problem with the law is constituted we had a hundreds of year history across two continents of duty to retreat and castle doctrine being the way jurisprudence worked
it was the basic legal standard
there was no evidence there was a crisis of people getting killed and threatened out in parking lots because because there was no stand your ground laws and instead legislators go ahead and passes entirely new standard which invites all kinds of crazy behavior and the result he was in fact that homicide rates go up there all kinds of escalated and cow
authors and it's it's went again as a conservative person with a small see it just pisses me off it makes me furious it's like you had a system that worked relatively well that was a had been tested by hundreds of years of history
there was no obvious problem that it was causing and yet people go ahead and change it because it allows them to score political points and death results and mayhem results and also racial injustice results it's it's infuriating but go to the racial component of this so emily there is pretty strong
so we didn't mention this but drinkers weight and mclaughlin the victim is black and there's pretty strong evidence that it's much easier to make a stand your ground kind of case and you get you get much more leeway if you're white and you kill someone who is black than the reverse right yes air is
evidence think that and it's really really distressing and and makes you feel like even apart from that just wrong had a nes of these laws for the reasons you are saying they are associated with higher homicide rates i mean amazingly even in this moment where across the country homicide rates are coming down
down florida is is significantly so that's correlation not causation but it doesn't look like a strong sign that stand your ground laws are making people safer so there's that whole kind of public health argument and then there is this problem of racial bias and the way that it plays out in the system and for mean there's a real parallel here with the death
penalty where you know whatever one's feelings are about morality or immorality at the death penalty the way that we apply it is racially biased and it means that you know black people who kill way people on or especially if there's a victim no matter who did the killing that's when
when we impose the death penalty and similarly here it just seems like these stand your ground decisions to declined to prosecute come about when you have a black victim it's interesting to me that almost nobody not even conservatives are really defending greater people think people are same
conservative line and seems to be the sheriff is misapplied of the standard because
used the point you made an anomaly which was that he did not have a reasonable fear and to the sheriff who has misread the law nobody is sort of same yeah drinkers drinkers in good shape their way and the state's attorney and the prosecutor fuck analysis counting could still come in here and bring charges and i mean that's what i'm hoping will happen but yeah
i mean i know when i watched this video i just the idea that fight over a parking space could turn into a lethal shooting in front of children in like broad daylight just seems terrifying so maybe that's why you're having trouble finding people defending issued although actually
went to europe is john
people behave in a polling ways around parking spaces and around handicapped parking spaces in particular it is something that works people up
really an to an extraordinary degree i mean mclaughlin and jacobs who parked in the handicapped space apparently without justification like that's an asshole move you shouldn't do that it's the wrong thing to do and and
sets people off i will actually i bet there are a ton of murders that take place over parking spaces and i know there are tons of angry confrontations that tape was overcome partner places because i get angry confrontations maybe i don't think there are a ton of murders and also can we just like make sure that you are not veering into victim blame
aiming because i am sure you don't think this person deserves to die hard time when i die but course no one deserves it
and clean toilets
the record i don't have the money saved i mean the drake is somebody who had confronted people over this very handicapped parking space before i'm just saying that in fact that people behave really badly around parking places and it causes it sets people off people people have a sense of ownership over parking places and so if you think that's a space on but to take summer
takes that people get agitated about that
the handicapped parking place and
the way it represents a kind of protected space and then you'll see people violating it that causes people to be aged i'm not at all
of course
seeking to examine and phenomenon and in
and but john i'm in now you know i think you're right about the conflict ever parking spaces yes people get as your site also john i feel like you are somebody who you are great analyzer of human behavior under stress in situations that require decency so what is the yeah well it's like road it's like road
rage i mean it's a it's a it's like the most a cute or one of the most acute ways line cutting road rage in which we kind of the general houses of sosa
yeah the general and just an airplane behavior perhaps like seat reclining in the injustices the larger injustices that we all feel outraged about
wherever we come from
kind of oh distilled down into a sharp pointy thing coming right at us
and feel like is part of what happens in these cases i think also i saw some very strong reactions to greedy jacobs who was interviewed afterward saying either i had to park wherever i want that sentiment
a mistake yeah this was subsequent to the shooting of them
of her boyfriend
so that did not win again even from people who would feel embarrassed if anybody suggested that they were blaming the victim nevertheless were incensed to hear her say that so i think you're right
david that this is some i mean in some ways this may fall apart as i say it but here we go to the extent that the starbucks confrontation and we talked about a few weeks ago is that starbucks became the location for a lot of other huge massive societal things that we don't know how to wrestle with very well and so that it was more the
what happened in that actual store it's it's a lot about the societal currents that just happen to appear in that store and i feel like your point about parking lots and these spaces
is kind of right
and it's sort of a surprise to me that there isn't more of this let me ask you this question about
i was unclear if the sheriff was sort of saying sure i would charge this guy but my hands are tied in other words was she was it's sort of i don't know i'm mean there must be a word in the law for this which is you we just have to follow the rule of law even though we all think it makes no sense because you know
laughlin mclaughlin was clearly backing up in the video and and he was backing of the way it looked to me before draco pulled any weaponry i mean that's pretty fighting fans and a it looks like he pushes him and then he immediately starts backing up
so anyway yeah i mean he did say something like i don't make the law or something that absolved himself and responsibility and but but because he seems to me to be making the wrong call it's hard to not see that as a paper thin excuse especially because he also pointed out that a few
atkins elapsed between the shove drink a fine to the ground and then the pulling out of the gun and shooting suggesting any even the sheriff said it gave him pause that because there was that space and time navy drake i didn't feel like he was you know under imminent threat was like he was undermining his own rationale
and the moment in this way that with quite odd right
let's wrap it there

it was good a cocktail chatter
when you are having a cocktail
one of your party and when he bows on what are you going to be chattering chattanooga
this is a sad when and i say about that but several years ago i wrote about this incredibly tragic case in which on
baby got very sack and
ended up having seizures you know throughout his life and the cause was mysterious and his baby sitter at the time whose name is treating munoz was accused of shaking hands and went to prison and to me it looked like a case in which the evidence that this was shaken baby syndrome
is really disputed treaty was not a native english speaker and when a social worker question her she described jiggling the baby on after he collapsed and that spanish word got translated as her confessing to have shaken the baby which does not seem to have been what happened but
in any case it was this case that went to try and lead to a prison sentence and all of the appeals that her layers failed or denied so now trading munoz is finally getting out of prison but she is not an american citizen she's from peru and so she is eligible for tea party
asian and because she has a felony conviction once she gets out in august it's entirely likely shall be deported and so this woman who may well have been wrongfully convicted and spent years in prison is going to be separated from her children on her family on and sent far away to a place where she hasn't lived for many years and the only ram
left is a pardon request pending before the virginia parole board and governor north i'm in virginia and to the utter frustration of treaty munoz his lawyers the parole board said they were gonna look into it and then it turned out to the parole board investigator had a conflict of interest and the case just seems to be sitting there with no and paying
any attention to it
it really seems to me that governor north adams people should at least take a close look at this since munoz was convicted there have been more convictions overturned in more questions raised about on about shaken baby syndrome in terms of whether you how easy or hard it is to tell that it's a cause of the child's injuries
obviously nobody wants children to be injured and that's a very scary thing but there was a kind of very righteous push to blame the last caregiver have a child when a child had abusive head trauma on the medical opinion around that has been shifting but not necessarily in a way yeah
that has helped this particular woman
i'm just looking at least some german happened to be on the wash and emotional story same that story don't know his attorney will speak in audio a few and speculation of possible presidential boot and found a joke you kidding
we've come to some games with lower your for some random person the scandal gets to run for president that's ridiculous
john for going i'm talking about star me daniels the story of that crazy targeted or rest of her is just like really upsetting anyone that's in ohio i think side john what's your child or magenta was the dumb as i was thinking about this week's news grossman trump
michael cohen and whether it was important to her where it fit in scheme of things and all of that i i was reminded of them
that even given the fact that the president is associated with at least two cases of paying a great deal of money at least among my view of things on thousand those a lot of great deal of money
to two women to hush money essentially that he still i don't think an economist would have to
to counter this in real dollars but you still would not be if those are the only amounts that he paid and hush money would not be the historical leader in hush money payments to women with whom he had affairs i should note quickly that he alleges that are that he says as he is not have those fears but nevertheless he did pay the hush money in that sense it's
apples to apples with warren harding and that drove me to an article by jordan michael smith in politico from august of two thousand and fifteen
which is entitled america's harnessed president i encourage everyone to read it
because it's it's really it's extraordinary what are the wage warren harding behaved we've had fun and hurting his expense
rather regularly i should say on the show
because his letters to his various to the people with whom he had affairs he was married
i have been published
guess i didn't realize the extortion portion of it so carry philips which one of his mistresses was paid about five thousand dollars a month by the republican national committee
but then in the and she was able to somehow for nagel in addition to those payments
a gift from the urgency of about twenty five thousand dollars and so this article says basically one dogs are yeah yeah i'm a lot of money that's exactly right
they the article calculates twenty five thousand dollars from
nineteen i guess this would have been twenty seven the twenties anyway and at about three hundred thousand dollars today so that's why i say that even just with with kerry phillips it would have been him
been more than the totals that we know about from the president's hush money but then also there's man britain with whom harding used to have acid nations in the closet the coat closet of the white house while a secret service
officer
watched guard outside and would knock on the door if mrs harding was a good us off the market
what was a man britain during the secret service
anyway in britain was was shamed
harding guys there's a baby basically to make the money back britain read a blog everybody shames her and says
she's making it all up but then it was finally ultimately to disclose that harding made secret child support payments until he died
and a dna test was done
later proved that she in fact none britain was was it was right anyway warren harding what an amazing
chapter in american history
anyway
send descendants to the child a crowd and ornament request questioning fine for that as a great question i don't think there are descendants of cleveland's love child but but i don't know in this case one of the thing and i would like to recommend is the movie eighth grade
with bo burnham
directed is a fantastic movie
the acting is just amazing if you were a parent it will be both regulatory and terrifying and
there's this one scene where am turned to me
this may be the greatest seen i've ever witnessed
it has to do much and i can't wait to see this movie that was that a good flag
it has to do with chicken midnight
chicken nuggets and the scene and the whole and yeah but definitely see the whole movie it's really
well rendered my chatter and author a listener chatter my chatter is also a recommendation something to watch which i don't think i've recommended before it he tells me i haven't which is succession this show on h b o o
it's sort of under the radar at three
scenery chewing drama about basically about the murdoch family it's about media tycoon and his children in the media tycoon has gone into deep old age but it's still a lion you still are quite powerful lion although failing on in some ways and the jockey and whose children each more
we him each each more ruthless and terrible my next and it's great it is there is amazing amazing scenery chewing as i said especially by brian cox at the patriarch the the the settings are spectacular the there's a lot of wonderful failure
it reminds me a lot of a show i loved a few years ago called kings which was sort of a biblical it was a biblical retelling about sol and david and it's very similar and in fields of you or somebody who like kings you will definitely love attention and it has an incredible soundtrack
soundtrack anything i've heard in years
check it out

the problem metaphor trial began this week and a virginia courthouse or perhaps you should say the first palmetto for trial began there will be at least two and who knows how many trials
of the man who is the napoleon of crime
this first man for trial concerns charges brought by special counsel muller of tax evasion and bank fraud
mahler charges that metaphor lied cheated juggled hid sixty million dollars paid to him
much of it by ukrainian oligarchs victor gonna coach mcguirk slash ukrainian president viktor yeah i'm kind of which and then committed fraud when that money dried up and twenty fourteen by line to banks about various fairly trivial matters matters involving a country to get loans and things like a metaphor is also scheduled to go on trial in september in d c and money
wandering charges so ruth none of the charges in this case are related to present trump to collusion into the campaign or collision so how do they connect to the larger miller investigation
well they connect and a couple of potential ways one is the potential though it seems like if that were going to happen it would have happened already have manner for it slipping and being providing evidence if he has any against tramp over
at least some information about what the president the or then candidate trump knew about his involvement or other involvements with russians for example matter for it was in the increasingly infamous trump tower meeting where are they dangle derek
the other way it could be potentially relevant is if it provide some insight into eventually and that could also be with matter for its cooperation or maybe we don't seem to be getting it in this trial maybe with the cooperation of rick game
who is alleged and now i'm guilty pleading partner in these crimes of fraud
adam davidson races this point in a very interesting piece in the new yorker which is there are two manner for its there is the man there's ostrich jacket manna for it who is just making in these eye popping sums of money and spending eye popping sums of money that you really can't even imagine like in supermarket sweep
steak some dating myself like if you were tasked with spending that much money will be really hard to do and then there is cash poor desperate for infusion of money man of for it who has somehow gone through these eye popping psalms in his resorting allegedly she carefully says to various forms of bank friday
in order to manage to continue to find his lavish lifestyle
and the question that adam raises which i think it's a really interesting question is so he's desperate enough to do these fundamentally stupid and discoverable things like lying to banks about the reasons for loans are lying about whether it's a rental property so he can extract money from the mortgage and this is
the very time he goes to work for the trump campaign unpaid and he is allowing the oligarchy is close to something like twenty million dollars and he's talking to his colleagues about how he can get right with the oligarchs and offering three things with the oligarchs so what did he
exactly offer in his desperation we don't have evidence that that seems to me to be an interesting question to answer your question so emily why
some ways to angeles but why a smaller able to bring charges like this if they are so on
on their face so disconnected from trump been could he could he charge could charge jeff sessions with jaywalking if you wanted to well i mean mahler's directive from the justice department as broad because it talked about russian interference nail action and all related matters and so as ruth explain the possible
not afford slipping on and then the idea that there was something that he might have had to broker so you know we haven't seen evidence of this yeah of our example the republican party's platform about the crane changed in a kind of unexpected way on before the election around the time of the republican convention and you could
imagine the special prosecutor trying to draw a line between these huge stats and office lot of spending and that decision
that's theoretical at this point but it's that kind of connection which we don't know of yeah but which could be on out there within the grasp and the potential grass of mahler's team that would bring listen to that all related batters sphere i don't know about jay walking by sasha is that sounds like it to be a much
hard or reach him but i mean like yeah
the theory about why even if muller sitting on information about metaphor
something unseemly with the term campaign is that he wouldn't want to tip his hand because he'd have to turn that material over to defense attorney to be is going to use it at all and the case against men rate from brady way any way that
oh yes thank you david other lessons are thinking and
yeah i mean there's something odd about this case in a sense that if it's all about something man for it then why as matter a i flipped is he waiting to see if he is actually found guilty and let the likely sentence will be is there some other reason we don't know that he doesn't want to flap or is afraid to flip on you know or just anything trump is going to pardon and so on
all those questions are swirling out there but in the mean time on yeah we can't necessarily see all the evidence and the fact that this trial is on there is a wall between this trial and all of russia allegations is useful to mahler it's also a wall that the judge in the child's in
for saying on family he has told the prosecution not to talk about russia and he also has told the defense not to make this all about the idea that matter for being persecuted so i think the idea is to have a straight up a straight up tile on the facts about the tax and bank fraud allegations and issue here
brits you present and early in your response my first question that metaphor has decided not to flip but it but just going to the point made isn't it
just as likely that metaphor manifests occasion to flip would be after guilty after and if he's he's found guilty and he's like i want to minimize the sense of flip then and then actually what he's doing is inviting the pardon so i find manner for it's legal strategy here
almost as puzzling as rudy giuliani is legal strategy here and trying to figure out which one makes less sense to me because tightening manner for it is man for it is shooting the moon
he shooting the moon in a number of ways
in order for him to have a terrific outcome which seems highly unlikely given ample documentary evidence against him he would have to first be acquitted in this trial and then be acquitted in the second trial that scheduled for september he could have chosen to put these to trial
together he chose not to because they they have to be separated because of complicated then you reasons of were crimes allegedly occurred and but he could have chosen to waive the venue as you know having gone to the basil on school of law
excellent to mention it free
i could have
that's want schools are featuring many professors basil on am and that that seems like a really hard thing to do if he thought his best thing was to flip and get the lowest possible sends you know actually korea lot of favor from with prosecutors are
good will with prosecutors by forcing them to take the case to trial quite the opposite of that yes good point professor and so so what to do in with that once they have a conviction they kind of have you buy this graph of your neck so that leaves the seems to me
pardon strategy which is what i mean i guess first will pardon al capone and then who will pardon pomona for nothing is out of the realm of possibility in pardon sheriff joe world by it
it seemed like a very risky strategy i know that consistency is like irrelevant here but i it is interesting
pardon strategy that chant name a torque all response as to minimize his connections with for right it's like i barely knew he hardly works for me which isn't really the thing that you saying before your about departments someone though again i realized that asking for consistency is
the fool's errand know you might i barely knew him he hardly worked for me that's why i have the freedom in trump brain to pardon him and he's being treated very unfairly see i'll i'll cook how how how how much worse his life is than al capone yeah you're right okay that lenses out my favorite and under noticed
tweet from yesterday by the way i'm which is the al capone comparison because paul man who by the way had been freed on bond and was under house arrest and living a perfectly under the circumstances adequate lifestyle new civil libertarian really caring about people being detained without due process
says hello separated children and parents president donald trump is talking about him being held in solitary confinement why is he being held in solitary confinement because a judge found that he had been trying to tamper with the witnesses against him
i feel really bad for him so the president seems more work took unusual
this week about them all our investigation and called on attorney jeff sessions to to shut it down then floors quickly insisted no no he was just there was just an opinion he wasn't actually trying to obstruct justice and and he's calling it a hoax and of course the usual which language
you that feel
what do you have any sense about whether he'd actually educated about this or why were the education my come from not really accepted the tile starting i think there's a lot going on beneath the surface that we can't see and the fact that this was the mole men trunk cross the line and publicly called on sessions to get rid of this pesky investigation
then suggested to me then i don't understand the whole context here because on its face the timing look strange there and just ban a star in the new york times about how mahler is looking at champs tweets and considering whether they're well then turn obstruction of justice on charge or scenario sell it just seemed like you know
awfully blatant on the other hand i think a lot of trumps public statements have gone in the direction of like i'm saying that's right out loud so there can't be anything wrong with it so i i i have a hypothesis so good
like to throw out that that trumps agitation and i thought they would use exactly the right word his recent agitation is not related to the manner try although he is actually putting bollinger on trial
or trying to but it's related to something else that we've gotten some glimmers of which is mahler has been once again seeking and trying to figure out how to obtain trumps testimony not only about collusion there is no collision but also about the possibility of obstruction of just
this and i am the i am making this up here by it i think that there is a point at which mahler is going to have to put up or shut up in terms of asking nicely and making the decision between asking nicely and then going away if he doesn't get what he wants or doing what prosecutors tend to do in these circumstances which is
issue subpoenas and maybe he has said in his latest offer which was reported the small last night or this morning about what how he would be willing to narrow the scope of questioning of the president and the methods of questioning the president maybe he is also suggested
there could be a subpoena in the works
i have a corollary of my hypothesis if i may which is also maybe the president and his team also know or suspect that having seen to russia related indictments from the special counsel that the next indictment is coming in that it could be a conspiracy indictment
that name's a lot of people who are americans this time who aren't just russians that does seem like the other shoe that's and about and drop since a vegan diet men of all russian conspiracy conspiracy us and we've been getting awfully close also to be collusion it was not a crime
argument i mean we're they're basically religion or giuliani essentially made that after michael cohen claimed to trump knew in advance and the trump tower meeting giuliani its responsibility been will trump didn't know about the meeting the meeting didn't occur because i was told by the people who weren't at the meeting that didn't occur that didn't happen but even if that meeting
had occurred so it's not a crime doesn't it's not it doesn't matter i mean this is just
most amount of chaff that's the sort of the previous previous answer is no longer valid is no longer operative way in iraq and if he has now and the chaff what mean i mean that the giuliani answer seems to be cohen there was no planning meeting for them
planning eyes
that meeting didn't occur and i know it didn't occur because i've talked to the people who worked at that meeting who said that it didn't occur i mean basically to he can't it's a non he's not making a sensible argument which is what i was trying to convey but but in any case at the root for giuliani be is it is even if there was a meeting
to plan the russian meeting even if present from new bedford so what which seems to be
this gets us to all the way to where we knew we were headed which is were colluding with the russians is not a crime
yes and never been a number of the commentators on the right and have been defending this idea show what so what if the dirt comes from a foreign government
no it's okay to take up ovaries are chart to take whatever you got from any source no matter what laws they broke to acquire it no matter how much you know other sensible people might think it's not so great to have tunes folks cyber hacking and order
to interfere with our elections i think we are like right up against that argument and it's going to be interesting to to watch that play out because it really raised deep questions i would say about patriotism and nationalism and are kind of
didn't chance then i think amazed to see us go this far to see some some conservatives called this far and they're willing to defend on chomp on these pounds but is that the case ruth that actually colluding to get information falsely obtained illegally obtained by a foreign government
it is not primo i don't know
no it is criminal and one or it it certainly can be criminal and exactly and it can be criminal because we've seen this in some of the earlier indictments it is it can be part of a conspiracy to defraud the united states of honest and fair election
if you are taking and it can be violations of campaign finance laws taking things of value not reporting things of value taking things of value from a foreign entity which is additionally prohibit and campaign finance laws there are any number of ways in which he
probably creative or law stretching prosecutor can go after this
the would because for this reason it's wrong we know it's rotten how do we know it's wrong we know is wrong because the president of the united states took pains to hide this and lie about it from people when it was first discovered that there was this meeting and then he lied about lying about it and now he may be lying about
out whether he knew about it at the time
he said at the time by the way and we should all were call this of that the meeting was first reported on that anybody would have taken this meeting this is the kind of thing that happens in campaigns know it's not and the way we know it's not his all the efforts they took to obscure it and make sure we never learned about it are left
austrian on let's go back to the metaphor trial from way which of metaphor if men afford it
been convicted metro will be because their are in a way of witnesses against him have been offered immunity or reduce themselves rotates to expand the number one person and met in that category
how how is it that prosecutors effectively use witnesses like that who are themselves compromise your themselves basically same getting getting protected
in order to turn on their former boss or former colleague s really normal some prosecutors to use the witness and it's like that they're good witnesses right they tend to have a lot of detail they have a close observed information sometimes they have documented something that's just a classic clay and rec it seems allow position to make i'm in
already and the testimony
the effort by that it sounds to say gates acts i did all this themselves in terms of you now tax and bank fraud without manifests knowledge some of the than doris have been on disputing that and denying it i know way we're dealing with matt forte directly sell on you know there's a real claim the prosecutors are following year
witnesses rarely come in the form of mother teresa with unblemished records they if you're the
a witness against a partner who is accused of a crime and you have actually already found guilty to a crime yourself you're open to being impeached and that's why god invented documents to go along with that and corroborating witnesses who may also be less than stellar by it you you add up
the legitimacy we may not actually hear from rick gates and which is why don't you think ruth i'm in the crossfire yes so they weren't sure whether they were gonna call on and i was surprised that up a little weird but maybe they just don't wanna open them up for other reasons that we can't imagine yet maybe i have they have a pretty strong documentary case we'll see
say one thing about this trial
which is we need to have cameras in court rooms if we don't have cameras in court rooms we should certainly have audio in courtrooms it is just outrageous in the modern era that we are not able that ordinary people out there who might be interested in this are not able to hear if they want and have a lot of time on their hands
all the testimony free themselves and make decisions about what they think is going on and have to have it filtered through us in the news media i cannot
why things need to change when in wouldn't it be great to have cameras in the courtroom and maybe god will bless us spearheaded and test for i wouldn't that be glorious to see the chances of pomona for testifying not would you bet your ostrich case or and i were in right now
my non existent awestruck skin but absolutely fantastic looking glazer on it
a car and they i think you're going to have an os treads glazer and should be like orange or pink bow as looks like the ostrich colors go to correct that diana know i was like like mine to be real
i say it but united and i don't get to know a color asked her to get covered with feathers
skin
the feathers it's know who leather allowing well i did that's why the textures didn't look covered with feathers i think against all this time i've been thinking about the nine hundred and fifty dollar tie there was a nine hundred five yellow tail i am a very very deep thinker
i spent some time last night looking at the photos that were put into evidence or at least into the record of all of his clothes and let me say sound of them are really hideous and there was also nine hundred and fifty dollar ties

how to get first listeners i'm interrupting the show this week because we're doing the sleep plus pledge drive and i'm here with the editorial director slate plus gabriel roth gabriel's in new york i'm in d c
we magic of connection it's like we're together
almost
almost together romans together i feel very close to your retina do
i really admire your voice do i really like how your voice sounds people tell that to me sometimes but i want to voice flattered you lovely voice that's so nice of you know if feel even closer to you but the way the listeners can feel even closer to you david is by joining slope pluses narrowed it is sleepless is
slates wonderful membership program and it is a chance for sleep listeners which i guess you are because you listening to this broadcast and sleep readers to support what we do it's late so it's a chance for you to support the pod cast that you're listening to the first and to the other shows that were doing that is trump castle
there's amoco there's the just they're slow burn their sleep money there are more than twenty five pod guess which is crazy and have a huge number with this wealth of opinion and analysis all that smart all of it considered and sleepless is a way for you to say hey i value
this excellent independent journalism its latest producing and i value guess i get it wasn't too i'm going to give slate some money to help support that and of course it's not simply what we're doing in your ears it's also what we're doing online the the magazine itself the articles and videos and stories of all sorts that we're publishing
are so valuable especially in the trunk bear are you out of writers like general buoyed leftwich markets of stern their writing about the biggest stories of the day they're giving incredibly smart independent non partisan aggressive coverage of the most important issues that the country faced
and it takes money to fund that and of course slate gets some of that revenue from advertising and tumbled from other sources but but we value the contributions that readers and listeners like you can get the chance for you to support something that you clearly value and to allow us to continue to do
do this work
so that's that's kind of one piece of what you get was late close but it is not by any stretch of imagination the only thing you go to sleep cloth and in fact there is with for public guess listeners there's a special treat that you get with sleepless which is what gave well as i think gab first listeners have probably heard every episode of the gab first has
an extra segment at the end of it if you're listening to the gab fist and you're not asleep plus member you're not getting the whole show you're hearing the three hosts talk about three political topics and then right when your version of the recording and they continue to talk they loose their collars they let it hang out a little bit and they talk more
about something else something often something related to the news or to politics often something a little bit more personal
there was a recent episode in which john dickerson and who was guest hosting talked about moving from charlottesville to new york and also about their feelings about charlottesville placed above them care for profoundly but is now at the center of our struggle against resurgent fascism and white supremacists i'm in america
it was really personal but it's political it was quite profound and affecting and there's a way in which on the slope postpone a segments that come every week you sometimes get to those those human moments that i think pod cast fans really cherish you get them a lot more in those postpone bonus segment so every week a bonus segment every week know
ads in the game there's no ads in any of your favorite slay pod casts much more than that every week on our slow burn and or our watergate mini series we did a complete bonus episode for slate plus members every week going deeper into the watergate story season to have that shows coming out soon it's about the bill clinton impeachment and monica lewinsky and can starr
will be a bonus episode every week was long detailed analysis and interviews and conversations about the people who were involved in that crazy story only slate plus members are going to get the ear those episodes
there's are slate academy series the ones with gennaro billy about the history of slavery in america and about the failure of reconstruction after the civil war and one about fascism in europe with rebecca onion in june thomas and just keating
i've learned a ton from those series and they're only first les plus members there's a ton of stuff that you get as a slave plus member in addition to doing the really important thing that david was talking about of supporting the content that you love and cherish if you really value this show if you value the other pod cast slate makes if you value slave as a website if you think it's an imp
news source in an important part of the media especially right now we want you to help support it and you can do that by joining slate plus you can go to sleep dot com slash gab zest plus act thank you for joining me david
back to the show slate dot com slash gab fest plus but have a fight about three the printed guns on tuesday day before download day a judge in seattle bard a libertarian gun enthusiast and cody wilson from upload any his massive files the internet which contain the specs that would allow anyone
two three d print a plastic gun a gun that would come without serial numbers the gun that might be able to sneak through metal detectors
wilson had been barred since i think twenty thirteen from releasing has plans are released releasing his plans on the internet
when the obama administration use in arms export control law to prevent him from applauding nom they invoke this law and the subsequent litigation and delays and kept us in the courts and and off the internet for several years although wilson had already uploaded the the specs previously and so one hundred thousand people that are you downloaded them
the trumpet administration has reversed the state department arms control ban and said they're not going to enforce it or it's had that doesn't apply and eight even paid a bunch of wasn't legal bills but this judge's decision or just order basically said look the cost of really think these out into the wild is enormous so until we
get settled or not not allow them to be uploaded so
in fact three the gun designs are already available on the internet you can get designs there are a lot of them wilson's on ones have already circulated it's also already legal to make your own gun at home it's a tradition that dates back before the revolution
it's also the case that three guns
are hard to make expensive and shoddy and you'd be an idiot to make one rather than go out and buy get a gun and basically any other method will get you a better gun
so why why why is this a big deal
he might you be any it to do it that way unless this seem like an interesting challenge you are you wanted to try to smuggle a gun on a plane atlas plastic in way more difficult to detect through ordinary mechanisms or if you wanted a gun they call them ghost guns that did
have a serial number and couldn't be traced teal sell you could be answered as an enterprising happiest here or you could be a really bad person
a big deal because it just it's a it's a hard case because this information as information is want to do is already out there and circulating and if you are a bad actor
or an enterprising happiest you could probably already find it and three d printers are not
that difficult to access them in public library you can my daughter is an architecture student does a lot of three d printing these days and yet we find ourselves in a country with more guns than people we are desperately trying to figure out constitutional
ways to keep these guns and of the hands of dangerous people and make sure that these guns are not brought into places like airplanes and other places where we need to keep them away from people and this is just another one of these manifold techno logic
called challenges where the technology seems to have kind of outpaced our capacity to deal with it and perhaps outpace the law
i'm going to start arguments you shortly but let's let's get some more stuff out here to emily wife and said a district straight up first amendment issue this person has a bunch of files this is information this is this these are words and code and numbers that he wishes to distribute and therefore he should be allowed to distribute them in the way
you should be allowed to distribute your articles in the way that i can upload a random string of numbers the internet should i so choose why is why is this constraint on his free speech
legit constrain all he may still went on those grounds cutting grass and i think can just current such a key charging us and all best i mean we're focusing on that's because hey has been successful and his pr strategy where he was not successful and has legal strategy and tell the champ administration just changed position came down you know
it is not a settled question at least not nationally by the supreme court that all computer code is protected by the first amendment and even if it does all counter speech we have limitations on speech mean you know child pornography is really all that is also data that is shared over the internet counterfeit that money
he is illegal and so there's the point at which the speech analogy always breaks down and you can move into conduct that the government has a strong enough interest in
in banning and preventing the spread out now that's a different question for mother it's really a fact that not at this point sense as a sad the plants on these three the plastic attacks lay on undetectable and untraceable guns are already out there but it doesn't mean that the government should give up a winning position
last lawsuit to make it easier to spread misinformation
i said several things i also do not like the idea of using a law which was designed for one purpose his arms control export law was not designed for this purpose it had totally other things in mind it was not designed to to to stop what what it's being used to stop here
military equipment right yeah yeah yeah i don't like the idea of been invoked for a totally separate purpose congress had shown no intent to to bargains like this and i'm personally i'm sorry to interrupt you were wrong there is a congressional law that prohibits the manufacturer and use of class
guns so under that i am just and your kind of organs another yeah i'm glad you're good housekeeping argument that this law is not intended for that purpose than i have some sympathy with it but it's not true and then i will apologise interrupting you and let you guys are saying that and yeah
know that that's totally fair but you're you're actually right although yes congress
has said you cannot manufacture and detectable guns
i think what wilson would argue with that were not manufacture anything yeah see it as argue that over and over yeah you're right
sadly mind giving him tidbit bit of information the way the anarchist cookbook told people how to make bombs
i'm just telling them something that they can do if they want you to that's number one
i just feel like look there probably will come the day when three d printer guns are extremely reliable that you can make them in a cost effective way at scale
and you can do it in your garage that day is nowhere near here the guns that are being contemplated here are incredibly unreliable they don't they basically don't work there are more dangerous to the person who who manufactures the person who might use to the person is using it then to the person they're shooting at there is this very long and honorable tradition of homemade guns and this country and
you you go after it at your peril i'd actually think that the vast majority people who to make guns on their own are doing it because they are gun enthusiasts and hobbyists and have and at are interested in doing it for for intellectual reasons and pleasure reasons and and to spend a lot of time and energy on going after them seem
like a a huge waste of time
there is not these these designs are available and have been available for years and i don't think we've seen any evidence of a crime upsurge of these guns being used in any way and therefore to to focus a huge amount of intellectual energy and legal capital and time on fighting it seems like a big waste of time to me and finally it's like
of all the issues that gun you can you know
america's gun policies totally fucked up and bad but of all the issues to spend time focusing on this seems like a maybe five hundred on the list because so many things that these attorney general's could be doing other than stopping these plants from getting on the internet and giving giving an irritating people like me who who want to sympathize with gun control efforts
i just feel like they've made they picked the wrong battle are so many other things that matter so much more so how is all back and change when someone smugglers one well named plan the exceptional plastic gotten that works through airline security and then like takes on a plane in there just to prove it can be done or
shoots and like we don't need something to be comment and to be really dangerous when are talking about plastic gun that can't be detected a novel sectors
you are positive something that hasn't happened and i can give you so many other terrible things that happen every day with with the free availability of guns
so you don't need to invent a bogeyman about i mean like that
we already know that assault weapons are dangerous we already know that that not licensing people in a serious way that allowing conceal carry to to spread that having stand your ground laws to spread is much more dangerous than anything else to to to spend this time and energy focusing on on these ghosts guns which is it's just
it's an illusory issue it's a ghost issue seems to me like a like a like a distraction and a waste of time it seems to me like up and also constitutionally wrong incidentally it seems to me like a percolating issue in other words technology is rapidly advancing three d printing technology is rapidly advancing
it may be difficult to make an effective safe as a safety the user on plastic gun now
that's kind of look awfully different in two years maybe or four years and so saying you shouldn't worry about it now because not a problem now doesn't seem to me to be the most responsible thing to do and and there are challenges with dealing with a lot of the other legal challenges constitutional challenges
with dealing with a lot of the other things that you mention so and by the way the thing that this is my killer argument president trump says you're wrong that one of the fascinating things that happened that the oh so rare white house briefing yesterday was that and sanders said the president has this happened the just commented and let the president and this
was happening and he thinks it's wrong
hot
i'm not interested in that that's not a killer damage i have entrusted all the many i and our age
that is anti three per to go islamic the money than any other that in iraq on making now gardens right i mean are at least as i as are and contractor
i wonder if you're misreading the politics i mean it seems to me that the idea than and is taxable untraceable plastic gun could be a game changer and ruth is right like the technology isn't here right now but it doesn't seem all that theoretical that it's within reach and that it's something we should be planning for and
namely that our laws have to change and take a different approach and start focusing on gun possession and try to get back but but i just don't understand the lesson of hastening of this
next step have access to undetectable app pens well you knew your maker totally fair point i'm money which was like it may well be that a more effective political argument because people get worked up about the idea of a three d printed
undetectable gun even though it's it's a fake
as a rational person i just find over blowing the threat from these things it pisses me off
there are so many other genuine threats out there we talked about one last week with to stand your ground and in fact that wherever you turn people are conceal carrying guns all the time but i find her eyes and was strange to me like right at this moment okay that seems oh okay i'm not sure i totally agree with you but i'm like ninety five percent error to you but if
you know we're two to five to ten years away to a situation in which people can make the gonna stand why are we laying the groundwork for right now
because no one's going to bother to make these guns too easy to get a gun and every other no not an undetectable plastic and does not that's not true and one that's untraceable all those things are really right now and we are handing people the means to make it much easier to get them despite those laws people don't kill people don't it's not that i'm
to people committing crimes that they have an undetectable go one i i don't want any other some people really isn't yet to some small number of people because he's now people on them the reason you do a lot of the reason i mean
handful get caught in crimes is rarely because they're gonna trace not never but that's not the reason the reason is that they leave fingerprints and clues everywhere they go and because there witnesses and because their security cameras that's the reason people get caught it's not because the gun is untraceable except in a few rare occasions and but i just don't like as a thing to get worked up over
over i don't want to do it i would rather get worked up over the thing that does seem to me to be killing lots of people and which seems an active thread not not the matter with the hype around in order to govern and then bam my country is not a wash and guns i might get care more right no i mean look very as a hyper asked an argument and even if we are facilitating the next big terrorists
act when you're thinking about risk rationally that doesn't stack up against all of the you know homicides and suicides by gun which way countenance everyday and name mount through the years however i think a lot of people have a different gut reaction to the notion of plastic undetectable guns on airplanes
that seems dangerous
so clinically i saw this on a different way which is that an in my assumption was trump was having and just like gut reaction of like wait a second this doesn't sound like a very good idea and has both come out in favor of guess on as you know part of freedom and liberation under the second amendment and also expressed doubts about it that kind of having and both
ways but you may be right that it is actually winning political issue which and therefore and therefore gun safety and gun control it should work be very worked up over it because they can win on it
that's a good argument i just i just think it's i think it's not season
not nearly the problem that people want to make it out but that but you're right
as a political issue it might be a winner hair as pretty good i think team that are effective way on now we did we got him
nordstrom has a special holiday tree for you for a limited time on nordstrom him dot com get free two day shipping and select areas on thousands of items just in tears that cut on their site to see all the great items you can shop exclusion supply
in the category of comically wicked ideas springing from need money bags who populate the top of the current administration we bring new treasury secretary newton's latest notion floated phone and privately and almost certainly not go anywhere but has no she has to cut capital gains by one hundred to two hundred billion couple of games taxes excuse me
by one hundred to two hundred billion dollars over the next day decade by changing how the treasury accounts for inflation capital gains and doing this without legislation doing this by feared by stroke of the pen at the treasury department and how they interpret certain regulations currently if you buy a share of something at one hundred dollars a share and it goes two thousand
to share and you sell it you pay taxes on them at nine hundred dollar difference at the relatively low capital gains rate internet might not know normal income it but if inflation if you sort of said inflation if if if you if you had that hundred dollars and inflated over time it would have been worth two hundred dollars
so you should only be taxed on the difference between the two between the two hundred dollars in one thousand dollar so you'd only be taxed on eight hundred dollars and you would save a significant amount of money and it has called indexing it has been rejected repeatedly or never adopted repeatedly by the by congress the bush administration also consider doing this by fear
at some point about fifteen years ago and didn't do it
so ruth
how could they even be contemplated to pure giveaway to the richest people in the country and they really were thinking about doing now okay it is yet another pure giveaway to the richest people in the country and it is outraged piled upon outrage there is the outlay hours
piled upon outraged piled upon outrage
currently i'm going to say outrage number one is that we are in a deficit soaring position i know we don't talk about it or worry about it anymore in which the last thing we need to do as trillion dollar deficits come roaring back is to add another come
one hundred billion dollars to the dead at least number two is that if you were going to spend that extra money these that either last human beings on earth on whom you would spend it and that would be the super rich who would reap the
is there something bigger than my share
super lion's share of the benefit here than i am interrupt or that statistic that i yet and amazing so more than ninety percent of the benefits go to the top ten percent eighty six percent of the top one percent and nearly two thirds to the top point one percent thank you numbers are good things there's there's john
iron chef so they don't these these are not forgotten trump voters said he told us he was going to be paying attention to the forgotten meant working men and women number three on which is just what send you into kind of hyperspace of outrage is the notion of doing this by executive see at
i thought we heard a lot of complaints during the obama administration about how he was doing things to executive order and it was outrageous and we needed to pass legislation and the notion that you could pass a tax cut by the stroke of the president's pen is just crazy making and it should be
particularly crazy making to people who call themselves conservatives okay i'm done to why did they float this idea and when it's obviously not going to happen they've already basically walked back oh don't don't don't don't be so sure of a yeah i feel like a floating it because they think it's bad to have people you know nah
be able to account for inflation on there
benefits i mean the other thing i'm puzzled by as if if this whole notion of adjusting for inflation is strong porn for taxes then when you make the whole tax code change in this way so they wouldn't benefit the super rich i shouldn't we have this rationalization if that's what it is happen for the rest of us
ooh i am i'm puzzled by that so emily here's where i actually didn't interrupt you okay so i don't need to
to be a girl and apologize all the time
we do actually have some rationalization but not all currently built into the tax code for example income tax brackets for regular income are indexed for inflation so if you were designing the perfect tax code also known as not in any way the tax code that we now have there might be a legitimate are
you meant for designing a capital gains code that also took inflation into account but let's be serious we have a capital gains rate that is david pointed out is way better than the raid on most people's ordinary income it is huge benefit if you can take your income and realize
as a capital gain so that people it's not only that the people who are benefiting from this change don't need an additional set of tax cuts it's that they are already benefiting from the kind of dual nature of the tax code which gives preferences to capital
games already so on in another break and by the way let's tie have some numbers also was just a study by the institute for taxation and economic policy i think i'm getting the name right that looks at the totality of tax cuts that have been a mass during the bush clinton bush
obama and trump years and it came up with two trillion dollars not two trillion dollars total but two trillion dollars was the amount that slowed to the top one percent these top one percent the don't need more to we have this rich guy economy problem we're basically the entire upper out
rios corporate oriented around help in the super rich and earth were isn't the republican party though
one hundred percent oriented around i feel like even magnified by the fact that the two top economic policy makers and the country who are you are the president and his treasury secretary come from part of the economy bitter fond memory different than the part three community most with limit to minute and comes out of finance
and trunk comes out of real estate and neither of those are the are you really know of those are the path of the economy where people you have a lot of workers who are working for a company who benefit who who are relatively low paid and who benefit from economic growth the bearer finances is essentially an intellectual profession where your
or you're competing for money and it's not about the creation of of economic activity that helps the world really i mean if only indirectly that way and real estate it's about accumulation of a
asset which only one person can have access to and as doesn't it doesn't employ people to it doesn't create jobs for people in a way that other professions do and i think that as a result we have we end up with it it magnifies the tendency to do economic policy that really just helps rich people rather than thinking about work or how workers can benefit and
and one
we've seen we've seen one other point which is to sleep in separate point which is the benefit of the term tax cuts has fallen overwhelmingly the corporation does it was expected
and what of corporations done with all that money is that they don't stock buybacks show that they've spent a huge percentage of the money that they're getting to buy back their own stock which basically benefits shareholders should benefit c e o's in particular because see tend to hold lot of stock and doesn't benefit workers at all because workers don't get enough
thing because most workers don't own anything more than a normal share and the companies that they worked for and and instead it again that's a game that has simply flown to the very rich in a way that that the economically completely unproductive it's not investment it's not new new planets it's not new jobs it's nothing like that it simply it simply
capital gains for the the richest people in the country it just makes you say so this is like that comically pluto craddock propose all flooded as you said by stephen and the treasury is actually a like has untold wealth by a president as lots of wealth are their political consequences
for that's that seems pretty easy to grasp on if they don't do it
you people will hear about it so that there's one other player that we should mention here who's the president relatively new economic advisor larry kudlow who is also a big proponent of this i was a session on the hill with a bunch of congressional aides earlier this week and i saw somebody asked the question should we take this proposal syria
leslie and as something they would deal either unilaterally or through legislation i thought they were gonna add this is a bipartisan group lotta off the table for the reasons you suggest that this is not a political winner and they said none are now this this this looks like it could be serious so brace yourselves
well if the democrats don't find a way to throw in the face the term folks and throw in the face and republican politicians the unfairness of good what's happened in the economy in the unfairness of a tax cuts
they are committing political i'll practice they gotta be able to to to indicate that to voters because it's disgusting it's absolutely disgusting what has happened to regular wrote a regular workers on the contrary and nano workers in the country when you look at the benefits that are going to the richest people it just there should be pitchforks there should be petra
fun and and class warfare there should be class warfare it's incredible but there isn't cause worker can you guys even come up with a more appalling measure do come up with something which would be like wow
they really came up with something that was just really gross even and there are some if you know we talk about targeted tax cuts this this tax cut is exquisitely well targeted i think again
pass and said emily pointed out yeah the inheritance tax changes are equally disgusting tank good yeah that's a good one too but you know that i think that the answer to the democrats malpractice and i agree with you is it is very hard when the president has the argument about an economy that is
worrying at four point one percent growth albeit for a quarter and be it to stop by advance spending by people who are trying to deal with his is coming tariffs and things like that he if people don't take in details about economic argument
it's a kind of take in the sort of broad sense of how they're feeling and broad numbers and the economy's doing pretty well right now and that is wind republicans backs
approximately every two hours one pennsylvania dies from the trunk of us left want mothers fathers
children and fans
explains because every second counts
see the live stream
blocks
a visiting paid back splash of the night
people of pennsylvania taxpayer dollars are let's go to cocktail chatter
you're sitting on your yacht
emily
your yacht your low tax yard and shadow
the new york times magazine where i work is in the midst of publishing an amazing issue about climate it's called losing or said has incredible photographs and miss
stork all kind of majestic narrative and the thesis is that between nineteen seventy nine and eighty nine the world had a real real chance to deal with carbon emissions to prevent climate change and came close and failed and sell it is the story of that decade and that attack
and failure and it's one of those like historical counter and you're being asked to imagine that something could as
could have come to fruition that didn't
just really worth reading and thinking about and knees waning summer days on as you know we seem at least in this country to be further away from really addressing climate change
mine a family allows to you follow the counter arguments made by a lot of climate science people who i thought very effectively pointed out some deep problems with with a narrative yeah i have been writing that wall or at least just starting to and my husband paul saving on environmental and starting a l was also in
fasting some preliminary skepticism to me this morning and you know i think that's all part of that rate like you put a provocative cases like this out there you marshall your attention than you know other people knock it down and sometimes they win that argument that it's kind of all intellectually interesting
so your shatter my chatter is in the age of trump they're probably two ways to to escapism
one is one of my kids is doing is binge watching old episodes of the west wing or you know for me it would be watching like old hugh grant movies than just but but i seem to be trending much more towards kind of binge watching just hope he and issue tv series so my husband and i have been settled in night after
with babylon berlin as usual a little bit late to the game came out last year
but it's very tangled convoluted story about
corruption and intriguing why mara germany and there's something about this sort of
decadence of it that is a little bit uplifting in the sense of you're thinking about other people's troubles for a change instead of what's going on right in front of your face so i'm that's my cocktail chatter i'm quite enjoying it
alright
i have a cockroach but first are do listener chatter again listeners you are you still got zagreb a game to cocktail chatter in just a reminder were soliciting your suggestions for your you would be chattering about it you're at your yacht band cocktail parties
and we're asking to tweet at us at psychopaths send a third you know or work of culture historical episode you're interested in an article some data something fascinating that you
you think get like to know in this week's cocktail to her actually was going to be my chatter and then i'm green neck at green neck
beat me to it and it's an amazing set of info graphics produced by bloomberg about how america
it uses its land and actually the authors let me get the authors because they did such a good job so it is the authors are dave maryland lauren leather be on bloomberg and it's it's
a bunch of they cut the data different ways but the most incredible map which you may have seen and your twitter feed his his shows how we use land the percentage of land devoted to different human activity so the urban housing for example turns out to be where the percentages i don't have the percentages here
urban urban housing turns out to be basically new england if you had all urban housing that would occupy new england livestock is forty one percent of us land wow
crazy with never private family timberland it's the entire pacific northwest airports airports or airports are measurable amount the hundred largest land owning families together occupy so one hundred families together have basically have the entire state of florida which is shocking
urban commercial is basically the equivalent of new york state
the food we eat is basically pennsylvania and ohio is takes up all the food that we eat anyway it's a wonderful set of graphics that green pointed out to check those out to my my chatter however are too quick ones one is the atlantic has a great photo essay
of bike share graveyards and china so in china has a ton of bike share program i think this on dieting
i'll say i don't know
i saw some amazing photo essay on this recently like months cow them in my essays of the bikes sort of blake shares as they're getting launched the huge numbers of bikes but now it's all these bikes end up being broken or abandoned enter the picture okay navy sailor
status detail and so it's just these photos of incalculable huge numbers of bikes some of which are and dump some of which have been crushed into cubes in a huge piles of tires that have been stripped off bikes
it's just been do steam the photos and then my other chatter is just that over the last three nights i have read to my nine year old son the lion the witch and the wardrobe which he had never read and i hadn't read to him and my goodness that buckled up wow does that buckled up holy and keep dying because you now

so present trump this week as usual r h our policy is to fire people on twitter so he announced on twitter that damn began his white house counsel
going to be leaving his job to fall soon as brett cabinet was confirmed
as a supreme court justice
so that was news to dom again i think he probably wasn't shocked he has a contentious relationship with his boss
but he didn't know that he was had had an end date that had been set and and he will be out of office so emily
mcgann is a really interesting figure he has played many many different roles and this white house
what does his departure signal in your mind
i think the most important things he's done so one of them is the judicial appointments and he has been one of the most important figures and getting on a very smooth operation
up and running for confirming judges to the lower courts champ has many more people through at this point than previous presidents including barack obama and then more about to have a second supreme court set of confirmation hearings for american and i think mcgann well deservedly take a lot of credit for that
that on with the federalist society that he is a part of the conservative movement and then the second most important part of the mcgann tenure is we don't know the significance of yet and that's what he said toa mahler during myers investigation and how that is going to play out for champ and so that just seems to me
like this big question mark when you go back and look at my dad's role in the administration either will turn out that he didn't tell mother anything that implicated trump in those long thirty hours which is why a champ is claiming or will turn out that he gave quite damning information either to protect himself or the institution and that will change how we view him mr
barkley have you ever have you ever spent thirty hours with someone and not telling them everything about for example every relationship you have her head as a little slow indiscreet and sets settings i don't know maybe those being interviewed by the f b i would have said scheme my nasa but also you another way to frame that question is
what topic could you talk about for thirty hours and not be really like getting into some serious stuff i mean you know and it's like if there was nothing to say wouldn't have been over in a month
a couple hours i mean that's horribly awful speculation but it does seem to me to be kind
extraordinary but can we stick on judges for just a moment
well first of all let's talk about just the firing in the way it was done
i mean so the president said later when he was asked to press conference it him is good and they had a good relationship and when you fire someone on twitter that as a self swallowing act would just say you cannot then later say oh he's a great guy you don't treat great guys that way that they learn about their own firing on twitter it just is so anyway
treat people you value and and eight yes i yeah i smell that we are finding out that began didn't know in advance like there is another version of this which is that they're on smooth enough to keep that part hidden and which of course in this administration we have no expectation of that we assume we're always going to
find out and maybe this is just too big a deal but i was like a little bit thinking wouldn't it be better for everyone to save face here and pretend that thousand announcement them again that was in on well yeah but like so many of these things and that's an interesting thought but like so many these things like the leak of a woman in the press officers name escapes me for the moment and
what she said about john mccain in people inside who when these norms are broken the norm that you let somebody know even if you're going to make the announcement ten seconds later five seconds later you'll let him know at least beforehand wait overnight
any respect for them he has other jumped does seem to be can generally allergic to firing people in real life of course the the irony given his tv like that just that he's someone who doesn't want to confront people in the moment and well he could have someone else like you did with a morose as somebody else
but it's but it's so dignified and so what were the man is your white house counsel he's a senior staffer it's just absurd it totally is and learning that has had to fire people in my life it is it's like it's a sin to to do it and some underhanded way or some way that avoids the
the directly confront hate yourself it's pathetic so there's that then the second thing is i think going back to family is good point about the judges
during the campaign began with was who weren't with own trombone and campaign was wise enough to know of two things one that down trump did not had a clean slate when it came to the question of judges and also knew that because of that clean slate he could wire it and such a way
that not only would the donald trump create a connection to the federalist society and leonard leo but that he would present a list of justices furthering that relationship between politics and the judiciary that we talked about last week and present that list of judged justices to the world get the validation then of the
federalist society and the and conservative legal scholars who would say if he picks anybody from this list were going to be in great shape that was all during the election and if we believe that that played a role in cementing a lot of people who are who were wildly about trump as i believe good which we should and as i believe then mcgann is not just some dude who knows about the
law he's a guy who helped along with mitch mcconnell in his decision on gossage helped get help a lot of people get to us about donald trump because of the specific legal thing and then just on the numbers the senate republicans have confirmed sixty judges to the courts this congress thirty three district court judges twenty six appeal pills court judges and of course
usage and probably cannot so that's quite a record and as we look at the trump administration and the disconnect between the reality show and the reality what's being done at the agency's what's not being done regulations that are being removed judges has to be maybe is arguably the greatest
johnson says success juggernaut a complex set of accomplishments for the president which don't get covered that much and they are big and real and will affect people's lives
in a really big and subsidy way even though much as a public attention is often spent on the various flaps yeah and when we that we should all think about that is that so far in the champ administration some of the biggest moments of refusing to go along with trump administration
excess have come from the judiciary and so if you imagine a judiciary transformed and really different from the one we have now you could imagine many fewer moments in which judges are resisting presidential power that's been expressed in like arbitrary
well rickety ways like without the travel ban the family separation is just played really crucial roles in those moments where we get a that's because we get back to you again the the big
an overarching issue of american politics which as we have a legislative branch that doesn't function and doesn't exercise i draw although of course for the people who are happy with those numbers that i just read to you earlier not only is the legislative branch is functioning perfectly which is to say they're shuttling these judges through really quickly and i mean
obviously you want to legislative branch in which you know all voices are heard and things are adjudicated and all that but for people who are of a
certain political view that then it's were no i don't worry i don't i think it would be hard for any any republican who actually believed in the constitution or believe me american system of government to say that the legislative branches working really well there's no regular order third committee hearing and there's no serious legislation there's no check on the press
didn't through legislation i mean it's that's
one example yeah know i know you but you know what i'm saying now right i mean what love you think of it in the longer time that the judges matter a great deal and then you only change the dynamic on when congress so and so congress family let's turn actually to an interesting story and the washington post on thursday which made the
case for that
using a game of throne metaphor which i don't dare repeat but they game of throne has met afford it
and said essentially that the the trump white house is not prepared for what will happen when if if the house was taken by democrats and in particular began his departure mean that the white house counsel's office is down it's will be down at the council but also for of the five deputy white house counsel's or
or gone so there's only one currently i'm in one deputy way have council who in place and they're about to be hit with it just us
if democrats take the house and absolute barrage a storm of records request subpoenas demands for documentation
which they're not ready for and in investigations all across the board not at all russia related their brushes a small fraction of that there's so many different particular investigations that democrats want to do and so much oversight that they want to engage in in the white house is not equipped for that
did that ring true to you and also if that happens
if the white house is not in fact prepare what what what will happen as a result
i think with these moments it's all about who comes in acts but then when you also think about the churn and the champ administration and the implications of being fired on twitter you wonder what quality of layer is gonna want this job knacks now i mean rudy giuliani has been angling for it since the beginning so as bad but you also people
like emmett flag who is president layer who i would think is i would say the least in the press
nothing off he seems to be in position for this to so if you imagine that they can get someone really competent to bring in his or her people then you feel like okay so you fill those deputy slots in their months away from congress actually changing hands if in fact that happens that's not a done deal and they have time to prepare for all of that
it's a question of like how they're going to get some one really good in there with the really good people that seems like the beta unanswered one well and also you could question whether i'm having four out of five deputy white house counsel spot spots
mt is a feature not a bug
which is to say oh we can't retreat these requests we'd lot we wish we could help but you know just so much paperwork and and they just slow walk the whole thing the i interviewed lindsey graham yesterday and his response to him again was
the president needs to hire somebody who basically this is my word on his needs to be ready to be on a war footing for when the house democrats take over and trample it seems very fired up to take exactly that a drowning everything about champ in the last few months suggests that he will be very comfortable in that little market
this question of you emily
sorry to ethically we talked to my last week you were on to whatever two weeks ago you're uncomfortable the idea that mcgann testified for thirty hours because of his ethical responsibility is to his client don't do those change now that he no longer works for the institution
that's a really good question i was more uncomfortable given his responsibilities to the institution of the white house although of course his client white house
he does that person yeah this is why nasa rather fascinated by so i mean your responsibility as as large as like ethics one or one continue after the representations how for example attorney client privilege doesn't end when you and the representation it goes like and death so a nonsense
no i don't think that ethical calculation really change for for him that doesn't mean that the practical it's like relation to an attorney client privilege doesn't
extend past death it extends to the attorneys to the attorneys not client stand the clients death does not end there it goes on there basically it's supposed to be for error i mean the the cases that are interesting that touch on this is if you know that an innocent person is in prison and then your client dies what do you do like that's only on the on that
who plays out in law school classrooms and has happened a few times in our history but now are really off topic know but i'm i'm saying to heard that
so in other words of this special counsel who's already had thirty hours of testimony with him is is not likely to get if if he follows the ethical rules of the job is not likely to get a whole new bonanza of information yeah i don't think that began leaving in strict by the buck ethical term should matter in terms of when he tells me
that doesn't mean that it won't accept that we think he already told my hands aren't l scrambled well and by simply giving them a dollar a timeline of events he may have told mahler a lot because of the shifting nature of the store but if if if a democratic house comes in and a subpoena
a subpoena demanding a set of records from the white house about
i can't think of when fortunately call them mind what are the arguments monuments that that acts or time yes
yes demand information about the present sex returns for the following reasons what happens
well they have to been they have legal obligations to fat and i'm sure the slow locking will happen because it's a good tactic but i don't think saying like we just don't have people and in it
sitting in chairs still work i mean it's supposed to be a functional white house office but i do think there's going to be a huge stand off and that who's ever there is going to be saying no no no you can't have any of these documents and forceful manner the opposite approach from the president's personal layers in the beginning of the mind there's no chance the president
will give up his tax returns without i don't know i mean without the us marshals going and seeing them
i think that's i think that's that's just right
last question here how does this affect the firing of robert robert mahler or of jeff sessions
well i think that is due to the extent that there has been this reporting that began threatened to quit if the president fired muller
then
some people think well now one of the brakes against the president's impulses is gone
and then maybe so
you know lindsey graham yesterday who is you know lots of people think lindsay has gone to the dark side but he basically said if the only way the president can get his way out of muller is if muller exonerates him so he said basically of getting of began as a way to fire muller
that will be catastrophic for the for the white house doesn't mean the president will do it won't isn't trying to do that but there are some voices who have been sympathetic to the president who think that would be
a big mistake
that actually doing i mean leaving the answer to that is well he hasn't been totally pushed to the wall he gets so we don't know but like he is as this all republicans in congress now that could or unhappy shine is now
super that's a very good point
we've seen a lot of talk basically about lines that shouldn't be crossed or whatever and but that's all
and don't i know that's that's a super good point
that's that's going yeah i think sessions
this doesn't matter with respect to sessions because sessions is basically a dead man walking
and nobody seems i mean who actually minimum condom mitch mcconnell did come in defend sessions the other day but this week i mean graham quarter like six different senators were like wow yeah looks like it's you know he's going to be fire now the question is there isn't one of the camera whose story it was but he said that the presence lawyers suggested that sessions could not be
that he shouldn't fire him before and mahler's report because it would support the idea that it's obstruction of justice because the president is mostly upset about the fact that sessions couldn't get it
recused himself and couldn't stop the special counsel so i i can imagine he waits that long i think at the most he waits till the end of the election buddy buddy
firing sessions at this point probably doesn't in the mall or and
well as a new a new attorney general is not accuse doesn't have a conflict so it takes rad rosenstein out presumably as the supervisor of sad investigation and then if you have a lackey and attorney general job then presumably you change the parameters you sort of quietly start undermining mellor and trying to
edit down and and that's that fear my name and to the extent that it give support for the idea that he's trying to end the investigation there may be previous testimony given by people like dumb again who's who might have been as seven months ago when the present one fire jeff sessions what was the reason he gave him the when and said well the reason he gave his that jeff sessions said recused himself and he was
instigation and it so who knows
oh my god it's amazing that all of the president's moves have to do with protecting himself investigation because i'm wrong doing have nothing to do with public policy that when you think about jeff sessions
jeff sessions
the two most effective and what's his name
the three most effective
members of the administration he forgotten scott who game that's so
i hope to never hear it again
i know but it is remarkable i mean jeff sessions who is doing god's work from the point of view of conservatives on so many france and the law and has been effective and a lot of ways that pursuing those goals as like turned into trumps who boy by am in there's just there's some just crazy weird like
greek tragedy element of that or fires
but i think you could i think
jeff sessions is the way i just tried to make began on a key player i think jeff the point you just both made his if you just think of the disconnect between policy and and her to impose yeah he is he is really doing the presidents work as as much as possible and yet is still being
hung out to dry the way is right
as you lucky fleet plus members experience every week we create special bonus segments of the first for slate plus listeners last week was an epic one it was well worth the price of admission which is for first your yourself for first year afloat both members did with thirty five dollars

a three judge panel again ruled north carolina two thousand and sixteen redrawn congressional map unconstitutional on i think first and fourteenth amendment grounds maybe we will say extra amendments that i've forgotten
originally i think you've got originally that map originally a different map with tossed in two thousand and eleven that map twenty eleven map had impermissible he deluded black voting power and been created the court said with the idea of deluding african american boats and twenty six team in north carolina legislature the ripples
chicken controlled north carolina legislature to a new map this time they said we were not trying to dilute black vote we're just trying to dilute democratic votes they came out and said the person who was in charge of it
came straight out and said it and he said the only reason we created a ten ten republican leaning districts and three democratically in district is that we couldn't figure out how to make it eleven and two so this is just the latest in a really remarkable and kind of appalling series of events in north carolina a purple state whose republican legislature
has engage in a series of really demoralizing practices to undermine a democratic governor rig or supreme court race regular congressional districts it's crazy
but emily talk about the legal issues at play the redistricting issues at play in the north carolina case because it's the latest in what seems like northern at number of these cases around the country
so this is a ruling from a three judge panel and it was a remarkable statement about the problems and didn't feel of this quiet the constitutional problems we have to partisan gerrymandering so to back that feminine in defense of the north carolina legislature who said yes yes were trying to read
democratic power to as few seats as possible when he said that he would have had every reason to think that it was perfectly legal what he was doing because the supreme court has never rejected or redistricting map because of partisan gerrymandering the court has not been in that business has not let lower courts do on that
regulating of how states draw maps so that's why you have these statements on the record from people admitting that that was the basis of the map can i just read one until your rep david lewis yeah justified the map by saying i think electing republicans is better than electing democrat so i drew this map to help foster what i
i think is better for the country yeah that's why david does is on the record in the way that he is and is now being mocked but in fact really speaking he was on solid enough grand when he said on that now is that a good idea i mean i don't think so and i think this three judge panel opinion does an excellent job of laying
out the problems from the point of view of both equal protection under the law of different voters and also freedom of association the problem with and jane man during is that you're punishing people for their political views and distorted and warping representation in a way that you know depresses the electorate mixed
people feel like the system is rigged because in fact is ranked so that's the kind of underlying issues can i ask what is the conservative case for not punishing states that jerry man for partisan reason also first of all it's not clear at all from the constitution that judges have the power to intervene so when you look at their
redistricting clause in the constitution it this that power to state legislatures mentions congress doesn't mention the judiciary so the original este argument from justice scalia when he was alive was that there's just no role for courts to play here and if states have a problem with destiny they need to change the process themselves on i
pass a law or ballot initiative on allowing for a nonpartisan independent redistricting commission and in fact those ballot initiatives are on on the ballot in five states
this november so there is an alternate remedy the idea that the courts have no role to play at all is extremely frustrating to people who are just like watching our political process on become so distorted and twisted through gerrymandering and so you see that frustration and the sense that the constitution should forbid best
from these judges and now you know in so the backdrop for this david as you are laying out is it north carolina all kinds of chicanery has been going on i mean remembered this is also the state which in around twenty eleven pass this law that had really restrictive voter id and took away early voting days and fourth circuit court of appeal said
that it was targeting african american voters have a surgical precision as you've got a lot of bad juju going on with voting rights you also have a governor where the ledge the democratic governor in the legislature trying to strip him of his power to make judicial appointments and put people on elections boards and then there was this whole massive china to change
the structure of the county election board so that they would very much favor republicans all this like basically just tinkering are messing with chicanery risque
he like that yeah all of this messing with the kind of structure of the democracy and a way that makes north carolina state governments started to look like it really is just about preserving republican power of that sad and i wonder why you think about this is the very end of august these elections are supposed to happen in nova
ember they have been the congress in north carolina has been elected in this heavily favoring republican candidates
way with this map since two thousand and eleven so this would be white fourth election with this messed up set of maps or a messed up set of congressional maps and yet is there enough time between now and november to fix this plausibly come up with a new nap what happens to primary
already had the primaries
the primates and i mean one idea out there is like you we hold the primaries on november six general election day and then you have a december election to see trains entire control of the house could be hanging in the balance in north carolina right i mean another option is luck it's dry these maps on a computer
i'm up with thousands of options ugly it's not like it takes weeks of preparation making the choice might be hard but you know the judges supposed to hear from the parties by the end of august i you tomorrow about what they think should happen next and these judges could order the legislature to come up with new maps in a few weeks
and how the legislature that if it can't do it will then the courts going to take over and that's essentially what happened in pennsylvania under a different set of time pressures because it was before the primary several say will loose make it all away
absolutely i mean the north carolina republicans have every incentive stick to the zoo to the supreme court but there's this sprinkle at the supreme court which is that it is for for at the moment and when there's a tie the lower court ruling is upheld meaning the ruling striking down the maps breck haven't i even
if he's confirmed quickly is not going to get seated in time probably to affect this vote and so the supreme court is not the refuge at the moment for the republicans that they would otherwise hope could know or so let's imagine there are some solution to this particular action but it ultimately get some supreme court when kevin seated
will be that because kevin a little bit five for with the conservatives in after november and of and are you okay so you're imagining a world in which the maps get redrawn redrawn some more democrats get elected north carolina and then the supreme court
knocks down the lower court ruling and the maps get to be redrawn well the thing about the maps though i guess they matter for two thousand and twenty because that's before the next census so dass there is one more drying of the maps but once you have water under the bridge all those actions take place i think gets a little harder to and surveys that and yet chicanery beauregard
who is famous north carolina
civil war general
statues of him yeah
chicanery bounding presumably they there would be more effort to fix that we're we're pretty far down the hypothetical lane
is it is tantalizing no to oct and emily
larger supreme court point there
given who have a noise and his record there is no chance of he becomes a fifth the boat
to get rid of partisan gerrymandering
things i'm into probably yeah seems as though that in but i mean look justice kennedy who had like opened the door to find me a method for moving again
a time a method for striking down extreme partisan and gerrymandering back to you open that door like twelve years ago and he backed away from it this spring cabin as one voting decision that i know about was to uphold the south carolina law that obama justice department wanted to strike down for being racially
discriminatory so while we know about his record suggests he is a safe vote for not involving arts and with gerrymandering
i mean there's a couple were point one is just i want to align myself with the man this is a short time it would require an extraordinary amount to have to print
briefly outside on new map you have to print new balance you've gotta get and the belt out the absentee voters which is always a huge delay
make a decision about the primaries like people want a partner in a district which have not been redrawn to do when the farmer
it's just a method does seem implausible to the other point i want to make it is obviously what has been going on in spades slick
pennsylvania or rico and wisconsin
met maryland really been a huge him and mentor is demoralizing but it's also kind of true that we've gerrymandered ourselves
and you're talking about the big soria the beach or i mean what's what's remarkable with countries how how partisan individual states had become for the most part that most states are now pretty safely one of the other and that even geographically
natural congressional districts are pretty much very well sorted themselves also that if you think about you know if you if you think about how you would draw
no she druid and squares but if you through said okay this is a natural region which someone should represent the city of new haven where you live to the new haven and going to heaven is one that yeah it's like probably ninety percent democratic and i i mean it's those out our district goes out but so i mean look it is absolutely true that the fact that democratic voters more and more
tend to cluster in urban areas has had an effect on the composition of congress it is also true that gerrymandering in extreme partisan fashion is a separate no no have mercy of course but
one final point on this actually either one of you i'm interested in your theory so they just to do some quick back of the envelope math
on this so as i understand and are counted release district basically so you draw districts it were eighty ninety percent democratic
three districts that were sort of eighty or ninety percent democratic and then ten districts that are sort of sixty percent republican yeah
it seems to me than know a wave election
those sixty percent republican districts there's a bunch of those it could be in serious trouble right there's been some discussion of that that some of the democratic candidates in districts that are not like cooper over rather say wait a second i'm not sure that in this particular race i want you to change my map right right right yes that's why it's complicated
finally
and just how does this all fit into the fight that several generations old which is the desire to have in particular have african americans have representation by african american legislators and which led to the drawing a majority minority districts across the south and particular
and has been crucial to the to maintaining representation by african americans in congress
it's a past generations for example of congressional black caucus wanted districts john so that minority voters could have a real shot at voting in canada their choice didn't i have to be a black represent ever hispanic representative in other parts of the country but it could be and it has been important
it also meant that
recently the democratic party has not had a white democratic candidates in congress from the south so and also that if you look state wide you were actually reducing the power of minority voters because they were also concentrated in electing they're very small number of representatives they couldn't influence other elections
so in the last i would say ten years eight years the democrats have really shifted in their legal and political positioning on this topic and so that's where you see candidates like stacey abrams in georgia and your guillen the democratic nominee for governor in florida
saying that a want to prove they can have state wide appeal by representing coalitions because they want to be more broadly attractive to the to funders to democratic voters they want to show that on you can be a minority candidate and get lots of votes and build a liberal coalition now way and
so i think what you're seeing is like in tandem that movement on to change the face of the democratic party also playing out in these redistricting fights where democrats are now saying we don't want eighty percent damn we don't even want sixty percent and there are some pretty good political science showing that
the penalty that minority candidates have paid in the past where like you know you could go to a place and show that john kerry got fifty percent of the vote of the of the wiper for barack obama only got forty percent or something like that there were a lot of efforts to use those kinds of comparisons to try to show
essentially what the tax for being a black or latino candidate would be in some parts of the country that taxes going away or it's much lower at least than it used to be and so the democratic legal argument is will in light of that social science it's were it's consistent or at least like a good reading of the voting rights
what we need here is enough composition of the vote of the electorate to have a plausible chance but we don't need to pack the voters in the way we use to

john mccain body will and state in the capital weekend
the eighty one year old fender and republican presidential candidate died this week
floyd has been much commemorated i know john dickerson you have spent a bunch of time this week talking about him and interviewing people about him he's been well remembered for whose whose side are to make fun of himself
willingness to reconsider ideas who's volcanic temper and sense of obligation and service
his heroism
as a prisoner of war
his interesting political career which which was all over the map elements of
conservatism liberalism iconoclasm some great choice and some bad choices let's not that we can spend as much time he goes and what i would like to as john what is going to stay with him after you know having a long relationship with mccain personally and then being through this week of thinking about man not it's a good question
because he was obvious am incredibly complicated guy he's supported things that were policies that were in some senses you know he thought his party on tobacco legislation to get tobacco advertising away from young kids and into
to squeeze the pernicious role of money and politics
and the tobacco bill died he was successful with mccain feingold until the courts basically unwound most of it
and and you can debate about whether mccain feingold itself as the right tool but having covered people in politics for many years as i have the power of people with money to influence their behavior and legislation is impossible to refute and it is such a lock
so anybody who fought his party and remember that in in two thousand what he did was he ran against his entire party and the establishment of the party saying that they were all corrupt because of their relationship with money now this is where it gets into some of his complexity where did his inspiration for that come from his own sin jang as a part of
keating five and he was not of the five he can make the case was kind of the the least involved in there were wasn't quid pro quo exactly he wasn't and he was doing basically and this was his argument i mean he'd so he took some he got some free flights from a donor and all of which was legal but
you know it's he used to argue that the illegal things are the ones that you that should be illegal wouldn't come out against the
the confederate flag and south carolina during the primary in two thousand and then after he lost came back and said you know that was wrong and i i am a millionaire palin said you know that them mistake though he still never quite but no he said i should have picked lieberman i think so
that's the whole big public thing i think what stuck with me as a number of smaller stories that of things he did in his life to people both known and unknown the mo you'd all story is i know one of your favorites david which michael lewis chronicled so nicely well utah a democratic congress man who took mccain under his
when when he first came to congress after he had parkinson's amazon and veterans hospital and was had wasn't getting a lot of people coming to see i'm john mccain made raider regular visits to go talk to my you'd all who by the time he was near death was not had no idea john mccain was there but he kept he kept going and lewis wrote about that but i heard about it at the time
time when i was doing my reporting on came back in ninety nine jacob who was who was in the navy for most of his welfare isn't years and years i can enter known anybody he was that he was the one who met mccain when he came off the boat
from after being released from noise
mccain didn't remember who he was but coop his whole life he's in he's a guy with the moustache and the pictures of mccain when mccain heard that he was dying and was in hospice called him and and just sort of backed him up at the right there at the end of his life which nobody ever knew a man i only know about it because i knew jay coop
lots of those stories of come out this week
and so there is the complex public life there are also lots of stories of him being bitter and petty and and you wouldn't shake duncan one hundred and i don't think for the most of his life till graham went and supported george w bush after mccain was the chairman i think of grams campaign took a long time to repair that so i'm not saying it was a same
and by any means but i think at the end of your life you want to have enough of those stories that people come forward and say you know here's a story you've never heard about him doing something to make someone else feel better and improve the lives of someone
my friend about mccain is he was obviously a great man and a great human being and the stories that you
meant in their john from really
incredible human quality and everything that happened during vietnam from it was important is there mccain is is there does he leave a political legacy
i mean i think that's complicated to under one hand the contrast he provides depressed and trump is stark and important right now in his farewell statement was full of the idea of the unity and against tribalism which is not the direction
that trumps republican party is going in whatsoever and that's important
and yet i also think it's important to remember that yes mccain voted hang on to the affordable care act but then turned around and voted for tax cuts that did a lot of the damaged affordable care act and obama care that he had previously offended
he also voted for trunks judicial appointments there are a lot of ways in which he remained very much
whale republican soldier in the senate even when rhetorically he was providing are we all alternate to have to trump as am so again it like it's just complicated
i do think the metaphor i think about with mccain a lot if that use a huge boxing fan one time i met him
i was interviewing and belt ultimate fighting with you hated and we got into big squabble about it
and he but barack boxing is guided by these rules the markers or queens rules which are which are rules about true gentlemen we behavior within the context of beating somebody in a boxing match and i always felt like that is a real metaphor for how mccain acted in the world which is that he he
fundamentally thought there was gentle there with gentlemanly behavior an honor in the fight even though he himself had been as a victim of torture people who are not fighting fair not treating him with honor but that he he was going to
with integrity even in times when you were in conflict with other people i think that's a like a very admirable noble and mike very last kind of tradition and i felt a vaccine you were going to say it was the one i always mention which is when he was at the naval academy name is boxing his strategy
he would basically run into the middle of the ring and just start throwing punches
which which has typifies the way he approaches some legislation and some of the political fight he caught in it wasn't exactly
it was it a lot of flurry and fury when he did the it to me mccain is absolute
standing against torture was the boast just principled thing about him that thought was a line that it didn't matter how much president bush was going to appeal to him to cross said after nine eleven mccain just stood there and
had an enormous impact by refusing to recognize any kinds of grey areas are compromised and far as i can tell and maybe it's because obviously like you see the horror of having the lines
washoe and the sand you experience that personally and so than in that context you hang on to them let me ask you this question which is in a time where there is some debate so critically when his own party about whether america is an idea or in america or america is a geographical place and we have a specific kind of
lineage somebody who believe that america was an idea which to his critics was a disaster because i believe that it meant that america wasn't depressed it's idea on other places where he thought human rights were at stake and that meant military intervention
for the restless support for the iraq war right so his his critics the idea that he supported which is the idea that people should be free and that america should go in intervene in the service of that idea is obviously one of their if not their biggest critique against him and yet in the moment when he is speaking out against what he calls the spirit
the spurious nationalism he is arguing america is an idea it is not a place it is not a land of blood and soil
so how to you is there a place for the virulent mccain critics on policy grounds to nevertheless support his affirmation in all that he did have the idea that america is a set of ideas and not something that you get just because you were born here guess there
i certainly that is my belief that is what i want even to somebody who has become increasingly skeptical of american military intervention i would so much rather have that sense of what america is than the than the blood and soil fence of it wasn't little sense of it is is sick and narrow and vicious
and and also creates a worse world clearly grits are worse world there are huge problems with the mccain project power invade everybody let's attack iran motive but you know if you force me to pick one of them i would much much rather have it in america that is too ambitious and too idealistic abroad and
one that is that an isolationist and narrow and and shuts itself off i think you could also argue yes america is an idea now let's fight over what that idea is and let's have an idea that actually like helps or at least is available and accessible to all americans i mean there's always struggle
for me and understanding what the idea is if it doesn't translate into policies that make lots of people's lives better and i think the potential power of of the idea and this is now i'm slipping and changing that to really mean norms i think you know
oh a lot this week people been talking about his concession speech in two thousand and eight to president obama and the time at the smith dinner during the campaign in which again we're measuring moral distance here of the moment where you have the president who's and off is now as for five years america's chief birth her and you have mccain when he was running for president at the
smith dinner
and when obama is there in the audience praising him while he's in the middle of a political fight against him praising him for his good qualities and then in his concession speech trying to create because he was trying to live up to his notion of an idea of what a good loser is back to your boxing metaphor david
you know trying to deliver a speech that they praised obama and set the conditions for coming back together
and that's all based around this notion of an idea of how you're supposed to behave which which is very much up for grabs in parts of our political life right now

extremely delicious rob as my wife the other night
they like this for a shrub had drank a shrub yes
robbins know over strobe it's like a vinegar very the vinegar free drink but you can mix it with alcohol
the shrub itself is called even worth not garlic and then if you mix it with are called still called a shrub
i think she had a gin clear with jim
prefer with vodka because i don't get she wasn't drinking a bus she was not talking about shoot having a shrug very been agree but fruity shrub when you're having that emulate what will you be chattering about you if you ever get lucky chance to have a shrub
i now have to wait for that
a lot with my oatmeal which has not arrived in new haven yet so california ended cash bal on this week which is a big deal and means uprooting the bal industry and yeah add on a lot of civil rights groups and thought hard for our farm in california ended up opposing this
oh and feeling very concerned about what the implications are going to be and the reason is that along the way tag gathering enough votes to pass according to its sponsors that bill created much more room for judges to put people in preventive detention in other words you get arrested the prosecutor say that you're a danger you're no longer
are going to have to find the money for are some really high a bail as the way of presumably keeping you locked up before trial the judge is going to be able to say like your risk it so we're keeping you for that reason and i just have no idea i mean no one does of whether the fears
is about this
new regime in california are gonna be realized are not and part of the reason is that california is also waiting for a ruling from its supreme court about the constitutionality of bail and the court could limit the categories of people who are eligible for preventive detention and away and what i think take away a lot of the
sting the potential staying of this of this new way of approaching where people and up before their trials so they're just all these unresolved questions but for me the thing that i keep coming back to his that it's become really clear to me and my reporting that eliminating cash bail is like absolutely
we should do in this country and for profit bail is just a scored on the nation and yet figuring out what's going to replace said for people accused of felonies and violent felonies is not obvious like their various ways that on the state can deal at those situations you know in my view you want to be detaining as few
people as possible when they're presumed innocent new jersey's reforms are a lot of interest to me they've been operating for a while new jersey just is a different animal from california
it was much more orderly and unified in its approach to getting rid of cash bail california when in this other direction from the point of view of the laboratory of democracy or just a journalist observing it's good news to have lots of different models but i just don't know what to make of this spell in california
you can make a hat
you can make a
what a new yorker well my channel or is
when i was in south bend indiana on monday interviewing porn
president jimmy carter which was a joy he was
amazing what he has done with habitat for humanity and then when they do them they build forty one houses this army of volunteers arrived seventeen hundred of them and when you stand among them while they're in the middle of one of these builds it's the constant sound of hammering it's just as beautiful symphony of all of loosing credit
a productive work i'm hearing the stories of the families who put all the work into their own as amazing because amazing anyway i interviewed the president about that but i asked a lot of other questions including and we talked in them and show about sort of the distance the moral distance we travel and norm shift and change and and so but one than i was thinking about when i met up with him was
right before his debate against gerald ford in nineteen seventy six party was taking a train ride to the to the debate and all the reporters run one place and they were all handed by the
by the campaign and interview that he had done with playboy magazine he said that he had lusted in his hard about other women this caused an uproar a flap it was on the eve of the debate many people thought going to torpedo his candidacy
and so i was just thinking about what causes of president to flap new in this case he was a candidate the kinds of things in public life that get you in trouble he and so i asked him about this
and he said he said this and response i asked him to reflect back on that playboy interview moment that had been such a big deal at the time with respect to our current things in the current like he did not decide to make any in contemporary comparisons but he did say this i lost fifteen percentage points in the public opinion polls overnight
so that's fifteen points and he said all i did actually was quote the bible precisely because i just quoted jesus and his sermon on the mount
several of them out talks about lusting in your in your heart and so he's right corner says unfortunately it was either deliberately or inadvertently misinterpreted by playboy magazine i quoted the bible to you know the wrong destination
so anyway as you're thinking about how the presidency has evolved and the role of character and sexual piccadilly those it was once a flap to accurately quote the bible about not actual adultery not paying hush money for alleged adultery but simply having the
thought of
adultery in your head
well
much better
we didn't get a chance to talk about absolutely astonishing appalling store in washington post
i suspect will become a bigger story over the course of the week the news that the united states is moving to deny passports to american citizens
who live on the border people mostly of mexican descent to live in texas arizona new mexico live near the border were born in the united states have american birth certificates and us and same when they apply for passports well we don't think your birth certificate is legit people who served in the us military
raised families here it's pretty shocking example of fashion from on the creep
it is a policy that the obama administration started the trump administration is massively accelerating so it's not something which trump invented it's a bad situation i'm so glad i was thinking of chattering about that i'm really glad you got it yeah
i mean i'm sure we'll end up suspect this is the story that will have legs because it it's disturbing my actual chatter is another washing post story about something called epic nerd camp which is a adult camp i'm always suspicious of adult camps truthful
a little bit odd but a partner camp just seems really nice it's a chance for people to do live action role playing a role playing games cause play one making sword fighting quit which whether name
make effects make up the post described in foot burning nerd
and just it was a lovely story about people who have interests that are somewhat offbeat interests and finding each other and you a chance to spend four days in the woods with no judgement and a lot of joy
check out the the story on epic nerd camp
is it
so in the woods and it's kind of fantasy
dungeons and dragons slash harry potter slash talking are lots of different cultures so there's there's some their detriment token the different when harry potter there's some star trek people are star wars people are people so there's been a lot of different stuff nice it's all all
all the universe is mary together
that's good

the sexual assault allegation term christine policy ford has prompted a delay and the judiciary committee boat as we're talking the committee has proposed that ford and cavanaugh come in as asked both of them to come in on monday
to testify before the committee
just them individually no other witnesses no other investigation ford meanwhile has asked apparently through her lawyer that no hearing be held or no testimony be taken until after an f b i investigations conducted into her allegations as i understand that the committee has given for a deadline of friday at ten am
to decide whether she's going to testify on monday
there's just so much going on in this story and it's so complicated
but emily when they start with a simple question which is if there is no investigation should doctor policy for testify on monday wow so first of all i think the classroom and investigation is a completely reasonable line and make sense if you're trying to actually ascertain the truth of these accusations stats
investigators do they look and surrounding circumstances and look for corroborating evidence this accusation is about something that took place thirty six years ago and it's possible that people aren't going to remember whether this party happened when it was etc but at least one would want to allow investigators a chance to try to sort that out
you know especially because cavanaugh said that he wasn't at any up at this party and that seems like something that it's possible to at least find out more about so i understand why a doctor but as he is asking for the investigation i think that if the republicans are going to refuse to do it which seems to clearly be their position then none of that
you know republican senators who asked for the hearing meaning flake and corcoran condom murkowski none of them are demanding and investigation and so i think the republicans have decided that the politics don't force them to do one and in that case i think that if doctor but as he wants to
try to have an effect on this confirmation then she has to testify on monday
whether she decided to do that or not that's her personal decisions i'm not going to tell her to do it but i think that sort of how the politics have landed at the moment david french do you think this merits of fbi investigation before any timid judiciary committee tests and or do you think that the testimony should go ahead with the two of them
now i don't think it merits and f b i investigation let's let's be clear about what we're talking about here we're talking about investigating what would have been a violation of state criminal law more than thirty years ago
something that the f b i doesn't investigate now to sing though when we're talking about investigation people keep ask acting as if the f b i is the only entity
that can investigate the senate committee itself can investigate the senate committee staff must both majority staff and minority staff can investigate a person who has been a a lawyer on the plane of side and have been a lie on the defendant side in a variety of kinds of cases in my career including some really tough in really tough sex
rasmussen type cases and a plaintiff can investigate a plaintiff's attorney can investigate and so there are a lot there are many different avenues of investigation here and so i think one thing i think is pretty clear and from what i'm hearing is it's not i do not believe that republican senators are sitting there
going i can't wait for her to testify in front of us so that we can destroy her on national television i think it's i think these republican senators many of them view her testifying on national television is an extremely high risk endeavor for the nominee
and for the g o p
i think that there is a is you that if she comes and she testifies in public and she's very compelling that this could absolutely sink the nomination but at the same time they also know you cannot possibly vote on this nominee without offering this testimony and so i think that they're going to continue
the offer up right up until the deadline and at the same time you would hope that these committee staffs are busy doing their jobs investigating this all the while so david maybe i'm a little confused about your position because a couple weeks ago you were saying that you know if there were only four four bars there were the other two let's hear from them
when in fact investigator shit interview everyone else at the party so are you saying that the f b i should not investigate by somebody showed or that hearing shouldn't just go ahead on monday on without any investigation no i'm saying and investigation should be conducted by the relevant committee and so the problem is if you're gonna say
hey there should be an investigation and only the f b i should investigate when this is not in the eyes standard operating procedure and think that's a problem that it is absolutely within the purview of these committees to do these kinds of investigations and from what i understand at least the majority staff has been doing these
instigation has talked to cavanaugh under penalty a felony has received correspondence from at least two of the other people who are allegedly at the parties say don't remember a party like this
so there is something going on behind the scenes that is not highly visible to us and the f b i typically doesn't investigate allege violations of state laws but in this context the f b i had does background checks of every supreme court nominee and did investigate and need to hell's allegations about
lance thomas in fact according to the lane as at the time said they were unfounded i mean i'm a little confused if cavanaugh is innocent i would think he would welcome investigation to clear his name so that part of it puzzles me but i also think from lousy for point of view the republican majority on saturday
judiciary committee is not a neutral source of investigation right i mean some of those centers have already said they believe cabinet and so i think what she is asking for here is to have some neutral fact finders but you also have the minority staff and powered investigate as well so that those are both part parties an entity is
the majority and minority parts of the committee and one lousy far is asking far as a neutral investigator and that seems to me to be different from just saying oh a particular entity the f b i am
i mean this is a slightly different point but i'm sleep i sort of your like he has not been
the this is the senate has the senate is the body carrying out this hearing the senate is holding a hearing to decide whether they want to confirm him for the supreme court this isn't a criminal investigation this is not an attempt to open a criminal investigation against him
is
process designed to decide on confirmation and i feel like if the senate rules as set by the majority of senators are like you know here's how we're going to do it even if they're tinge was partisan bias like it's why not just go ahead with this she can make a point as she testifies here's why this is an inadequate investor
location and here's what should be looked into but i don't know that that necessarily that she necessarily is entitled to this kind of investigation well i'm not delight and tied on the nonsense means and i i feel like i'm repeating myself but if you really want to try to find out the facts here as david french road a week or two ago you would investigate and
idea of having a neutral investigative body that more people might trust their findings seems totally sensible to me i mean the already have a situation in which people are lining up on one side of believe ham or believe her with a lot of partisan bias and forming their choices about that matter so if there are some hope here
of finding out other facts that could help people see this in a more neutral way galaxy important to me one other related question i have about this is the decision to only call to witnesses when there's a third person market judge who according to plan for it was in the room and then also is someone who suck
ports cavanaugh his version of events i mean it just seems to me that not to call him our judge has everything to do with marked i just character and the fact that he wrote a memoir or maybe even two memoirs about his alcoholism and black out drinking and if they call mark dogs they're going to say to him hey there was a character in your buck who you called bartow cavanaugh
you you know talked about peaking and passing out from alcohol is that back cavanaugh they'll the republicans don't want that guy you know testifying in front of the american people but again if you were really trying to ascertain the truth here and try to figure out who's credible and whose stories hold up of course you would call that third person
anyone else you could find who was supposed to be at that party david why do you think david french why do you think
mark judge and particular shouldn't be called on wonder if you do think that i don't think that i think that if you can identify people who were allegedly at the party they should be called and they should they should testify
so you know i look at this i look at this and in a way that is very similar to the process of civil litigation this because there's there's no prospect of prosecuting a crime here
that's that ship has sailed a long time ago
in in the process of civil civil litigation
a person comes forward with an accusation and then there's a burden of proof and this is the burden of proof i articulated in an article when all this just first broke on sunday was the lowest burden of proof possible and court and that is preponderance the advocates are more likely than not because i don't want to have a supreme court justice
sitting on the supreme court if it is more likely than not that they committed this this heinous of the sexual assault even when they were a teenager i if it's more likely than not that they did this i don't want them on the supreme court in the same way with roy more i was utterly opposed to this election in alabama because i thought it was more likely than not that he
had abused under age young teenagers when he was a prosecutor in alabama the same worries and i don't want i did not want trump in wealth for many reasons i did not want trump in the white house one is i thought it's more likely than not he was the sexual abuse or the same for bill clinton
that's the standard which i think is a fair standard as that we don't want someone in that office when it's more likely than not that they did this well then how do you go about establishing that i tend to believe that the accuser the person who comes forward with the accusation bears the burden of proving at least that it's more likely than not they did it
occurred in one thing that troubles me is as of right now
the only people who have said anything under it's not precisely penalty of perjury it's more precise he said sort of penalty a felony the only people who said anything under penalty of felony so far about this or cavanaugh and to the other people who are allegedly at the party and the accuser to this moment
still not said anything under oath or under any penalty a felony in a court of law that accusation would be tossed out unless the person was willing to state their case
under penalty of perjury and so the staff should investigate the heck out of this thing between now and hearing and then they should call relevant witnesses and if the majority doesn't want to call relevant witnesses
then i'd say shame on them but that is what we we we require of people all over this country and very very difficult circumstances when they claim has made his to come in put their hand in the air swear to tell the whole truth and nothing but the truth and then make their case subject to cross examination that's the way this works
do you think if we end up seems highly possible at the moment with simply the two of them testify and on monday and may maybe is david friend says there will be a background investigation so at least the senders will come armed with with material to ask questions about although it doesn't sound like there will be the other people under oath at the moment and
we have one person who makes a claim and she was credible and we have another person who denies that claim and he is credible what do we left with at that point if me and i'm gonna check because we haven't read the testimony and i agree with david french that it's entirely possible on i mean in my view likely that lousy for it is going
be a compelling and sympathetic teller of her story and that that could have a real impact but we have to wait and see how it plays out you know for me some of the arguments people have made about why a lousy for it doesn't seem credible to than are not arguments that hold up to me on and i
for example because one of the arguments i think david french you've made this argument that you know because she waited so long to come forward that suggests that on i mean certainly true of makes it harder to prove but to me doesn't at all make it clear that she's not telling the truth
caitlin flanagan did an amazing job on the daily this week for the new york times and in the atlantic talking about a sexual assault she experienced that she didn't tell anyone about i had to experience of sexual assault in high school in the eighties i didn't tell anyone
for a long time we just didn't do that i felt we too much shame and responsibility to talk about it just seemed like something that was my fault
but i know it happened to me
and i have the same response to hearing president chant and others suggest that maybe she's mixed up about cavanaugh his identity because i would never be mixed up about the person who did that to me so i find those efforts to undermine her story
really hard to listen to do you guys think that the
peripheral evidence about cap and o's teenage years has his own joking about what happens at georgetown props to the dirt can prep the hence in the mark judge memoir about cavanaugh do you think that's going to come up is it relevant to senators need to consider that
look i think whether or not he drink to excess on occasion in high school is
you know to to let let me put it this way if he said look there's no way i could have done this because i was stone cold sober all of the time and remember with clarity where i was in where you know what i did and then there was evidence no in fact you drank too much on occasion i mean at some point
it gets very very difficult to say evidence that he drank too much on occasion he calls evidence that he committed a serious act of sexual assault to mean you know
it's funny how all of this is when when you when you lack in one of the problems that we have here i think is when you lack a lot of evidence one way or the other we begin to fill in the void with our own experience in i think that's one of the reasons why some of the articles that
for example caitlin is article that you referenced earlier has been so so powerful for so many people because it resonates so much with their own experience and so in the absence of a whole lot of evidence to really sit there and way and carefully consider you begin to import your experience in these things and i think
that's just a very human thing that we all do but it's a thing that we do in the absence of evidence and when that occurs it ramps up what's already and intense and emotional high stakes high stakes kind of confirmation battle political battle and it becomes something else entirely it becomes a big call
neutral moment and we've seen this many many times and so no i don't say that there's a lack of corroborating evidence contemporaneous corroborating evidence means that she's lying i'm saying it more from a legal standpoint is that is a lack of additional evidence that is of consequence if you are going to be making this case in court
saying that that's where i'm going with that
making this into a cultural moment sounds like it's very machine and being propelled by a few individual anecdotal narratives so i want to bring enough and smart article by sandra new meaning courts about on though relative rarity of false rape accusations are just something that i've also written about
the low rate of people of women or anyone men to whoever who come in to police stations and report a rape falsely and we've known that for awhile but added to this picture which i thought was really valuable his bed when people do maze make false accusations they usually have a his
three of fraud or mental illness or something sometimes there's like a clear motivation of revenge something that allows the facts to unravel pretty quickly and shows that there is some external motivation behind the false claim and also usually the false claims are like really
the floor it there you know highly dramatic accounts of rape like the claim that you know the uva student made and the rolling stone peace but fell apart which we've talked a lot about on the show
people rarely and make claims of things that could be mistaken for consent and that's the kind of claimed lousy for it is making here so i think that's important set of not just a few anecdotal narratives but some day that to add to this picture that to me
no balance against this notion that blogs you for it isn't telling the truth
there's one there's one problem with those studies so the problem is our our legal system just not adjudicate for falsity so
what you what you end up having as a general rule whether a prosecutor if the jury equipped for example a defendant they don't adjudicate the claim to be false said that the burden of proof wasn't met if a if a prosecutor declines to proceed with the case or a judge grants a summary judgment
motion and a sexual harassment case a civil sexual assault case the there's not an adjudication of false news when it instance there's a a failure to meet or he believed failure to meet a burden of proof and so all of these studies that say well x percent or false
and there's a methodological problem there because that's not what our system adjudicate for and so you can have a situation in this happens all the time were a person isn't a false accuser
in other words are not deliberately making a false claim but they're making a claim that is insufficient to meet the burden of proof sometimes for reasons due to their own memories sometimes for reasons due to conflicting evidence sometimes for many reasons and so i think it's
i don't think outside of the some of the fever swamps on the right i haven't seen too many people sitting here saying that doctor ford is it maliciously sitting back there and making all this up
what i'm seeing is more people saying that based on the totality the evidence it appears that she might be mistaken about one or more elements so you are talking before about a situation of proving grape beyond a reasonable doubt and it is absolutely true that rape is a famously hard charged approve but the notion that
then one moved from there to the idea that there is some large number of false rape accusations out there we just don't have any evidence for that it just like canard and when you say that you think that lousy for dismissed could be mistaken that's a very delicate way of putting it though what do you think she is mistaken about she could be mistake
and about identity of the attacker she could be mistaken about the exact circumstances of the things that happened in the room she could be mistaken about the amount of alcohol that various people including yourself consumed when you're talking about one of the things that's really interesting about memory
is that in this is a hard truth for people to understand because nobody doubts their own memory
if you say to somebody the thing that you remember is one of the most important things of your in your life you could be remembering incorrectly people get really upset about that and they said vicious not possible
better everything that we know about memory says not only is that not only is it possible that is frequently the case frequently now it's not doesn't mean that this thirty year old memory that i have seared in my mind is false it's just that i can't be sure that this thirty year old memory that is seared in my mind is true when as a young lawyer i used to
this is you have the law so naive that was here's one side that's telling the truth and here's one side that's telling a lie and i always want to be on the side that's telling the truth
when i began to see his on these really really important things in people's lives i would see people believing with their whole heart that their story was right and then sometimes reacting with extreme shock when confronted with contrary evidence and so there
is actually a really interesting malcolm glad well pod cast recently revisionist history that sort of use the brian williams controversy to tee off on some of these aspects of our memories and so that's why when people say we need corroboration we need corroboration you're not saying you lie or you liar you're saying these things things
things get hazy in our minds play tricks on us and the more that we can have that can give us assurance that this thirty year old memory is accurate the better off we'll be we're very close there's a article this morning and the times by richard feynman is a psychiatrist about memory and he is pointing out
in a way that i think has a very different emphasis then your rendition david french that when people experience intense emotion that back and actually make memories more powerful and lasting and one of the really important distinctions that freedom is making here is between are covered mammary where someone you know
a memory completely goes away and then supposedly returns there's a lot of reason to doubt situations like that and a memory that's there all along that someone has tried to pass but can't get rid of which is very much what happened to lousy ford what happened to me that's what happened caitlin flanagan you can dismiss bad as a few anecdote as you want but i think they're a lot of other
people out there who have experienced sexual assault a lot of women who are in that category and to me all of those things not to mention the culture of silence of the eighties ways much more heavily than the kind of doubt that you are trying to sell here though i realized that you know for republicans it's really useful to try to sell that kind of doubt right
now

under girding the carter pay page five application the text messages of former justice department f b i officials who criticized
including f b i director games komi former deputy director andrew mackay lisa page the lawyer f b i agent peter struck former agent peter struck and also a material for the former justice
if the former justice department official birth or i thought he was he's current current he's still there
an extraordinary that i'm happy yes
so it's clear that the president has the the right to order the classification of anything he wants
so david brent what if anything is problematic about him ordering a the classification of these materials maybe nothing as well so there's a couple ways to think about this one is
mr believe having seen an awful lot of classified information in my life that we have a massive over classification problem
here in this country
we classify way way too much information i mean he would almost laugh out loud
i was in iraq i had my super net computer and and my cypriot we you know it's a secret system and i would look at all of the the information flowing through the super net and i'm just like only about ten percent of this really needs to be classified so i default as a general matter towards more trains
guarantee especially on the matter like this that were conspiracy theories are just ripping apart our body politic however however to say that i'm against over classification does not mean that we need to have total transparency because the fact of the matter is some stuff still does need to be class
certified in i frankly i don't trust donald trump to make that distinction
nor do i necessarily have a greater degree of confidence suddenly very authorities that are responsible for over over classification problem to draw the boundaries either so i feel like we're at a bit of an impasse but my general default is towards greater transparency rather than less
it would be slightly more persuasive if it wasn't so obviously designed to benefit him if he pick things that weren't so obviously about the thing for he has been making noise around him at her personally related to him and he's that he is obsessed with the fact that he continues to use the justice department or use the justice system as his own personal
all vindication of his own personal legal troubles is what to me as problematic emily do you feel like there's any defense for what tramples trying to do you really think of it i mean it's true that over classification is a huge problem it's true that deciding and this incredibly selective way to release the materials that you know
mark meadows and other people who have been excoriating and castigating the mall or investigation and the justice department for a month practically years at this point on that is just a very specific an overly specific part is in biased way of addressing the of reclassification problem mean i just think they'd want me to do with each other
on and i've been struck by the response of a lot of or justice department officials that this kind of order like there's no precedent for it in an ongoing investigation i also wonder if it's really not gonna help trunk in the end i mean every time these you know incredibly part is and republicans have tried to make some
case of bias on having to do with the face application for carter paid for example just part of what we're talking about here they've just been proven wrong when documents have been released i think it's useful to try to try to get that tax between pete struck and lisa page you know from the f b i and the just apartment back in the news because
cause even though i think that's a lot of smoke there and there was a whole investigation and yes they were biased against but the findings by the inspector general at the justice department where that had no bearing on the investigation despite those important central facts i'm just having these kind of bad sounding tax out there is like a way of turning up a lot
of chaff that than confuses people and it's like a good sort of love obfuscation are just like smoke for time to hide behind and that seems to me to be like the only real utility hear that and just railing against the justice department in trying to undermine you know the people who are protecting them all our investigation right i think your chat
point is right on i'm a way which is that even if there is less in these documents and current pope theories in terms of indicating hammer suggesting a partisan bias and investigation and against him it creates talking pouring to create things to mull over think it creates just distraction confusion and and undermine and also
oh it fulfills what i perceive to be one of the implicit goals and the trump a president trump same a trip administration which is to undermine certain institutions of government because he perceived those institutions to be a threat to him personally and that to me is what of so unsettling about all of this the weakening of institutions which we
as americans should want to be pretty strong david friend she said this week that we don't have an attorney general the present term conclusion a remarkable attack on his own attorney general know i have certainly have no deep fondness for jeff sessions and attorney general illness find him to be engaging in matters policy will i find appalling but what did you make of that
as as
conversation for him to start
our time
the to asian of a battering that jeff sessions and the dating or months
i disagree with sessions on the number of things civil asset forfeiture some of its approaches on the word drugs some of this purchase on prison reform i mean i could go down a list there are also things he does that i like but i think at least thus far
trump administration i think history will judge jeff sessions as being a pretty courageous guy in the face of some pretty intense pressure from the president states to distort the wheels of justice and and so you know each time the president says this and each time the president pitch when these temper tantrums my
initiation for session standing firm and rosenstein saying standing firm increases and you know look i do think on that he to give people a little bit of background on the d classification issue there there's another reason why
net net i'm for greater the classification of the quarter page pfizer applications
and part of that is i think that there's a lot of people who are making a faith based assertion about the carter page pfizer applications that i do not believe will be warranted by the facts based on everything i know about the pfizer process and people that i've talked to off the record who have been at least
what connected to this process
and that is the faith based assertion you see on the right there sort of this unified conspiracy theory that exists and the unified conspiracy theory goes something like this that the entire russia controversy all of it truly boils down to the use of the steel dossier they got
this this shoddy dossier they used to corrupt f b i and everything and this is the fruit of the poisonous tree is all of this flows from the or page pfizer and what is interesting to me
is that assertion is often made most definitively by people who have not seen the document
and so i actually i believe two things at once i believe most of the reactions of the car to page pfizer are not actually you can remove them and not harm national security and the other thing i believe is that i also do not believe that these fights applications
when they're seen and when they're in context and that's going to be key is this just going to be a super targeted reaction that only redux information helpful for the trunk
side of the argument or not that in when read and context
i don't believe they will provide the support that people believe that they will regarding this sort of the unified conspiracy theory and you know once again you have to go back to these these fights applications where new time and time again by different g o p appointed judges and all of these people who say well these these fires applications were material
misleading materially misleading forget that the judges have the ability to go back to the d o j and ask for additional information and to sanction the d o j d o j if they believe the d o j was materially misleading suit every david i mean i have a question about that if that's the case then why with president trump be so eager to get more of it out the
would think that than the ambiguity who doubt about what's in them and the fact that people haven't seen them would serve him why would he wanted to why would you then want everything exposed where if you say what you say is true it's going to reveal that in in totality is actually doesn't that make his case at all i think the answer lies in some comments that he
made recently after the classification order and that he says that he made the classification order after hearing from sean hannity judge janine
and i can't really dogs don't leave out of it and lou dobbs and lou dobbs so the idea i think that the idea that trump i sitting there at the resolute desk remedy you adviser at like like
having a teaser confirmed as they did exactly that he really unify the ah clouds it yes yeah the idea that hey sat there and sort of like this saturday the remember the old saturday night live sketch about ronald reagan that raised looks bumbling when say the boy scouts or how america when yeah then that trump when he's he's reality tv star by
day and then by nineties behind the resolute desk pouring through classified documents i just i think he's operating under the same faith based determination and one of the reasons why he has his impulse to declassify has been for did for so long and said other people and his orbit who are not operating under that faith based determination are saying are you sure you wanted
you that mr president are you sure you want to do that and sean hannity we finally convinced him that he sure i'm in the veil and that is the concern about burning intelligence sources i mean this president has been careless and that in the past we have evidence ad and so the tricky part for the justice
part and you know in responding david to what you're saying about how a lot of death doesn't need to be redacted there isn't a national security interests bear i mean you may be right about that i have no idea but i do have to take seriously that potential problem and exposing on intelligence sources or methods and an ongoing and best
and and you know maybe you'll be proven right and these documents will be released and will see that the justice department didn't have a national security interest in protecting the classified nature of these documents but you can certainly see why trumps lack of concern for that would give people pause and internally
just someone who weird little more feel like
we all live with been would have since world now which is mean by that which is you know that now that there's there's a president who is playing so fast and loose with intelligence and how the intelligence or more per attack and pretend that i n enroll david david french's and initial point which is that we are live in this world of massive over classification remains
and it's you
i don't want to be put on the side of than saying okay let's let's declassify everything that any any intelligence agency wants to keep classified because they're not betray want your guess i mean i think you could certainly promote a culture of great er the classification and i could be all for it at having more stringent standards but to have this incredibly selective you know
self interested even if deluded order like that this just isn't that one final point about those actually question for you guys is so the president ordered it but it hasn't happened right i know i was sent home with that
i don't matter just like when it will it happen will have to see and also unlikely actually that they actually engage in a review process which i don't know if the president orders that was their review process what's the deal their david french shouldn't they just shouldn't we all be downloading copies of this on on our i phones right now
well you know the race a really good question
remember trump has issued some pretty emphatic declarations in the past that if not come to pass for example you know he he should the string of tweets about trains and or soldiers in the military and where where exactly that that policy was about a slow walk as you can possibly imagine
my understanding is essentially the positions been taken now is that his order triggered a process it didn't end the process
and one of the things that you see
frequently in this administration is there is a gap between trumps words even seemingly trumps emphatic orders and the actual actions that take place and so i'm going to wait on the d classification assessment until i see the final result here the ultimate the classification assessment
until i see the final result here but to the sources and methods point so i think at some point if he pushes this to the point that truly jeopardizes national security that truly jeopardizes the lives of say a source or truly japanese jeopardize it's a method that is vital to american national security protect
he literally vital to our surveillance of russia our primary geo political rival that's when it tips into serious people and b o j saying mr president i respect for i respectfully resign rather than carry out your order we have not seen that kind of thing happened yet but i think that that would be a tipping point we haven't seen that safeguard
click and quite yet
i know for a fact it's been considered on certain occasions but we haven't seen that safeguard get clicked and and i think that safeguard should click and if he is truly endangering sources and methods but one of the things that makes me a little skeptical about some of the classification battle here
as you remember the the infamous nunez memo several months ago which feels like in the in the hang of a bad break that yelled headache yeah yes mean that's probably just a few months ago feels like it was twenty five years ago it is just a few months ago but still hang of it yes
there was a lot of anguish over the fact that the nunez memo was going to be declassified and then it was declassified and you reddit new thought what in there was worthy of classification this is just a very poorly written memo containing information that we basically already knew but the the anguish over the class
location people telling us this was going to cause national security problems and then it comes out in it and it lands except in sort of again conspiracy theory twitter
with a third i am skeptical even in this context of the muller investigation and all of this of claims about national security and sources and methods in part because all of the mistaken anguish over the nunez memo there should have been anguish over it because as a cruddy memo
but not because it was endangering american national security every i hear devon and his name or remember the first time i heard it and i thought i'd never want to hear this guy's name again
somebody who's given nunez to me and bodies the kind of person who
just isn't is an embarrassment to the republic is terrible and his job he's a disgrace and you just want him to vanish and yet he keep and yet reality the heat but he keeps mushrooming crap and he he has to me a symbol of all that is all that have screwed up in america and i want him i always want him to vanish

why i changed the way i write about police shootings
the peace that david brent wrote for national review it raced around liberal twitter liberal twitter loves it when somebody who is on the other side takes on one of their positions or at least seems vaguely sympathetic to part of their positions and you know david you have written really interestingly from a lot of different perspectives
police shootings about qualified immunity for government officials notably for cops
and so let's have a conversation about the state of of police shootings in the state of how we think about police shootings and maybe we'll start with another piece that you wrote right before that about the worst police shooting that we've had yet which is the amber geiger shooting of both i'm sure john
a neighbor of hers a hamburger as a police officer in texas who barged into the apartment
a neighbor
at night and shot him
essentially unprovoked and she thought she was enter into her apartment know
she what she said it we say what was sitting on it attempt it's a crazy story the idea that it's considered a police shooting as ludicrous she's a she's a civilian she was acting civilian neighborly way and went and shot somebody in a different apartment but anyway we can talk about that and she's game charged with manslaughter it's that happened yet
she's charge as of right now but the grand jury has not yet weight in i would act grand jury to ultimately go with murder i would expect but it wouldn't shock me if it stayed manslaughter but i think murder is the correct charger and reasons i explain to my keys are david
first of all is that a police shooting this is a woman who is not he wasn't carrying out her duties she wasn't carrying out her job duties the time and and then talk a little bit about why you why you feel you're thinking or writing about this in different ways to their yeah i'm going to say yes and no to the police shooting yes in in the sense that i honest
if the story as being told if the story that's being told right now is the story and i do not believe that there there is inconsistent evidence right now that contradicts the officer story
that we can get into but if let's just presumed for the moment that the officer story is correct
i think that her identity as an officer was was important to her to the decision to pull the trigger and this is what i mean she walks in off duty she's armed and and winning a cop is in in their uniform most cops i know still view themselves as being closed with the authority of the state she goes into place that she
he believes as her own apartment and we can talk about that all day how that's not very credible delicious say that it is there's a person in there and this was this really an important element of this that she was using as a defense that he would not obey her commands and when he did not obey her commands she shot him
so in that standpoint what she's trying to do quite obviously in this account is to close herself with the authority of the police officer responding to an uncertain dangerous ambiguous situation that's what she's trying to do with her account so that's why in the one hand i say yeah police shooting because that's true
what she's trying to do but the reality as as you as you said it's not a legally speaking it is actually not a police shooting because the instant that she went to the wrong door
and the instant that she brandished her weapon in another man's apartment she was not close with the authority of the state at all at that point she is functionally and armed home invader and the person who is in reality close close with authority by the state he was he had the authority
at that point he could have defended himself a deadly force she was a criminal at that point so in that same point no it's not right to call it a police shooting and that's one of the things that i think is so that was so disturbing it was so disturbing on count number one that she is attempting to fit this into the box of her
of her authorities and officer and then number two it appeared that she received some pretty substantial treatment special treatment that you or i or any of the three of us would not receive if we walked to the wrong door and shot dead man and his own home
she walked away from the scene apparently without being arrested it took several days to arrest her she was charged with a crime
several magnitude order of magnitude less severe than what you and i would be charged with and attempting to benefit both prior to the shooting and and after the shooting from her status as a police officer and i thought that was outrageous to david you point out the police should shoot and kill about one thousand people a year in this country
for thirty seven hundred since january two thousand and fifteen
five to nine percent of those people are on armed
that number has gone up and down a little bits here and there it doesn't appear that black man
our been shot and killed disproportionately
they have been killed proportional to their share of the population but not perhaps their share of the population potential criminals or violent criminals
but they just want a fan like i find that pass and really proud attic as a starting place no and yes because it assumes that all black men are violent criminals and therefore the subject
more vulnerable because of their own behavior which is just absolutely not true and it's also true that cities where there more violence
does do are not the same cities by them are police shooting so and all that i just said comes from wesley lowery in general do and also the other point being that black men in general are wildly disproportionately subject to other forms of police mistreatment or or police use of exceptional for so peppers
pray for example even if even if they're not shot and killed it rates so what what in those days are what in that suggested to you that you were thinking about police shootings
cock eyed way yes a couple of things one is if you go back to sort as the inception of the modern form of this debate because we were fooling ourselves if we say that this debate just got really rolling two thousand and fourteen thousand and fifteen
but if you go back to the inception of the debate
and you were trying to look and figure out how big of a problem did we have a police shootings we really had huge gaps in our data just huge gaps and so what we what was happening is that we were extrapolating an awful lot from anecdotes and so you would have you know that my
brown shooting say in ferguson or they eric garner shooting and you would have these individual you know something there
it wasn't shot with letters at a choking the choking guess yeah
and so you'd have these individual incidents and then we didn't have a huge amount of data so then what would happen is you would look at these incidents were almost like a proxy for the whole debate
so you know when the hands up don't shoot when you know even the the holder d o j couldn't substantiate the hands up don't shoot
that see that debunking achieved first and partisan reasons and also said for some reasons good faith reasons
outsized important then news organizations notably among them the washington post said wait a minute
all this data we have about police shootings
is just wrong
it's way in complete so we're going to try to be more complete as they began to try to be more complete and applying real methodological rigor the number of police shootings skyrocketed like the number of actual shootings went way up and that wasn't in the post it and keep count of all the wounded so you know there's wounding for
every shooting so that number expanded dramatically than another thing began to happen and that is we began to seem more video of the actual shootings
and as i looked at the video of the actual shootings i was filtering that that through a prism of my own experience and i have experience serving in iraq during the surge with the third armor cavalry regiment and i have experienced not as much as an infantry soldier of course or an armor officer of course because i was a jagged officer but i was a jagged awesome
was outside the wire a lot on foot patrols
i'm in convoys in tribal relations in meetings in meetings in situations that were a hundred times more dangerous than any given day in any city in the united states and i saw that the soldiers i served with exercise greater fire discipline
and a far more dangerous circumstance than some of the police i was watching an american cities
and that was deeply disturbing to me so you have a couple of things going on at the same time you have number one the number of shootings is far more than many people believed and number two the circumstances of shooting after shooting from my eyes looked more suspect
what looks suspect even under in a war zone even in a war zone compared to being an american city and and there was a shooting i looked at in sacramento
where an unarmed man was gunned down within sec i mean within seconds after the police believe they spotted a gun when he actually had a believer cell phone
and all of these people were saying well the police were fine because they thought the cell phone was a gun and said no whoa whoa wait a minute i know that for example soldiers take into consideration the back ground level of risk and are trained to take into consideration the back ground level of risk before they pull the trigger
well so for example in sacramento i did the research and i found that there was you know maybe one a shooting of a police officer say about every fifteen to twenty years
that's not a circumstance and says i opened fire within two seconds when i'm pursuing not a suspected armed robber but a suspected vandal and that combination of factors
led me to believe that whoa wait a minute the way that i had extrapolated and talked about this issue in the past was it's not that i said all police shootings were right or that all it and there was no such thing as races cops it was much more on the standpoint of to be sure there are some races
dropped by it and then debunking the larger problem if that makes sense and so now i realize that wait a minute
there is a larger problem
and here's why i believe there's a larger problem
one and i think they liked it at your p for the or recognition that while the justice department in dade the officer killed michael brown they did fine if history of deep history of discriminatory law and forest man in ferguson missouri where brand killed you know to me that is very relevant contact
and i assume from the way you what your piece that you're also thinking a new about those kinds of facts on the ground in the past i think you've been very critical of the black lives matter of men and you know i see that movement of coming out of their fans of a recognition of those racially and discriminatory facts in a lot of places
the country the black lives matter of men have in families evolved into being more challenge the democratic process right now and is in a number of ways i'm looking to influence politics and something that was hilarious been raining about lately and i wonder if your views of black lives matter i have changed along with your
thinking about what kind of context matters for evaluating police shootings
well it depends on what aspects so for example their formal black lives matter movement still seems to it doesn't seem to it actually does honor some of these convicted cop killers who are in cuba right now
it's still maintains one of its goals is to disrupt the western prescribe nuclear family those things i just i just never gonna i'm never going to agree with those things and and then you know some of some of the rallies turned violent that i'm not going to agree that that's
writer or a proper in in any of these contacts so so here is my my problem i think in the past as i would look at those things the the violent to incidents the more radical statements from the organization and then i would say i'm going to focus on those things that i disagree with right and i was in and i was not
going to focus on the other areas that i was over time began to grow more and more alarmed by so then about you know i don't know year and a half or so ago it flipped over to where my alarm about the things that i was seeing on the streets and things like the substance of the second d o j ferguson her
court and the elements of the study i mention in my piece about the much greater likelihood of non lethal force but still very substantial for being used against african americans that became more important to me to deal with than the excesses of black lives matter the formal movement so if we
i think we all believe that that
people there are too many police shootings and i think david your analysis that officers are over preceding risk and acting more with impunity because they feel themselves at risk even if they aren't at risk what are the the actual remedies are improvements that can be made i mean for for one question i have is should cops always carry guns do
police in this country have to carry a gun all the time if necessary adding that they're really good question it so hard to unmanned and then giving up their weapons at this point and because we're such a weapon i used culture and so many other people have guns
that makes it feel sort of and plausible that you know i think let me go back to death terrible shooting and now we're talking about earlier we see the real dangers of cops caught carrying weapons out the time
i imagine david france you have a different perspective honest and say no you're much more of a second amendment guide and i am oh yeah i mean i think cops are always going to carry guns i mean i live here in tennessee i have a concealed carry permit i typically carry a gun
the i think the issue though is in here's where guys can christian democratic questions or it because we don't have that many people with concealed carry permits so look who come on the show and
interesting to me
just can i just can we just linger for a couple of seconds with them question what has her how often do you think you what makes you decide whether you're going to carry that day i said default that i do unless i'm gonna go to a place where you know like the sound engineers like wait a minute this guy armed not for the record i doubt the
as a general know or feel that will carry permit it
well you don't want to be a little nervous and i don't want to wanted me to feel uncomfortable now i as a general my default as i do i don't when i know that i'm going to replace that is a gun free area so like a going to school or concerts things like that so that's my default is that i do i use to tonight i've always supported the right to
kerry by my family
some listeners may know i was pretty prominently in involved at least prominent by you know obscure pundit standards
and the never trump world
and we got a just an avalanche of vitriol and against our family and including some really really disturbing things that occurred and so i'm very keenly aware of the need to protect my family so that's my default
is that i do carry and how do you have clothes that are modified for to where are you don't mean if you want to say where you carry and know it's it's very easy as just a matter of of
which you know it's a matter of gun choice actually so it's very easy once you settle on the gun that you are most comfortable and accurate with you then adjust your clothing accordingly and it's super easy you see me and you would never ever ever in a million years suspect that i'm carrying a weapon so around here in the south you know like if you if i say that when i'm up in in our head
in new york
and i'm talking to just random fogs it's sort of they look at me like you might be a little dangerous and crazy
that around here it's just you know you're kind of surprised if somebody has never carried a weapon
my wife's friends carry my wife carries it's just the norm for an awful lot of people so it's not even a socially awkward thing at all
one more question for me on it so i carry a phone with me all the time and against my my will against my better judgment uncomfortable touching the phone turn you know on checking tumbling like when you're carrying your weapon how often do you just like touch it or cart like remaining engage with it and how often is it just sort of sitting
you don't even think about it a responsible gun owner is constantly cognizant of its position but is not fiddling with it
at all
so yeah yeah hear you're sitting there your cognizant of it but you're not manipulating it and that's just basic safety and so and when the interesting things about the concealed carry community
look at the statistics a remarkably law abiding our best indication is that the concealed carry him community is more law abiding the police
which can get her back to live in a and where you've been saying that not very impressive but ah well one of the reasons and this is i think really important distinction between the private citizen with a gun in the police officer with a gun and this is super important i think for people to understand i know that if i
fire my gyn and it isn't unreasonable use that weapon i'm going to prison
i know that if i fire my weapon and i negligently or recklessly harm another person i may not only go to prison but my family i may be bankrupted as i pay damages i know that now if you're a police officer
and you use your weapon in the line a deity unless it's like some sort of like cartel style execution as long as you can make a plausible see my semi semi plausible argument that you felt afraid then you're almost certainly going to be acquitted and then you're almost certainly going to have what's called qualify
immunity against damages so think about the difference there you have a concealed carried community that is absolutely subject to the law in a police community that is sadly and very important respects not subject to the law in the same way and i think that has a real negative
pat on the police use of force

max max and i visited paid
backlash
eight people of pennsylvania taxpayer dollars go on to cocktail chatter
when you you more about one in your post yom kippur
mad consumption of food and alcohol and booze in your your girl falling down drink after drink what are you going to be chattering about two things actually a of hurry and came and van again wrote this amazing fannie atlantic that we talked about earlier and dead and and interview on a daily with
hey really recommend and i bring it up particularly because they felt like she was articulating something about her own feelings about forgiveness there was related to what i was trying to say earlier in the week about second chances for people and why it matters more to me that if cat and i indeed committed the factual sell that he has never in any way
hey reckoned with it or on paid any debt for it so i just recommend that and in line with that when i was infinite god for young people are the rabbi read some text from my mom at ease that has to do with died my mother
for my motive thought you said
from my manatees i know text and lift in the modern the modern world have a different meaning i was just like imagine my mom he's texting
oh really
dammit an ending like you it yet
i mean i know i was actually do at the can't the concept of tissue it
judaism which is what we are striving for on yom kippur war and it's some combination of like a town meant and seeking forgiveness and also return anyway and my mind he said among the paths of repentance is for the penitent to change his name as if to say i am someone else and
no longer the person who did those acts i don't know if i exactly think that you can no longer be the person who did the bad acts but i think it's really important to allow room for the notion that people are not the worst thing that they dead and that one matters more is what they do or don't do to fix the worse thing made it and now i'm going to sneak
in another sort of hit chatter which is anti to recommend a piece in the washington post this week by elizabeth burn and about rape allegations that took place at the high school she went to in arlington texas there are allegations back from two thousand and six that ended in just total disaster for the teenage girl at the time
time who said she'd been raped enlisted that's just did an enormously sensitive and also on comprehensive job reporting out this story and trying to understand why these boys were never in dated even know there was quite a bit of physical evidence implicating man as well as and or why it the teenager story and
it's just such an important reminder at this moment of how many girls experience sexual assault and not only does
are not able to bring the by its to justice in the criminal justice system but themselves are turned on that is still a reality that is present for us and fails relevant to me this week
david what is your chowder
well let me let me echo the complements tool is but story it was an outstanding and moving piece of reporting and did show very very vividly the challenges particularly and in this is sad to say because we've seen it many many times are in this country when you make claims there's sort of this
category of person that people rally around in a vicious way and it's high school athletes
you may claims against high school athletes and it's remarkable what happens in that story can be replicated has been replicated around this country many times and that's evidence i think of a cultural sickness that we have so i recommend it it's incredible piece of writing but i'm going to completely shift gears
i'm working through ozark season two i'm net flicks i recommend the show i guess the the the you could title it a little differently it's a named ozark because it's taking place in the ozark mountains and in southeast missouri but it's like parachuting into a family that's been bad for
a really long time
and it's it's just not only is it gripping on its own terms
jason bateman and laura linney are fantastic in it but it's really this interesting exploration of what it's like when crime has become a routine part of your life and then the the reaction when the routine starts to be disrupted it's i can
it's just a really good show i mean part of it is i'm colored by the fact that i've always been a jason bateman fan going all the way back but it's just fantastic it's so well done it's i would say it's a top three or four net flicks show so so if you don't like dark television don't watch it but if you do
if you do like sort of the anti hero genre you're really appreciate that show
my chatter also a quick double so the upshot at the new york times both the most interesting data analysis anywhere and they have a really fantastic
interactive feature up this week and it's about how we are connected to each other and uses facebook as the tool to understand it so it looks a different count every county in the united states and says if you live in that county how likely are you to be connected to a person in the next county into any any other county in the united state
dates and to you can see you know if you live in if you live in
dallas texas you're very likely to be connected of course you people nearby counties but in general you'll be connected to people in texas a little bit to people in louisiana and and
so on it spreads out but what's what's interesting is not the ones where people are just naturally connected people live near them which is true everywhere but when there are these weird other kinds of connections and so so the upshot identified a few that are quite remarkable
one is is how history ways on us and so if you look at people who live in chicago and milwaukee who probably in this case in the case of him talk about our african american you can see huge connections in the mississippi delta because these are families it migrated up to chicago and and
no walkie generation to three ago but maintain relationships down and the delta and so there's just there's a heat around now walkie but then nobody this other spot of heat down in in in the delta
in there is another in california in certain parts of the central valley in california their big links to oklahoma because these are still these are the keys who came from oklahoma and the great depression and the dust bowl who are now their descendants live in california but they maintained relationships that are way back and where they came
from so it's it's just a really fun to play around with
and i recommend it highly i also recommend because i cannot get through a week without lol growling the atlas obscure kids book is out today it's called out with obscures explorers guard for the world's most adventurous kid it's beautiful it goes to more than one hundred of the world's most magical and replaces the gates of hell and turkmenistan earth and
mexican cave which has crystals as big as elephants or to sneak island if you have a kid who's five five to one hundred and five years old they were like the atlas obscure kids book check it out it's really really good if you saw original book you'll probably love this kid's book and of course we've been collecting listener chatter
you dear listeners have been giving us great suggestions about what you were listening to watching reading absorbed with
and we encourage you to keep sending us great ideas at athlete
yeah fast
fast with your with your cocktail chatter ideas and this week comes from deb as rail at dead as rail she says
the new york public library grow up many lending library program a project for new york public library and it's fantastic because what does it do it allows people to checkout ties and briefcases and handbags if they are going to a job interview so if you're if you're a person in good standing at the library if you don't have outstanding fines and you've gotta go to a job interview and you've got to make yourself
look presentable but maybe you don't have a close for it you can go to the public library and check that out
check this out for a brief time i love that idea it's great good for you near coupler library for coming up with that
that is our show for the day the guy festus produced by just on franco researcher british laugh you can follow us on twitter and at slate get best for emily bows on and for david french of the national review institute thank you for coming in back and time i am the and clots

so let's start with you i think everyone who's listening to the show on all of us spent the day
glued to the television and i should note that i stopped watching
for just during ted cruz's question and so it was almost at the very end so i didn't see the very end of what happened to if something happened in the last five minutes
i missed it and i don't know if you guys to too
what did you make just first of all do you make of of the day
wow
oh weird
and no no money in front of motel
i don't know about you
morning
all
pride in doctor bobby orr mani re outta we got a ball and
oh wow i care
remarkable and bucket
i've been thinking about our all identity
wow it up i felt
the proper to you it back
i may have been incorrectly to her or airway
oh analyze our debt
at the trauma and know
it hadn't yet that were know that were the morning and it
obama up and an airy are we really are
denied the ballot
want a part it on
and let me repeat out of the
women who made break eight
you
people can look at me i'm at and
pumping it or it happen and you can be hundred our very out on her ball and not believe that one actually acne or you know i think that hard at it hard to deal with macmurray at me
doubt op
anyway
about a nickel
non profit
john what's what do you come away with from the hearing with
dr horde
you know for me
well i got her
extraordinary not going beyond what you knew airport
even make sure he didn't get an educated and currently undergoing pointed out
we're done in here but i think when you have an expert in it
like i and being an expert witness on the nature of promote it
usually don't get don't get
get bad and i got a great burning question you know
in what could all about her credibility and why shouldn't be credible that it would be a roadblock formation elevation to job
elevation or cabinet or treat for pod
who are who are upper grad here
came out and gave that variant
i thought he earned a man with incredibly passionate our then he basically maintain that level
but he what
area emotional pain
what of anguish and then i think in and or it got a little eat branded upbeat
and what i'm trying to figure out a lot of people
we're we're not and eight
the way a person
you'll be about being caught would be paid
then would be different from person to person would be paid and eight up they were totally being wrongfully it
appreciate what you're going to you
the behavior of that you would describe would include people a one hundred percent thirty something and i lack the capacity and at our air
it can hurt orient
or a bottle
when he
any club or daughter old everyone the daughter of a of an all like whether she had blacked out
a weird
em and get brittle net which you know after going through what he like you've gone through maybe that we could add a little great and allow for that on the other hand
weird own only
talking now
i did think and emily let's let's go to some of these credibility questions around cavanaugh that's the most recent thing that i've spent time thinking about it because the morning now seems to have been a month ago so he was adamant about denying things which seemed pretty obvious that he he referred to this year book
references been is not and all been derogatory about this young woman who was clearly been interrogated in a t denied ever having possibly drunk and such a way that he might have been fuzzy your loss control he said he suggested the words didn't mean what we know they meant do you generally down play
aid and potential for for understanding him as having been alcoholic or been somebody who could have misbehaved and all of that it seemed to me he was working very hard to try to ensure that he didn't concede any ground on this question of
ever been fuzzy
could there be something which i've forgotten
and he wasn't leaving a tiny shred of opening around that and that caused him to lie about things right
really really on corporate banking there
yeah right i mean he hadn't heard that why the arctic that are ellen
that and wreck way not why but no it wouldn't go at being a great happy and women add one
a democrat and i think that would mark what to call hard way but all of them
right at me in
eight than outdoor man that he couldn't really give any around on on you know on
ow
reference your buck
and then
money or at the right
but a court order to crack open a new holiday at all like oh no room for any a bad in that picture
up and now i'm very much it odd with another director of that people a new combat
going for that all out right i mean with another article on and that the more you know yeah i drank a lot and i don't remember everything but i think he decided to go that that would not be him and he want about it
out and that he couldn't do it or whatever he you happening on that way
oh the lead up or down on denial with the very grumpy and raid on about it
yeah go for our bit and for me
really it really raining migratory about the right way to it
well he made it is possible that he had an episode where he was quite drunk didn't remember what happened early has the easiest memory and therefore actually genuinely believes that that what she described didn't involve him
suddenly back to our no it and he added an you for him he a you admit it back to be a possibility and know we're left with that he had program without him fell in with you know honey in iraq the lake
at odds with all these other women or make him the app
the very good
brutal about the question of drinking
could be clear from a book from going on through your page
a trend
judge that bit
we gotta be the arbiter give any quitting on the political attack can we bringing up the cliff
i think with let your republican questioners do all that you can wait
when he can't have that his daughter praying for doctor ford and he talked about what the couldn't case or patient family and family's the most emotionally powerful why get into all the part of the stops let them at the politicians do that they're gonna do it why he why that helpful key or breed
eikenberry cut down on how your pocket going to be a fair and impartial guides when you get the bank and you have liberal cognitive
clint gift and democrat than you
yes but i see to use planes
because audience was two sets of people one was the president who did not want to present to yankees nomination or city was weak and and to the was very much plane to the president and then i think he was playing to the men on that committee in is very canny way i thought it was an incredibly effective performance
for those to audiences for the men
he is for trump he was his indignation his denial his aggressiveness about his aggressiveness towards the question he was something which which we know trump responds to in the respects admirers and that kind of
i concede no territory attitude is is very empty and and he's very sympathetic to the and in terms of the the the senders themselves i think they also saw themselves and have and saw the sense like oh my god i could be subject to this and look and he standing up for his honor and the way that
i would stand up for my honor i think they were the white male republican senators were very very strongly identify with them and and that is exactly why they took back the questioning midway through it's like they suddenly recognizable i want to be associated with this guy i don't need to i don't
need to protect myself anymore in the way i did in the morning but i don't want to be on record asking any questions about this i don't want to a computer doctor policy for it suddenly they realize you know what this guy is going places i want to be with him i want to get on the side of it and it was and the is going to like it i totally agree and then and quiet play
egg that you or your and them or county and i guess if he and ray or air hand you make them per year
the other already a panther and are now behind you back
i would cry and i think they are totally right about it
i play
exactly articulated by graham artillery garnett who get arrogant who do what the question
added
oh and that territory you know ukraine the question you win and lindsey graham but it could be good for any republican thinking about voting it will be a vote or character that nation
trying to shift from you believe doctor board
you are you okay doing it to him and or
sorry work out in our an extra hour of that bear
a matter for corcoran quake or leave it but bait voter in their state are getting a queue program
detroit
making and increasing the pain threshold
am from republican keeping the way to work on i think you're totally right about it grand prix retraining and court but it leaves out
we're all the people and our men that were gay
by air
at one end of it
economic her neck when he rebut yeah i'm he rebut yeah i'll end up drinking it currently neck dream neck that arctic arctic it far outnumber at thing you know the f b i investigate and that did not happen that one would presumably want
about finding a true
and about clearing your name i mean i think that with birds were the questions
the cannot like damned around if not then think about today and then thing mark guide the friend who would probably back up ah but cock back because you're going during game
vagrant me on a record that he republican atlanta and in a room on be a believe big out all of bone
pete are and factor that we can narrow it down there quite between character it back and eight that that think about actor and back and eighth amendment graham want could be the one thing about yard
to me what you animated film like well even the brand but you know i'm going to it that trend
but but
dr
them in a room a kid and didn't i mean he didn't make up one thing about it
our boat
whatever happened if not i mean you can be eleventh hour
democratic operative no one can create a narrative like that
right
put hoarding cabin on been room
why people i mean
making that connection
and connect him to the guy who wrote the book about her drunk
that bad it an incredible
he could information that know what a with by on that
god you're much make it all the more important you add in their current bill right and also the fact that that calendar which which town i was so
indignant about and and system to bed indicated there was on july first a party and which judge and tavern and the other people that the doctor for named we're we're at a party at a different place
and so there there's there's so much in her story that the
speaks to truth or scenario or is was confirmed by other
dig ancillary evidence i mean we'll obviously never know but judge judges absence was extraordinary and the and the way i said democrats were very inefficient and ineffective at making a big deal about his absence and the senate can force him to come testify they chose not to because the majority wouldn't wanna but it's pretty amazed
the judge has been allowed to stay on this ridiculous statement that he made one thing about been morning that i wonder why you think about that
the art of gravity or not not what he back backpack
in trying to cut back your bet ignorant come on out remember being at that party gargan mean it didn't happen no reagan that it would have been memorable for the people there already
oh we don't have her hand or operating went and air with that
you're going to try to in a way i don't think there cannot be edited year
i'm an avid i think back your all
like helping hand
but i didn't i assume you guys sit in the same exercise that i've done which is to think back like book was i like fifteen i think of episodes when i was fifteen and you can think you can call to mind the things that were most
amazing your difficult or shocking but almost everything else is just a mass like it's a vague sense memory or something that happened there something that happened there but you don't you couldn't with any accuracy say it would happen on the state or with these people it's only eat there a few very specific things you could call to mind which were particularly traumatic or
particularly exciting and so the chances that anybody else would remember that party that event like how anyone got their what happened is doctor for never said anything about it is nil no one would remember that so it's not at all surprising that nobody remembers the right
right and and we know about the way the brain
emily brought up a week ago and we add
show claiming that you know when you have a moment of calm might create even valuable but not an early broad memory and then regular old people in their memory
that may and
yeah john to that and i thought the most astonishing moment in doctor for testimony was that description of the last or the glorious laughter between the two as a kind of thing which would stick it would just like remain in the memory was so strong because it just you can just feel how she felt
that moment and this particular detail would stay with you wouldn't be so hard to shake and so sticky in your brain it was that was the most powerful moment of the day from and are lined up with one of effort and are mira bad at at an hour when he right hundred and gardening and fat black at
when quite odd the and he to make
her being you know
that advocated there's only one of them was a motive for line really
unless you think that done and has a long as a long game where she's just been waiting to bring him down and this is a moment to play which i think is preposterous only only he has a motive to lie them she does not really she's not making any money it's not going to it's ruined her life it's annihilated her life so that's one big issue
thing that i thought was so telling that the afternoon is that actually the republicans did not at all engage with dr boise forwards testimony they it was as though she hadn't even been there they didn't press him on anything that she mention they just allowed him the conversation in the afternoon
republicans perspective was just cavanaugh his honor protecting has on our heat he was speaking up righteously for himself and he'd been characters fascinated by a democratic clot there was no sort of substantive engagement with the actual allegations that she made and her incredibly persuasive testimony to that effect
at that
a event
wrong but body if you're a traitor testimony
enjoy reading up
agent air
a male republican edit or delete air
doubting whether it ever happened women in general
what any operated eric are allowed been
i've found a credible
the nature of the quiet
eric
admission
it drag
i think it may engage with got war much a writ running into a lack of a better grade and immediate problem
and aren't accurate
having an hour
that ain't no harm
i mean my critical thinking when you add me on our are biodegradable economic yet
i have not yet
and i and
and not yet know i mean and and
and why the lack of a coping argument really hurt
the night or of logic
everything we heard from boat by and i together will be unified field theory
now that it can be understood with the narrative arc
act that were
that i at this point assume that he's going to be confirmed i think it's very likely there will be a party line vote on friday morning where they will vote for him
out of committee and will go to the floor and i think not
be enough to stop collins and murkowski from voting for him i just don't think they can withstand the pressure that can come from the base after kevin has exceptionally forceful performance and the pressure that will come from trump on this if that is the case and emily you can disagree about whether you think that's going to happen
and for the game that arrogant
it gave up and cardigan workout he buried it right
rail on women that will be a good at i mean maybe they aren't
tomato it but i don't know what it could happen be act right and i can
yet about really likely
if that happens do you guys think that will be in electoral catastrophe for republicans do you think this is a thing which will cause democrats to come out and and be just absolutely outraged and turn out even more than they would or do you think as i think it's possible that this whole episode is going to really motive
ate a lot of republicans to come out and vote who were maybe weren't even planning to regardless of whether he gets confirmed i think if even if he gets confirmed they will come in or maybe it won't matter at all
i think
i think that democratic when women in general
divert from a broken to hear that line you been away
iran preparation not been heard and and and areas up their own
or very close to it
i think that it it framed on formation
republican not with women
and it becomes a motivational
motivation in
leave that out
people are animated by agreement republic will have gotten what they want it
confirmation of avenue
or that won't be a reason to turn out to eat around you didn't want it happened will be a big angry and walk around emily what do you think will happen with the court if cavanaugh as on a john roberts to so concerned with the courts legitimacy
and this
the notion that cavanaugh would be joining the court having pass through on the narrowest of margins in the most contentious of ways the so much question about his own credibility his truthfulness and the possibility he isn't actually a sex criminal what will the court be lake
i won't go guard at me that camera your me about incredibly emotional create and eight that world bank had on a rack grow back
mark iran agriculture am quite happy i mean
what happened in the crash helmet when you're in your came he from our you know
whatever it
aren't there
there will be
go more from critic government of weighing up require a make any five are willing partner or abroad and bombing
relate to women and they won't do it anyway because they will happen our could do it back or happen i can't believe over
hang in any way
out back haven't i heard that them
cloud hanging over him a background
john you're really good on history and on perspective do you feel like this cabin on episode regardless of how it turns out is going to the poison in the soil of american politics for generations to come or do you think it will be forgotten in the way that
these things
one seemed douglas ginsburg one seem important for this one seemed important and now no one cares wow you know a it
with you i think it merits berlin
create a girl and bird or create a liberal i'd i know
long term programmatic
in the legal community of i'm in
going back to the war court
i mean if you believe a republican cared more about it being ordered the voting issue and democrat
and her and that into a dramatic role
for trying to reverse the leopard
rude or that happened gotten the i think that i think anything
and more already happening but that happen on the lab and i think
gender
aspect and it and candor not yet like when a huge the conversation by ad here including now my way out
in our own experience in
an adult
you cannot get any any order and or and one
identity enrage than bit
and whether you articulate it or or i'm close to it
about a strong feeling you get a get you
go i think you will out an during in fact i hope it hasn't during impact in a different way
certainly left liberals been interested in the courts will be fine but i really hope this keeps people fired up about electoral politics like we can't rely on the supreme court to be the one arm of government that does our bidding
whether we're liberal or conservative you need a vibrant electoral democracy you need legislatures acting and i really hope that at the state level at the local level to city level and at the federal level that people are as indeed to ban that issue and as and use those institutions to move forward because i think those are the institute
that were designed to respond to the peculiar will the courts are very going to be very hard to move it's acting in by voting and by being incredibly active citizens and pushing for for legislation that you want that's going to make the biggest difference
the court is has become by because the other two institutions of government the other two arms of government have withered so and or so so bad and how they carry out their business it is declared has become overly powerful and so having democrats and quickly recognized electoral politics matter and vote and vote and vote and vote
that seems to me i hope is an outcome of this although i think what you're doing it makes great
it ain't your presidential election we camp where people at all current reservation about him but well name the neck or yeah
now that that is more important than any other optimal issue current and
we a job where you her certain odors but i think your your point
braddock and good adding a rope but with all of it on it
art that respond with different eat a different way that from an adequate know why we mean by and
narrative
it
embarking on and crime our current her right up by
on a you know from a lot on my current britain or day and a lot of to break
three and a way that it's not like he wanted at all
and it will be for naught i mean it that it's not her fault it is not her same the country but i am going to find that really really
but it's not for naught millennium
she did her duty as a citizen she did her duty with somebody who's a who's victim and she will be she may not have wanted it but it was you know sometimes responsibility falls on you and you have to act and she acted in the honorable right way and she will be i think rightly praise certainly on the left for
the next generation for having done that and while that may not be the same satisfaction is having actually stopped cavanaugh from becoming and justice a not stop from becoming a justice
it does not in any way negate or or or diminish what she did cheat and in order to diminish the impact that this may have on people and the same way that anita hill failed to stop the clarence thomas for been confirmed as the supreme court justice but changed america and i think that it's possible that ford will change american ways that we can't measure yeah
not in the way that she hoped to change it
but in some other way that it's hard for us to know but she moved to people she was credible she was it important and she spoke truth to power and that's all you can ask someone to do add up here rate and i need to get a rabbit and he get not regret having over at am i hope be
before at wow
not wanna out variety wanna be
he wanted to be it to do right
yeah to wait an hour
aim at are horrible
what
going to beat you
really hard

good i've been trying to decide whether i'm going to read it and now i will definitely i read it
my chatter is another gloomy chatter so open the government and the project on government oversight for you
some materials from the department of homeland security and discovered and released this week
the i guess not that astonishing fact that despite the fact that homeland security secretary nielsen deny there was a policy on family separation she actively said there was no such policies they they fired and received for the memo that nielsen had signed which laid out the policy and family separation that policy that was so dreadful and
cruel and so vicious but the government was pursuing in the spring and
it is depressing that they would
lie so blatantly the secretary would lie so blatantly about this we knew this memo existed there has been protein and watching posted the memo existed but the actual evidence it is
depressing it's gloomy it is just further sign of the degradation the world we live in and the willingness of our public officials to manipulate the truth and to deceive us when his expedient for them so
good for them for finding it bad for us for having a government that was willing to carry out the policy and and mislead us about it
there's also a great listener chatter so listeners you've been continuing to send us great shatters and actually keep sending them we have another we have a live show this weekend and austin and will need a listener chatter for that and then want to
for the show color blair with and he was at at blair sided who sent to me and john and particular wonderful story from the new york times about how the abraham lincoln presidential library museum is a terrible state because they seem
in debt because they spent a lot of money to buy a whole lot of lincoln memorabilia
and one of the things they bought was a lincoln stove pipette which they spent six million dollars can imagine that six million dollars for a lincoln had one of three supposed lincoln had that existed and they have covered up the fact that
the f b i and other other indicators think this is not a genuine lincoln had that there's a lot of evidence suggesting that the provenance of it is not what it was supposed to be and they're certainly isn't a good chain of custody sending it from lincoln to to this museum and so they're sitting on this this thing which the
consider to be hugely valuable that actually may just be fraud so it was a great story in new york times thanks

murdered almost sixty people at a festival of music in las vegas
before killing himself it was of course the worst mass shooting mass murder and modern american history
using an arsenal of legal weapons some outfitted with legal pump stocks the phrase none of us have ever heard until this week bump stocks that effectively turned them into automatic weapons tadic fired from his thirty second storey hotel room at the mandalay bay
indiscriminately murdering and wounding festival goers
at the time that were taping on thursday morning their peers to be no clear reason that he had for commit mass murder other than
a desire to
cause sorrow and distress among people and arm them and i think it goes out saying there's going to be no real political response to it after new town which was the the mess
murder in which twenty twenty two children were gunned down at a school by somebody who had no business having guns
if there was no political action
after that
action i assume they will be nothing that comes out of this
airports that republicans in congress are talking about as well as democrats i should say attacking it out outlying stocks
that would be a very small and specific piece of legislation but it would be not nothing the national rifle association so far has been silent on stock idea that's floating around so maybe they will get quash it but when you see people like john corn talking about it you think
well maybe that republicans could actually take action year and i would assume myself that republicans wouldn't be floating this idea if they hadn't gotten some sense on the and that it wasn't going to be like the end of their careers if they propose such an idea germany think about that
yeah i think there's likely to more be more actually have a response here
then to new town because it's in a sense legislatively the path his legislatively more obvious and easier which is to say the two things people can move to our one the bumps dogs which were in i think it's hard to there were conflicting reports but as many as a dozen
the rifles that he had and the bums talk essentially terms of semiautomatic rifle into something closer to an automatic by using the recoil of the gun to create an automatic burst fire and then the other one is that the suppressor is or silencer spill that was being pushed by the a seems to be now in some even though it's
related here seems to be in had been slowed and might not happen or if it does it will happen in a much different way than what of before this so this guy was obviously motivated patient
and david said the intent all we know is really intent on causing
mayhem and sorrow so
you know if you'd taken the bumps takes away from him he would have found some other way that i don't really like that argument i mean it's not an extent
that he would have found some other way but that's meant that it must have meant he could kill yeah no question no question no question my only point is that if you get rid of those it doesn't solve the problem with people using weapons that can kill a lot of people quickly
you shouldn't mistake thinking that getting rid of bumps stocks argument are going to end
the use of weaponry that can kill but what's what's interesting about this is this is the one of the very few specific examples where you can say actually had lac this piece of equipment
this would have been a much less deadly much less deadly in there sure are much less sorrow folder totally occasion not to say that he wouldn't have done something and sufficient that necessary to ban them
that's all i'm trying to say that's all i'm saying
i do wonder if there will be this is one of these things were those sort of conversation about it talk about it and then you know
there's a long way from conversation to legislation if the house and senate want there to be a long way between comprehension legislation will slow down and then people will sort of gradually forget about it
this is an incredibly frustrating issue i mean it might be my it's one of my least favorite issues in american politics because when people are of americans are pulled their in favor of kind of common sense regulations on guns it because of the night of the ira and terms out that tens of millions of dollars at
cars tech congressional race as there's sort of a stranglehold on anything ever happening and people who are really concerned about maintaining the freedom to have guns vote on this issue they care much more about it than people generally who are in favor of gun control for gotten you know if you're in favor
kind of comment chance gun regulation it's like on a laundry list of issues but it's not something that has exceeded and galvanizing its forces and the same way that the second amendment force i think i think there's a little bit of a canard when people say oh it's the array as a stranglehold it's not the and it's a fact that there are
somewhere between ten and fifty million americans who really have an incredibly strong and passion feelings about gun culture and guns i mean i think i saw a figure which said three percent of americans own fifty percent of americans guns
it's not that the array is is is there there's a large constituency of people who care a great deal about it we're probably concentrated and districts that are red districts and the republicans care about and they are incredibly passion they're much more passionate about the issue of much more directed at the issue and much more dates with the issue then the two hundred and
fifty or two hundred seventy million americans who are skeptical right and that is really important part of it but i don't think that are relevant anyway good well it was like that it's a little thing you know really under relevant at all he's saying don't don't focus uniquely on it or the money again because the what's much more passionate into here is to what you were describing them
people who care about this the anti gun forces
there aren't as many people who are equally men motivated to either of you my maybe you take this first to either of you
i think you're somebody who thinks there should be certain categories of gun regulations common sense regulations around registration around background checks and limits on the kinds of weapons that people can have but there's a politically unrealistic
as far as i can tell so is there anything that you see that can happen and american political life because because big changes in legislation or definitely not going to come at least in that direction that more likely to come and need you know everyone gets a concealed carry permit
direction
is there anything that that the forces who who favor morgan or like regulations can look to or can try to do that isn't legislation i think their state and city based legislation that can happen in fact right i mean let me see there is interesting research come hang connecticut which made it harder to on a gun and misery which made it easier and you see gun deaths
go down and connecticut and that does not happen and misery so i also think that because you know ten to fifteen ten to fifty million americans who are tagamet care so deeply about this and and it's so threatening to the degree that like any limitation
you're not a gun on or and you're not steeped in gun culture i think it's at least for me a little hard to understand why you wouldn't want everyone to have background checks are why you know keeping people who are mentally ill or on the terrorist watch list from owning a gun doesn't seem like something that we could do but people are opposed to those measures feel like you know given any
take a mile that it's this incursion on their personal freedom that's going to end with someone coming to their house and taking are gonna away and given how entrenched that fat of concerns are and how divisive it is politically i'm not sure that we should have a national legislation about it right now or at least like i'm not i'm not sure it's worth the cost
cost of whatever it would be and we already saw this with president obama chime quite desperately to get these kinds of laws passed after new town and nothing happened so california wants to ban everything then they should do it and that's probably the best way to get any actual progress if you believe in these and then but then you do
the question going back to david's point about conceal carry that's where it's the legislation to allow conceal carry to basically be available in all states regardless of what the individual stance has done them that his position where
it does become a national conversation start you know i was going to say
i wonder if there's a reverse psychology play here today so much of what defines people's political belief in this country today because of the the partisan sorting that we've done is that if the other side is forward i'm against it i wonder if there's a if there's a play where the liberals should just massively embrace gun culture like you make gun culture like a lot
uncool liberals but like all the sudden loving it
everyone out buying guns were all getting guns and then it becomes something which no longer becomes part of conservative political identity to be in opposition to it just becomes somebody it's in the fabric of the country
and then and then it and then it becomes them which you can start to regulate because it isn't it
you lower the temperature on it as an issue
well so many would chime in to say that some of the previous gun control measures were in response to the idea that urban african americans had to easy access to guns so that that which is a kind of a version of right actually talking about know you're going to the question of this
this murderer
it's very hard to make sense of it i mean we don't know there is no obvious reason this has happened does it matter whether we call this terrorism or not
so i always this debate leaves me cold i have to like remind myself every single us high and what that the definition of terrorism as i always forget it has to do with intimidating on the country or citizens and also having a political or social objectives i don't we don't need to call someone
on a terrorist can condemn a terrible action like this i'm not really sure what the point isn't because it often gets used in this anti muslim and racist way and then we have to have an argument about why we're only calling person a terrorist a vague call out allah akbar before they shoot it does seem to me like it's
have called a sack and maybe we should just psyched graph it
i think i agree with you there's the animal logical question of terrorism which is and what it actually means and then there's the way it's used in debate where it's one of the tactics you use to highlight what is an important part of the way we every time we have one of these debates about rights and particularly this specific debate about guns we
the exacerbate all of the underlying problems with the reason we can't talk about these issues and but it still never the less important to play with the idea even as a and because it illuminates something that if we were known that this person were islamic terrorist or were
from a particular country of course the reaction would be different
and so what does that mean what does that mean about the way we react to things what does it mean that six days after the san bernardino shooting then candidate trump called for full ban on muslims which is of course of trampling of rights
in the service of safety so if he does that six days after that shooting
how is that different from what people want to do to limit the second amendment rights of americans in response to this violence and and using those comparisons might break loose a little bit of understanding and in that sense
terrorism is kind of may be useful for a minute to think about bad but more often than not it's used as a way to kind of argumentation points and it kind of loses all meaning and it becomes just another ploy and argumentation not something that actually has a specific meaning i don't have a real coherent thought on terrorists terrorism question i do
the thing that i
haunts me about this particular
act of cruelty
is there something that is happening to people and i don't know what else happening to basically to guys to men that makes them think
that it is the right and good thing to to take the misery and pain and loneliness and suffering that they are feeling and export it to something we're doing and society is licensing that is giving people a sense that that's okay or that that's a good thing to do
i don't have any smart thing to say about it but there's something that's gone terribly awry another scary element and this is clippings and haitian that off and media coverage could be playing into their we are in dark decisions fat people make that and they know that that will be you know all of the headlines all of the search for understanding
it's all completely scripted at this point and i don't know what choice we have because it is newsworthy but that is kind of a sickening element here

hurricane maria is two weeks gone porto rico remains a mess power is out to think still about ninety five percent of the island
and may remain out for some people for up to six months it will certainly remain out for almost everybody for at least a month
most porta rican like clean water food is in short supply crops are wrecked businesses are destroyed as we learned today the pharmaceutical industry which is the biggest export industry in porto rico
has been devastated by this and their shortages of drugs that are looming tourism has vanished
present trump has stopped treating insults at the mayor of san juan and the us government is is finally starting to deploy resources to help the island recover more significant resources to help you out and recover but it's a terrible situation occurs already seventy plus billion dollars in debt to hedge fund the creditors infrastructure
was already a mess
congress is not eager to ship a lot of federal funding toward people and a commonwealth who are citizens to the united states or not you don't vote in elections that elect them are like the president
john is the response that the us as
has displayed towards porto rico a disgrace
impart let me say one of the think quickly first because i think it connects to the previous comment you know the president's choosing at a moment to go after the mayor of san juan because obviously under enormous stress watching people i mean all of the devastation around her and you can imagine that just existence
theory that would come from not getting things for whomever whatever reason to to then in that moment go after her and to has previously initiated this divisive multi day fight over the nfl
when you have something like the shooting in las vegas you one of the many things not the first thing that one of the many things he you realize that for a national leader and for our national conversations you have to budget your outrage and your divisiveness because things are going to come to you by surprise that are going to split the name
and that going to cause incredible pain even by people who aren't directly affected in any way and since you know that's going to happen in one fashion or another you don't go pick fights you don't go make situations worse for their own sake but then you sap the kind of general national energy for when a surprise things had thing happens
porto rico to me is there was obviously the issue which are now quickly turn to it which is itself
important but it also i think has this connection to the other things the other fights the president has chosen to pick in a job where usually you can try to calm fights
i think the question with the puerto rico is it was a it's a special case it's not like texas and florida as you mention it has only infrastructure issues the question for me and evaluating the federal response is and they also had you know you had thousands and thousands of containers full of supplies ready to go but there were only twenty percent of the truckers available the roads were wiped out special case but isn't
we hope isn't the best we hope for a federal response that they have the agility and nimble miss to recognize hey this is different in florida and texas and as a result of it's being different here's the different things weren't going to do and then to master the moment in so in other words all of the difficulties that porto rico as had and that
the collapse inside porto rico that makes this all the more devastating should have been the kind of thing that if we are operating optimal way we'd be saying wow they were amazing and able to adapt to the special conditions of porto rico
add to that the thing they keep taking means that it took them more than a week to name an onsite commander and it was impossible not to feel that there was a void in leadership hear that because of all the power failures and the impossibility of the roads television and because this is puerto rico
oh american television wasn't covering it to the same degree at all as it was true in florida and texas and so it wasn't real to president champ because he wasn't seeing it on tv screens and there's something i'm sorry shocking about that that the person who is privy has the most and best information in the world can't
respond to something and tell he sees it on his tv screen because he just doesn't think that it matters and it's a priority and then when you add on the layer of you know prickly defensive
rat a tat treating at the mayor of san juan
like how dare you question me in order to get help from me you have to kowtow that's also just like a horrifying displayed of anti leadership
do you think that we as a nation oh porto rico the same thing that we go to maryland or to hawaii also an island
yes absolutely and our citizens and also there's a tortured history here of colonization and lay it means to be a commonwealth and why we have a commonwealth that doesn't have electoral votes and representatives in congress
yeah your are you just as willing to pay higher taxes too
to bail out the people of puerto rico's you would be to pay our taxes to bail out the people of massachusetts
yeah and i also think that this is like a nanny
their line by the way i don't believe either line i don't believe do that's why one and wide i'd you feel why our cultural affinity to people like every other state in the nation i also forget cultural event of a human affinity well as a family that people are people are suffering but regular and people are suffering to a greater degree there them they were
would be in states like florida or texas where they have local resources and yet but and haven't been all right i'm i'm glad you could argue you more he should be more than i'm willing to for my nation to provide resources to bail out haiti which is not part of my nation that i would be to bail out god i wouldn't be to see the devastation and and apps of life
that happens to those countries in particular that's what that's part of who we should be as a nation well john i do agree the human suffering there was much greater than anything and he american suffered any american natural disaster but the fact is that we've put tens or hundreds of billions billions of dollars to recover from a sandy
a katrina
northridge earthquake
and i think the numbers that we put in for for other countries were there for a tsunami or for haiti
or trivial in comparison so there's no and i think you would but you were making a separate case you were making so that's a fact which it can be debated on so terms but you were saying that you thought neither of us had the view that we had about one i think i think it's really easy to say in the abstract oh we should we should give as many resources to haiti forget porto rico for a second to her
haiti as we should to new york but i actually don't think that in practice that if any of us were in a deciding role in a position where we had the research of the us government he had to deploy that we would actually act and that way i don't think it because we care less about the people in haiti or because we would be politicians great about lab votes were coming from a mix of both
yeah you care most about the people in haiti because they're not because the nation is was a way we define ourselves
and
and people in new york or we see the more there's more coverage they're closer to us culturally than they would be no i mean if i could have control over my tax dollars are other people's tax dollars i think i would change how they're spending any number of ways and there will be lots more foreign aid and there but apart from of that puerto rico is not a foreign country and puerto rico is the united states
america and sell we should be thinking of it as part of the united states of america and treating it accordingly
a few weeks ago i don't know if you guys remember this but i think was actually before the hurricanes and a brutally about climate change
and
we're talking about how eventually the united states would make a decision
not to rebuild a place that was devastated by climate change and i was i was saying we want miami will just give up on man in believe me i've heard from miami and i understand that you're not happy about that
but i think the day as i think that days here i think that porto rico
is it is as a as a
the territory as a commonwealth we lack the political will to restore porto rico to be what it was we will like the funds to do it porto rico is going to be a poor society than it was there will be more outdoor migration people will leave it it will be it is a place which because of this natural disaster that have happened it is going to be permanently scarred and damage and
the way that i think we're going to see going forward for lots of places in the world and i don't think we will muster the political will to to spend the resources required to to to restore it to health to that's a fascinating question is is what do we know in advance of the next one because presumably you rebuild
put do we go up to you
let's rebuild or you do with miami beach
knowing that there's a greater risk that those two places are going to be hit by by weather and so what do you oh what do you oh when that's the money you're using to build something that's going to get knocked down again when that same money could be used going forward for you know let's say general research into
infectious diseases or whatever other thing in a limited budget that someone that to me isn't is of that's really fascinating question which is separate and apart from that of gray with my else yeah ground which is a separate and apart from what do you do to get them the relief and the emergency care in the wake of disaster
he should do that for the conundrum show
one of the striking things to me about the whole hurricane season we've had is not just the short attention span of president trump and his kind of the way he is john describe it he's miss a lot it is outrage and its energy but all of us that there were not really i don't know what's going on houston used to was suffering from an
natural disaster couple of weeks ago i actually because i'm a disgraceful citizen i'd actually don't know what's going on i can't remember what obama did i don't know if the places that were damaged by our i'm not sure what their recovery is the media attention to porto rico there's been there's been lots of effort and lots of resources but nowhere near what there have been to other
pastors and other situations there's so much horror and frustration the world and
i don't know i'm struck by i'm struck by how quickly our attention of moved in a way that i don't think it did with katrina
he also had i mean in the blunt and cruel and masturbate you just had a great deal more cats and katrina
one hundred people die until that's probably that's should that would be one factor i'm not saying it's a factor but it too
the category is is a little different rate and also with his hurricanes
there's just this massive clean up after a long slog greatest site people's waterlogged houses and the insurance estimates and then rebel dang like news coverage intense news coverage feeds on high drama and the aftermath of a natural disaster if if fair not some huge number of deaths is tons plenty out
it's harder to generate fat it's amazing having studied this further was just stop this week which is about johnson going to go after hurricane betsy nineteen sixty five which is the first kind of presidential moment our president arrives and uses the moment to show leadership in in the night until nineteen sixty five it will happen in nineteen
fifty five and nineteen fifty which are two huge years for hurricanes like record years if you look up and they have their own wikipedia entries
and the front page of the newspapers in are stories about the coming hurricanes and where they're going to hit on the east coast next to stories about eisenhower being on vacation eisenhower he's not in any of the hurricane stories in nineteen fifty five on the front page in the stories about him being on vacation are oh he's out fishing and hunting and these flying from pennsylvania to denver and though isn't that neat there's nobody
saying this is an outrage she's not and then when the hurricanes hit there was no federal response really expected it was basically taking care of by the states and by the red cross and nobody said oh this is an outrage when he went to visit one of the hurricanes
he went to basically say you need to have a civil defence force that can handle these things when they hit not i'm here to help you so
he was just interesting our national response to disaster and how it's changed just that
leave it at that at that it goes really fascinated when was fema have created during carter and even johnson even johnson when he goes to hurricane betsy which hits the ninth ward he's doing it basically and david because you're a fan of lyndon johnson on the phone there's fantastic recordings of him talking to russell long does it basically because russell alone has done
a bunch of favors and sense he's begin to take it and that had taken it in the teeth
for johnson johnson feels he owes him one and so it goes down to the ninth ward basically politics in that case was what was motivating and not the desired be like seen on t v or to be seen as compassionate but then kicked off a chain of events that led to what we have now wow that's amazing
it's fascinating
but it goes back to your point about time and attention of the actual president but also is it a good thing that we all look to the federal government for responding to these things eisenhower's argument was basically it saps something from us at the local level if we just think that thing will happen federal government i would come in to you
the fantastic piece that lay off he wrote maybe seven years ago about been in moscow
when there were fires menacing moscow and it was about what it was like to live in a country where there with no nationally organized response to natural disaster and how terrifying it is and how the idea that we can rely on local or self organization is a canard and that at some point you need some larger authority with resources and a plan
and to help everybody i mean that there can be obviously individual acts of heroism and individual acts of stuff organization but that without this kind of national effort or some kind of large institutional effort that it's terrifying and unbelievably dangerous as a brilliant piece that to era there is a fascinating also little historical site
part of this which is that the civil defense efforts on hurricane preparedness and domestic tornado preparedness and all that were really a way to get people to be in civil defence forces because of the coming invasion by the communists so that it was like prepare for your tornado but really keep yourself fit for when the reds come
we are brat makers and the tried and true apple cider vinegar that you've had having your cabinet far as long as you've had a cabinet
and you trust that model sitting in your cabinet because we were in your mom's and mom's cap
you use this as a wellness drink your mom used this and salad dressing her mom's mom used as this glass cleaner
and while there are many ways to as one thing is always saying our recipe it has never changed since we've been putting cabinets brown it's not nearly think rex
welcome back skoda us justice roberts and the gang got back to work on monday
for what promises to be dramatic term with bad news almost certainly coming for labor unions and workers interested in labor rights uncertainty for those who had gerrymander and those who had bake cakes
emily
let's talk with sort of limit ourselves so the big there's a big case come in which i'm so excited to talk about when it when it gets closer which is the masterpiece bake shop for what it's called big shop masterpiece take shots to peace cake cake shop kate case about the take pick or her didn't want to bake a cake for a gay wedding but bold and i think see
sadly the end of them
save that that's going to eat so many so many questions and thoughts and hypothetical for you can you go spend a week in a bunker preparing i exit but until then let's start with the big case of this week which with guild vs whitford the gerrymander case brief it for us please counsellor wow
fill in clinton there was a census and after every santas we district and this country in the twenty eleven redistricting in the state of wisconsin the republicans controlling the state houses and the governor's office so they put together a what was supposed to be a very secretive process very dry and their maps they had
add some aids kind of squirreled away and room that a law firm yeah the capital and they had help from a political scientist at the university of oklahoma named keith gatti he was hired to create regression analyses and data that would allow the map makers to easily visualize what
would happen depending on how they moved the voters around so basically you know right now if you're trying a map and you're trying to maximize part is an advantage you want to know if you move to hundred republican voters out of their safe distract how safe will remain like how many points why the republicans have to win by state
why it in order to stella maintain this protest distract so you want to be able to see the results of we've elections as well as more standard elections and then make decisions about how you distribute your folks to maximum advantage and then how you usually you're trying to concentrate the other party especially if republicans are doing the job
mandarin you wanna pack as many democratic voters into a smaller number of urban districts are that they're not going to be spread out and for i'm saying other elections or amnesty so the republicans did this whole process there was one day a public hearings that was the moment at which the maps were visible to the democrats to the first time republic
lawmakers had then signing confidentiality agreements and coming to look in the map or am just at their little slice of the map but the democrats only found out about it at this one day a public hearings and then a week later the maps become law in wisconsin and then in the two thousand and twelve elections the republicans when sixty of ninety nine seats with less than fifty percent of the vote
statewide for the state assembly so that is an amazing transfer of power and it basically remains entrenched in two thousand and fourteen and twenty sixteen and by a number of measures of partisan bias this republican map is an outlier and terms of the degree of gerrymandering so the legal context
wow this is that if the hands are republicans were dry and the maps there was really no reason to think they were doing anything illegal because the supreme court has never struck down redistricting map for being too partisan and it's gerrymandering there's a whole body of law about racial gerrymandering that we can talk about but not about gerrymandering about political parties and the question is whether
this case is going to be the moment where the supreme court steps in and allow lower courts to start stepping in as well the state of the law up to this point was that there were four conservative is the last time around which is like two thousand and four and also two thousand and sex who are ready to say that the courts had no role at all its prey and gerrymandering
ever and that these cases should be that's called non justifiable like not something that you get to bring a lawsuit it out but justice kennedy while he upheld the maps in those cases it was not willing to shut the door entirely on these claims and he said he was looking for a workable standard answer the question is whether since span the quake robes
bust development of social science that has talked about partisan bias or what's called partisan a symmetry as crack standard this is different from proportional representation i'm happy to explain why actually figured this out and i was writing about this attempt quite proud of myself about and then there are a bunch of tasks that measure
well a symmetrical are how biased the map is and so at oral argument this week justice kennedy actually didn't ask any questions of the lawyers who are challenging the maps which was interesting and he seemed skeptical of the lawyer for the state of wisconsin and so there was a kind of hope full set of stories and coverage about the
the argument suggesting that may be candy is open to the sparkle standard on the other hand chief justice roberts and justice for such went out of their way to dismiss of the social sciences what roberts called gobbledygook and to basically make it seem as if there was no way the court could ever master this and do a good job of referee in gerrymandering based
on the science that i just have to say is just horse shit there a principal reasons to think that courts shouldn't interfere in these cases but the notion that the science is gobbledygook and that courts can't handle it is just silly the same tools you use to make the maps are the tools the judges can use to assess the maps
now finally stopped talking cannot describe the one little piece how irritating it is when the standards of one call arm when depending on the side of the argument you're on the standard she had just go through completely out the window and so the gobbledygook good point even forget this just in general
just infuriates me in the same way
other issues where people who will search night and day for a workable solution to a problem then when when they're on the other side of the argument though be about too complicated can't do it tramples on rights that's it we're sorry too hard and then least
yes and also science the whole roll of social science or even hard science at the court that's something i've been really interested in for a while because and i've written about it with regard to justice scalia that there's a way english conservatives often are trying to take positions in which the social science is on the other side and so
the market or they belittle it justice scalia famously like at a climate change hearing basically said like i can understand this word i can remember there are some and he met use like i'm not this isn't my specialty there is nothing inherent in conservative philosophy that would make it seem ultra skeptical of science and yet that's what we're seeing
dudley while i think this goes exactly to john's point which is the whole point about the precision of the gerrymandering that it's based on on exactitude that we now it's based on science that demography is much much better ability to measure to geographically locate where people are who they are identified with they are
much much better than a so that it is drugs
both said the fact is that it has science it has given people the tools to create these precise gerrymandered districts and dresses kagan just justice prior made these planted argument it should be said emily so there a couple of conservative i mean there are a number of conservative claims to go after the first one
which i find kind of the most compelling news you know democrats lost themselves the statehouses like really badly even well before these were the as as jury members they are now
they were victims of this gerrymandered map because in wisconsin they couldn't hold the state house and they couldn't hold even though to state where they should run well and it's a political failure on the part of the democratic party to compete and therefore
cost of a political to defeat way wasn't part of the reasons but democrats did so poorly and two thousand and ten in particular had to do with this red map nationwide
project and let republicans or really successful i'm spending money and putting resources into a slate legislative races and good for that and that's how politics works i guess the question is what should the consequences be right i mean when you control the government you get to put your policies in place and sell wisconsin and purple state has in some ways
a bright red set of policies like the union busting a policy is that governor walker has championed and there are other examples and the state as well but do you also get to entrench yourself in power in a way that makes it very hard for the voters to vote you out even when they don't support you like do we want a sister
i'm in which effectively the party that loses in twenty tan than in trenches his health and power for the next ten years because there's a handicap right where i like the loot the the power party that's out of power would have to win by ten points or twelve point or seven points statewide in order
to retake a bare majority and those are real structural issues about that democracy that i think transcend like that kind of whipping the democrats may deserve for having lost all those state house races and twenty and ten
interesting part of this which i think went to the standing issue whether these these people even have the right to challenge the maps as a whole was the first amendment claim i wonder if you could talk about that too broadly speaking the idea that because people are democrats because of their the speech their position
political beliefs they're being discriminated against in some fashion
to back up into in equal protection land we talk about suspect classes people who are being treated differently for reasons of religion or national origin or race or gender and we talk also about immutable characteristics like you can't change those things about yourself and so they deserve special protection you can change your religion but we like first arc or reasons have really
and in that category most of the time we don't think about being a democrat or republican as a protected class fare like a few nibbles around the edges and the law where they are like employment protections for not getting fired for the basis of your political party but mostly we don't think that way the first amendment the area is another way to conceptual lies the case
kind of differential treatment we're talking about where it is true that if your vote is essentially going to be wasted because you're going to be packed into a district that's ninety percent democratic that's happening because of your political beliefs and associations and and so i think that's what kennedy's first amendment theory kind of gaps act but then doesn't that take you right back
to the level and extent to which you're being muted or does it just except since you've been pushed out of because the german during his happened your political view as been
close to me how do you prove that you haven't been given the right to speak
way well that's a good question i mean one of the issues here is usually when you have a legal came claims like an on or off switch like racial gerrymandering and happened or i didn't with political gerrymandering the court has to figure out a way probably to say okay politics are part of redistricting the constitution gives the power to you
district to the legislature so we're trying to set boundaries the best analogy i found when i was writing about this was to box and like the idea that boxing is about people hitting each other we recognise are going to keep hitting but they're also referees and boxing who set boundaries and rules around the boxing so there's like some kind of hitting is off limits
that's the kind of thinking that would have to happen here in order for the court to play player all one of the things that oh
enjoyed reading wrote this her enjoyed but have been
taken by so been reading about it
sometimes this comes actually you've been from republicans who talk about it
is the pernicious effects in the long run of having a highly gerrymandered system and
what it points out is that it means that it just increases the level of mistrust and democracy and about the system
it is one of the causes i think of legislators representatives feeling they could ignore constituents not respond to particular kind of constituents avoid public events avoid hearings and the analogy to the old pocket borough system in england where you represent the district but basically like you were given it it was yours and there was no need to
responsive to the people the whole idea of a republican system where you have a people who represent you is that you were than responsive to those people who represent you know that you have to do everything that they tell you that your elected it's not direct democracy but the you have to be in some sense and responsive to them and if you have these districts where people don't need to be responsive to
a huge class voters it undermines the whole project the long run it's really the corrosive one reason for the supreme court to open this door is that you know the fate of our democracy is at stake to be dramatic about it we have fewer and fewer competitive races and us house and that is not entirely because of gerrymandering because
the big sword the way in which people have moved to increasingly live among people who vote like damn that's a factor here we've talked about that on previous shows the gerrymandering also plays a role and when you have fewer competitive races you have more of a landscape than the one you're talking about david and one that's more polarized and
i think for me it comes back to the hit like right now the republicans are benefiting more from gerrymandering because they can draw more statehouses and look like if there is no remedy maybe they'll kind of permanently hold on to that advantage but there are states in which democrats have also gerrymandered to the same degree and when you
think of the idea that the party that the voters don't support remains in power there's something fundamentally and stuff but that it then you start to really affect that democracy is warping and i think that is one reason why there's a sense of urgency and a reason my this case matters a great deal so before we close on this topic and the finals
john morning
my one final fellow be to remind people that with or without the supreme court states can address gerrymandering they can appoint nonpartisan commissions to do the redistricting themselves and in states like arizona voters have created those commissions through safe referenda so if you're worried about the legislature
too entrenched in its own gerrymandering to do that kind of reform this is something that voters can actually do themselves and it really is it's like the shape of redistricting is not something that usually gets people to march in the streets but it is one of those structural elements that underlies all the decision making

can act can be used in a way that allows players to make their employees sign arbitration clauses in their contracts but then makes it impossible for those in plays to band together to pursue a collective action and so like a collective challenge to a workplace practice
you know this whole thing of these binding arbitration agreements that then force people to divide up their legal claims into tiny little individual places that have no value to any lawyer it's just a real increasing problem and it's a little complicated and i guess little boring but it's so important
i mean if workers are stripped of this way to have collective actions been that means that every time an employer skins that off the top doesn't pay some overtime they're not going to be able to come together in order to address that problem and so we just increasingly have a system where these arbitration clauses are used to allow and players to chew
people out of things you know not huge individual damage claims but across the whole company you can have a lot of people being slightly screwed and essentially a situation in which it's very hard to remedy that it just seems like a real mistake given our current imbalance of power between
in labour and capital and also the course of world when that one for the employer's right exactly and this is just an example of how pro corporate the supreme court has become and with course edge on the court will continue to be a fear john what does your child much enters a month
welcome news that uses official them in the twenty twenty olympic games in tokyo climbers will be able to compete for gold
so they announced that there will be three disciplines climbers will compete in sport bowling in speed climbing
i'm really sorry
very cool if you
our interests in the one of the ways i've come across this is by following climbers on instagram which is which is amazing for seeing the door sport climbers but them people who do competitive climbing indoors just watching them souls bolden puzzles and also than watching speed climbing is amazing it looks
are roaming one horizontal ground
that's good for him that's good news for all of them and for those of you who can then learn about the sports before you get to twenty twenty
running on vertical ground
yeah ending and horizontal ground but it looks like they're just like it looks like the all ogre
clamoring and cross level ground but they're in fact climbing vertically so totally free here
you feel like you you'd be like i can do that because there's no way you somebody could do that such amazing precision like without it being easier than it might otherwise seem and them you try and could do it and knew you were immediately delivered to disappoint is climbing one of these things so i've only done a very little tiny bit and terrible
but it's one of these things which sort of like mountain biking or downhill biking which is if you go faster it's probably better like that could actually going slow takes you out of a rhythm and like that in fact the speed you build up momentum and it gets you going a certain way
i don't know about momentum because the gravity is working against you but i definitely think and this is i haven't actually clone for many years now and a wonderful
do it again just because i'm out of shape but there is a flow because what happens is when you get stock it's a great lesson for life you have to just calm down have perspective and work it like not go only got my arms and life forms are going to cramp
oh my doing this oh my god i'm i'm three hundred feet in the air
everybody's watching like you need to to mellow and if you're in flow you don't know stuff happens usually stooges moving and it's really great and it's amazing to watch i have two chapters this week one and self serving but also serving you your listeners which is if

and we will have cocktail chatter and before we go any further a reminder december twelfth in new york university scribble center in manhattan we're going to do our annual conundrum show
the time when we gather to pay such important questions as would you rather be a fish or a tree
you can still get tickets that slate dot com slash live please join us
at the scribble center on december twelfth for conundrum show it can be really fun play dot com flashlight for tickets the apparent torture and murder of distant journalist from show by team of saudi hit men inside the saudi embassy in istanbul has turned into an international crisis information
seemingly leaks by the turkish government which has its own reasons for doing this indicates that show he was murdered and dismembered when he went to the embassy to pick up some documents he needed for his wedding
other reporting suggest the murders were extremely close to crown prince muhammad den some on the crown prince's of course the increasing me autocratic ruler is the the ruler in fact that not name of saudi arabia
the young prince who is quite good friends with jared kushner the trump administration which has been hand and pocket with m b s as he is known has contorted itself not to blame the saudis for anything yet
they accepted saudi denials more or less at face value
dispatching compare the secretary of state to saudi arabia and then to turkey to weigh the evidence and at least you know just of make a make a face showing have been interested in this and the president has indicated explicitly that he does not want to disrupt the us had a relationship for this
john in some sense the the the attempt to keep business as usual with the saudis is not that surprising we haven't disrupted business as usual the saudis are murdering thousands of yemeni when they broke off relations with canada over a canadian foreign minister making a mild comment about their human rights when they kidnap the lebanese
mr and so on and so on
why is the us government and in particular the trump administration even more than us government them of have so willing and eager to work with the saudi government and to turn a blind eye to their repeated misbehavior
well there's a there's a series of different reasons
some with more proof than others
and they range everything from
military orders the saudis have booked which is different than money name checks i've already written but things they said they wanted by which is where the president gets his one hundred and ten billion dollar figure experts say that the numbers closer to twenty billion but they are big purchase of us
arms and
every time you sound the plane you're not just telling them and plane you're showing them the parts and all of that so that's the argument presidents made it's about jobs but the big reason the geo strategic reason is that to saudi arabia is helping the united states with its number one priority and in the region and maybe it's a number one priority but probably number two to north korea iran
so saudi arabia is is at the center of and iran focused us mission in the middle east
and then the other reason is that the president has bragged about having interest in saudi arabia in the past and his son in law also has interests financial interests in saudi arabia and so there's a web of interconnected news that the private level some of which is opaque and so that may or may not
be involved here
you could imagine it not needing to be involved because of the primacy of the iranian focus of and that's the focus from people like bolton and i'm pale which who don't have financial ties to saudi arabia
emily what do you think it is about the show be murder i'm going to call it a murder because although we don't know for certain yet they're cute preponderance of evidence and rather than have to couch and each time i'm just going to say what what is it about the show the murder that has inviting international outrage
that all these other incidents including the ongoing war crimes in yemen did not why is it causing people to withdraw from and b s's huge splash he davos in the desert conference and casting doubt on whether you can even continue to be the crown prince
i mean if you're talking about loss of life and you're being completely rational and counting then the atrocities in yemen are far worse and leave ignored damn you know at our moral power peril for a while now but i think first of all jamal khashoggi had a lot of friends in washington
he was someone who is well liked by people on the press corps there are a lot of people with personal connections tan line and position to make a fuss and i think the thing is just that germanic nature of this crime and been described is horrifying ways and it seems as if it was carried out by
did were very close to the crown prince of saudi arabia who is himself very close to jared kushner and so there's just this sense of personal involvement it makes it feel like a kind of mafia killing or just their head of state eliminating someone is politics he didn't care for and that kind of breath
taking blatant way and they think there's just something about that that on has distressed people and captured their imaginations and you know sometimes the narrative of one person and how abuse of power affects one human being can transcend a bloody conflict like the one in yemen in which there are lots of people who
are being terribly harmed but they remain kind of a mass of face last people to us whereas i care is this one guy we can see pictures of her family can read his words his fiance was waiting for him outside the embassy walls as the consulate walls i mean they're just all these reasons to identify with ten and strongly in their story
you know science wouldn't be the first time that the united states made a decision
a moral decision
in its strategic interests that was against its human rights rhetoric
i mean honestly the first grade so in a sense with the president is doing in appearing to slow walk this we don't know the full story but one thing that is so jarring is that we know what this president looks like when he is on the hunt for suspicious information he does it regularly but he also rose to power as a political for
figure by being relentless in his pursuit of the truth about barack obama is kenyan birth so when it comes to the kenyan birth know piece of information is too insignificant
and all information is credible and then in this case nothing seems to be credible in terms of the way the president reacting the way each reacting as a way you could argue a president should react which is with restraint let the facts get in there are other equities at play here he may know it's it isn't public but again relative to his reaction in all these other cases and it does matchups
pattern of a seeming disinterest in the and authoritarian sluggishness of latimer couldn't kim jong il and duarte so
it is he comes within his his pattern just on need to yemen point and not only in saudi arabia
a bombing there but the un report of a week ago and claim that saudi arabia was responsible for at least twelve hundred deaths of children
and in some cases the munitions they're using in the prosecution of this military action or munitions it bought from united states
dig into that point of yours and this is the age of impunity this is the age where if you're a lot more potent you can assassinate people you don't like on british soil using chemical agent
if you are the north korean leader you can you can use a nerve agent in the middle of a incredibly busy airport and malaysia to kill an enemy if you're china you can kidnap ahead of interpol and imprison a million weaker citizens and yet
it has no consequence for any of it i totally understand the need for rail politic in the world my i'm not in any sense an idealist but it is pretty shocking to see how far the united states has strayed from its avowed support for human rights for solve
and it's and
not only is it that the trump says nothing when these things happen said he couples that with criticism and attacks on the countries which do support democratic ideals and which are do behave with respect and dignity towards its citizens were where our biggest enemy is the countries that are getting the full rhetorical brunt of the united states
canada and germany and meanwhile we have assassinations occurring in embassies and atrocities occurring
all over the world it's it's very very disheartening
right doesn't he actually gets it gets going to be a costs that we're going to bear in the future because we have lost america has not always lived up to it's ideal often been cynical it is often overlooked as emily you'd be pointed out overlooked a human rights issues when when it has needed to but we've been
at least to be minus on it now we're a d and it's going to be a cost we we are no longer a moral beacon in the world are we increasingly seem to not want to be immoral be can and that's a big problem usually there's about a counterbalance so the us may not act perfectly in all cases but there are cases in which there's real effort to try to live up to and
spread the ideas of human rights and in this case there's the balance seems out of whack and in the other thing that is i think this is an occasion i think about is whether our priorities are focused on iran is a cracked one and whether that is part of why we're being led astray i mean we think of saudi arabia we wanna think the bad as it
partner and fighting terrorism that some of the saudis on tactics breed terrorism and you know the it is an autocratic monarch call unaccountable regime that we have more or less supported for many years because of our own tactical decisions and you know president obama express
some reservations about that and some desire to distance are south and edge sounds and hold the saudis at arm's length and i think what we've seen less champ and particularly with kushner are these very close relationship is john mentioned earlier may or may not be tied to their own financial interest and you know you see kushner making a
bad on the asked mohammad den som man that seems like a terrible that to make in terms of human rights and that were that he is embolden ing someone who is not going to be a good leader for his country either domestically or internationally so for also just thinking here about judgment
and about you know all the responsibility and praise that trump lavished on kushner especially early on in the administration you really have to one here wonder here especially because of the reports that us intelligence picked up that the saudis were planning to detain jamal khashoggi before he showed up at that consulate and we don't seem to have warren ham or done anything
that map
i think the m b ask questions
complicated the thing he is the alternative to is also terrible the thing that he is the alternative to was a monarch system that was heavily corrupt also supporting very theologically conservative in fact radical islamist theology all across the world and spreading it a country that
if anything less democratic than what he wants to make it more in many ways more repressive than what he wants to make it less open to the world than what he wants to make it and yet he hit he himself is now proving to be an autocrat a dictator thug a villain murder of the were sword and so it's not i mean with
weird as that is not that somehow saudi arabia has taken some really dark turn to a much darker place has just taken a dark turn into a different dark place it was in a dark place
as you have no good alternatives than don't make a big that rendered agreement yeah yeah yeah that's how i'm his own i know million like i'm all iran and iranians are just texans there in a text message a dark hair
it is important to remember the saudi arabia it was the location of the president's first foreign trip it was the ball the chips were moved him to his
that that wasn't just because they had happened to work for the itinerary it was it was
chosen in specific for a specific reason with it for a real orientation of us policy and a big bet on saudi arabia
yeah and our relationship with saudi arabia is essentially built on two pilloried are out built on a shared cent of set of values are shared set of principles of how country should be governed or people should be treated it's built on oil and arms sales which to are two things which i certainly would like to reduce in the world that the spread of lots of
us time to saudi arabia to me multiplies the danger in the middle east and creates more likely that there are more things like yemen and more likely that there's a war between iran and saudi arabia between their proxies and i don't want to live in a world where all we were fully dependent on saudi oil being pumped and keeping saudi oil prices low that seems like a tear
bubble world and one less dependency on that must use of it so i'm all for a turn away but i don't i'm not sure that there's any grand
coalition to turn away from saudi arabia
these days anymore but there's not a grand coalition to support saudi arabia in the senate
marco rubio said there is no saudi arabia caucus
and so
will be interesting to see the pressure if there is any pressure or what the power the president divergence from from his from from republicans her one thing i've been wondering about his tongue i'm not sure that's the right word for it that you know there's this real party like we don't want the saudis tears stop pumping
while because that could really canal throw a huge wrench into the world economy gas prices could soar like can have bad and we don't want to stop the arms sales because we like that money and then there's you know my palm pale shelling out and being all jovial and laughing at this moment of great seriousness making it seem like
this is just acceptable behavior that the us is ready to just completely
brush by and i had the same thing when i was listening to jump say almost in one breath and not giving covered anything saudi arabia is this arms deal is really great for us and we do that's a business for them so he was giving cover in this moment where he claimed not to be it was incredibly clear and i mean if you are like
a real critic of us foreign policy and you think the us is always a cynical actor then you might be like okay well now it's out in the open you know good we have a washington post lead today on thursday which says that the us in saudi arabia are searching for a mutually agreeable explanation for show his disappearance
let's just show the complicity and have it all out there but i do think that it matters a great deal whether the united states is explicitly condoning and looking past this kind of murder it's scary to have us just off the moral compass entirely either
no i see the hypocrisy in the past i'd still think i'd rather have some sense of limits even if it's incomplete and flawed and etc while the hypocrisy did some did some work in the past which is that it that some limb is some limits and kept some countries from misbehaving and ultimately
the idea that you're fighting for truth and honesty in the american way ends up being the saying that marshals
american men and women who go fight in the service of their country is that you know that we're the good guys and we stand up for the right things i mean that's the i'm not saying in this specific case but it is it's all on that same continuum the person yeah yeah i mean i guess the other thing i keep thinking about is that i feel like the delphi for
the trump era is gonna come do dramatically later but we kind of see these foreshadowing submit and this is one of them and none of the foreshadowing seemed to be big enough on their own to change the political dynamic inside the united states sufficiently but you can imagine how in the future where
gonna look back and be able to like trace the bread crumbs to a different kind of world order and weaker democracy that's certainly true that the deficit this week
yes that's a good thing to bring and right now exactly speaking of bells coming do just one final point on that actually which is i think it's important to recognize there is no saudi caucus as you say in the us senate john there's a huge saudi caucus for saudi money for investment
and every company in silicon valley every company that that wants capital is is trying to get a cut of of saudi money i mean through i go out and pitch my company and talk to venture funds and private equity people and a lot of them have saudi money and their funds and spend a lot of time
i'm going to go into saudi arabia and meeting with the various power brokers there and so so wallet is it's the case that those folks they don't want to be associated with with murders and they don't they don't want to be associated with a with a thug regime the poll of all that money is very very powerful and and yet
people withdraw from this conference which i suspect actually has the biggest threat that feels right now is at this conference is going to be a fiasco but they'll come back of the money is they're they're going to come back with that money is it's extremely green and there are huge huge puddle

senator elizabeth warren announced the results of a dna test this week thunder warren who like like so many of us who are good students i think it's always expecting all test results to be good test results was very happy to announce the results of this test and probably thought it would prove triumphant instead it's been a result it
in a huge backlash
warren was of course attempting to prove that she did have native american ancestry and bust that trumps slur of her his constant calling her pocahontas was even more baseless than it seemed she instead scored what we call an own goal in soccer and in politics he made herself look foolish he reduced herself to trumps level
and last and she irritated really really irritated people who are to support her
so isn't as lane a cherokee nation should be just say another name mac engraved yes and emily can you just should have given the background about why weren't ancestry
became an issue to begin with because i think some of it locate to from ivy league law schools a place that you places that you know well
embarrassingly it's out so i mean elizabeth one did not get her job at harvard because she claimed to be native american she as far as we can tower has explicitly no implying and benefit from it and she made that really clear in as five minute video that she released however however did claim her
one plane as like the first minority end to get tenure she checked the box on a farm for the it's called the last the american association of law schools anyway and like a law professor directory basically so she said his lead clean in a small but significant way to having his heritage now
you know she says this is based on family law and that she was like expressing pride in this part of her heritage
okay except did you know making anything that seems to be a sort of self interested claim of having native american heritage is questionable thing to do especially because tribal slow tribal identity is you know really important matter for tribes how
you establish that you're a member of a child daycare a lot about it and they have their own rules and ways of preceding that are not based on dna they're based on a longing and family ties and you know directly been impacted by being part of the tribe so i feel a blind throughout this has been in
sufficiently send staff to put it nicely to those interest and so okay so she takes the stand a task and in the sort of basic straightforward way she can i guess she did it to say to chant like luck you said you'd pay me a million dollars if i could prove that i had indian heritage luck i just proved that
now be quiet but it just to do that without talking to the cherokee nation and figuring out how they were going to feel about what was essentially a political stunt i just don't understand that all like i don't understand on a human level it seems mean and on a political level it seems like
own goals like a nice way to put it i just don't get it and you know you can say like given all the things all the if if you're a liberal like elizabeth warren has lots to recommend her policy wise and character why is that this is some kind of blind spot that is troubling i don't know how else to think about having
ran all the responses from the native americans who just seem like this i mean especially given our history of how we have treated in decimated native american tribes to be an american politician that doesn't seem to really care about how they're going to react to your self interest to claims about your heritage like i have stunk
here's would seem striking to me democrats are
twenty days away or little less than twenty days away from a huge big mid term where everybody's is a nationalized election route wants to keep the eye on the ball why would you do this three weeks out when your party is know needs to stay focused on the never benefits from culture wars know precisely right and
that's that's my next territory here which is it seems to me that when you getting one of these stupid political fight would you want to do is get into a stupid political fight where if people can't follow the details of why you're fighting they never the less have communicated to them you're deep interest in a thing that they care a lot about and
think they're a lot of people out there who care about this question of identity or not identity now
you could say well what they care about as they want to see a fighter for the democratic cause against this president who is fights in a different way okay but if that's the case this is not a victory in the wily primary right the wily primary is who is more widely than donald trump and whose michael of an audience
is pronounced bathing is winning that he's trying he's trying to participate in the wily primary everybody on the left is going to have to and one in one way or another participate in the wily primary to show that they are more widely them donald trump against to mayor going to have to go up and this was a bit in that i don't think in law
yeah yeah and the lost in a bad time at a time where democrats it seems to me if i were a democrat i would want to see somebody fighting on my issues in his and to be really fair to her this is what i was with foreign when people used to watch your you tube videos that's what they used to watch is her fighting on
kind of traditional democratic issues in a way democrats like to see their candidates fight and so she's replaced her herself is that we have herself as this for the moment for what his a new cycle what south park
been frustrating about this is not only does not trump trumpet basically confirmed the attack
that's fair know his attack which was a racist and gross attack but the the subtext of that attack was it wasn't really about did she have native and history or not it was she taking was she virtue signal into she taking advantage of it in the game in her elite snooty ivy league university and getting
privilege out of it
i don't think she did that as a university professor but she certainly trying to do that now she's trying to virtue signal now she's trying to indicate some connection which she hasn't earned she's a white woman who has some as we all do somewhere and her pass something happened way i think you're being a little unfair hear what like wow
she does i mean i don't i don't i'm so disinterested and of the stand a stuff like this is convinced me that i am as person who's going to kill the last but i will just to stick up for on the fact checking friend and now i'm relying on gland cast lot of the washington post she does have more native american
suggestive dna and the rest of us like and she does have this family story of some sort of tinge of racism and prejudice of her father's family toward their mother's family
like that anyway that's feeble also you don't know anymore was in the messages aren't even have a dna test as far as i know i don't have a girl i know i'm
elders and your family
yeah here and it wasn't in the united states whose families that you know you get the test who knows and is it is also clear that there's nothing in her life nothing meaningful her life suggests that her native ancestry insofar as she has it has been a like a significant fact in her life at all she's not someone who's who's spent time
on reservations she's not someone who has deeply studied native law she's not someone who's worked and eight of law i don't think and so to to associate herself with it at all is just lane and it smacks of the kind of that kind of pc showmanship that gets so many people riled up
and it just she should never have talked about you should have rushed out the route the column about that she should have just said you know that was a bit was wrong to to like talking about that and never talked about it again never had a dna test never talked about the dna test if she did have it it's just everything she did on this was wrong headed and and i can't
the
they of it is so profound it's really frustrating
i agree with that never tagging i mean i totally agree with like not checking off the box not doing the dna test time i guess i'm like eighty percent with you than that i didn't like you have a family a story about your family that captures your imagination and some way that doesn't offend me what offends me is over claiming for it and not like aligning your
claims with the people whose lives are really affected people in the cherokee nation or other tribes
it seems also if you're gonna do come combat with the president on values and and identities stuff when a whim and also there's other there's other territory which isn't anything to do with you personally about where you might get
i don't know it's not it's not a great played for pick your terms of yeah yeah
of that one thing know that i like breeding for today reminded me of caught using pocahontas as an insult as horrible can we just just check that off like it
pocahontas is based on a real teenager who is effectively kidnapped and who died when she was twenty one i think in britain or she was like spirited there i just i didn't totally understand how disgusting it is to go around making that into a joke it's really gross and that is on on trapped not island
but warm
then you should know by the way this was the week of course foods to us which is jackie though different
i guess we're even another that trumps whatever trump says
trumps original a fault with fifty times worse than than morons feeble perry if just she just didn't need to do it
think to change the subject a lot the dna tests are good for the world do you think this information reveals anything that really helps us have understanding connection or more principally a source for alienation and a miss reliance on blood over over the actual thing that shaped you
the culture the family grew up around the place up in a friend who grew up around that's such a good class getting really great i struggle with this because a a general kids and born to be pro fact and pro information and dna is just a piece of information so why should i be lying around time
not to find out about themselves i do think that we don't really understand what it means on there was huge confusion and the reporting of elizabeth warren's dna results
and i think we over over interpret our genetic makeup yeah i'm in this did make me think about how totally in curious i am and about this and i hadn't really thought like i was just being lazy that's not just laziness like i just don't care about this at all i don't think and
maybe it's because i have an incredibly boring
ashkenazi jewish genetic makeup as far as i know so i don't there's really only grew up for that or do you or do i but i have had friends who have gotten quite unsettling recent information from do it and twenty three and me in terms of their health and andrew
in japan who is not your parent as it turns out like something else was gone on that will that
yeah that's you don't want you don't
that i don't know maybe you do on that i mean i'm not sure whether that's good or bad but it it is not made me anyway i just think the whole thing gets over we get over invested in and think about it too much
ancestry where you're where you people came from part because i have is that i tell myself i'm in my particular my mother's side is a most of them i mean it's amusing on them if it's true
i'm probably a quarter irish but behave like i'm eighty five percent irish and so i'd like that
know where the rest of me comes from because everything and went dead so his brother joe home
cause i got hi matthew i'm interested in the geographical aspects of a i think
i am curious but i'm totally unclear serious about the kind of notion of from the that i'm discovering family or that i'm somehow discovering character by discovering income family secret your family is the people who raise you spend time with you got through your family
no ambiguity somebody who's a who gave oh
impregnated someone three generations ago
or someone who donated sperm is not a father on a parent
that's nothing to do with it and there's this
spend all this time to my sperm donor
brooke and sperm donor region of and i really became i really got unhappy watching children look for their father they were looking for their father and i always felt like that people are not your father there be supplied some genetic material which has helped shape you i'm not saying that the genes certainly have an affair
on you but
the only thing the only person who can be a father someone who is who is present and and acting in your life that genetic effect is not that is not real it's hugely real but it's not that person is not does not matter
endless the further you go back in your genetic make up then you wind up like you know what if i wasn't one hundred percent ashkenazi jewish and i had some other like dna that i i'd still be my white jewish self because you know as you were saying before about elizabeth warren i've never
like been impacted by being part something else it would be like ridiculous to go around and suddenly claiming that that was had some significance in my life whereas people who look like that have a close relative who is black or hispanic or something else like that's a different experience up the world right i mean that's where
i feel like you have to be sensitive and specific and how you let people to find themselves
by the way i'll make a better if you're under twenty three main yourself that you are not one hundred percent of the jewish find good that would be more interesting i be totally happy about that but again i don't think it was given that that's my own sense of by heritage and saw only thing i've got going culturally i feel like you'd be silly to then suddenly be like oh i'm there i don't
i'm italian and i'm italian or know this
i came over here because of that potato famine famine in ireland just like dogs fan

there was a brilliant essay by as required and box the region of american politics
the came out this week the very short but i phone
astonishing piece that pulled together a lot of a troubling themes and american political life
the senate underrepresented the most populous states the sham of the electoral college presidents lutheran popular vote the rigging of congressional district birth by german during and locking in of for incumbents the manipulation of campaign finance laws in a way that particularly helps one party the use of unheard of
tactics to lock in an ideological majority and supreme court
the basic unfairness of a system that requires democrats to win
international national group by eight points just to play even the unfit stability of the constitution the disenfranchisement and franchise meant of citizens in dc and puerto rico
the concerted campaign over the past decade or two to reduce loading by people who are more likely to vote for democrats
using tactics that are racist sometimes and slimy most of the time
and what as or conclude from this is that would create a politics where the left no longer increasingly doesn't believe in legitimacy of the american political system
the right by contrast will believe that any effort to change those rules
to balance it in a way that liberals the left would like to balance it that any effort like that would would also be illegitimate and that therefore we're in a standoff
in a stand off with with a conservative minority
putting a chokehold on a lot of political power no clear way to fix it to allow populist power or to allow democrats to alter their candidates majority it's majority power in his argument you just populist or democrat it's just majority death
so to use that one case that he said that's not really what the topic of this this segment is but also say that on flowers
the focus of this is on one case where some piece of this is an action which is in georgia where the secretary of state republican bryant camp is in charge of elections in the fairness of election
he is also the republican intended for governor and he stayed on the job
secretary of state state even as he run for governor
just some of his predecessors did also running for governor have knocked on they stepped down from the job and he appears to be a gauge in a campaign to disenfranchise voters who are more likely be democratic and more likely be african american so what's the what's what does that said that camp is doing what does it said that is going on in georgia
so can is what's the word suspending i suppose the registration of fifty three thousand people who tried to register to vote in georgia because of what's called the exact match role and this is a policy georgia has been and can have been trying to put into place for years have previously been in previous generations
they were blocked by the department of justice from doing this now we don't have the o j playing that role anymore and the exact match program means that if there's any tiny error in spelling a missing hyphen you use like you know dave instead of david as the first name you don't get to be officially registered
hard and that can happen if the county officials entering the data makes the error so a small error means that your registration gets kind of held in some nether world now i want to say really quickly that this does not mean you can't vote you can still vote and if you bring and
election officials recognize your i d you can even vote regularly and not conditionally so all these folks who have gotten these letters from the drawing secretary of state can still show up at the polls but it's to send them a confusing letter suggesting that there's a problem with their registration is to suppress their vote and the
few states that use this exact the exact match system are places like kansas where chris kyle back who's like even higher on the pantheon then brian camp of trying to i would say limit access to the ballot that's like this is his kind of tactic florida did this one point
under another republican administration bad was making other active efforts to throw people off the rolls you know look always with this question that's a balance do you want people to be fraudulent signing up to vote no we don't do we have evidence that that's really a problem of any magnitude know we do not have that evidence we have
lots of evidence of people being blocked from voting or what i call sort of a soft block burners
yeah exactly
and it just so happens that seventy percent of the people who got these letters are african american even though i think it's something like thirty two percent of registered voters in george are african american so we see you know racially desperate outcomes here and then we see bryan camp saying like there's nothing wrong with this i'm just do
doing my job this is you know has no racial implications and that is just hard to swallow on its face states abrams who's the democratic candidate from georgia
and i should say disclosure a former law school classmate of mine of whom i am fond you know she has been waging this battle in georgia for years to try to increase voter registration and camp has been her phone that and so what we're seeing or national headlines about a long running bad all which is
you started out framing david you know ezra klein's peace does a really good job of pulling back and showing how this is like one piece in this mosaic or seeing right now that runs counter to majority majority rule and the country
it seems like the one piece of his argument that is
possibly seems more fixable
maybe i'm miriam
deluded but
because somebody because he's bigger argument that's what's interesting about it is his argument is the structural flaw exists so it's not the things you don't like about american this is his argument where they grew they're not and south of the things you don't write about america or the result of the behaviors of the various people it's beyond the structure itself is broken
produce argument to is that people are exploiting the broken nose
but anyway
david one quick point before your when the question
fascinates me hear about this and to the extent that it becomes a national story is that the political science research suggests some time that people get quite motivated when they think their voters being taken away from them in this election one of the questions was going to be whether minority voters were going to turn out for democrats across the country in the numbers the democrats would like them to turn out
georgia maybe a special case because of socio rooms but whether this becomes a turnip mechanism more broadly because african americans obviously being denied the vote is pretty much central to the effort and her story in american history
that was kind of the question was actually going to ask you john which is that there is this notion of as you say and political science literature that the attention to voter suppression tactics increases the turn out of people who feel threatened and i i think there's clearly some evidence of that but it also feel like voter suppression gotten pretty good and it is
true that people give up when it's convenient to vote they go to the wrong polling place and they can't don't have time to get to the right one the the line is too long because the machines aren't very good at around of people are that they've closed a bunch of polling places and consolidated moments of the lions too long and you can't be late for work or election there's not enough early voting and the only to you can vote
on election day but you you've got to work on election day or you've got to get home the line as long at the end of the day and you've got to get home at take care of your kid and there's so many inconveniences that pile up that even that motivation that happens which i do think clearly see and and clearly saw when people are murdered vote they will stand among line well
indoor more the
the
the tactics to discourage people from voting are pretty excellent as well and i am not i'm or
that that the motivation fighters winning over the inconvenience side right now one of the interesting things to watch and test is whether whether you call it voter suppression or and attempt to just kind of there are two things is one which is really trying to do something that's borderline illegal other is to to spend money and
on social media to just kind of depressed turn out by just bombing out different groups and keep which which is in which may be underhanded but is within the boundaries i mean it's within you know
really trying to press the turn on the outside and that was something the trunk campaign was it was successful in doing in the presidential election and what surprised me is that as a tactical matter the democrats haven't kind of tried to bolt told us together and which is goes to your point david which makes this more of a sustainable argument which is in other words
usually so voter suppression has been useful because it's happened quietly as you say the efforts are are good they're hard to sometimes identify they have been quickly him but in this case you could imagine a situation which somebody takes the voter suppression efforts or even a hint of them and ties them to a larger discontent among people of color
with the entire term presidency which would seem to me to keep it in the news or give it more energy than than than simply the narrow issue of is your vote being denied you that's a really good point especially because while some of those disinformation tactics are within the bounds of the first amendment if there
paid for by foreigners i e russia has no luck
fair there are no longer least
foreign influence in our actions that is both illegal and not something that most americans want to think is the reason that our elections go the way they do
do you guys think to you
dude
the shape of ezra his argument about the relative remember politics was very familiar but it does in much more like a national political issue than a local political issue that at the local and state level not that there's not manipulation we see in states like wisconsin in north carolina that that strong republican majorities of attempted to change the rules to institutionalize
is broken power disenfranchised places where where democrats traditionally have had influence so it's not it's not completely a pair playing field that the state level but the state level politics is is much less subject to this and therefore maybe that's a that's an area where where democrats should focus their efforts
other than trying to the national national political winds are so much harder as we see with the senate
this year and even with the house this year and therefore a lot of state level focus where politics is more responsive and and more fair might be a better place to emphasize so that such an interesting argument because traditionally it's republicans and conservatives who have invested a lot of energy and state
offices and and thinking about federalism and the power of the states and liberals and democrats have
had more faith in the national government so here's one downside of you just suggested the federal government has enormous resources in power ever more sell it becomes hard to ignore if you wanna have policies that affect lots of americans lives you know it is like the elephant in the room
but of course your raid that some states
or easier for democrats to take control of i guess what i wonder about we start going down this road is whether we're talking about a more and more divided country and which where you live determines a lot of things about the shape of your life and that's ok because like people can move in that goes but there's something and
settling a bad let me think of the national social compact about having places that you know really differ from each other in terms of deep policy matters
i think i want to say about these questions about the democratic process we're talking about is that democrats when they have been in power has thus far
in a lot of places and certainly on the national level not seen this as an urgent question so there are ways to start shifting this power balance right leg national automatic voter registration could change the picture david lean hired of the times was talking this week about adding senators from dc in puerto rico because he did a piece showing
you know white tee ball benefit from what he called affirmative action based simply on the composition of the senate there are ways to we tell the playing field and thus far those kind of structural fixes have not been particularly high on the democratic party's agenda and i wonder if we're going to start to see that change
change the bombing structural six is is that we
going back and spending some time with
president mann awesome and when you listen to the debates they had first of all the continental congress being totally in secret so that they can think and talk and have a debate without it leaking is seems awfully quaint but also great useful but also the fact that everybody has an argument and a discussion and then because they believe in the structure of the debate that they're having
they all kind of agree with the outcome even if they didn't agree with what the actual outcome is they believe that the structure in the process created a good outcome
a problem with all these reforms which are very appealing on some certain level or at least appealing to discuss because whether you agree with the solution or not you enjoy and learning about the various component parts of the discussion is that we can even have proper arguments any more
at a public level with good faith on both sides so the structural flaws make it hard to fix the structure

behind us and we will go get a drink
oh
very strong cocktail
at a local watering hole and john when you're having your very strong cocktail when you're going to be chattering about when you went
a tough week and that's why in addition to turning to non alcoholic methods of alleviating your stress you might also turned to a cocktail but nick cage
a tough week
past week he found himself on the way to work and then was suddenly hurtling towards planet earth at the speed of sound feeling six times the force of gravity because he was the american astronaut on the pointy end of that rocket that the so use russian space
camps that exploded on launch but he and his russian colleague in the
have and made it down to earth in which is amazing
and why did they do this because they prepared for two years for basically every kind of thing that could go wrong so when they were spinning in the huge vita mix heading in hurtling towards earth they were able to complete their little checklist of things or the valves working is our orientation right how's the rescue crew doing but they did it in russian
cause we don't we just americans just hit tribes and on and so i use now because we don't send rockets into space to the space station that way so he had to do it all in russian and then when he landed safely thank goodness he basically
interviews he did this week he said well you know sometimes things happen and you don't get a vote so this time we just roll with the punches
because he's not going to goods not like there's another one leaving tomorrow you know he's now going to have to wait so you just reminded me another way in which space exploration we know about it in all of its glory and when it discovers and the kind of romantic things that we discover but sometimes even in failure you see something incredibly admirable which in this case was his equity
smitty and is the incredible preparation and grace under pressure that happened in this and i should also known as a stark matter there is a time when the russians and the americans use to measure their rocket programs as a proxy for how quickly they could destroy the other with their nuclear rockets so the fact that when they land
did he reached over to his russian power sitting next to him and shook his hand and then they joked about how fast their flight was seems to me to some be some sort of hope
in the turning of history that you know it's about fifty years after we were on the brink of going to war with the russians and now we're through the space race and then we're operating
i had not heard about that i just read the story if you were talking about a while instead of listening to john you and read that i he was telling the story
both
emily what is your one hundred and sixty proof chatter
i'm gonna sneak in a tattered today
i want to recommend a beautiful piece in the new york times magazine this week by a dear friend of mine dwayne that's it's called getting out and it's about drains odyssey from being convicted of carjacking in virginia when he was sixteen to graduating from law school and being admitted the bar in connecticut
which was not not a done deal that connecticut by seemed to be uncertain about whether to had met him and dwayne persevered and just rates about his experiences with tremendous perspective and heart a law makes you think and and make you feel a lot of emotions as peace i think sell its
called getting out and dwayne worked at my beloved added in atlanta summer minutes just to so go read it and then i also wanted to tell her about remarkable and a trail on the houston chronicle kind for what they call a judicial sweet and the misdemeanor courts so the editorial board is recommending that voters tough
out every judge in misdemeanor courts and harris county that is done and its suburbs who has opposed bail reform there's been this fight now far more than a year over implementing an order from a federal judge that was kind for ending just terrible system
a cash ballon misdemeanor quiets where people are having like literally five second hearings and getting consigned to jail for months before trial on because they had this very high bal sat sell this federal judge leave rosenthal through out the system back in may two thousand and seventeen and there's been a lot of wrangling and over it and resist
tens from a whole bunch of judges they've spent millions of dollars in public money in fighting this order in the meantime bal and charlie's can continue to be kind of mixed up and problematic and harris county and sell the houston chronicle and time voters take get rid of all of these folks i think
it's like ten or more judges who they are crying for being thrown out so i'll be just really interesting to see what happens this issue on election day
my chatter
first a little law grow and self promotion
begging else obscure my company has so many great jobs available right now come and work with me and an amazing calling from brooklyn were hiring a designer achieve commercial officer or a digital advertising sales director a photo editor
program manager for trips and newsletter editor that a lot of great job and to get out with obscure that complex job
the place to be and we have so many fun interesting people working in armor up to so many fun interesting thing so come join me
my chatter is about another slate cast actually i know you have heard of talk and probably other people in your world talk about slow burn the pod cast that me i'm nate far has done for played over the past year or so the first season was of course about watergate the second season has been known about the lewinsky scandal
i just want to urge you to listen to the final episode of flow bernadine if you don't listen to the rest of it it isn't absolutely extraordinary episode because it's about the story of one need or broderick and it has an interview with wanted a broader when he broke records
the woman who described at the time this happened been raped by bill clinton in a hotel room in arkansas when he was a gubernatorial candidate you then the attorney general
and her account of that rape is exceptionally persuasive she told other people about it at the time
in ways that pretty great credit to her story it's absolutely persuasive and bearing and what its own
the slow burn up so not only goes into her her accusation of rape it also goes into how that hung over the impeachment
behind the scenes and impeachment
bill clinton during know the wind ski case
where it was a shadow over but it wasn't actually part of it and it couldn't officially become part of the impeachment proceedings even though was i think by far the most damning charge against him and i also think it gives us a new way to think about how why there's such continued region conservative media and i'm conservative
about double standards and and how clinton manifest and the double standards and the most egregious way that he was it sex criminal who is literally a criminal literally a rapist if you're to believe broderick and this
evidence of wrongdoing was essentially quashed by complicit media and he was allowed to get away with it and then hide behind sanctimony about republican a witch hunting and this doesn't in any sense justify anything that donald trump or cabinet has done but it does get that we
but a hard time getting it why they're so much conservative hatred and disappointment enraged bill clinton and this is how to explain it
really help explain it and it really also helps explain it to i came away from thinking i never want to hear another fucking word from bill clinton and hillary clinton again i just don't want to that story it is it's it's it's an appalling story it's a story that he should never been allowed to to be dog catcher
arkansas a given if that's true
and also just too bad
to your point
they also ate all the enabler who heard and heard the story over the years and didn't get very curious about it
and who are now in the neighbors they would say either in the democratic institutions democratic politicians enabling press they said who heard those stories and didn't really do anything about it and now when they hear stories with one tenth of
their credibility were evidence nevertheless jump all over it because a political polarity has changed anyway so please listen to that episode of slow burn it's the final episode and it's just really is it's a thing that it's made me think most of all the things that have been going on over the last few weeks
we also got great listener chapters this week once again you have your cocktail parties must be incredible parties to be it i would love invitations your cocktail parties
so you are treating us like get for some time you're posting to our facebook page this week we have media vasquez who is one of several listeners who pointed to the story the gym fallows did in the atlantic making their case certainly know raising the possibility that gary hart's collapse and then
in nineteen eighty seven when when he was photographed with donna rice on a chartered boat called the monkey business
that may have been a set up orchestrated by by republican trickster and operative lee atwater and i think the case that has made is circumstantial best but it's really interesting read
get a look at them
i mean you've essentially says that this friend of gary hart's was paid because he needed money by lee atwater to basically set up this photograph set up the night stay by hard on this boat and then set up the photograph where the famous photograph were done rice's on his lap and he's wearing a shirt called earth and a shirt
wild monkey business or that up the book called them like he's wearing a shirt the word monkey business is in the photograph and i can't remember what that was the name of the boat and was a part of what torpedoed is his presidential career that year
you know what's funny about the hard thing no going back to your point david is if there was seen at the time has an overreaching the presses obsession with the sexual pack billows of their candidates that obsession actually you know it didn't it didn't obviously stop bill clinton being elected any kind of went away i mean can you image
and the teams of people that would have been dispatched to cover president trumps poconos as a candidate where this nine hundred eighty eight
the fever of of character investigations into the central practice of seems to have actually been his lesson today then and i don't trust me with donald trump there been other candidates were where are the the coverage wasn't you know the teams and investigators weren't sent out so it's just an interesting moment in presidential history
there's a consistent point there though because john edwards was totally ruined by that but not during the campaign people knew better during the campaign didn't report on newt gingrich subsequent to the gary hart thing people knew he was having an affair didn't report on it during impeachment that's what i mean in the hard case he was and it was idiosyncratic because heart was a certain kind of canada but it was seen in wake of watergate
as a character test we need to test and figure out in campaigns whether the character of our candidates is sufficiently good because you know character can lead you to these awful or character flaws can lead to these awful outcomes which of which watergate was an example of course in the watergate case the character richard nixon it and perfectly clean private life but it was this idea that investigate
patients into character of that kind were a part of the presidential campaign and i i think at least in the hot
this was true with investigations into dole and mccain and others that didn't happen but we're in the background of campaigns that never made it to light

get tickets that's like dot com slash live this is a grim spectacle even though standards of twenty seventeen the controversy over whether president trump slandered president obama by accusing him of not coin the grieving families of dead soldiers the related controversy over whether president trumpet then
he told the widow of a green beret killed in new share he knew what he signed up for the implication of the death of a son of gen john kelly and had a president obama may have treat it that the regular diet we've been eating of political and competent of warmongering of private
waste has been bad enough but now we've added a truly stupid grotesque pointless bile showcase involving are dead
service members so john what does the heart of this contrary why did it and emerge it didn't seem considered or pointed it didn't seem the president trumpets this was something he set out to to create and yet it has become a ridiculous big front page story oh my god i forgot the whole thing about the other one with the president trump
had promised in june to pay somebody a family of bit of another dead soldier twenty five thousand dollars and it didn't pay it until yesterday went to washington post called him on it so
anyway
a good thing
delineate of to
put a little corral around just one part of the story and then and then the other two parts
later but one thing that the most striking thing to me as i think what happened basically was the president was asked about if he'd contacted the families of these four dead servicemen and he was it seemed like an in the moment defensive himself
slash elevation of himself over his predecessors
so i think you're right it doesn't feel like a strategy
the military was one of the last into to institutions although we should add the nfl in here because it was used also is one of the last institutions that was kind of protected and it wasn't perfect but certainly relative to our other political debates kind of protected from the political left right blue red thing
in one of the things secretary at us when we interviewed him few months ago and that he said on and on his he thinks one of the greatest dangers and america is that were tearing each other apart
and he is thankful that it hasn't gotten into the military any more than it already has and then he hopes for a day when people can debate and argue and then still be friends again
so now the into important ways the president for his own purposes has brought the military in the middle of these kind of most heated debates we have first by claiming that the people who neil during football games are denigrating the service of those who fought for the flag or fought under the american flag
and then now this claim about calling families he's basically saying that i'm on the side of the military and obama and the democrats are not and that's really dangerous and he did that all on his own he chose to do that and that's that's really playing fire looks get into that in a second job because i think that those are really good framing
it is also you touched on earth a second ago it's also shocking
his need to put himself at the center of this discussion that the whole context if it was this is what i did
moment where you're supposed to mourn those who have served and who have fallen in the service of the country and it's all about who he is right it's a terrible time to be a narcissistic and it's amazing i mean i guess we should lose our capacity for for shock with the narcissism of president trumpet it's pretty incredible that that his entire modem analysis
around the death of those he sent into battle is oh look at what i've done look at me making calls and much better i am not to actually spend time on honoring in their services really shocking
the thing is this is just not a supposed to be a debate because this is my command doing imagine the hates making these phone calls like of course every president finds it difficult to make these calls and they feel like every other former president at least george w and obama talked about how hard these calls and contacts were that i listen to burn
man i mean jack find it really hard to call up the emotional grace to do it and also i fight with all of these military actions they go awry he doesn't want to take responsibility and there's an element of failure that he just wants to run from and so you know
the thing that he's aborted the sad you know he knew that he signed up for as a way of distant saying one south and not taking responsibility and of course you know it's one thing to have someone in private life is like a bouvier it are have that attitude and then it's another thing when it's rather than presidents
we're going to have our government the way it exists
it's not certain that it presents to call every person who falls in the service of their country
that's not been a standard that we've had before in parts because we've had wars where do you know sometimes you'd be on the phone all day affair with the case but the distance between a president in the orders he gives and the people who carry out those orders there's a reason to maintain that because of what you said emily i mean any president the weight of this
and i remember talking to people in the bush administration about how the president had to be careful about who we reached out to no matter how awful the story because he would set the expectation that he would have to then call everyone and if somebody didn't get a call then they would think somehow their service wasn't worthy of the other person's what am i remembering correctly
wasn't there a big scandal in during george bush's presidency about their was embarrassed i can remember this for the woman whose son had died in her test of the arrow towns and
the meet him and he never met with her right yeah right
wasn't she left standing outside of events and that was upsetting but wasn't she also protesting the war cindy sheehan said right
so then you could argue and i'm not criticizing but that the politicizing of the question of morning and meaning with the family is one that's coming from the family whereas this time we're seeing it come from the president i mean one thing i found really unsettling was reading some of the fox news what i guess web coverage i haven't been watching
television him but just reading the way it was being spun as a story in which the politicization came from the family and the democratic congresswoman and from the press like sort of blaming the price for finding that story of person who said that promise twenty five thousand dollars that he didn't give as
if like it's coming from the other side and it just struck me as one more time in which we are seeing alternative facts as well as alternative opinions it's a completely different presentation on the news story i question whether for the for wilson the congress someone who brought that up
should have done the i did think it was a little
i thought it was off those for to take words fundamentally private conversation between the president i'm a widow
and to make good news out of it
i'm sure president trump perfectly perfectly willing to believe that present have handled it poorly and didn't express empathy in a way that you would expect but i'm not sure that anyone who served by that that piece of it becoming the scandal
oh i agree although the widows in the middle of this then said that she confirmed the congress on this account she didn't say i wish that she had never a part of that and it was a call that was on speaker phone i mean that's not really the same thing as a totally private car and then we have trump saying that the congresswoman is lying adding to their so i don't know maybe you think that big
because ms wilson who sort of you know first on this one yeah that that but i think like it's a little much to say i mean if the widow of this fallen soldier had sad like please give me my privacy that's the one thing but that's not actually what happened
you know maybe it was really hard to listen to that call it sounds like it was shouldn't we grant or the privacy maker has to ask for a given that she's dealing with the death of her husband and what's a super hyper charged political moment that she doesn't have a lot of control over
assuming that wilson didn't like just did this spontaneously on around without asking permission and maybe that's true but i don't think we know that well even if she were given permission is this really like is your response to this to throw my you should johnson in the middle of a in the middle of a huge national fight
i mean isn't that up to my asia johnson like that's not exactly the not play angers woman way but i'm not sure that we know that how jobs and doubt about it i mean that's like you're assuming a lot there i think maybe that's the case but i haven't read anything that suggests bad johnson was unwillingly thrust in the middle of this certainly thrust
right well i guess my default position would be don't thrust unless explicitly told to go out and make a big deal about this which teams
oh you know i mean if maybe the maybe that's right maybe you should johnson said go out and tell the world about this i think that
so would surprise me
what do you guys make of president obama been silent in the face all this this president trumps original comments putting down obama greeley infuriated president obama former staffers also muster monaco
predator neighborhood who step in chief of staff for the president for prisoner obama treated this was a fucking lie in the president trump was a deranged animal which was pretty pretty strong words frank frank and honest exchange of views but why do you think the president obama himself has not spoken i guess there's no
no gain right
yeah i mean what's there to say like he tried to handle this differently i also think that john new to the point you made earlier is rate presidents don't call every single phone jar and i think also president obama had other people posting photos of him meeting with the family is in the white house like the wreck the historical record
it is clear and don't know what else he could really say that wouldn't see him again just be adding political fuel to the fire and i think he has been great time pretty are non to do that unnecessarily to you
i think politically john going back to your original point that this dragging the military and attempting to put present trump in the military and one side of the divide and president obama and democrats present and the other do think that is going to be effective in this case it's clear that the military is a conservative it's to should generally
i think if you if you looked at how soldiers i think they vote and officers who they vote for republicans were in the vote for democrats but as a kind of unify national entity is the president going to succeed in fracturing that
i don't know i mean that's the the worry here is that i'm now everybody's gotta take sides and where you're where you take sides depends on who you whether you support president trump or president obama and you kind of have a default position based on that not based on the underlying institution emerges means it's just
like every other damn thing in life now
and the question is who who does the reset hear of this who resets with the simple proposition that presidents all love the people who fight under their command period moving on
the like these stories now that are like the number of people that did color didn't call obama do color didn't call it just
it feels like we're talking about any other thing in itself is bad
do you think we're going to get to the point where everything is political doritos or political shag carpet is political that no matter what thing is that you're going to have to be associated with with one side or another that's what it feels like we're heading
i think we were pretty much
the air with football i mean that i was talking to somebody last night is kind of a republican but not a trump supporter who said you know i'm just really angry i wanted football to be you know that's what i do for fun i don't want to think about politics when i'm watching football and i don't want to think about whether this person he is or isn't
patriotic or does or doesn't respect the troops and want to watch people run towards the end zone and it or not succeed
like all i want

the new yorkers unstoppable jane eyre profiled vice president mike pence this week the gist of the piece woes
hey liberals if you think trump is bad pence would be worse a full scale basically competent koch brothers acolyte corporate republicanism
at it's finest with a strong side salad of social conservatism
in marriage telling pence is a bit of a non entity but who harnessed is wagon to the coax ideological movement
as well as his own conservative religiosity and is now infusing the trump administration with coke is
pence his control of the transition processors influence on the transition process brought tolkien like scott pruitt and betsy divorce and to the administration sankey mayor also strongly suggested that pencils preparing for his own presidential campaign which of course he would be in which could come and twenty twenty or twenty
twenty four on one assumes emily was or anything regulatory for you
the the story about pets
what i was really interested in was the sort of tagline back in back and forth of influence from the sort of coke more straight laced you know let's like cut taxes oh by the way you know the koch brothers value when up thirteen billion last year i think to ninety seven billion general is treating that
the speak do so this sense that you know we have these really determined people who want deregulation and want to be able to make as much money as possible essentially and that pants was down for that project but then there's this divide sort of between the coke and trust and the interest sort of
populist part of trump is represents in the form of steve ban and so you have these like critical quotes from ban in and jane mares piece about pets and you can see behind them like the coax on one side and then the murderers who are funding you know the ban and uprising on the other and i don't
totally understand how the weather there are really deep differences between these people or whether they agree on like ninety percent of an agenda and so then they like viciously fight about the last ten percent it's just kind of confusing and it shows you know what happens when you have one party rule which we
right now which is that it magnifies the importance of policy and cultural differences on one side because they're in control
what are those distinctions
they ten certainly seems more socially conservative right so you have you know this anti abortion agenda
he was signing bells that you know the got indiana a lot of embarrassment in the algae b t realm but that's not really coke and now see morally grey that was like pence is on christianity speaking out but then you have ban and basically warning that expenses president will be a tool
all of the koch brothers and that that's very different from donald trump but like in the end policy wise when you look for example at the tax packet of the republicans are trying to pass on much difference is there really here yeah i don't know maybe my pencils a representative of a basically the mainstream of though
republican thought don't trump is not in the mainstream one importantly a problem when can i just started in are up to toronto paul the idea that mike pence who by the standards and ten or fifteen minutes ago
a conservative extremely conservative the idea that he is
the center of mainstream conservative republican brought his role a testament to how far that party has moved a little goodwill but i guess by that by that what i meant was he's for deregulation and tanks he's the sort of the paul ryan
mitch mcconnell whatever we can do to get to these goals and then he on them on the social issue stuff is further to the right now obviously during george bush's presidency he was
he was kind of them you would have put him in the freedom costs if it have existed at the time
so even as i say he's in the mainstream republican pod i guess what i really mean is relative to donald trump who's been all over the lot me don't from came to the job without roster of people he ran as a republican so we picked the republican roster and the republican roster has been supported by and created by
though large funders in the party which is almost certainly the koch brothers in other words if you'd had scott walker you'd have the same cast people most people have been voting republican politics are getting their money from the koch brothers at some level i guess what i'm trying to figure out with this piece and with the administration itself sells is whether my pants was there are not a lot of these people
cool would have found their way into the into the republican ranks one of the things that comes out in
mears piece about pets is that you don't seem to be a nice guy like people think he's he's a nice guy he's always been super ambitious and had his
i'm a main chance but he's he's not he's not a bad human being
but he has put himself in the thrall of a sociopath
and he has been unwilling to do anything to to challenge that are when trump has been called on his grotesque human behavior and behavior that is a christian indecent lascivious pencils done nothing about that it does suggest him when he's not someone who's likely to make any
hard choices
life
well great i mean this is the fast and bargain he can only remain in office i mean i guess this is actually not true he can remain novice forever that's the power he has is that time can't fire him but he can only be a player if he is obsequious that's like that demand that champ seems to require and so you know that
obviously limits isabella you just stand as any kind of moral counterpoint you know there are also some interesting like actual policy moments in jeans piece that illustrated that's like a big fight over whether to admit any syrian refugees and to indiana people who'd been a family have been vetted for years who the catholic church in india
a very much wanted to reset olson's this is cause that is important to catholics and other people of other religions to be welcoming etc and pence blocked it for political reasons and again you have this sort of move toward the easy or a political stance are what seems to be politically required as opposed to
some other kind of large our sense of purpose and so i guess i emerged from his profile with a feeling that's been familiar to me from the beginning of the presidency which is that a pants presidency would have smoother edges like we would not be having some big fight about gold star family is or the nfl it would be much
easier to ignore but presumably the agencies would be humming along make a lot of changes the way they are now the etc the republicans in congress will try be happier and passing something and so it might very well be that you know the basic thesis that liberals would be unhappy or in the and that a lot and would be pa
se wise would be changing but there would be less fuss about it that seems right and then i guess you balance that against what we were talking about earlier which is this really dismaying sense of like the whole social fabric eroding and division for a division sake it's hard to imagine pants been particularly effective in that way he just like that doesn't seem like his thing
the policy would be roughly the same either way one thing though that is that use that in previews parts of his career
vice president has paid a lot of attention to at least though the him no
there were some boundaries and politics obviously after he ran and he took that pledge about no longer doing negative campaigning he had some level hears that call that you're supposed to behave a certain way and then one of the criticisms people have made is that when he then uses his stature to cover them for the president so for after the
after the access hollywood tape when he said he was grateful the president had expressed remorse
the president didn't really express remorse the candidate be the he said it was locker room talk and sort of let's move on
he acts as a cover for some of this behavior but if it were just him i think there would
i guess i'm basically agree with you emily about the gold star families but i also think he would probably work to try to
do what normal presidents normally presidents have done which is try to reach out to the other party and months he he would succeed in them on saying that there would be with thousands of bipartisan bills but
president trump has almost not ever except for the like brief little moment with them schumer and pelosi which was evanescent has not really even nodded to those traditions so i guess that would be one place where you would see
would expect a difference one of the things that struck me in reading about pens and pencils kind of like it doesn't seem like he's particularly smart he's a good talker and he's clearly was a great talk radio host and he has a nice demeanor about him but there's this very effective
local grassroots public policy ideological efforts that have been made he comes out of pens comes out of his heritage backed indiana think tank
there's a lot of ideological training and a lot of resources and preparation that's taking place at a local level of conservatives who want to have a role in politics and pencils kind of a clear a triumph of that and i wonder if that
f can learn anything from what do you think i was i think he's perfectly smart enough rain that if you have these model bells that you can get behind you and you have lots of position papers from the heritage foundation
you know you have backing for whatever positions you want to take the agenda becomes pretty clear and you can exercise power effectively without being like a genius you can kind of roll it out
i think democrats tend to be more divided along those lines and mean an organization like alec the american legislative whatever the he is council which has been so good at creating model bills that than different republican legislators and state has his pass around the country the democrats don't seem to have an operation that work
quite like that although to give them some credit right now the activists i'm on the left has been pretty strong and certainly they have position papers on ideas and like evidence supporting them they don't they just don't tend to get adopted in the same kind of uniform way where you have the feeling that like okay anyone is like pleasant and and good spokes
person could make this agenda propellants i'll forward
funny thing i mean just to the pleasant piece of it the reason pentiums you president is the trump ended up having to spend an extra day in indiana because his plan to retire and the had dinner with the pencils and like them but the trump seems to think that looks like a vice president and there's always talking about how we look at look at what does that he straight of central casting or some other phrase like that
it doesn't isn't some policy genius he's not he's smart enough and he's good looking in a very straightforward this guy looks like a republican presidential candidate kind of way and then to ban and at least and jeans piece band and tax bad him is a kind of like necessary sop to the coke
jokes on his part of the raid and that kind of so that allowed for him to come into trumps tan john let's let's close on the ban and question actually which is do ban and and pent actually represent as we've hinted at two different parts of the republican party and what is ben and up to ben and abandoned supplies the most pungent quote
mer peace and ben and also engaging in this campaign to fund challengers to a lot of
and a lot of senate races
well it is his quotes in the peace or fascinating the most interesting part of the piece i think that at one point he says you know if mike pence became the reason would be bad as if mike dense became president is the dinner then he would be sort of the the president of the koch brothers
we should remember that the president president trial by the candidate was very clear about the relationship between big money and the republican party has republican politicians he said it made them puppets he particularly said anybody who went to the koch brothers annual meeting was there to bow down to their puppet masters and that would then be a puppet of the koch brothers
when he talked about draining swamp in the course of the campaign that's what he was talking about they've changed the definition of what that means for a variety of reasons including the fact that when you need off the shelf staffers to staff up all these agencies you need people who have been lobbyists and presumably if you're draining the swamp you don't fill your administration with lobbyists but
that's when he said like that was the point that's the band and message about corporate interests which have
which are support free trade in which support the policies the koch brothers
well i don't want to say that the relationship between money and getting people to do their bidding and not the bidding to the forgotten man
that's the ban and view and it was the president's view i did but you can't run a presidency that way so that's the tension here but it gets very sloppy because also there were bit several strong quotes in the piece about how mike pence isn't is necessary because there's kind of know crazy chaotic president
doing his disruptive thing which is what he was elected to do and what
he wants to do but but but ban and everybody recognize that that you can't do that alone so you have to have a connection to the rest of the party and that's the mike pence is the bridge
he he's necessary but you wouldn't want him to be president seems to be abandoned view

cbs the sixty minutes and the washington post teamed up on an amazing story this week how the pharmaceutical industry particularly a portion of the industry distributes drugs
rather than makes them or sells them directly but distributes to pharmacies pressured and lobbied congress and the agencies and the president's president obama administration to ease back on trying to limit excessive opiate distribution by pain clinics the
the story comes out of a whistle blower former official named joe joe an apprentice name reddit but you're right
easy who told cbs and the post how he and the drug diversion offer city ran tried to stop these three large distributors from filling obviously shady orders
example incredible example if the pharmacy in west virginia town that has fewer than one thousand people that ordered nine million hydra cota and pills over the course of some years in two thousand and eleven these drug distributors who didn't want to be constrained and who they could distribute to it at what scale started in this telling and cbs and the post
started pushing back against a and tried to get the at ease up on them a little bit and in two thousand and thirteen
pennsylvania congressmen and tom marino and mimic tennessee congresswoman named marsha blackburn both republicans sponsored a bill to get the purpose of which was essentially to take away the da's authority to free suspicious shipments of opie lloyds the bill had been strongly pushed by industry
they spending corn to some numbers one hundred and two million dollars lobbying for this bill to pass it passed without any opposition was signed by president obama has gone into law ran a cc who would oppose this easing up on guard distributors with pushed out of court eat his own telling and tom marino in fact had then been put forth as
the drugs or for president trump there's a lot of moving pieces in this so emily was there scandal here maria with now withdrawn his the name is drugs are after the storm came out and there was outrage about it but is there a scandal here and if so what is it yet
this is really interesting story i mean it seems like there are folks at the da who are furious and feel like their ability to try to address the obesity epidemic by blocking distribution was really hampered by this law and there's like a whistle blower in this story and
long live the arctic all by a farmer yeah are making these claims when you look at actual change in the wording of the legislation as a lay person it's a little hard to see how this change of already had this enormous consequence but it has that flavor of the kind of story that makes you think that congress as passing things where the fine print mean enormous amount
and somehow it didn't break through this law was passed without even an official roll call vote and just sort of snack along and then you get the sounds like maybe dan marino was in the pocket of the drug industry i wonder if there's like are more complicated story about the distribution of opie like that
also includes the doctors who are writing the prescriptions and the prescription services that are filling those prescriptions at huge volumes in a lot of parts of the country i felt like we are only seeing one part of this larger puzzle to explain like the giant apparatus of supply behind on the oprah and
dammit canal is confusing to me but it was interesting to see a story about like a bad law actually have a consequence for potential trump nominee and it made me think i mean first about trump in the administration and no allegiance to this law and particular and i guess they had no real allegiance to marina either
i think yeah i mean i i was confused by this in part because this law only just took effect but obviously the void
epidemic has been rampant for a decade and so the the had these tools for the last decade
they weren't deploying them very actively and effectively if this was such a big deal why haven't they done more to constrain beforehand and i think part of it is that there was a lot of ambiguity in the law that preceded this law when claim of the defenders of the drug distributors was that the problem was that that law was totally ambiguous and that they weren't sure what was going on
they need they wanted to this law in place so it had more clarity and get i share your a little bit of your confusion here that we have the drug manufacturers who are making these making these drugs in the us now makes and consumes eighty percent of the world's supply of opiates eighty percent and were percent of the world's population
asian
and so the drug manufacturers have a role to distribute of all the doctors have all the state regulators have a role it's weird that this blew up as the big story because it doesn't feel like this to me is the the main crime it's going on but i don't know what the main crime is well is nothing else no one thing
it struck me is that you're right at the the pandemic was fully galloping and i guess the this legislation didn't certainly didn't cause that but in the face of that gallup like the fact that it could pass as as i suppose the question in the aftermath of it though what strikes me is that this could have been and should be presumably
if you think about a president who is willing to pick fights seemingly in all kinds of any direction where there are no barriers here's an epidemic that has heard his voters really
you know in a kind of direct way and he's not on the hook for it at all except for having named drugs are who is associated with the story but i mean he's not and he didn't sign the bill and so forth that he could jump all over this that for a guy who likes to do things that show his bases attendance and get them
but
it seemed ready to
in another kind of presidency in another kind of politics where you would have imagined a president jumping on those and there's just been very little rosen sign that at the justice department said he's very concerned about the story and is going to look into the know da needs more tools to carry out its mission that sort of struck me from the
the general was kind of slow fullness of the trumpet administration on the issue overall amazing is just really sad just seems like such an easy trick room to pick up i mean there's sixty four thousand people that we know of who died and then these estimates it's many more here get last year and that the deaths are actually much greater because they're a lot of deaths which aren't be report
period related which probably are and it's something which would have conservative and roll support it's also not going to be i mean the solution in the eighties when it was crack it was just like let's lock up black people with basically the solution and give them really long sentences and that's and so we know that this time it's not going to be for basically for racist reasons is not going to be a
a punishment solution which leaves the opportunity to huge opportunity for conservatives and liberals and rural and urban to come together on something and save lives and produce misery and it's weird that there's been so little that when it's such a huge issue and where everybody everybody's on
the same team why is there so little action
so i would say that because the solution is messy and when choir really sustained paying attention and order to accomplish something and then trumpet set himself up i mean i guess he's really good at praising and and taking credit no matter what the outcome is but it doesn't strike me as the kind of fight he's been interested in reaching i mean why
so what we've seen him get really behind in kind of fits and starts and bursts of energy are taking down obama has legacy and obama his accomplishments right he really likes that and that helps explain climate change actions and ran and obviously repealing obama care but other than that
i mean what's the pro active trump vision
i guess you could say like a trade war but that hasn't really gone anywhere even renegotiating nafta falls and the camp of dismantling the accomplishments of the past i guess that's and bill clinton accomplishment i don't see the way in which trumps really deep and strong connection to his supporters which seems like a
very real and continuing i don't see how that translates into like a real you know let's start this hard war on opiates together like this sort of l b j war on poverty or even the war on drugs those were long marches and i don't see trump going on long policy marches
but why isn't wasn't the why arthur rural state senators who were saying this is our cause we're just kind of this is what we're going to focus on what what are the hard solution them like what does what would need to be done
i think some people like john mansion and claire mccaskill have been talking about ban i'm sure there are republicans i should be putting into this category as well so first of all you do have to figure out a way to have fewer painkiller prescriptions and take those levels down i in the numbers in west virginia alone of how many you know like a small town
with just millions of these pills are pretty staggering and man is like that means you know that involves the doctors and involves the people who write the prescriptions and pharmacies that fell then as much as it does like the wholesale distributors on the back and the obesity epidemic also goes to these deeper
crises of like the american dream and the american soul you know people who feel like their lives are getting worse not better there was an amazing episode as listen to the new york times the daily this week at the rec and factory in indiana where the woman there who had lost her job was
like she was entangled in really difficult family situation she was someone who had i think she was making like in the low fifty thousand a year which was like a good income she didn't finish hate the church yeah gone to college she was really like taking care of the sick granddaughter and a son who wasn't working and trying to get her daughter off to college and just
feeling like they're asked as she was losing this job and you just have this feeling again okay this these were the people she voted for don time she believed his promises that you know in the whole carrier i you treated about her company to but the idea that there's like a sustained solution as opposed to just like getting everyone really mad about who's taking a need
during a football game i don't think we've seen that
i mean some is easier to get people riled up about a for program and to play on him in this politicians have been doing this for centuries get them excited and riled up about a cultural things on the policy changes are different but
still you would just expect it wouldn't be so
the fertile no issue would be something a little bit better them and ask him to
this may be a super and question goes can smoke weed down about this but is one of the problems with the oakwood epidemic is that it doesn't
it doesn't metastasized violence in the same with other drugs do it doesn't seem i'm could be wrong or could be there's a ton of violence that stems out of opium that i'm just not know
but isn't that isn't that a problem for fighting it because it just becomes it's sort of like oh these are people who whose own motives are screwed up but they're not they're not take him in the new you know with property crime probably played or something but they're busy not going out and killing people that is not a lot of drug violence related to this and which which causes
collective action against to but causes a punitive criminal justice on i mean you could argue the opposite it's actually a huge opportunity because we don't have that fans said just usually induces us to put more people in prison we could really be thinking about social services especially because these are mostly white people who you know the american public or at least partition
i tend to be more sympathetic to our that you could see that kind of policy response here that could then maybe translate into helping some people of color in inner cities but instead this is all part of essentially the shredding of the safety net like what people need our services
and some sense that like there's something to fall back on when our lives far apart and that is not something that politicians are excited about promising right now
yeah although again don't trump has promised you're right i don't say live and they don't want a promise that they don't want to actually and supply it about that
yeah i mean and there was a weird lack of funding for rob portman has worked on this issue her a long time that he wanted as a part of the first round of health care reform out of the senate and the reason with the weird fact that he couldn't get the money he wanted for treatment programs that in ohio been he's been working on this issue for
i mean i feel like forever
been talking about it but again just like
doesn't seem like it should be so hard

let's go to cook till chatter when you're sitting in your home john preparing avidly for our chicago show next week but you still have time to to think about other things what are you going to be chattering about to a little person's well in
dolphin news
there are ours homicide you know many thoughts on this but go ahead
last week we talked about dolphin fishing
but there was a forgotten that i had clip a story about scientists essentially when i'm essentially scientists dropping a touch screen into an aquarium as a way to try to understand dolphin language and interaction apparently the barrier so far has been that while scientists know the dolphins
they have their own language and
rich variety of noises and thanks and pops and grants which all mean things and have the dolphins have individual and specific sounds and one of the problems has been apparently when you can crunch dolphins together it's hard to know which one is talking to him at what time and this has been some kind of a barrier to understanding the nature of dolphin language so
back in the eighties they did the submerged and nine by million foot electronic keyboard that was hooked up to an apple two computer and the dolphins learn to use the keyboard to make requests from their human handlers for things like toys or get a belly rub or something
anyway that kind of is being built on with these screens and the dolphins in that are been held totally in captivity are nevertheless able to play whack a mole with fish to learn the game of welcome all were a fish
disappears if you do the right thing and this is you know possibly opening up new ways of understanding what dolphins
how they communicate and if you can figure out how they communicate then of course we can all drop latin and start taking dolphin in elementary school
and
be the first species that we can have you know like start texting at the end of this because we will have learned dolphin language i would definitely taxes and dolphins and be fun
to be more responsible mentions just and dolphin fishing update news i did hear from vessels
who says that when he goes fishing off and they will accidently her could often and the dolphin will take out your line instantly and so you have to cut it fast because if you don't cut it to spend everything out and take iran or something and that they use hooks that will rust out so that the dolphin
suffer
but he's never actually boat it often
emily what does your chatter
oh i thought i would do one of my periodic updates about the state of north carolina which is doing all kinds of interesting things to essentially change the structure of its government in way is that if you worry
one party can draw seem like they they could be a little alarming so the republicans have veto proof control of the legislature in north carolina and so the fact that the governor right cooper as a democrat from their point he was beside the fact and what they're doing right now is changing how they elect judges so for the first time in one hundred years
state is choosing to have judicial candidates identify by party office still to be an r d next to the name of the judge you're voting for
usually think of judiciary is like one step removed from politics this is step in the opposite direction they're also redistricting the judicial districts in a way that will hit a whole bunch of african american judges against each other by the way they're changing the lines and they also want to reduce the size of the state court of appeals so that cooper the governor
or can't name replacements for some republicans who are leaving office and it looks like this will probably go through and it's lake
district restricting the legislative districts in the last few years in north carolina and other changes they made to how people get elected and who controls the councils that do the redistricting that establish where polling places are going to be just we're talking about like the apparatus of government and of future elections and it's one of those efforts to really entrench
party in power by changing like the very shape of the government these signs that or seeing and i wonder if this is a model that other states will be interested in following
that didn't like me mood

hey
arizona republican jeff flight took to the floor of the senate on tuesday and delivered a sculpture of a speech without mentioning president trumped by name which honestly is quite hard to do it is very hard not to say trumps name for ten minutes i found flake assailed the president and his funky he said ray
reckless outrageous and and dignified behaviors become excuse and countenance just telling it like it is when it was actually just reckless reckless outrageous and undignified
we have fooled ourselves for long enough that a pivot to governing is are right around the corner returned to stability instability right behind it we know better than that by now we all know better than that then this brave david this profile and political courage took his slingshot and his five stones and ran for the hell's he announced he would
not seek reelection in two thousand and eighteen he joins bob quarter the tennessee republican retiring tender from tennessee and george w bush the former president john mccain the arizona senator republican senator presumed to be serving his last term and five years from an election even if he has not serving his last term among the
few republicans who will call out the president almost by name
so emily is what flake and quarter and george w bush and john mccain is what they have done is that courageous is it cowardly somewhere in between
somewhere in between the right it's taking on the president of their party i don't understand the not naming i mean i guess for george w there's some to on the bad a former president that it was so clear that flake was talking about president champ that just seems like that's odd
in the speech deadliest me look i mean i think given where the beef is given flakes own polling which showed that his whole stance against chomp has cost him enormously there is some cost to being the person who stands up at least an immediate term and i think he made it pretty clear that he was making a play for
our history and he was talking about what are we going to tell our kids that we did at this moment on which is pretty profound that's a different lens and politicians normally use to make their decisions about what to say i think i'm the other hand i don't think we should be giving too much credit because speaking against champ is different
from taking actions that actually derail or unsettling his agenda

john
will see and and called the speech one of the most important sentence speeches of modern times which seems premature but
do you do you think it was important do you think this is a significant moment lead depends when you put the needle down on modern times that would be an interesting i know right
if you are going all the way back to the enlightenment
it right
and barely between the enlightenment and and and like eighteenth century that they really weren't that bad a really one and it will send it
they just sat there mute
waiting for the cameras to turn on can i
can i ignore the question
and address this question which is if you were doing the twelfth grade english paper about and analyzing flake speech he started it by saying
mr president i rise today to say enough so the fun of this is okay so the reason and senate custom you don't say the names of your colleagues that's why it's always the gentleman from this the gentle lady from there so when you rise to speak to the president you're actually speaking to the president of the senate but of course in this case it has a double meaning because he could say i wrote mr president
you could imagine he's talking to the actual president since that's the thrust of his remarks but the present in the senate is actually the vice president my pants who is a lifelong and dear friend of jeff flight they both came up through the same kind of tradition the same kind of conservative ideological position and pence through the campaign
constantly trying to convince flake to support that tramp who who did not support any and he said when i interviewed flaky said you know my pants kept saying that the president in private is a different person than the person you see and flake said well that's fine but i don't know how you govern in private
so just in that first sentence he kind of the the entire speech is contained in that first sentence and it's really what struck me about it was that it was a charge to his colleagues to not be complicit in what he says he is allowing this to go forward jeff lake is not exactly a rhino you know he comes out of that western republican tradition which is that the huh
of the new republican party knew i should say after eyes an hour or in modern times here so but you know it's the party of goldwater then of reagan of of nixon all from california all from the west he is not like some ish so this is an ideological argument quarter burger the german the center for relations committee who also not a square
well isn't is not a squishy i mean these guys both vote with the president like ninety five some on percent of the time which we can get to later but coworkers coming at it from a different side not from he basically said that the president is is in danger of getting us into a war by mistake so he's came from this kind of dire
security side so i'm trying to figure out how to characterize what the schism it's about because it's not really about policy i mean quarter and flake have particular policy differences with trump but really it's not that it's tempting to characterize it as a difference of style i don't think that quite does justice to it because they're also
these kind of fundamental democratic values at play about free speech and you know norms and structure of government so is there what how do we talk about it's a really good question because if you believe in what corcoran sleek and the number tempers the conservative movement believe in you are at a disadvantage if your critique is seen as just
theater review in other words he's a little too boring hurt for our kind you know he's not one of us
seemingly and unseemly miss which is and easily punk trouble debating point because it's like you know we could use a little more kind of spirit in our in our country and in our leaders but so the critique it seems to me from the two different positions are from flake it's that he is laws that he is not a conservative and so that ideologically he's not of our movement and therefore doesn't believe in the things
we believe in about limited government about morality restrain freedom like he doesn't believe in any of those things so why are you putting all of our chips on this president i think secondarily he has a moral claim that he makes about the president both the way he behaves in public and also the diminution of the party and the republic that comes from not standing up and saying as they often did
during bill clinton's presidency
is wrong behavior in quarters case it's that he is not up to the job and then he is in danger that he's undermining his secretary of state which is going to get the country in a position where it might stumble into war and or in a position where he is surprised by something on the foreign policy front news air or anything else that his instincts are not up to the top
ask of the job and so his is a much more kind of in the situation room when it's hitting the fan incapable of raising the level where he can make the kinds of decisions that you need to make to keep america safe for do whatever you need to do so those are two the critiques and then of course there are others to emily one of the thing
that flake literally said in his speech which i found bizarre was that he he's essentially admonishes colleagues not to be not to quail before primary challenge not to not to be daunted by that and yet as he out
as he himself goes off stage and so how how can a quarter in quarter and it is perfectly legitimate for someone to give up on politics and to give up on a profession to say i'm not going to run anymore it's fine to do that
all kinds of reasons why one wouldn't want to be a senator wen one wanna be in washington right now
but how can politicians who differ with trump up for these reasons the john just identified there and are in the republican party how can they run what can they do if if these two men who are the so far the most vocal won't stand up and fight and actually do something
what can anyone else do write they're essentially saying that the battle electoral he is last i mean i think you can argue that for the two than they can still be effective laces and maybe an offense if they're not being kind of mocked by steve baton for how poorly and are doing and twenty eighteen race they could get for like
they could be more effective that there's a way in which that they can now on rise above politics and in a particular campaign but they're absolutely not providing a model for anyone to join them who is actually running and array so who would that be a well i mean susan collins decided to stay in the senate and
she is on that would be on the target list in terms of being a republican she's actually far more moderate than a nice too
and so she's decided to stay now and she's obviously not have been this vocal sas has been super vocal will see whether he runs a nap and twenty nineteen and young at that's now
i mean there is a an alternate view of this which is not focused on the to who have dissented but on the and any many many many who have not the fifty who have not joined bad and so the argument turned in another direction is the president's winning he's pushing out these people who who
he doesn't you know who don't like emma say mean things about him great he's gone people be elected who will have to be get elected by supporting the president can be able to get their voters to turn out without that it's to change the votes because these guys normally vote with the president but it's never the less going to have you know it's moving things in the trump direction on its books every one other you are assuming that there are public and they're going to hold the
especially in arizona has no foregone conclusion chain and then i'll be interested that i'll be a fascinating thing to watch now
you could argue that if you want a republican to win in that seat you want to know who you get there is a chance that somebody comes in who is more like somebody mcconnell might like and who would win and there's also a big chance that somebody comes in who's more like the ban and and who's the van and gets as a condition for giving him sport money love and other
he was they will vote against mcconnell as majority leader which will be is one of the things to watch and in twenty eighteen one of the things that i find sort of sad about this whole spectacle is how easily flake and quarter and other people who oppose trump have folded
on this and that to me it's not a surprise that the defections that racine are coming in the senate because the senate is a place where essentially your job is to be a writer british and you don't actually ever do anything you're not responsible for anything
don't govern you just sort of you you high mindedly speeches the vote on class action lawsuits may is slightly again that it was a town
i know but it it matters yeah
it doesn't matter just as most of what they do is give speeches and then occasionally you cast a vote not and rarely these days i mean the article one has not been carried forth with the intensity there anything in there is expected husband one more moment on that they just dismantle the years of work by that consumer financial protection bureau that with going to the right to feel
it was a town of okay but i think it's just they've run at the centers of run up against someone who is it better read a recession than they are and president trump and they've just given up rather than say let's try to take him on let's let's challenge him at this it depends what your audiences because i think
there and this is what we were just talking about which is in terms of the republican off non presidential year electorate he's a better writer addition than they are in terms of the general election on audience or the country is a whole their rhetoric is probably more powerful with that larger group and then the president's yeah i think i believe but yeah
they're not but they will be in the in that year and two thousand and twenty they're going to be lobbyist working with her
pharma well and learning john k six campaign right there's a chance at some of the law primary job but on cases i think has been an admirable figure in the john casey has been consistent about this has stood up about this and has basically been doing this for a year when nobody else was so i'd give him props
so here's another thing that's going to happen is there's going to be a vote on this tax cut bill so what if like quarter doing with that
right so flake because i think fat nothing and opposition quarter has talked about not wanting to add the deficit so he could use that as reason to vote against bet i bet he will vote for and that the reason will be both his conservative politics and beliefs and also the fact that to vote against would be to vote against all his friends right it's not
just trump sick and agenda it's also mcconnell for the leadership that they're buying something harker as close to those people right i think that's yeah i think that's possible
it depends how many more rounds this thing goes i mean because it you can imagine it getting to a level where ones person whether you get into the middle of a fight and you just do stuff that the fight for for other reasons i don't know do you guys read there's an interesting story i think it was in the atlantic
it's always true
but it was the think
think the atlantic sort of surveyed a bunch of historians about whether they thought the civil war was how likely they caught a civil war was the united states in the next ten to twenty years and what was astonishing was that the there were some folks who thought it was like eighty percent likelihood and some of the thought of as as low as five percent but the consensus was sort of thirty five percent
which is a terrifying number but one of the one of the points that that the civil war historians were making was that sort of a instantly they don't think it would be something like where it's shiloh and gettysburg they sort of a different kind of civil war but we're going to bracket that
rounded up with
low low intensity gorilla conflicts low conflicts not not fall two sets of our charlottesville times it and got times right exactly sure i follow every week
and but one of the points to the civil war stories made is that they thought of a necessary precursor to a civil war was actually that the parties have to fracture they're one of the reasons why this happened is that the party system in pre civil war america fell apart and the wigs vanish the republican party emerged democratic party split split
and and so the question is is that likely to happen and the party i assume that's more likely to fracture would be the republican party
john do you think there's any possibility that this what's going on with the flake and a quarter and mccain and bush and romney presages an actual split i don't think so because you see romney mentioned in their romney's been pretty silent there are people even at
the who is in the usual suspects category he's now been golfing with the president twice you have you don't have critical mass and that was talking to a republican is definitely in the never trump camp and trying to figure out what to do with his energy and his argument today was the problem is that you have you have individually you have moments where you have flake and quarter and sometimes season
islands mccain and graham but they're one offs and so what happens is the president can just go as he explained to maria barter romo being the main and then he takes them on individually
they don't get gain the strength in numbers now one really interesting notion would be if the if those numbers let's just take the three you are and up for reelection and then susan collins who seems to be protected from this even though she's running again they could they could hold the senate hostage i mean if you want to pass them and your if you want a majority on tax cuts then come talk to us
for because without us you can't pass it and then you could add you can imagine adding but old ask questions with the president that's the problem as well as well as starting out on health get a definite it on and on taxes on we don't even know i mean right now there is a tax framework which they've now stripped like several things out of and the press
and has suddenly said like i don't want this and so it's not even clear what the tax cut packages anymore and even if you even if it wasn't about getting policy past it would be a way to say wait a minute you want these things to pass then you have to listen to us and you know and to use that as some way to change because one of the things that that i think you're touching on is okay there are complete
since their complaints everywhere but like what are going to do about it how are you going to leverage this moment to improve the lives of the people you were sent here to to represent and on you know that's not happening last point on this emily do you think in a year that jeff reuters a more about her more important figures and american political life or less important than america
the laugh let all yeah i mean i know i think that a well man or less as they see as as what what matters is who is taking over and in our state they're going to have a laugh and laugh at and microphone and know the question really will be as we've been talking about are other people then followed that and what else
happens if they turn out to seem really present but isn't it really just about trumps numbers but the base i mean how can you really get away from the deciding factor can i just on one point which is that there is the substance of what they're actually saying and whether anybody has to rise to refute it and say
i know this is not the case or in the people whether it's president bush john mccain and even john kelly last week talking about the collapse of standards in the country
it's a lot of people are don't on the collapse of standards various people are saying here's who's wrong and his not but what we used to agree on is that if standards of collapse one of the people we might turn to is the president because f d r said officer the presidency is primarily an office of moral leadership so the question then is is this
even if you even if you hold the president let's hold everyone blameless for the dropping of standards who then do we bring on stage to reassert the moral character of the country and if you can't make the case at the president should be onstage
isn't that curious because in most of american history you would he would be the first person you would bring on the stage
i think the first person to bring on stage
that anybody can different

when asked to a hardly need no introduction to your home audience but because we also have left turns out there in the world can packs of the state's attorney fuck a county which means she is the chief prosecutor for the city of chicago and environs chief band twelve years in the office handling cases
what insiders call line prosecutor she left the office and came back and cans action in november two thousand and sixteen to me was part of one of the most interesting and i think important phenomena in american politics today which is that a group of candidates ran for district attorney and state's attorney around
the country in big cities and small cities as self declared reformers and progress and to have a kind of different vision of criminal justice that is not merely about throwing more and more people and press and and it's a more holistic approach to trying to reduce crime and making their community safer and at the same time
i'm really paying attention to fairness in the criminal justice system so it's something i'm watching avidly and fuck am i going to ask first question so you came into office after the killing of the clan mcdonald on and a big fight in chicago for the release of the videotape of that
shooting both your predecessor and mayor a man you all really did not want that video to get out so it seemed and then it dead and so you came into office at a moment right think building and rebuilding trust between lawn poorest man made in your office and also the police department you don't want for see is
it's crucial factor for the culture and health of the city of chicago so how do you what are your first step the big job to take on how do you sort of start thinking about that why either give do first acknowledge that that has to happen and i think you have to say that we have to rebuild
preston and saying you have to rebuild means you have to acknowledge that it's broken and i think third too many people in our systems who don't want to acknowledge that perhaps we had been doing things poorly or wrong or backwards because then you are somehow complicit in breaking it means that you'll continue to do policies
that are bad because you won't acknowledge that it's broken and so i think i was very honest with the people in cook county that our criminal justice system was broken i thought that it was only right to not just look at other law enforcement agencies say police but what is the role of the prosecutor and i think in two thousand and sixteen
there was a real conversation about prosecutors know nobody generally knows who prosecutors are i wished you guys can follow other is around and clapped like you did for me
i have been
does not happen
have you thought about giving them like instagram account i mean
the nature prosecutor yeah i mean because no one it's it's one of those offices that are largely unnoticed ninety five percent of elected prosecutors run unopposed and so yes ninety five percent of elect prosecutors run unopposed so i ran against a two term incumbent
it always i think to myself what happens if i hadn't jumped in even in the midst of everything that had thing
we may have stillman with our former prosecutor and going down a path not just with police accountability around the climate that amount but around mass incarceration around a bail system that punishes poor people around wrongful convictions around juvenile justice in the school to prison pipe
fine and so i think for me same are bail system is broken and having the credibility with the public who already knows it
matters and then it means that i can get by and to actively work to fix those things

every time i
other states attorney's across the country
thank you
so can i do think that probably the first question the are always asked and our local audience may already be bored with this end up going on board with it
but from an outside perspective the the first
thing that everyone is remarking about chicago is the remarkable rise and gun violence and murder over the past couple of years and you are obviously new to grappling with this problem
what for those of us who were outside of chicago why what's what's happened why it had happened and is there any reason to think it's going to reverse so i mean we are in the grips of would spend the last couple of years arise in violent crime in chicago what this audience knows is that we have an over privileged
guns on our streets we have more guns taken off the streets of chicago the new york and los angeles combined
we take more often those two large municipalities combined and so in the course of the last couple of years in the wake of what was happening post lukewarm mcdonald in criminologists and sociologists will all debate
the impact of that is it the police are not doing more aggressive police is it that the community has not been as engage is it just the proliferation of guns i think we don't know what the answer is and anyone who says that they definitively know what the answer is i think is being disingenuous what we do know is that having
access to that many guns no matter who we have children eleven twelve thirteen carrying guns that level of access to guns in the absence of other things that we know that they need quality education mental health drug addiction treatment
really affordable housing the constellation or things that are happening in the neighborhoods most impacted by violence if we only have a conversation just about guns and not about those things and think we're gonna solve the issue of violence we're gonna miss the boat
was really important as a way of framing the fed of question that city needs to address i would add one more thing i'm curious what you think that's matters but i was looking at a graph of chicago's rate of solving homicides and and that has gone down significantly
fewer orders are being solved and that was horrible way to people can make an argument but that also yeah i mean it's all in related i mean if we look at the chicago clearance rate for homicides the number is hovering somewhere this year about twenty three twenty four percent which is incredibly low
when you look at it and twenty three twenty four percent solver not solved
and the national average
sixty percent i think
for shootings is so not not killed someone but you've shot someone and we have on pace of four thousand people shot the clearance rate is five percent one
trump could walk down with the three trunk could walk down the street been literally get away
he's very good so even if it's not clear what's causing why i mean that is a huge factor in terms of how people think about crime reporting the please come as a witness to testify in a cave and which is why i think the legitimacy of our systems matter if you believe this
someone can shoot you are shoot at your neighbor and nothing will happen to them then your inclination maybe if something happens to take it up yourself
so good oh street justice and that doesn't make anybody safe and so i think again
kim ill afford to say to people that were doing everything that we can win we're not and homicide clearance rate the shooting clearance rate i think the chicago police department is actively working on those things and actively looking at innovations from other municipalities because they're not happy with the i mean i don't want anyone who
here to be resigned that this is it is our normal right now but that is acceptable and i think the shock that you all have expressed by that number should also mean a push for accountability and i think that's where we are right now is that there is a reckoning
with our law enforcement partners what we have been doing hasn't worked and we have to do something different is there a isn't a problem to identify where chain
causes these low rates and or is it you know where the problem is you just need to implement a fix i mean how complicated use the response
it's complicated only in that not one entity own sake raid so if you talk to people you know the easy answer is what people in the community don't trust the police and so they're not talking and then if you talk to others it's like well the police came out in they saw the guy lay it on the ground and air and i who shot you and he was like i'm not talking to you and like
while we don't know and then walk away like that's also not acceptable it's not acceptable didn't no one talks and so i think you can't own why into of why that disconnect is there what i do think you need to do is a deep dive i think you do need to look at the data i think for some communities they feel like the effort is being put in
and that kind of fatalistic view of you want us to perish and that's frightening that is frightening and use said
they're looking at other cities and other communities is there a model that has worked in this her listen new york's closure rate is somewhere around seventy percent and at dc is down a little better but one point with almost one hundred of them through was really interesting and homicides went down thank you and pretend to understand
it fits decline
so yes there are other models
and
are those other models replica bowl or they just like well they've got a whole chicago's unique i think we i think it's only fair to say that i think how we do the structures around what we have historically call gang violence in chicago is different than it is in l a different in new york and different in dc
given other sentence of up a i mean yeah i think what's happened in chicago is we don't have traditional gains like people have seen from television shows of you know the bloods and crips on one side or the other we have real fractional a nation of gangs and we have
crews have two three four people who are part of a larger said who are literally fighting for a corner and not a full territory and so trying to figure out who's doing what you're looking at social media looking at facebook looking at snap chat an instagram to figure out who's beefing with who it's really complicated and
again over proliferation of guns also makes it difficult and so how you attack how do you you're
no head the to go after there was no structured is not it's not like the sopranos you go after tony they give up everybody knows there's the smaller factions that make it a lot more you have to be more nimble you have to be more innovative you have to have more ground level intelligence in a way that i think and other jersey
addictions there is a more organized network i'm here in chicago the only thing worse and organized crime and stuff going on has grown guess i'll have to give people a reason not to participate and see my other avenues for raid and of like fighting for our suspect all the time
what a lot of it comes down to listen a lot of it is respect a lot of it is money a lot of it is survival a lot of it is a amount of these neighborhoods that are impacted their quality of life is so dramatically different than any of us could ever imagine
no we we talk about why do people carry guns and i think for a lot of people the notion is where you must be a bad guy if you are and license gun carrier for them it's survival and what happens when we have a mindset where it is better to be judged by twelve
been carried by six and that is a very real thing and i think it's hard for broader communities to understand i think there's a there's a judgment that comes but the reality is we had a horrible murder
i have a nine year old a few years ago here in chicago who was lured off of a swing into an alley and shot and killed allegedly for the sins of his father and one of the things i say when we talk about that case people are it's gut wrenching
and i say that nine euro i had a nine year old at the time
who's now live then we lived many miles away and cheese happened to catch it on the news and she couldn't sleep that night and why and she's like there was a boy who was killed and i said that's not us it's not shoes traumatized
the classmates to shanley who will sit with that empty chair
everyday and sat with a chair everyday for the rest of that fourth grade school year
our thinking i've lost a classmate i've lost a friend in the most horrific affections is someone going to do that to me
and then there's someone who says halo mean i got something for you which is a gun
when we can get more guns than mental health and trauma treatment
we got a problem and that's what's happening

laptop that are though it's favorite example of what he all
the department of justice has really changed what it was doing and how though it under the obama administration there was an investigation of civil rights violations by the police department big report the city may or may not be implementing some of those changes but the federal government is no longer that kind of presents and what champ
attorney general fashion of talk about it's tougher police thing at the answer in chicago and across the country is that rhetoric helpful or not for you
i don't know anyone in chicago who takes this seriously
i say that with all due respect i mean i think if you
all due respect
do do is the key part of that thread
yeah we lived through would happen on what the climate donald we we know and that was kind of that was one big public nationwide issue but we had issues of wrongful convictions in this county for a long time we had the cases of john birch
he was a police commander who ran basically what's called a terror squad
where when we abolish the death penalty in illinois a few years ago it was because there were years of these horrific abuse is so much so that we have a curriculum in chicago public schools teaching about that torture
the people in chicago recognize that there is an issue with wanting to make sure that we have a police department that is the most of professionalism and integrity and doesn't abuse its citizens i think that is been a recognized give any here and so the notion that and as you say for most
most people here
the notion that what we've seen and heard for the course of the last two years is make believe no one buys that i think we have a real opportunity here
the attorney general lisa madigan went to court
to fight to enforce federally by a federal judge for oversight of the consent decree or work out a consent decree which i think is amazing we are gonna do a plug for shit cairo where chicagoans we really don't wait for people to come save us
we were waiting for jeff sessions to come save us
it's abundantly clear he whoa this is a real opportunity for the city again in that level of accountability to say the city of chicago you can afford not to do this and we're not going to half ass our way through it we're not going to just do small change
his we have to fundamentally change how we do this and it's in the interest of public safety that this isn't about villa nice aim law enforcement i am a law enforcement official it's about elevating the work because our communities that are being the most harmed need us to be at our absolute best and the pub
should stand for no less
what's the proliferation of guns what's the what's the plan their how does that get that that is the vexing question because a wee gets sixty percent of the guns that are flooding the streets of chicago come from indiana
mike pence
but still people who don't know there's intimately as our audience does what does that mean exactly that they come from india so we didn't have gone we don't have done dealers in the city of chicago there was laws on the books they're prohibited gardens been sold in the city of chicago
and we have very few and our surrounding suburbs and so the guns they weren't just popping out of the sky it was literally an iron pipeline from indiana and you don't have police officer standing on the border sand let me check your your trunk so there has to be greater coordination i will say
that the
add an additional twenty eight you have agents here in the city of chicago
police superintendent and i have been working on trying to come up with a gun strategy to deal with trafficking we're going to have a new us attorney in short order who have heard nothing but good things about who is committed to climb trafficking and i think it has to be a local and federal response that it's not enough
we've been doing has not been enough to do they just did the federal peace does the do they get this i mean in terms of you f
and the us attorney
i think they said they would send in the feds
in two thousand and eighty f agents
so i do think that they get the guide and pieces huge i think the us attorney's office
now this year my i'm saying have done more gun cases than they have i'm in the last several years i think we you can't not get it at this point you can not not get it but also getting at it the universe of getting it has been out rape and the real question is does congress get it would congress have her path
kinds of laws that will close the loopholes and allow i mean if you're having people go across one by one and bring back gardens that's different from like seventy people i mean one person bringing all bunch of gone are the purchasing them through unlicensed gun dealers is that the way the purple and works
one more question before you head off to and gums or whatever
this is a totally different
subject which is your elected prosecutor elected prosecutor seem like an atrocious only slightly worse than what the judges but i've never had the chance to share a stage
what's the case for you know what did rather than appointed by you want me to defend and buy it because i know
listen i it is an awkward position to be you know when i was a line assistant
again there was no you're out there you're doing justice you are advocating on behalf of communities and victims and the like
having to go and declare party and raise money and shake hands i mean when people are running for mayor congress so i wanna road i want to offer is justice grade
a lot it is thought that guy
hey you find that sometimes people who like are willing to engage early not just as that one something else
is that something else the three calls to cargo just
with a gamble tv show
oh by the way they had carl weathers play in the state's attorney and
and it didn't last
and
i agree with you i think the notion of having politics in in the justice system isn't is an odd thing but i will also say however having the people be able to give a voice about what their justice
system looks like if the traditional role has been quite frankly people who have not had contact with the community who believe in law and order and punishment if you have people like a jeff sessions who is appointed not elected he is appointed
are you getting a better system of justice i think the politics is awkward and eighteen and how you have to go about doing it but i also don't think you necessarily get a better result i think you don't get someone like me from the public housing of chicago
who lived the wired it and watch the box said
say and having proximity to the issues in where it's not academic if i don't have a chance to run for the people of cook county believed in a better version of our justice system and that's what they chose

what small left inspiring fact it is i think forty six or forty seven states liked prosecutors the appointed prosecutors are in alaska in connecticut and new jersey and maybe one other state that i'm forgetting say around and state it's our nor and there is a way
way in which that accountability banking or pointing to you can be a good as well as troubling petra it can fox thank you so much

so the first a trickle now flood
this week has seen torrent of news about really ill behaving man
but that's true most weeks really put this particular week it turned out that bill or riley paid thirty two million dollars
hey to thirty two million dollar settlement in yet another sexual harassment case after which fox still offered him a new contract
this but this revolution appears to have scuttled riley's plans to go to work for sinclair broadcasting director genes tobacco was accused of sexual assault and harassment by more than two hundred women
amazon tv executive price lost his job and mid allegations of of this kind of misbehavior john bearish a new orleans restaurant her lost his job with the head of his own restaurant empire for it the weasel to you're a literary editor and long time public intellectual was dumped by the brookings institute and also by steve
his widow marine mourn powell jobs had been bankrolling his new magazine
the group of former colleagues if weasel tears complained of his sexual advances and lecherous and harassing behavior and more and more and more so if at all over it's all over for the men is it just can we finally put a pan and these battles fell shiny
then more people out there who are quaking more than they were last month and they'd get i do think the fire say what the heck hasn't changed
so it does seem like since the bill cosby revelations and maybe there's a way in which you could date it earlier than i'm not thinking of that when a group of women come forward in solidarity there's a way in which the numbers themselves are giving way to accusations even if we don't
have a ruling in a court of law that in either the form of a criminal conviction or a civil suit backs them up and that wasn't true before it wasn't true when a group of women accused bill clinton of various forms of harassment and abuse so that does seem to me like a real cultural shift on the other hand a group of women accuse donald trump
of these exact well some of the same forms of misconduct and he was elected president so i'm not sure how we can say that now impunity has been forever rectified she say
the things that you did on the way to becoming president was bring some of the accusers to the second debate yeah the summer bill clinton's accusers to the second attack has worked for i have my thing
well the extent that he got to literally
but that also it me the idea of hillary clinton taking on this issue are the more difficult and this was after the actions center though
billy bush to tip to yeah isn't but doesn't until after her everyone's do that's the thing that because cosby was as you rightly say is the sheer tonnage you just and sheer numbers but that was kind of director good him what's striking here is that all of this behavior
it was at one level or another hidden suddenly once i mean just like there was a huge shifts
when that didn't happen after cosmic ray i do wonder though about putting giving too much power in terms of example to a situation in which a lot of some some to a lot of the women who came forward a very famous actress and with oh you have that that sort of additional
no interest in their word right because turn mean that you mean that the regular mode old person who's got a boss who's doing this has no more power than before her everyone's to that's right and that i'm just not sure we can universe
although but just don't know all of the examples that i cited and most of the examples where to think of in public our media business has mean john bashes at a restaurant germany's a fundamentally er media figures and i don't know that we're seeing in the mid sized insurance company market is not
sure that is happening in the hospital sector or men being called to account for their grotesque behaviors and only in professions where people are celebrities were there is a megaphone that can be used against them were this is going to happen or do you think this can apply to i mean because i am sure that if their sexual harassment going on
and how everyone seems office and and john better his office there is also it's also going on at hospitals and insurance company
no no no just a few worked for if you were just like an anonymous person and he worked for our relatively anonymous employer company and that's what's happening to you and you weren't sure if it was happening to anyone else would you be any more likely to come forward and also a simulated so i'm thinking about this a lot in terms of leon result here so he is the figure
we're in our field and you know we know of han we know women who have experienced lake crappy treatment from in the one time i met him i thought he was total lack dress shark probably doesn't even remember that i wasn't working fran but it's like a memory i definitely have
discussion of why don't people come forward earlier and when everyone knows this about someone why does it continue in that moment there's so much shame and you blame yourself and you feel weird about it i can't even remember whether i went home and told my husband like the weird yucky thing that i experienced a dinner with the enemies
voltaire cause i was like twenty eight and it made me feel worried that i had done something to bring it on the environment it happened in made me feel like you know that there was something probably wrong with me or just that he had power and i didn't so that's a crucial point is maybe my original view which is
wow something's really changed
yeah jumps over the fact that if you're still at anonymous company and you're still or it
it's only obvious in retrospect right it's like once the momentum starts and gwinnett culture was on the front page of the new york times making these sober accusations we see that as heroic an honorable man we start pointing fingers at everyone all the man around all the other women around some of whom were part of this are enabled that and it seems so obvious
who is good and who was bad and who's up and who's down but her a break like it's not the least bit clear that it's going to play out that way
have these of these households now made it unsafe for consensual work close relationships
is it a removing to a place where were you can't you can no longer sleep with your boss basically
i mean that's something that's happened on college campuses much more of a sort of old model of like okay well maybe i'm not gonna ask that woman out on a day while she's in my class but as soon as it's over i will and mean i have friends who are married from situations like that in how your
the bomb as a few resort of his supervisor right way i guess that's true technically yeah right so it's not as if it's always terrible problem that that power imbalance then translates into a different kind of one hopes equal relationship but i think our concerns about relationships that begin from the power imbalance is
continues belief in it does seem like when you look at the one scenes with bush's and a word processor weasel to their really pathological there's just you know it's not just one person who they've had a bad consensual relationship with it's like doesn't scores that guy two hundred you know one hundred there's a story written about this this director james tobin
some fifty sources in it and then in over the next day the reporter was contacted by one hundred and ninety three other women who had been abused by this guy and so should we make policy to deal with these highly predatory people who are abusive to everybody and thus should have constrain
what may be more innocent but still slightly a key relationships
where do you draw the line and his own i mean yeah i don't know i mean i don't know is it
there's so many people boss mary secretary
barack obama marries his supervisor whatever it is and you think that's a good story that's a happy story there's nothing wrong with it and but if we are fundamentally going to constrain sexual relationships at the workplace those things will go away and maybe they should maybe they need to go away to prevent the
the wind students from running rampant think you could argue that right now we have legally speaking the worst of both worlds so we have a lot of talk about sexual harassment the workplace and most of us have been through some irritating training about sexual harassment and that makes them seem like a box that you check off and it was ever failed that train
they make and model detailed though
i mean all other things like it's theft a should you steal the computer and take it own be no
and yet it still excruciating right so we have these training is why do we have these trains because the supreme court basically said that a way that companies can insulate themselves from liability it's by taking steps to prevent to say that they are on it and this kind of training checks the box and then if you get a complaint you have to have a
process for that complaint you have to investigate it but you can take do that investigation and a cursory manner put the results in a file draw and never look at them again and again you check the box and these allegations are hard to prove they often come down to situations of the classic he said she said where you know sometimes there's corroborating
evidence and sometimes or isn't and so we have a lot of talk about this in the sense that it's unacceptable and a lot of bad jokes about it and not a lot of actual successful lawsuits and successful monterey you know between bad jokes about it i can imagine somewhere now and workplace somebody in the course of just a p
or otherwise ambiguous interaction with people have somebody saying oh don't you know don't call me leon weasel day or something and using that to create a different power dynamic
in the moment we're in right because then you're essentially like mocking the person who has made me feel right and then the i think we should talk about are these non disclosure agreements and the role they play because this is a way of buying silence and then people who had these experiences don't tell what happened in a way that warren's other people now maybe
we think it's ok for companies to contract for people silence but there is this social costs so here's a question about the non disclosure agreements presumably a company that has a non disclosure agreement has this public media reputation that they're trying to basically protect because that's why they're the goes are so you don't quit and then make fun of your boss or the company and so
in that position isn't even asking for a non disclosure agreement that has this kind of sexual harassment okay by as clause isn't that asking for that now in this new environment
like a no no you can't you can't ask for that because because you had you are this kind of company were talking about you're not the anonymous company i don't think it can be i don't think it will work as a taboo if it's just a social norm and taboo only work if it's a legal problem right so there are these questions about the harvey want about miramax like if they find a new
contract with harvey weinstein knowing that he had all these settlements with women and they basically agreed not to look into that to treat as a private manner same thing fox and riley how can you say that your complying with these laws where you're supposed to be protecting your employees from sexual harassment
just to go back to
kim fox
as much
i cannot just say if i worked as an anonymous person an anonymous company it would be these kind of the chairs would be sitting
don't you feel like they're like from cannot going on
no exactly your performance reviews going very well and monster and minimum
you guys didn't answer my question should you be allowed to sleep with your boss
i mean i think my wife would be unhappy
yeah i don't i don't believe in telling consenting adults that they cannot facts that seems like a bridge too far can i say something else
this this moment of
scoundrel man has made me so much appreciate the man in my life wife worked for and work to whack who have like never made me feel like any of this was a problem we haven't been that and i don't mean to make the so purely
gender and but since usually we're talking about predatory man and blaming ma'am there are a lot of like in heaven
a decent honorable men out there who promote women's careers and make us feel like you care about our whole person
so we've had a series of stories about basically sexual harassment sexual assault point of women by men misbehavior to from we have not seen
i don't think kind of similar parallel examples of grotesque racist behavior or anti religious prejudice generally anti religious behavior
is that because those cases don't exist or is it because those cases art do happen but people don't perceive them has been outrageous or is it because people are afraid to report it would you think there is there's the harvey weinstein equivalent who is just
treating his latino employees in this incredibly terrible way racist way and then but it's not been reported or or or not
i think there are employers out there who do those things it way and then i guess are they doing it in a way that is somehow more hidden and so then harder for people to address lately speaking or is it possible that the sheer volume of sexual harassment is baker i'm not sure
i don't know
i mean yes of course it's happening i'm just trying to think through the
it doesn't i think it's chosen looking for the example the alien when i know what is mel gibson which was not a not what you're describing but it is
a way which public sanction for that kind of behavior when it burst into the open was severe and now maybe somebody would argue maybe not because he's still going to the academy awards and all the rest of it and and so is there i guess is your question
could this is easily happen to accompany the way it happened to harvey weinstein were some where there's initiating event and somebody says oh yeah it's been that way for years and just as a cute and egregious yeah
doesn't seem like those either people aren't interested in that are the the just don't become public or maybe people this is not a form of terrible behavior that people engage in all the time i don't know that doesn't mean the dentist it's just a super clear that racial discrimination in the workplace or and hiring and promotion takes place where i may or may not be like as
right right had pets oh no it's more women who aren't happening on in me in this kind of yeah a cute acute were yeah i have been a homeland continental yeah

so let's go to a cocktail chatter when you're when you're down in your peroni john dickerson what are you going to be chattering about
i'm first
you
okay me like it so i have recently been spending some time thinking about calvin coolidge is all of you have
because it feels like to me that the the modern presidency is bound on the one in by president trump and on the other by counting college and here's why i think that so calvin coolidge sometimes would sleep fourteen out of twenty four hours a day
and he also indulged and frequent the president is up early and we know from his twitter account that he's up early coolidge said that as a national leader president should not called go ahead of the majestic army of human thought and aspiration blazing new and strange pants
the president has definitely blaze new pants
cool it said perhaps one of the most important accomplishments of my administration has been minding my own business
no presidential candidates said coolidge was ever injured by not talking too much so this is so a great president and then we could look back a myth
also this tragedy in the middle of colleges presidency where his son dies and so a lot of people think that this is what that he anyway but as i was looking into colleges life i found this somewhat amusing thing first of all they were obsessed with his health because of course harding a died we think of the presidency being covered a lot now but bank man there's a
story in the new york times coolidge takes it recovers quickly combination of heat and cantaloupe causes a breed
causes a brief attack of indigestion now is the sub presents up so there's an entire story in the new york times on may twenty third president had suffered a slight attack of indigestion today in his office
so as i was
as i was learning about the president's cantaloupe indigestion manners i found that one of the ways that the president and work towards good health was was was this and this again from the new york times prison coolidge owns a hobby horse this hobby horse is a very remarkable creature it bears little resemblance to the hobby horse have no issues or mary
grounds mr cool just played thing is an electric device designed for exercise at the fireside or for one who is not disposed to go outdoors is horses installed in the president's dressing room
so equipped that the person in saddle can take light moderate or heavy exercise the president's mount is said to meet the demands of exercise of a man who was pressured for time
so it turns out that the president of finland elliptical machine three times a day and hey zeus can we put a put a picture up on the screen
three times a day the president was up on this thing why he did not ride actual horses according to the new york times because he suffers with a nasal infection which is this is my favorite third tier my about marketing
better this is i'm just reading from the new york times what can i say
the failing failing near times
feeding and he suffers with with the nasal infection which his friends declare becomes aggravated by a fluke here
that arise from the equine hide
now you might think that this does not provide the kind of exercise that you would need to face the challenges of the job even if you are as coolidge one said that nine out of ten problems brought to his office could be safely ignored
this this device behind me offers the following vibrating handles and quivering straps on the automatic shimmy makes the body of the user shake and a highly effective modern jazz style
it seemed extraordinary anyway
so and then now i'm moving towards my conclusion
and i'm glad that that line did not illicit of blows
the reason we all came to know this was not because it was talked about or snickered about in the white house canteen but because the president apparently got on his mount and suffered an injury it seems that recently mr coolidge was putting the horse threw some of his pieces and that in the midst of the excitement
he got mixed in his buttons
this is not this is not a euphemism
according to the new york times the result was that the animal became involved in gate and the rider was forced in haste to jump from the saddle
can you imagine during the cold war if the russians new this thing be like
forget cuba we're just going right in we're just going to move the missiles and to baltimore anyway the white house veterinarian was not consulted wrote the new york times
instead and you feel like the writer had like a martini next to the writers he was having so much
instead
the president sent for an electrician
where is that
we're fed object
that's the calvin coolidge and historical museum
not part of your have
no no no when they have right that's like an early pellet time
emily what is your chat or fell and i have been paying attention maybe some of you have been as wow up late have a seventeen year old girl whose name we don't know i'm she was bad can't came to this country cross the border from a country in central america where abortion is legal and when she was
nine weeks pregnant in custody asked to have an abortion and her case has been litigated for more than a month
the champ administration's efforts to block her abortion included going to current and arguing that even though she was a miner who was saying that she was endangering her home country that the choice to not have an abortion was once she'd brought on herself that she voluntarily removed herself from the country and other words when back on to a place that abortion
recall that she could have the proceed to herself that making on abortion accessible to her and got custody of the federal government was was not acceptable to the politics of the trump administration sell lots of litigation judges on both sides and wednesday the just made their decision
you won this lawsuit and this girl of evil to have
so he through her lawyer issued a statement she said i've been waiting for more than a month since i made my decision it's been very difficult to wait in the shelter for news that the judges in washington d c have given me permission to proceed and then she said that she was touched by the show of love from people from all over the country who wrote to her
her and then she said this is my life my decision i want a better future i want justice seems like it's always when it comes down to in the and are women are girls going to get to make the decision themselves about what their future is going to look like and with all of the you know moral dilemmas and disagreements that abortion
gives rise to and i know those are deep seated there's always is this question about what it what it looks like to actually for someone to have a baby when they don't want to do that and how how you can ever square of auschwitz letting women choose their own future
so i want to tell a story about why it is there no living people on us currency
based on some a story to one of my colleagues michael waters wrote for most obscure you're worried about there being a donald trump
troll dollar bill
we're no longer a eighteen sixty six law that prevents any living person from being on us currency why that's perfect
prevent for every job drove the congress will never pass can't pass the healthcare reform that are going to pass
currency reform either they're not going to rid of the penalty for example this story begins with a man named spencer clark and spencer clark was brand
the superintendent of the national currency bureau from eighteen sixty two eighteen sixty eight and while he was the superintendent he became a very controversial figure for sort of harvey weinstein reasons he he the treasury under his watch became court a house for orgies and buck and olds he was accused of hiring
women based on their looks rather than their ability
he one woman told congress had offered her first one hundred dollars than ten times that amount for a tryst with her
which is a lot of money
i guess he was ahead of the current just take one of those take one of those bills as monetary on many more money but so but this that's not why that's why we ended up here so in eighteen sixty six one of the with the wars of a war
having wreak havoc with all sorts of things and the economy they were shortage of metals and so there were there isn't enough medal for coinage and so the us decided to print fractional currency they were printing bills and small amounts and including the five cent bill and god i'm so glad we don't have that anymore
which is really dumb because there was a nickel
so
there was also having that there was a three cent bill also god
and so congress passed congress because well they passed a law said william clark
should be on the five cent bill william clark with get a picture of william clark up there wearing parkas of course the great explorer of lewis and clark
he was going to get his place on piddling asked denomination but still that he was going to be on the five cent bill now let's get a picture of spencer clark up there you'll notice that spencer clark and william clark have the same last name
they're not related they're not the same person however but the instructions came over from congress and just said that someone named clark had to be on the bill and so what happened is that spencer clark for going over next photo
had himself printed on the five cent know you just that better beard he does have a he's very he looks like he belongs on us currency
but this to no it was in circulation and congress went crazy and in eighteen sixty six shortly after this bill was printed they pass a law saying no living person could be on us currency but what was there is actually a coda which is that they neglected in passing that bill to actually get rid of the five
sent build clark so they had to go back and has a second bill which which stop them from printing the five cent note with censor clark on it but so you have to admire a man who had the moxie to get the us government to put put out bills with his own face on them

first topic today we know that there are a ton of women running for office four hundred seventy six women failed to run just for house seats in the twenty eight thousand election that was sixty percent more than the previous high in two thousand and twelve and two hundred thirty five of those women when their primaries which
was up from one hundred and sixty seven in two thousand and sixteen which was performer record
but in addition to that quantifiable jump in the number of women on the ballot there's also been a qualitative difference in how female candidates have marketed themselves so multiple women have shown themselves breastfeeding and their campaign abs they're showing their tattoos they're wearing jeans and t shirts and getting ultra sounds
and it seems like for a lot of candidates this year has sort of march and opportunity to stop pretending that they're just like any male candidate that the experience of living as a woman is sort of incidental to their qualifications for political office and they're making it more of a part of their affirmative argument for themselves
celeste you've been following a lot of these races which candidates have stood out to you as far as self presentation is concerned there have been a lot of women that have done some innovative things like think really the idea that a lot of us have looked at is this idea of of authenticity
on the trail that as you say it's no longer have sort of a hindrance so to speak although obviously never should have been considered one but now it's not just okay to be a woman it's important to be a woman being a woman means maybe you've had experiences than men haven't had a war that you consider problems and away
that men don't consider them being a mom isn't something traditionally that voters have lacked questions about there's research that shows that female candidates are questioned by voters as to whether they can quote handle the rigors of public life while taking care of their families
now you see a lot of women out there as you say breastfeeding but also talking about being a mom and being a family person as as a qualification as an experience and that that is something that's been really prominent in this race i've not every candidate who does this wins we had one can in new york zephyr teacher
who's running for state attorney general
who was pregnant during the campaign in the primaries she had an ad where she was undergoing a sonogram you could literally hear the baby's heartbeat
while she's talking about how awesome should be at this office was something i don't believe i had seen in any of the eighty five thousand campaigns are covered before this
can i can i just way you can i just you use the word authentic it's so interesting that stuck out to me because i to me it felt it feels perform at it like when you and i love it i'm not saying perform and of in a bad way but it but to me what's like intoxicating when you sit down and watch these videos is that they're like performing motherhood on the ads it's like
so in your face it's not the way like the mail campaign ads just have they're like family around i have a family they're like in your face with my breast feeding and my ultrasound it's like very pro formative i wouldn't say femininity just like female nurse and away which feels very bad ass to me yeah
i hesitate to use the word gimmicky but that was the first word that sort of popped in my mind when i watched the the two candidates who are breastfeeding in their abs are both of them lost their primaries but one was running for maryland governor the other was running for governor of wisconsin and the fact that both of them are breastfeeding in there
it seemed slightly awkward like they were trying to make it seem like oh this wasn't planned and i just had to breastfeed at this exact moment a may commercial had to be films like we couldn't have time around a baby's hand schedule
and it was clear to me that they have probably thought a lot about this because if you're not that they were actually showing their breasts but if you're sharing this intimate moment with your baby on camera like clearly you've planned it
with zephyr teach out in when i don't think i've even seen a political candidates belly button before like much less watching them get a medical procedure in a doctor's office and so i agree with you on i was kind of shocking to me and yeah i don't think i got the authenticity vibe that i did get the i am trying to be authentic
yeah i got the state the state run part of it is really clear and if there's an on time for folks who make a statement i guess pokes are like this is it this is my time to show my boob on camera
but you know i did have this moment when you know
certainly the fact that there has to be such a dramatic
display is i think in some ways a little bit of a backlash against like i need to show up as gender neutral as possible which historically a lot of women have done down to how they dress and how they don't talk about their family or a family responsibilities because of the fear that it might seem that
just like when you walk into a job a job
you don't start you don't start off by saying so i have five kids and i'm expecting another one and is this conversation about whether that's even okay for people to ask so there is very much still this very strong and any i think most workplaces
yeah i would say most workplaces where this idea of motherhood
we call the motherhood penalty were whether it's getting a job keeping wages running for office
this is this is really the the the the contrast to that is so stark and i think it's important that it's so stark because the penalty has paid so much everyday okay validity for did it freak you out like actually watching them because like i was really scared like the penalty is real like the cultural visceral step
rio types are real like i actually was like i i my mind was racing when i watched his ads because i felt like i was like do it don't do it do it don't do it
i just couldn't like did you watch them as somebody who has actually been through this did you watch them and think like yeah at an early and also so many who you know just lake throwing my hat in the ring for local politics and thinking in that like i was like i would there was there is absolutely something that i would never do nor would i advise someone to do
what's that one man or breast feed my evident
just keep it does some level like i'm also one of these people think very private and just seems like a very intimate private moment and
over sharing culture is one of those things where i just like you know even like i have i have family members relic don't take pictures of your bare belly when you're pregnant that's crazy
it is definitely like this this foundation that i have for my upbringing
marla steep
when it comes to you know bodies and even putting your kids out there that's the other piece of it that i was kind of shocked about to buy are absolutely i was laid new because now you're going to be like the breastfeeding canada and that's all i can never talk about breastfeeding candidate what remember talking about right now maybe
maybe that's the point though i mean the fact is we are talking about it if you think about all the candidates that were out there that were sort of
you might think of them in their in their eighty's power suits not trying to show that they're just one of the guys not breastfeeding way that would be i didn't see anybody breastfeeding and then eighties power not only not resonating but not having breasts like our roadways cover now yeah
it's just
the fact is it is getting attention and a lot of people got a lot of attention through these ads that they might not have gotten and of course that's just one part of the story but i think people sort of also at least observations if this was a year to do it this was going to be the year the susquehanna why the time to turn the tables well because
because women have been so much at the forefront of politics
in terms of in terms of the me to move in in terms of just a backlash to donald trump to sort of translating the passion and the intensity of the women's march into action
walking with a sign for a lot of people wasn't enough to to to express or to to take action on how they felt about a lot of stuff the trump administration was doing and that was way before brett catalog got involved in the picture so i think very much being forward and out there about being a woman guess sometimes
look i mean by the third add
doug just being like breastfeeding or being basically like hey ladies
that kind of thing maybe it starts to look a little road but there were people willing to take that chance especially in these crowded primaries were you gonna stand out from the crowd or know you're just you're wasting your time and also slashed euro in a piece about women candidates that if women don't confront questions
about having kids and balancing their life at home with their life in public they will take a hit with voters and so i wonder if some of these women by coming out and saying like look i am a woman i'm a mom years of my life looks like i'm not going to pretend that i'm not at home like surrounded by primary
children's toys all the times and like a burp cloths on my shoulder that they're trying to get out ahead of some criticisms that they might face stereotypes that might be projected onto them yeah i think that there is a reality there for women candidates of those questions with voters are different than from
men men featuring you know they're loving wife and family in their commercials all the time and it's never like cod how's he going to make it work being a dad being a public
us large you know so you don't you don't get that dynamic but with women some people are like but what about the children
it's really not fair so you do have do you do have to talk about that
there was a big case even
in this cycle with a woman who running for congress out on long island in new york who convinced the f si to let her use some of the money that she raised in donations for childcare
that was kind of a big deal so does the fact that took this long but it's twenty eighteen people had kids before this midterm cycle and the fact that this is just coming up now's is to me kind of amazing
thing i wouldn't say is that i think that
to the folks that are saying at least on the side there has to be a change in the playbook because we're losing our message were not reaching people or maybe both parties are having that problems said the other point i think is important is that in addition to standing out it's like how do i really to voters and how do i get people out and then term how do i really in a way that
is outside the party norms and this is one way that people have reached out outside the norms and cases where women are running without endorsement of the national party or without the coffers and financial backing
and there is the sense that you know we have to change and not be the everyone no one wants to be the establishment right now
because because that's the losing message for for every town america so i think that
you know i think that is another piece of it is like how can i
dissociate myself from the political establishment and the expected canada because you know whether which side you're on we're losing with with that with that paradigm so can we just spin out like best possible scenario of this wave of ads now we're just talking imagery here we're not talking about who's going to
when right yeah like best possible scenario of all these ads and like worst possible scenario like best possible scenario is we change the language around political presentation we make it more real we allow women to be themselves it's kind of authenticity like it leads to authenticity eventually because women can be
more honest about like the reality is they face and what their life is like like they can they can handle it
so there isn't this kind of and spoke in question around whether women are able to do power and children at the same time o m g
what's the worst possible scenario
i think it's exactly the stuff that you describe think it's people have people have a reaction to women have a bad reaction to it they get sort of
cheap i hate to use that word but it's sort of like let me let me explain my adorable baby to get you to vote for me because i really want to go to congress or i really want to be mayor or i really want something i want something from you and i am using my personal story to to target your heart strings and to get it which is
kind of the lot of what people do all along other than the other options are you the reader resume or talk about
how bad the other guy is chump you what a champion now you should ever have a forum where i mean like spin it out even further so like that's what happens in this and so therefore what happens for women in politics so like let's say people think it's cheap trick or they just not buying it for some reason and then what would respect a score of zero or women or people
i think i say read some of the youtube comments on our one of these campaign videos with breastfeeding candidate it was maryland gubernatorial candidate crush the garage
and i should never read the comments i know that and i usually never read the comments but i'm like i don't know what the people are saying about this video and the two people were saying things like just because you show your tedious on t v doesn't mean you can be governor
in meanwhile you know her breast was not exposed i think it's very important that we make that clear but they called her and entitled them though they said you know hillary tried to do the whole woman thing and and failed because i thought was hilarious
as if you know just by being a woman running your like doing the woman to woman thing
someone else transcribe the ad and replace the word woman with the j j
so i think and not at do that
gotta ride in iran
there
i think we are
probably none of these new to come enters will vote probably a lot of them don't even live in the us i was guessing based on the way they were spelling some of their words but i do think that if if i took that as like the pulse of the public i think the of the worst possible scenario of the public i would say that people will look at video
like this that sort of forefront the things that people usually say make women look weak and
project those things on to all women candidates to say that you know women are just like breast feeders they're just people who get sonograms all the time only mom's you know and even a woman who doesn't have kids is like i'm thinking of her through the lens of this other candidate who i think showed her quote unquote teddy's on tv yeah
and i think that the the broader question about whether we can use identity or at least some identity as an asset in politics is still a lot of people's minds especially following the two thousand and sixteen presidential election where it was like we can we can't we can we should but at the end of the day
it's the identity or the gender of the being the woman itself that is so hard for people to get around as opposed to i'm in canada and i'm really qualified and that's why you should believe me even if you don't think women should be or which is kind of sucks and cynical but for those people who are already having a hard time with women in power
power this meeting you where you are in my pants suit or my collared shirts
i think alienates those people that you know maybe it's as much smaller slice of the american electorate but there's definitely this folks who kind of squirming around and have never seen locally even a woman and you know and any power and also that this goes the other direction and
pantsuits will make a comeback now i want to talk about two female candidates who had ads that sort of went viral and they were adds that tried to make them look extremely strong and i would say traditionally masculine these are two women who were in the armed forces
and jay hagar who's running for congress in texas
she had i want say one of the most viral videos viral campaign videos of all time especially fair candid who was you know
had no history and political office
and i think we can probably listen to a clip of it
but my story begins much earlier one of my first memories was on her door and it was my dad during my mom threw a glass
three years later mom got the courage to walk out the she opened a new one for my sister and me here in taxes
it was here that that my foot on the gas and follow my dream to be a pilot
and that meant pushing sometimes kicking through every that was it my way
c n knew you know she shows herself not only caring for her kids and playing with toys with them but also she talks about when she got shut down piloting a helicopter in afghanistan and there's this one line where she's like
you know i i strapped to myself to the skids and returned fire on the taliban
like oh my god i love that ads and then later then again i mean she is lay back and home
and the other candidate was a make graphs she's running for congress in kentucky she's also a pilot
in the marines but both of these women not only did they talk about their military service they talked about lobbying to get women into combat roles in the military and the men who shut them down and i thought showing that sort of like female power in the face of men who didn't want them to have power was extreme
powerful and possibly
a way forward for women who are wanting to show like that they are both women am strong i thought that there was a great parallel with that with those two messages with the current climate right now which is very much like i survived it's like the survivor as opposed to the sort of like i'm a woman so that's ok i think that the message especially in
the political and social discourse around
assault and other things that are coming to light his the survivor story and i felt like there are various survivor some tricks someone even talked about history of growing up and so the sense of like i'm a survivor
and bringing the story comes along with that skill like you know the story sounds just like i'm a person and i'm very i'm like you but like i'm using the story to sort of show a shrink that i can bring to the opposition very different
easily than what we just talked about on the on the breastfeeding
so i was very moved by these innocent like women in combat generally is is extremely exciting to me
yeah i gotta say listeners all of you should go out and watch the sad if you haven't seen it it's on youtube it's everywhere you can find it it is so genuinely moving i mean that's what you just said like it's a survivor thing but to me what was perfect about it was the tone like it didn't turn was extremely practical you know and i mean it was like i did this and i was flying the
plain and and this happen and then the kids came and then this happen and then i went knocked on doors couldn't do it did something else it's like it's like it's like you really have to read the survivor thing between the lines because there's so much action in it and the doors trip is really really good and so you just like you trust this person like you trust this person to feel things but have everything
under control like it as such a good political ad it's amazing the empty a hater ad was was very very effective for a lot of the reasons that everybody here is talking about they get it is exciting is exciting to talk about this woman being in the military and having this experience at arena earning a purple heart
but at the same time there is a narrative that runs through the idea that that her experience and the pitch for the scan it can be summed up
in this idea of doors of a passing through doors of going you're entering door knocking kicking in doors is is very effective and i really got people's attention and it wasn't so much necessarily about like hey i'm a woman but i'm a woman who did this who lived through that who will do this for you
it came off as it did come up as perhaps is forced and the doctor didn't come off apparently from what i'm hearing from over the years it didn't come off as a key which which i think kind of kind of important near now oh my gosh site blown up in a helicopter like it's definitely not achy and there's definitely this this i have less of an idea
of what the sort of anti feminists are this the folks who are like you know the gratuitous ads mean nothing
criticism than a lot of women are getting and sort of like you need a real platform if you're going to be in office this is not real even if you have one all they see as you know your brass so i think this is this is very different to and the solicitation of responses from the naysayers who say you know tell us about what you're going to do not about who you are which is ridiculous and
politics because it should be about who you are but if you're going to be yeah it's an opportunistic argument to say like you know i think that this person doesn't have a real platform which i mean this is the way ads work so i think it has a much better staying power
as a strategy yeah i mean and i was trying to think whether it's a replica ball strategy for other candidates who maybe haven't been shot down in a helicopter and returned fire on the taliban and you know was one of the people who got the pentagon to change their policy about allowing women in combat roles
but i think the way like you said the teeth or she
she takes her personal narrative and her identity and translate that into how she would actually lead and and our next segment will actually talk about how identity does or does not in for how people lead i think that's the thing that could possibly capture voters attention more than just that even if you haven't had all of
these experiences use of domestic violence and anybody can sort of take their own background and make a story like this is just an incredibly good set of communication skills but she and her advisers have i do wonder though if there's a way to tell the story like a lot of the research that shows that women tend to be
the more or overqualified and don't think of themselves as is ready for office of the women that we dad or lake you know way overqualified not necessarily for the job compared to men
and a lot of cases and i wonder in part of the thing there is how many things that one potentially has to overcome it less less paths laid out for women and i guess there's less of a legacy assumption and you have to make your case and i do think there's possibly a way to translate that into a message so it isn't like you you got shot down and
a plane but you could say like the path here was not easy which i think would distinguish for many women themselves from from the male candidates at some level you want people to think you have money and backers and you don't want people to know that you're not raising money but the same time there's a message in like you know i decided to do this and
go to make it to this point without x y and z and that could be a way to answer a question are there any other candidates or abs
yeah i'll have that sort out here well there's that haiti high camp armrests line one
very funny yeah so highly healthcare is a senator democratic senator in a very very tough race in north dakota and she put out an ad shows her sitting at a table arm wrestling with this guy twice her size were in a muscle shirt as she used to
talking to the camera as their as they're going at it there but she say that it's a baby
is how we should decide elections and her premise of course is that that will be a ridiculous way to decide elections but it's an attack at it is it is going after her opponent but the idea of a woman arm wrestling in a political commercial again
yeah they covered a lot of these not something i remember seeing to too often
in terms of advertising but the against the point that we've gotten to did this level says a lot of things about this campaign he talks about the different strategies the fact that you could be a little bit more blood she's not actually saying she can have a beat up physically beat up the other guy but
there's this sort of feet of male female component there and also with it's just it was his eye catching something you look at your like but the hell is going on here
and at the end she does beat him and she says something to her opponent like kevin i'm just getting warmed up it's a little bit of the threat
so yeah i think that the person watching that video is think like wow haiti hate can like so strong sober asshole
so manly well everything i wanted to quickly mention we've been talking about women
raise and using issues of the day related specifically to women in their ads
you know specifically around things like sexual assault and domestic violence and being survivors and i were as we would not necessarily have seen that in the past her past election cycles but the other thing we're seeing his men doing the same using this opportunity to appeal to the elusive the women
voters that everyone's been talking about are the ones to to appeal to right now because of the loss of of women voters and their tracks of all these following politicians and other folks who have been accused of misdeeds
the interesting part of a right now is accurate a part mentioning you know andrew promos mention of of sexual assault or in his ads and in some cases it's very clear that the men are just like sort of taking a box and and other cases you may not know how they feel one way or the other and others it's very clear
that it's totally opportunistic and totally not on that authentic taken all and
my question when i see those was that really working do people really believe now that you know this guy is really super excited about his ability to get into office and actually do something about sexual song we see that there's history that bears that some cases is a very is a lot of doubt yeah that that's the case
leave it there then listeners let us know what you think about the ads that forefront the woman nets and the mother heard of the candidates

our next topic today do women make a difference if all the women who won their congressional primaries end up winning their general elections which it's not going to happen a lot of them are running against republicans and very conservative districts would that leadership meaningfully differ from any other debt
crab majority congress
i have a tough time with his question sometimes because i know that there's a ton of studies that show that women do pursue different policy priorities and office
but a lot of that has to do with the fact that so few women in office are republicans and so to insist on that there's some sort of essential difference between like a progressive woman and and progressive man feels a little uncomfortable to me
hannah what do you think you know i think it's like you're right it's completely theoretical which is pathetic that it's complete theoretical like the best studies that i've or the best test case for me that i read about this is the women on norwegian board like when norway passed a law say
met a certain percentage of their corporate boards had to be female and then served track to that are some somebody track that and saw whether it made a difference in decision making and the one difference in decision making that they pointed out was not so much that like women were more empathetic or that they focused on a different set of issues but that they weren't as
reactive which actually made a difference so when there was a recession for example they didn't instantly fire people like they weren't super focused on the bottom line they had kind of a long view so that's a form of empathy like let's let's look at the long term and see things play out over time
so i don't really know how to translate that to politics like i'm i'm often torn between thinking well is the right future were hoping for a future in which women can be anything like is that what we want or do we want we just want women to be progressive and like
everyone should be stacey abrams i think everyone should have
she is amazing everyone should be i want to be stays abrams i'm just saying like in my mind i'm not sure what is ideal for the world to get there's no question that the idea that somebody has to scrap and get to the top of whatever political branch they get to i can't dissociate that i think there's there's a
story there there's a paving the way potentially for other women even if it's with a set of more conservative view points i know that's a little
controversial but i think that we're so divided on partisan lines these days that i can't even tell sometimes who's a feminist and who's not a feminist and i think because we associate so many progressive policies that benefit women with the parties we kind of a lot of a candidates off the hook or a lot of the elected officials on both sides after hooked as i mean there are a lot of progress
and i'm not one hundred percent sure women or men that they're feminists per se because they support tick the box or her choice and are wide i'm good
but that doesn't mean that they're not you know is not they're not things going on in their offices are they're not like perpetuating misogyny and some other way which as we know has come up with some democratic lawmakers who were
who sort of like faded into the black because of being accused of harassment on i saw so i don't know i i i personally think that
it's a it's about what happened in our everyday lives and like thinking of feminism and whether or not something is good for women on partisan lines is extremely difficult for me speaking of partisanship i think it's important to remember i mean i've seen a lot of
over research that would suggest that partisanship is more important than gender in the end whether you're a democrat or republican is going to be more important perhaps in the decision making process or and how you though them whether you're a man or woman
c
studies that show that women are perceived as more trustworthy
you also see indications that women may be more collaborative and more into team work outside of government but once you get into once you get into the matrix so to speak you know how much does that change i think a lot of people find it is it is different then then in the real world
real real world us capital may be different than you know real world like successful business
when i think about women who are republicans and whether i should be excited for them to succeed i mean this this wave of women we've seen running for office is absolutely limited to the democratic party
there are no more republican women running now than there were ten years ago and republican women have trouble now because they have to kind of walk this line that's very difficult to walk yeah this particular moment trump whatever it's really hard at this particular moment for a republican women to run rate and i almost think this is
doubly anti feminism he in some way but i think that it's almost worse when conservative woman six years then when
any normal like bad republican man succeeds because they're able to funnel their arguments against gender equality and against feminism through a woman's perspective so when they say something like oh yeah you know christine lousy ford is lying and women my about sexual assault than men can point to them and say like oh well look
look what women are saying and people can feel better about subscribing to that view or or parenting that perspective because a woman has said it
i think about people like sarah palin who really did forefront her mother heard in her campaign
for vice president and the way people use their mom status to justify racism and xenophobia like keeping their kids safe from m s thirteen and when you hear politicians talk about trans people in bathrooms it's always invoking this idea of like a little daughter being accosted by a man
man in the bathroom i feel like there are ways that people can use their womanhood and their mother heard
to harm people in ways that like any old man can't because they're easier to brush off as well that's a man talking
woof that's a really hard one because you're absolutely right you're like one hundred percent ray maybe it's just and faces like it's sort of one eventually like seventy years from now for it to be possible for women to occupy lots of difference a slight there is interest one way to be a woman
yeah all i don't super damaging like right now what you're saying a super damaging like at this particular moment
now i will say that i think being a woman does matter when we're talking about reproductive rights even even within progressives and the pro choice community
i was reading an article recently about australia in the state of queensland they the parliament just voted to legalize abortion which had been banned since eighty ninety nine and people have been crediting that shift with more women coming into political office and i remember when hillary clinton ran for president and she talked about
abortion during one of today's she had a little known trump it felt different to me and i would actually be curious to hear from man if any of our mail listeners want to raid and how men interpreted that because to me it felt completely different from even when extremely progressive men talk about abortion rates because for her it felt
real it felt like the stakes were personal and wasn't just like oh this is a political issue that i feel passionate about this is about like women's bodies in flesh and blood and something that i can intimately understand for me that showed like there's a difference between just voting the right way and being a leader on certain issues and i think from that perspective women's leadership
ship can matter a lot and we've seen that also in the way that i honor presley
ousted an extremely progressive congressmen in her primary she's almost certainly going to be the next congressman from her district in massachusetts she said in her campaign you know i probably won't vote much differently
from the sky that i'm running against but i will lead differently and pretty sure she's her district is like the only majority people of color district in massachusetts she's a black woman and his white and so she was like it makes a difference that i am representing this district and even though we might have similar views on things my leadership will be deferred
then again who are we kidding of course it's going to be different like to think of stacey abrams doesn't isn't is elected governor
it won't be different i will be amazing
and it will just be amazing to watch like these and particularly at this moment because the women who are running or energized to a particular way and if enough of them when will have models of leadership to work differently and will be driven by identity yeah and i think that i was just reading something about terrorism and how for for multiple reasons she is problematic for
a lot of people but she's one of these women in power who made a point of saying it's important for women to be in power and i'm committed to make to making sure moment and aren't power as a societal exercise different from one her policy agenda is which is as i said problematic croats of people
and i think that whether or not whenever a side you're on this idea that we're sort of even hemmed in to like this limited scope of of hot button political issues is part of the problem you know it's the fact that you know he's got the party who supports abortion rights and the party who does
don't and fundamentally
you could have and you do have but there are hard to get around with talk about it there's a lot we've always thought that there's a lot more republicans and quote unquote you know conservatives who are pro choice but they don't campaign on that issue they don't come out they don't vote pro choice because of the partisan divide and i think that is what's
clouding a lot of this as well as that you've gotta do certain things you just can't speak against which for a lot of feminists are just like if you're if you're sure enough for this there's no way you can support women and be a feminist
and to some extent it's almost like how you lead and you know and how you how you talk about women's you know it
advancement in society as much more important and can you do both can you talk about women's advancement and not be purchase that's the question
i just i was just the one thing about in regard to to sort of these contrast that we're seeing between the newer women candidates and the older men candidates are more traditional can the example of receded to live in michigan really interests me i mean there you have john conyers
who was
a veteran veteran lawmaker i think was there for over fifty years and left office after a bunch of sexual misconduct allegations and now you have a woman replacing him i don't know if that's going to be kind of a moment for pupils people are going to look at that that sort of changing of the guard she has no
republican opponent on the ballot in november so it looks like she's she's pretty well on her way to washington but the idea of of that person that exchange know that succession is i don't know kind of powerful to me it's it's kind of a moment i think in in american
politics as part of something bigger the that we're talking about now
listeners
excited to hear your thoughts
i'm whether whether one room think different once they get into office and how and also i yeah if you're a man and you saw hillary clinton talk about abortion tell me what he thought of that the waves that's the dot com is our email address this episode is brought to you by career builder

we're going to have like flying cars and also a woman president
future is so much brighter in hollywood
the jets
yeah like to it's like a stay at home mom who depended on the robot i know but i'm thinking like the the idea of a woman as for example president or vice president is like is the thing that has never happened in real life for us but all of those things have happened like you know we're going to have a robot he's going to cook all of our meals
before we're going to have a woman in the white house
that's not true but i do think that that watching women in office on tv and in movies is like a little bit of wish fulfillment also a little bit of like projecting our worst fears about what women in power will do
so they think it's not totally off topic as we talk about this landmark election
in terms of women's representation
god willing to talk about what these female politicians and the culture tell us about what we want and what we don't want
i'm going to turn it over to you first wow do you have for us
i have a couple so claire underwood from house of cards him who sends you know as a result perhaps of her making and the combination of her husband some minds but it's all very
cloak and dagger
i think that it was a very interesting time for that character to to rise as this very shrewd smart
and then sending by my husband who's the president announced the united states since would of you know sort of waiting for my time and then and very much having her own agenda and that's very very clear and as opposed to sort of waiting for her time to sort of like jump into the machine i think that the contrasts with this character is that lake
very much is an operative than her own rate and has a very very specific set of things that she wants to happen and do that
that despite how like grim and like scary that show in some way some ways it was just amazing to watch her i just loved that character so much for so many reasons and she was also very staid and very very elegant i have to say that i'm sure it was intentional but she was just very poised
despite all of that am being shrewd and that that that doesn't always come together usually like shrewd it's like raging reaching feminist but she was shrewd and respected and also very
just very well put together and very lake com the other i have to throw julie resurface into the mix for the oh yeah you her feet down for so many reasons and though while the description of her character has been like this is like narcissistic unqualified like cursing
you know woman who's who's who's of the vice president who wants to be president doesn't sound too far off from a lot of be said
this idea that this is such a far gone idea that you would have someone with such a personality is what on the one hand on the other hand i think this show does a really good job despite the fact that she comes across as a buffoon and a lot of ways
there's a lot of cutting moments where she talks about
how difficult it is for her as a woman she talks about you know she refers to
the reason she curses so much as because she had to survive in her early days she talks about that
one favorite favorite scene i have is when she said and finland and one of her nemesis is the prime minister of feminine she's there and like she's giving her gift and her husband the prime minister has been groups selena meyer and there's this conversation in the hotel after the incident happens and she's talking to her aides
one for women aged says well you have to say something you have to talk about this as she says i can't be the woman i'm going to just be no no one's going to make a statue out of me because i got groped by the prime minister was has been kind of a ways out to her aid why she can't come out about being groped by the prime minister's husband because she would be known that would be her like a
and she's like i can't talk about being assaulted and she's and she's lying on a bad smoking which only does on international trips and it was just perfect moment her male advisers are standing and she looks at her eight her women aid who was very confused and like you really have to come out she's not coming out and she's like that's because we live in a man's world as she takes a puff of smoke and she turns to her
and she says
the axis of dick and it was just like the most perfect moment of her basically being like yes this is crazy but the end of the day politics is a man's world and i can't talk about my sexual assault
this is like a few years ago but i thought that that the show does have these moments of really like laying out what it's like my celeste
do you have ironically the exact same to care curse
i literally do it i think it's it's incredible the contrast between the two of them between between the character and house of cards and the character in the is is what's so appealing to me
in in house of cards and the claire underwood character you do have this sort of i would go beyond poised frankly i go to to should have cold as sort of having exceptionally perfect the near least in public have always you know never never a hair out of place never a
a wrong word
everything so exceptionally exceptionally calculated now
a woman who's obviously risen to extreme power
and it's it's exciting and interesting to see how she exercises it but the idea of how she gets there is completely treacherous completely cold hearted her her marriage has become essentially a put on it's it's a fronts until it ceases to exist
so the idea of her being still being a sort of
engaging character from an emotional standpoint does have a real life she does have an emotional life it's just not necessarily with her husband
that to me is very interesting now
other hand you do have this sort of the silliness and the sort of the goofy character the jury julia louis dreyfus character but at the same time i think she's much more much more reliable than the claire underwood character because who
people could fantasize about being in this this plot twist the world of house of cards i think the veep character is more like like dang i spilled coffee on a shirt again
i have this really important thing to to go to have a really important meeting i've got to do a really good job and his presentation this is this has gotta go down perfectly and i i i trip they slip died whatever
i think that you have these two characters that both have power in their own ways
i'm still somewhat reliant on men still try to deal with man or
you succeed despite and then but both both approachable in to varying degrees but still fun to watch and a way to get people into politics that might not be which i am i prove that message i would love somebody to get into politics he was inspired by claire and
their word
to avatar way to the time
i also like the way they handled her abortion where it was like started out as something that she wanted to hide but then she kind of turned it into something that
like a like a plus for her something that she used to galvanize mum in and i am curious to see whether that will ever happen in future elections seasons weather like the breast feeding commercial or turn into the i had an abortion commercial on
hannah
i had enough and free on american television i hate all the representations of lady politicians on american television wow never strike me as real their total fantasy is there are either parodies or kind of fantasy is a sexy power or just kind of liberal bullshit fantasy is were like a woman gets elected president and like fixes the and
firemen and it's just it's all wrong to me and so all i got for you is bargain and beer gut nyberg which is that danish t v
there is a tv series called for again b o r g and danish political drama it is unbelievably great it was hugely popular in the u k for a while and i've watched every episode of that there are three seasons and she's like a minor politician who becomes the first female prime minister of denmark and and the other main character in
it is this reporter katrina farms mark she is like the tv one news anchor and they're such a natural grappling of the kinds of issues that women would realistically face like a woman would realistically face like there's the abortion and but it doesn't go down like the way it does in america where it's like m
obvious child she had an immersion it was no big deal like fuck you it's two thousand and eighteen you know it just you like watch bargain and you're like at his two thousand and eighteen like this is actually how it would happen these are the issue late she would deal with i feel like abortions and american tv is usually like a tragedy and and such a difficult decision it's either a try
tragedy in a difficult decision or it's not and then we have to write fifty thousand articles about like oh my god it's not a tragedy that so radical that they portrayed it as not a tragedy thank you
so anyway and bargain it's just like she has a husband her husband cheats on her they end up getting into force that site what happens when you get a divorce and your the prime minister it's not so by operatic it just goes down and this realistic way now i'm a realist so i prefer my dramas that way i totally love both like i watch veep like i love that is so funny like there
hundreds of feet by watched over and over again but it does nothing for me in terms of like the real real like what would this like getting my head around what it would actually be like only bargain does that for me so i know you're laughing at me that a really good show it's a really really good show and mostly i think we're org
in but i i wouldn't tell you i would go even further and talk about the woman who play beer good who whenever she's interviewed is the most funny like like just wise things about women in power and about her own language but i just cannot proud surname so i am not going i talk to you about her but if you just called poor
in and beer
her name is since the babbitt knudsen i don't know listeners just laugh at me and then displayed right and or send us a little like like voice memo about how to actually pronounce all these names but but anyway it's it's the best not always
best yeah
i am going to was so that that nobody already took this melli grand on scandal do you have any scandal fans and
wow wow nobody not even danielle i'd watch that shit that falls as hard in my box of whack fan
i like it i watch it it's totally intoxicating but yeah that thing for me i mean there's nothing realistic about this the portrayal of anything in scandal it's all like incredibly like soap opera and nothing would ever it's like the drama compounds
season by season so that by season five year like i now there's like eight hundred back stories you have to deal with and everything just gets more and more bizarre but melli grant is a pro choice republican she started out as i don't want to say a senator
is also actually starts out as the first lady becomes a seminary
and she does this sort of wendy davis style lake filibuster to defend women's health care at one point and that rockets her into the onto the national stage as an actual politician and not just the first lady
but then by the time she becomes present in her and her husband are divorced him so she's not only for the first woman president but she's single and i kind of think that the most radical thing that scandal portrayed boatman her husband was president and then when many grant is president the depiction of a single president and how they're dating
and how the secret service has to like bring their one night stands to and from their bedroom
but then there's this one plot point in the season were malley as president where the head of state of this fuck him
middle eastern country called bash ron
gaps they they have like a romantic entanglement and it kind of paternal tapes that with foreign policy because he gets ousted in a queue and she has to decide whether to go to war with this country to reinstate him and then he ends up getting killed by her aides because she got too close to him and they fell he goes clouding
our foreign policy decisions so that to me was like the ultimate look what will happen if we put a woman in the oval office late her emotions will get in the way and will end up going to war with the country just because they have a really handsome prime minister
i kind of loved it though i also like the idea that we could elect a single president that it doesn't have to be like some thing is wrong with somebody if they don't have a wife for or if they haven't had if they don't have a partner who's willing to stand beside them
hey man i just say amen to her listeners please tell us your favorite women in politics on t v say to hear from you

let's do our recommendations on out why don't you go first
i actually okay so i actually watched this couple weeks ago it was really the best thing i've seen by lake in years it's that movie minding the gap by being blue about skate skate that has friends who are skate boarders but it's about american masculinity
it's a documentary that he filmed over years and years he's like twenty eight or something and he's just been keeping a camera out with his friends it's an interrogation of his mother and male violence
and it is just stunningly beautiful and really like the best thing i've seen and forever it was on h b o for while i hope it still is but it's called minding the gap
and it's just it's fabulous that's fabulous sounds really going to less how about you i would definitely recommend that people check out the glamour women of the year some it that's coming up november ten november eleven there are a whole bunch of things to to see and do they going to be speakers they're going to be what you call experiences
this all leads up to our our big award ceremony where we honor women who are are important in a number of different walks of life it could be politics it could be entertained with it could be business so glamour women of the year some definitely check it out
and when that is november tenth and november eleventh grade after the election
latino of this leak
so this week and it's not a new show
know that they have made it more available if you don't have that blacks i think thinking didn't watch it on some local stations so this is happy valley
which i absolutely love british tv which are also absolutely love and the reason that i love the show i love british crime drama generally but
there's multiple things that it has going for it including the fact that the main character whose i think the it's a small town she's more like a small town chief of police but she's got a lot the weight of the rather her shoulder she's raising her grandson
because her her daughter was killed by her boyfriend who then goes to prison and then she has to like battle the boyfriend coming out and wanting wanting to access the child her sister lives with her who's a recovering alcoholic she herself a single and has has a lot of
young people looking up to her work and so it's like she you just want her to thrive and she's a bad ass and she's got all the stuff happening in her house and and she goes and sort of like fight crime in the streets and it has a small town feel it's not like urban gritty
there's a little bit of pretty nuts and it's a little dark in terms of some of the cases
but it's just go thing about the show which is a lot of british shows that i like in the genre is that it also features a middle aged woman as the main character which is also always very refreshing and you want to root for her she's got power and scale lot of power and it's very believable and it's just a great way to
just unplug and
if you need someone to root for he need to
his featuring middle aged women and lead roles of british thing i guess i mean maybe it's just the genre of lake crime dramas and mysteries that i liked by by far i can think of only a couple of us shows that i like or watchword of features middle age women are now you just me make middle aged women
real women they're not they're not they're about robin raid on how some there
just being able those sort of see the every woman and a professional and their job i feel like that so much more of a british saying that it is something that i see here which is one of the reasons that i'm drawn in addition to having like really strong female characters in law enforcement spaces that sounds really good i'm going to recommend a show that's been out for a while but i'm always
late two things
the marvelous misses me his own son amazon prime
everyone of in time me to watch it i was worried it would be really corny it is and i don't hate it
if you listen it's pod guess you probably know that i've been in the mood for some escape is in recent months and this show it's not pure escapism most definitely some serious storylines the it's about a woman in the late fifties
it's to her life is sort of thrown into turmoil and her husband leaves her and she's been to delete this perfect housewife
and then she decides to go into comedy which her husband did and and was just and very unsuccessful at that she has a real knack for it
it has kind of this like a starry eyed view of comedy and like you do it because in that it even know it ruins your life which i find a little bit dubious at this moment in history knowing what we know about how he felt comedians are treated but it is incredibly funny i actually have laughed out loud several times while watching it
which i don't usually do when i'm watching tv
and there's also a great one of the lead characters is this bush woman named suzy who is awesome and i'm so happy to see masculine and center woman get such great character treatment in the show actually my partner and i are dressing up as suzy and nudge the main characters karen we
at a party with during this weekend there's just so many gay characters in the show rachel browsing and it's fantastic in the lead role and i highly recommend it i have like blown through the first season and i'm waiting for the second one it's so it's gotten so many great reviews and then i see yeah i'm like that's not something i think
it seems very camp
it's really more than that and i think so my partner is the one who has like you need to watch the show and i'm like i'll watch the first episode you and then we'll say i think it had to do the font that that the title one's then if sarah looks like the bewitched font
it's honestly a lot better than it seems he's driving really funny i highly recommend it you can stream and on amazon prime
that show for it today thank you so much to our production assistant alex bearish and our police aren't any hewitt and thank ether thank you thanks santa totally my pleasure and thank you so much our clients less really appreciate it was fun

democrats had their first good night and a year on tuesday with democratic candidate whopping republicans in the few odd year election races that take place around the country
notably film murphy easily took back the new jersey governor seat by crushing chris christie's former lieutenant governor that was kind of gimme feel like you could have run a bag of rag and it would have beaten the republican that state and more notably virginia surged incredibly hard for them
regrets ralph northam crushed republican ed gillespie to become the next governor democrats may have flipped of many a seventeen of the hundred seats in the house of delegates and which would recapture majority and house of delegates they were they had only thirty four seats before the election they may have as many as fifty one hundred and fifty two by the time the recounts are done
and that also included the election of the first trans gender official to a state legislature danica rome
it was elected to the house of delegates and beginner there were also wins in unlikely places and georgia and mayoral races in new hampshire
washington state the state legislatures following draw the democrats essentially almost anywhere a democrat could win on tuesday night they did win so how big a deal was tuesday john it's an off year election
i think it was a really big deal because of all because the sweeping nature that victory that you talked about
so it's a big deal just period anytime you get that kind of a clear signal across many different races it's a big deal you don't have to do as much back bending to convince yourself that it has ramifications for other races or for the shape of politics when you have that kind of consistent signal coming in different places so that's a big deal just in terms
of our current political moment for democrats it's a particularly big deal because they just spent the last week
padding this internal really dead end
feeling fight about twenty six sixteen race just a very backwards looking fight
kicked off in part by or maybe entirely by donna brazil's book and so what this ratified for democrats was too big things one that really biggest thing which is that an off year elections were democratic voters don't usually turn out the question was would the antipathy towards donald trump which became a value
opposition in other words it's just i don't i don't like his policies it's i object to him at the very core of who i am and who identify myself as was that going to be something that would motivate democrats to go out and vote so that they can overcome their traditional off your issues the answer to that appears to very much beat yes and it appears to be
yes across the entire democratic constituency so millennial voters voters of color and edge college educated voters in the virginia race
democrats had one between forty two forty five percent of college educated whites in each of their victories in the states so that's obama in twelve mcauliffe and thirteen warner and fourteen in inclement sixteen so that's forty two and forty thought northam got fifty one percent of college educated whites so that is a
signal that the democratic party coalition does respond to and north and was not a
you was a kind of bland candidate had some stumbles which makes the signal seem even stronger and then finally and i'll just shut up but finally sent signals to republicans running and we can talk about those but i'll shut up now
there to interpretations from the point of view of the republicans have tuesday night one is dead trump is in without trump is not going to work outside of deep red states that it's become too toxic and another is that glass be lost by not fully embracing down on top and that of
i suppose trumps own spin on and steve and has been like all over the airwaves everywhere saying that gillespie was a creature of the spawn that his past is is very mainstream can it meant that his efforts to embrace some of trumps immigration and speeding that's not have banned him but that's how i'd put it that that didn't work because
people didn't see it as sincere and of course he didn't glass be didn't campaign with trump so which of those clearly ban in and trump are pushing back against the first narrative which is everywhere it does seem crazy to me though that gillespie did seem fake to people that he wouldn't be able to galvanize the tramp
and the same way as a candidate and you know who really lake drinks from the down on champ gordon and thought said and then i wonder as well but would that can be able to win and win in a swing state anyway i mean is the problem here for people like chump and ban and that this turns out to be a relatively
a narrow way of attracting about because virginia almost nominated a trumpet
that's a person and corey stewart who is the person who collects be beat in the republican primary i don't think i think you'd be hard pressed to say that stewart would have outperformed gillespie and with election i think stewart would have would have done even worse so i think it's a very hard trick to pull off in states that aren't deep breath
anyway but i hope for the sake of
trumps defeat that term continues to push this and and republicans are stupid enough to keep trying to do it
well i think that the north and victory was so big i think your point is right david which is even if the more ban and like candidate had been story to have been unable to win the primary could he have made up that massive deficit and that deficit was created because of this antipathy towards present
trap which presumably a corey stewart candidate would have exacerbated because he would have brought the president into the state
so i don't think that that theory holds but the fact that there is an ongoing debate
about this means that the signal sent to all other republicans running is very unclear and so what where do you go what do you do if you're a republican in are in a state where things are up for the grads or of your house member in a suburban district where the suburban vote just came out in force against donald trump
one of the interesting things about thurber generate again that
gillespie and republicans performed extremely well in rural and white areas they over performed in rural areas and southwestern virginia and particular republican candidates incredibly well and so just to dig into that question john with an electorate this divided what is it that state
ten minutes are going to have to do in states which are relatively purple and estate like a misery
i am not and i think in in in alabama or mississippi this is not that much of an issue because that's going to be interesting to see this ryan learn race may that anyway and have clashed so
yeah that's the question because again if if gillespie did well in the rural areas if he did well in traditional trump areas than a more trump trump candidate is not gonna do you can only get so much of the election out of those areas
and so what you are flirting with here if this is true is the idea that politics is reverting to what some people would say it would be reverting to form which is that there is not enough of a trump coalition to defeat the rise of the democratic ah
coalition that what happened in twenty sixteen was that basically donald trump
goose is turn out as high as it probably could go and he ran against a very weak canada so the conditions are now different now again as you point out what do you do in misery
it is a constant question every day for her candidates do they what are they going to do relative to donald trump and if you're democrats the reason you like that is that your message actually quite clean which is you make it about donald trump and donald trump wants to make it about donald trump whereas if you're a republican you want to try and make it a local race with enough donald trump
you are able to turn out his base emily one of the hardening things i think for anybody watching this left right center is that there was a series of new candidates drawn into politics as the way you want to happen with that people who are galvanized by the electorate twenty six and decided to enter politics and run races and i think i saw a statistic that thirty one
people who had been drawn in by anti trap activism ended up running and winning on tuesday
pretty significant number among the democratic victory there's a tremendous amount of diversity a lot of first time women can get a room the first trans gender
state elected official or burger
in the state legislature there is a sikh mayor elected in hoboken
what does that tell us about the both the diversity the democratic coalition but also this new involvement and politics
i mean it's heartening if you are part of the resistance or just part of either party in a moment as cemented change the sense that like new people will come in with their energy and decided to enter politics one of the problems in the last decade or sell has been our fear that political life has become
so unpleasant and unforgiving bag that people aren't gonna one or up their sleeves and become can that sell now he has like on some democrats are really good response to that and presumably it will be galvanizing from two thousand and eighteen many other thing is it looks to me like the future in the sense that turn up
was up with millennium goals and millenniums are going to overtake boomers and as a proportion of the electorate by i think like either twenty twenty or twenty twenty two and so there's just a shift happening hero an openness to lots of different kinds of people and not in this sort of bluest parts of the country
me either and that's i mean that's just gotta be a helpful thing in terms of like the polyglot open nature of the country what john do you make of the
victory to there were some victories in state legislature cheats in georgia
trump be district in michigan went to democrats the medicaid expansion in maine when strongly strongly endorsed by voters
the mayoral election and what with a new hampshire town or a couple of florida mayoral election went to democrats why and relatively republican areas or trumpet areas
do you think this this happened
well
i want to be real careful about
drink too broad a conclusion because i haven't actually looked into all you know what happened in the manchester year's race that
that worked here but i think the signal that get sent from all those different disparate places the one unifying theme is the leader of the opposite party has a thirty seven point five percent approval rating and that as you pointed out when you mention the thirty one people who won who have just entered politics is a part of the trump resistance the end
energy and the system that has led to these results wasn't just turn out energy on election day that there are things that president trump put in motion and we see some of the other big forms in politics moving as well that are a reaction to his presidency so many more democrats running for office is all up and
down the ballot as an active opposition to the president and also just re revitalization of their own feelings about a certain brand of politics because the way the country is split now
oh all this stuff goes to you know
a reaffirmation of a very different kind of world view and when you have a stark alternative like the president it excites those who have a different world view
to go and fight for what they believe in so all their energy doesn't have to be in opposition of the president is just it's the president makes them want to get out and fight for what they believe in and so that gets candidates it gets people excited and energized well before election day and the president is in a sense under this
theory providing with each new tweet turn out mechanisms for those people who have who feel this opposition to him so that would be my first cut it this just based on the disparate nature of those outcomes and you have in maine an interesting thing developing which that the governor le page said
says that he might not basically listen to the will of the voters on the medicaid expansion which is nuts and can i say when my thing about that to attend and still you know now it seems like oh it was so obvious that route from someone is going to when he won by nine points like foregone conclusion that last week it seemed like the polls are all over the place like
who knew and one thing i was really wondering about was whether all of the efforts to turn out on north some voters were going to also turn out less be supporters that you know if you see the other team gearing up and practicing extra hard for the big game like you respond and do that too and that doesn't
seemed to have worked i do have happened and i think that's really interesting it suggests that the trunk
turn out push for its own base is not like and as easy a button to push just to build on that and we we have to be humble about what election exit polls tell us especially since there's a new reporting i'm thinking from center for american progress on the size of the white working class
vote in the twenty sixteen election that's quite different than the exit polls but having said that on this question of trump islam versus president trump gillespie obviously ran that at about thirteen played on fears about immigrants and crime in what seemed to be right out of the trump playbook in the eggs
suppose it showed that only twelve percent of the electorate was moved by that issue or cared about that issue or voted based on that issue not surprisingly collapse be one that group overwhelmingly but only twelve percent so if you look at the issue that motivated north and voters thirty nine percent said healthcare was the number one issue and he one man by a gargantuan
margins so the point here is the reason you run on these red meat hot button social issue type or cultural issues is to increase that share to a large enough portion of the electorate so that you can take advantage of your existing advantage in that topic area and the fact that only twelve percent cared about the immigration question for gillespie means
it's not a push button type thing or that all you're doing is exciting or base you're not pulling in people to vote on that which is what people when they were criticizing north them at the end they were saying oh he came out and said he would not support sanctuary cities he's really you know he must be on the run on this issue glass piece you know put him on the defensive which sub
did a larger portion of the electorate was going to base their vote or base they're feeling about him in some measure on this question about crime and and immigration
there was one quite demoralizing aspect of tuesday night for democrats which was that democrats dominated the election in virginia
and i think north american went by nine points they are going to either to have half the legislature or maybe a one seat majority in the state legislature and the reason for this is the the distribution of oats is not fair but essentially because virginia is a gerrymandered state in the state legislative districts are gerrymandered to be the democrats
one many more votes they're not can end up with much more representation in the legislature this is lost because they're getting back sixteen or seventeen seats so it seems like a huge win but given the scale of libertarian they actually are to control a clear majority of that legislature emily
my fear about this election is that supreme court justice anthony kennedy is going to look at it and say look the voters want to the ballot box they flip the virginia legislature why do we need these kind of gerrymandering interventions that the people in wisconsin are proposing the system is working voters are turning out there galvanized and
and they foot the legislature even though the legislature should have been flipped much more than than it may end up being laid except the last thing he said is so important and relatively easy to see that i think let's give justice candy some credit and it's clark sinclair hit because you know look when you i was looking
this last night when you look at some of the task for measuring the degree of gerrymandering in particular the efficiency gap that has gotten attention in wisconsin case which is run by the supreme court the virginia house of delegates scores super high it has a big efficiency gap which means that on the votes then distributed in the way you say
say to give republicans a big advantage and so the second sentence is also what you said which is that even in a way of election the democrats are barely taking control or they're not going to have control and that's exactly the same kind of scenario we've seen play out in the last three elections in content since
twenty eleven gerrymandering bear the problem is we don't have any kind of right for proportional representation in the constitution and the supreme court has made it clear in the past they don't think that a simple measure a proportional representation is what the constitution guarantees however if you see a scenario in which in election as
after election a party in trenches itself and the other party even in a wave election can't easily take back control that seems like exactly the kind of problem the supreme court should allow lower courts to referee is they're going to open the door to a claim for political gerrymandering on which you know today
haven't had those kinds of court rulings that have actually allowed that kind of claim to win one final question john the impact of the election on mode tax bill that is now been considered a mouse and senate
so one theory use this makes it harder built a pass because suburban house members from particularly from california and new york new jersey are going to be terrified of doing something which could hurt their constituents which which some of the theory is that this topic though it really hurts certain kinds of voters a moose
areas theory number two is this is just lights a fire under republicans and the house intended to do something anything that looks like legislative action so that they appear to be not simply intransigent do nothings which theory you subscribe to well i think because of the diversity of representation i think both can be true so
again you have you have more fanaticism in the system
you have on the one hand the leaders and everybody's saying we gotta do this we gonna do this so that we can when people say try and tie donald trump to our candidates we can say look i vote with him when i support him and i don't when i don't and i got you a tax cut
they can't say that second part then they've got nothing to give their supporters and they don't have a very good answer for those who are disappointed with the president for whatever reason but i think if you're in a suburban district it was going to life was gonna be tough anyway and there are other bad votes as a part of this tax bill as well in other words it's the one that's a tough vote
for anybody in a in one of those high tech states
that's one problem that the other is that you know if you ever talked about the debt and deficit as a candidate this has huge impacts their though distribution tables for middle class tax cuts depending on which version you believe the promise that everybody's going to get a middle class tax cut is not
true for certain people and so there's other bad stuff about this so i think this makes it harder and finally because the president wants a win because everybody's telling everybody saying that this was a huge rebuke to him
he's going to start putting his foot on the gas and we have not yet seen and legislative event where more of his attention has improved the prospects for the legislation

it is three hundred and sixty six days and selection twenty sixteen one of the most surprising days and our collective lifetime
in my own remembered life there are three days that fundamentally change and experience the world one was december second two thousand which was when my first child was born the other was nine eleven and the third was at least so far was trumps victory another brave twenty sixteen i went to bed
that night i remember very very anxious and depressed
but partly because of temperament and partly because of the unearned luxury of being healthy and white and prosperous i woke up and told myself well it will not be that bad it's not going to be back bad
so a year later is it that bad
what has gone better or worse than expected
is the country or the whole better or worse off than we expected it would be year ago
emily
how do you feel i obviously i think if i know you you think the country is worse off than it was a year ago but has it worse off than you expected it would be all not at war and the economy is humming along so those are like really important basic fundamentals for at the country right
i mean anything if you were some are you worried that down champ is going to blow through a lot of the norms of government and give us like serious rattling to some basics of our constitutional structure of that stuff has happened on a daily basis in a way that you know it's very hard to give a necessity
attention to you however you know in my you the thing that has like got me the most agitated probably the most one of the things has been like concerned about the basics of the rule of law holding and on the idea that the president is subject to the lawn that the mahler investigation is going to be
glad to proceed and that has continued rate of mean tampa's on rattled the saber at mahler there's been talk of firing him at various points into an enraged jeff sessions are accusing himself and the investigation and sessions and sad that he regrets having done that by sessions did and he's still there
yeah i mean maybe only because trump wouldn't be able to figure out how to get a new attorney general confirmed and and now but as long as that stays there i feel a really important kind of basic part of our constitutional structure as it's evolved especially since on that nixon investigations and nixon's resignation that has held
and i think is you know it's really important we need to keep watching it but as long as that's in place i guess my deepest fears about the toppling of you know really important structure all aspects of the government have not been realized
don't forget i'm just a that there's a whole other one which emerged yesterday which was the thought that the president to the jury may be pressuring a t and t to get rid of cnn as part of the approval of any deal for eighteen to to purchase time warner which is yes a fairly other another kind of
violation of a norm and and intervention in process that is fairly shocking if true we don't know if it's true may now be true yeah and it's a complicated i just don't know enough about that merger and how other administrations might have been expected to respond to it in the world of anti trust i just haven't read enough about it
yet but yeah me and on its face that could be like one more serious mark what will we'll see i mean with all this like it's still pretty early on and there's also such a gap between what the president says and tweets which is like really norm bass staying and corrosive to the rule of law at
on and then to some degree what he actually dies at least in the rom we've just been talking about the only thing i think is really important to bring up here is that while congress has not yet past a major piece of legislation
in the kind of trump agenda given the amount of health care we don't know what's going to happen with taxes it is still true that some of the federal agencies are marching on and doing like serious work i mean the claim that trump really has accomplished a lot is true if you are looking at it through the lens of the air the department of homeland security
or department of education there's just a lot of regulatory success for the trump administration
john what's your coat on in what ways do you think the country different when off and you expected it was going to be back
i would have expected at least some simulation in the market
some people see the success of the jobs numbers and the stock market and say well of course they don't you know they like the fact that is slashing regulations and wants a big tax cuts for corporations and what's not to like but businesses are kind of risk averse and saber rattling with north korea
and just the unpredictability of the trunk presidency i thought would have had their would have been some moment where you would have had some economic moment of jitters just for the fact that the president is by his own admission sowing chaos in order to achieve what he wants so the fact that there was no sir
no other than really constant basically approving signals from the market now even if you argue and you have a strong case to that the economy is essentially are moving along on the trajectory that it was on at the end of the obama administration the fact that the despite the incredibly negative coverage and the fat
that is approval ratings at thirty seven point five and all the other things that donald trump has done hasn't gotten in the way of that trajectory is surprising for me i think you could argue based on longer time out with the democrats that donald trump is an odyssey you don't want to take this too far but he has rig reinvigorated the democratic party
in a way that is obviously quite robust now there are a lot of arguments still to be hashed out in the democratic party but they'll be hashed out regardless
and then the final thing i guess i would say is that the real challenge
and this is touching on my chatter a little bit but there's a professor paul light new york university who has studied the kind of failures of government over the course of time and going through back to the ocean
obama years and the challenge and our government has been not just the failures in decisions that presidents have made but the failures of omission the failures to put policies in place the deal with long term challenges and francis fukuyama has this idea of utah accuracy where them the minority can basically veto any action
on anything to fort the progress on the left or right
solving that break in government and solving the partisanship that locks up congress and makes it a week shell of what the framers wanted is a long term project that people gotta get started working on we're nowhere near that happening and every day that that doesn't happen every day that doesn't get improved
as a day that long term problems are not being addressed and by addressed i don't mean your preferred solution i mean that it's even being talked about her having the conversation is happening or that somebody is putting forward legislation that might have a chance of going through and becoming something and the number of government failures according to lights research has increased
over time because of this lack of for thought
even my government standards that's not getting any better
as i say every day as a day that problems can grow yeah i want to dig into bed just and my answer to this questions well which is that too i've been surprised how completely incompetent both he and his people turned out to be the level of chaos and lack of foresight is pretty astonishing
and i think one of the results of that is that they're further discrediting the idea of government has an effect of actor so the bureaucracies crippled received it from the state department which basically doesn't have anybody working there the best people have been to it and out the duties of government pretty performed poorly
i'm similarly surprised at how incredibly in effect of congress has been it its job
astonishingly poor congress has been doing anything so some of it is the failure to pass a healthcare bill but russia investigations have been placid every legislative element that have come up has been mishandled i think we're headed for another december funding crisis if i remember correctly because of the botched
that and the combination of the trump trump in incompetence
and congressional latitude as i think brings us back to the problem the jonathan roush has been so good about way now
which is it we're increasing the number of people in this country who have no faith and no belief and justifiably so themes that government can do anything and that politics is is a legitimate profession that can accomplish anything and we have accelerated part of this is norm busting that you identify anyway
that part of it is just a general sense that politics
is not legitimate it's not whole thing that people should do it doesn't work trump himself both preaches that and then he practices it and he is exaggerated they increased it and then there's actually just a at that point i think there's another element which is that there's this huge amount of presidential and corruption and also corruption within the administration
you've seen as amazing stuff with wilbur ross the secretary of commerce who apparently has been doing all these chipping deals even if he's been secretary of commerce as well line about how much money has but there's no one's been held to account about any of that stuff either and so there's there's also the sense that the system isn't even effective it self policing and can hold the president or his people to account for their
wrong doing if their lives and so to me that what's so demoralizing about the past year is not necessarily that the policy i mean i think the policies pursued have been policies i disagree with but like that's their right as the administration to do that too that's fine and the fact that the country has gone to war
good i'd like that and that the economy has a crater but this degradation of politics and political action has been incredibly worried and john i think that polite example he decided to sort of the evidence you just cited there's is reinforces that which is that politics become incapable of addressing and solving problems and trunk of success
and yet when you know you think about the conversation we just had a doubt that of reinvigoration as democrats or anyone who feels like they want to address this and politics it does seem like the system allows response to have that's right that like you can become more cynical
and turn off or you can like roll up your sleeves and their spend a lot of sleeve rolling out in the last year
although and i'm look i'm glad i'm glad to see wrote northam elected governor
you know i have friends who were running for office know there people i admire and respect thankful they maybe took a job but i continue to be sort of surprised by the lack of a cogent democratic plan that isn't
trump i don't see what it is i see that people are excited they're they're glad to be part of the resistance and they are running but i don't know i don't see what the affirmative messages that that's coming out of the left that of now galvanized by politics just seems to be not trump i think that's fair i mean there some
you can see some of that to be psych our healthcare single pair verses that kind of medicaid expansion bell that we saw succeed in mean this week like a specific issues but i don't think that you're seeing get like a really hammered out message about addressing inequality and that kind of social
y'all optimistic kinds of messaging that the democrats presumably mean but that feel like they're real era than like stronger together and some of the other saga and from the clinton administration that fell at least to me like death out flat john why do you think
for improving his his acceptance speech of his victory speech on election i talked about been president for everyone come together as one united people why didn't they bother why is no one bothered i mean that's one the other things so troubling and sad about last year's how much more device
edit the country feels
it's true one thing that we're we're witnessing at the moment is our first
well on and off its first but let's take the the dodge that we use in these instances which is the first in the modern era where you have a president who is
who is purely partisan president the rise of partisan politics and the presidency has been increasing since nineteen eighty for a variety of reasons but the idea of the president who could build a coalition for members of both parties kind of fly above the party
fights to build a coalition and pass legislation has been declining it is now
the president has only in a couple of instances even nodded towards the rhetorical idea of all let's all come together and we used to be the president's would nod to that all the time and then do what they want it now he doesn't even nod to it
and i think that what this is it's the next step in
vast part isn't split that we see that is both creates our political structure in congress and the white house and then is fed by but we now have on the pew research work that came out in october we now have the largest partisan split on a series of ten issues that they have measured since nineteen ninety
for so across a range of issues about ration race and justice and business and equity adjusted and
democrats and republicans are thirty six points apart
is it largest since ninety nine four they only started making eight or they started in ninety four
as a large as ever measured the largest they've ever measured and they started in nineteen eighty four so that manifests itself in many different ways the median democrat so democrats are becoming more liberal conservative republicans are becoming more conservative the median democrat and median republican are as far apart as they ever had been the views of a president you hadn't
as an hour's first year fifty six percent of democrats liked him
eight percent of democrats like donald trump now twenty three percent of republicans liked obama and his first year so you have honeymoons don't exist anymore the incentives for lawmakers of course we've talked about this a million times before but when reagan and nixon were elected half of the senators from the states they one where democrats so those democratic
senators had a reason to bargain with or make deals with the president because they knew a lot of their constituents had voted for him for president now we have a situation in which basically states vote for president and senator in the same form and so nobody wants to give a victory to the president and mitch mcconnell can say that is
his goal in life is making sure barack obama is a one term president and this will be my final point that the efforts to bridge the gap if you were a president trying to bridge the gap you would seek some common view among the electorate about kind of basic things how what's the role of government in in american life is health care of right are african americans do
advantaged by the system
on those basic questions democrats and republicans are as far apart as they ever have been and so if you're a president trying to make a bridge between the two you've got a span and even further territory then you ever had before which makes it very hard for any president to do it and say you could imagine and i think we're seeing a president basically
aside why bother
i'm just going to run it stay with my team keep my team energized follow governing strategy that's like the one the president follow to get elected and see if that successful an extension of that is a campaign and twenty eight team where you purge people from the ranks who are not at the first end of the ideological spectrum as you
to find it and so you basically try to run up at your team said it you can not have to bother with building bridges the problem with that is two fold one you can have a huge backlash like we saw on tuesday and to you create divisions in the country that are big and violent and irreconcilable and operate
not just at the national political level but in people's daily lives as this split and the exacerbation of the splits because you have to keep the splits exacerbated to try to build up your team through poking at the nfl and all kinds of other things
that creates a constant sense of kind of venom in unhappiness and that's obviously horrible for a country can i just add have made the pylon and my theory which is it
the kind of split you're talking about john and i think teams like increasingly failed to me like the right man for in a way that's alarming because once you pick a team you like to stick to your team it's geographic great i mean one of the things we're seeing else a bad as tax dollars that when you have states where you don't have members
the other party like there are no republican senators from blue states to exaggerate only slightly and so then like the republican senate tax bell is sticking it to the blue states because there's no actual cost and that senate to doing that now at that's not true and house who knows what will pass but just seen that happen that kind of like
geographic punishment is this gotta be a bad thing for us and then the other arm and to me is the failure of the media in particular the way that thoughts and other right wing news outlets i just supplying a different set of information and facts and headlines every day until a few live in a part of the country where everyone's watching
fox news you're just like walking around with a different idea about literally what is happening then people who are watching and listening to other media outlets
although it's weird about that all though emily if it even when you look at the numbers it's only forty percent
if people are are
thirty seven point five percent like this president know it's really you forty percent of people who are sort of conservatives and fall and so it's it's odd but that forty percent should still
v so able to dominate oh but go back to your gerrymandering play in a class of accomplishing of data and seems so odd
right plus the intensity of the national number may be thirty seven point five but it's all those people are participating in the process then they have an outsized influence in the electoral process because half the country's and vote
one of the things that i actually think it's it's also creeping up on us and the lowest it's been creeping up on us for years but this last year has multiplied magnified for a century the american ideal our form of government are kind of approach to free markets are moral force in debates are
growing up a strong middle class or internationalist open approach the world has been a defining mark of the united states and also been
we meet a world and we've always been able to fend off these kind of countervailing forces we fended off obviously nazis and fascism offended of communism
but i think that the rise of be technocratic authoritarian china
and countries aligned to to china is going to defeat us because we have squandered those advantages that we've had we've lost the goodwill we've lost the global faith that our political system works we've lost the trust enough as a partner and this is not all trumps doing and it's been things that have been sliding on for while we've lost belief that
we're going to be for open trade and open borders and global of them and that were reliable economic partner but trump is massively celebrated that and that's that's disturbing not just for us as americans but for the world to have the moral beacon in the centro guidepost of global policy suddenly not be there anymore
or is a problem and it does mean that china in particular is going to lead the world and a different direction and in the world structures and organization is going to be different than it has been for the last century and and probably in ways that we don't like
that's bleak
i'm all for bleak man
title can just say one of the final point is that there are a lot of people who
to put their faith in the president still have lots of faith in the president who are not the
partisan combatants that you see and social media and who think that the press and the elites are just out to get the president and if they are you know let's say that the liberal dream comes through and the president is trounced and and discredited and you know her
pray for his opponents
it's going to leave a lot of people who who had faith in him and who thought basically that the entire political the elite structure as demonstrated by the press but it with all kinds of other university professors and the special interests
all aligned to basically make it impossible for him succeed and so that only drives the split wider and and creates a lot i think a lot of dangerous reactionary forces in and in itself as well so
that worries me to no no yeah that's telling all right sir john how bleak to me
leave it there
and a bleaker spot

congress just heard from facebook google and twitter executives about their knowledge of in response to russian meddling in between sixteen election
we learned about several astonishing episodes the most amazing to me was when to imaginary groups conflicted into being by russian trolls each of which had a social media presence managed to get people out on the streets in texas for rallies in opposition to each other so
these to nonexistent groups which managed of gin up online followings got some of those people who are following them online to show up on the street and then essentially rumble with each other so the fake social media created a real conflict on another occasion another russian manufacture group managed to turn out hundreds
or possibly even thousands of people for an anti trump protest in new york city
the russian online meddling appears to have been very flexible very clever very chaotic it didn't seem to be necessarily seeking any particular and wasn't necessarily seeking trumps election
from my reading of it what it was seeking was to sow discord and mistrust and by any measure it was a fantastic success it was probably one of the most successful political campaigns and espionage campaigns and disruption campaigns in history
would be my my conclusion based on what i've read so far
what is it that we learned from the hearings about in particular what did we learn about how our big tech companies are grappling with us or not
i list is so not surprised the disappointed with this response i mean first of i do think that sending your layer and of coming or south as like a big thumbing their nose at congress and demonstrates that you're not really taking this seriously and second of all we're seeing the tech companies try to get away
with essentially as little accountability and certainly as little regulation as possible they're saying that they're looking into this that they want to have a better understanding they did hire a bunch more actual human beings to monitor their content with regard to political ads and i do think hiring human beings is like a huge
part of this when i was reporting particularly on facebook for my buck about bullying there was a huge resist stands to hiring lots of people to search through content and respond to complaints it just doesn't go with the silicon valley mentality are supposed to find a nice clean algorithm that's going to fix everything for you i don't think that this problem is one
the algorithm is going to help us with very much in fact this sort of algorithms way of paying for ads and then targeting them is is a lot of the problem here
you know to me just looks like congress has gotta step in here we have this huge domain of what enterprising that is now totally hang on a second we have this unregulated huge that of political advertising that we have no idea where it's coming from a from it get served up as if it was just regular content if it was on the
the airwaves we would never put up with this we would have a message at the end of each add at least saying where it's coming from and the idea that because it's online for this like reason google came up with having to do with character limits that has nothing to do with the modern internet it just seems like insane to me
why are you like apoplectic at the idea that there's anything congress can do why can't they regulate that
they regulate amazing what it has a ventilator bending they should literally figure out how to regulate spending on political advertising in particular by foreign agent since i mean this isn't amazing fact that the russian hit the russian intrusion into our election on facebook was paid for with rubles
that that's not obviously like they can switch dollars that next time but it is incredible that that happened at didn't raise any alarm bells and they should figure out how to have political advertising monitor i clearly identified on social media and and then how to regulate at the same as we would for for
organizing and any other forum but a lot of it
my indignation is on that was slightly mock indignation
it's a lot of this isn't political advertising that was sort of groups being organized this is like a stencil blue grass roots and that are formed black matters you as you united muslims of america or whatever you know try and over texas and and and these are kind of extensive
the grassroots organizations are not political advertising their their social organizations and is that something where is the problem that these things that are created were false is it that they were created by russians is it that they that they were on truly word lying about the origins
i don't know i don't think i don't think there's isn't political advertising no i don't think it's i think it's just so shocked disruption well great the don't give up their like a different buckets rates of the political advertising was also there and we should regulate it and then an addition what you were just talking about these like fake accounts that are
spreading dissension in texas getting people to actually like show up on both sides of ginned up protest those clearly violates face bucks terms of surface where you're supposed to like have a real name called and be who you say you are and so then it becomes a question of why does this company that claims to be policing and
exactly this area doesn't enforce its own rules trickier on twitter
yeah i used to that question emily a question for consumers to penalize the company on that basis and just take your business elsewhere or is that something where where there's any kind of government stepping in saying these year terms of service you're not living up to them and because there's a public cost to this we're going to step in
well that's a good question i mean the first option let's take our business elsewhere is one that personally i am drawn to and i've been feeling this way for years because of the work i did on bullying and the extent to which it seemed to me that facebook in particular but also twitter and these the some of these other platforms are just like really falling down on
their own claims of regulating this contact right they don't claim to be a public square or anything goes they claim to be like the shopping mall where they have their own content speech police but then they don't want to be held to the standard of the media company and so they set of like we go out of any real responsibility so yes we could take your business elsewhere
the more i suppose radical or at least like interventionist answer as the one tim wu a columbia law professor has been arguing for lately which is that these social media companies should really be treated as like public utilities proud almost like they should be run for the public benefit they should not be able to just like
reap enormous enormous profits out of advertising profits by the way and that are stripping other media outlets of their ad dollars and all wall this is going on on all of these things that are not serving the public interest i'm not saying that's going to happen anytime soon but i see why tim is making that argument there are no if a good solution it is
they are much more like utilities what happened with facebook to its own i think surprise
has become the biggest conduit of information and communication on the planet
obviously it's very happy about it but they're in denial about employer case when it burned around but the an edge of it's hard it's hard because they just want to be they just want to be what they want to be they don't want to have to be responsible for all that is go to one of their gross hypocrisy is which is like they say oh there's no evidence it adds
anything but so they say that there's no evidence he didn't you think they didn't sway the election but the same time they're telling all those people who are advertising and facebook you should really advertise on facebook because it the most effective way to reach people in the world to sort of its coca cola that wants to advertise on facebook ads on facebook are great but if it's russian troll to ago we don't think that affects people at all
they're they're totally hypocritical that yes i agree i can i add one more thing which is good the reports of like these enormous just loads of you know suspect money in particular lately from the saudis that we've learned about that are in the coffers of these companies like what do we think about had the idea that like data
want to comment on the recent like weird corruption courage and saudi arabia there's just a way in which because they're so huge there now implicated in these ways that seem quite and see us and all kinds of national and international affairs
let me go back to the arab spring
there was all kinds of social media action and social media meddling the united states and to create democratic or people forces would have been united states encouraged to create democratic activity within elections and egypt for example to the egyptian government that sure looks like meddling but surely you know american
meddling in their internal affairs
what's the difference between what that what american democratic activists were doing and twenty and eleven
and what russian
state backed actors are doing and twenty sixteen
there's not a huge distinction me one distinction obviously would be well no there's not in the russians are meddling in suffer in southern idea which is the idea of russia and so they believe that that's furthered by that meddling we would of course argue that what we were fighting for is a universal set of principles that all people should be
available to them which is freedom and liberty and sort of fighting against totalitarianism but i think there's a national security matter and this is where it gets back to facebook is that countries have to be aware that this kind of this is basically espionage that other countries that we're going to that are going to do
do it and minutes we sometimes do it with our own allies and so then the question is what role does the federal government get involved in the social media networks on those grounds and what how do they get involved and how do they retaliate and somebody suggested it was mitch mcconnell
suggested that facebook and twitter essentially be allowed to engage in or be encouraged engaged in or be used as conduits for
retaliatory attacks against the russians in the same sphere joe you know create our own destabilization of russia which i'm sure we're doing by the way through russian social media or russian facebook will always particularly weird about what mcconnell said i mean first of all like that's pretty soon star
the idea of using private companies to retaliate and that way and also mcconnell but saying at a while he was also expressing doubt about regulating political advertising or other regulation of the social media companies so it seemed like wrongheaded and two dimensions
my proposal in fact know how this would be carried out is that any post
on twitter or facebook or or even google ad you could have a feature which identified the country of origin of the person creating
register
so obviously you would like real names when you'd like real names but it least the ip address that created the thing
i'm sure maybe they get around that but i'm not until you get around that they just have like ip addresses that pain to three like antarctica or something yeah and then we know about all the fucking antarctic meddling in our election

okay well if got a cocktail chatter when you're desperately trying to come up for a solution to any russian meddling in your drink making and would have fallen what we've been shattered
i learned and the past week about this really interesting project called the graphic advocacy project founded by layer name tally j pope and what they're doing is trying to create like news graphics comic strips but other art illustrations as a way of
making it easier to understand all that complicated
legal issues that people try to sort out on their own so for example i've been trying in the last month or two to help a family in connecticut with some guardianship issue and everytime i go online and read about guardianship like i can figure it out and sort of but i'm never really sure i'm right a lot of the language is like unnecessarily comp
allocated and like also separate problem like unnecessarily antagonistic i would argue but in any case it hasn't been easy to sort out and like i don't the new went to law school at should be simpler so i just love this idea of using visual imagery as a way of just having regular people will be able to understand how things like
guardian ships are divorce or trust and we'll see
basic things in which people often end up the representing themselves and this is part of a larger movement that's gone on for decades to provide easy to use better written materials so in addition to the issue of people having to represent themselves and how to help them do that with visual materials islas arguing that it's time
time to redesign supreme court opinions that when they come down they have this syllabus at the top which is supposed to be a summary of the main points but it's just not easy to read or understand it's not clear what the different majorities the majority opinion who signed it you don't get that right at the top you don't get a really easy to scan holding
and the media is often criticized for getting tricky decisions wrong
famously with bush person score but also to a degree with one of the obama care decisions and i feel like if someone like how he just came in and redesigned the supreme court opinion we could solve that problem
right
what does you know
hi my janitors about a piece that michael lewis wrote for vanity fair on the us department of agriculture it's a wonderful thorough investigation of what the us does and it does lots of things that you might not have known or understood that it does but it is a
he and and it is a examination of what we were talking about earlier which is what exactly you're we your federal government does who the people are who are inside of it and he has these very in depth interviews with the scientists that the u s
and the guy who's the head of the food stamps program and it's written in his charming and lovely way which means are lots of little bits of sparkle along the way which are entertaining but what i like so much about it is
i like this idea in general which is that people should know where all this money is going and what because it's so pervasive the view that there's just all of this stupidity and ways in government and of course there is but there is also a huge huge group of people who toil in anonymity for their entire lives
basically the purposes of helping other people and this is just a great treatment of that and
so anyway in the most recent vanity fair by michael lewis and it's part of a series i think he's doing he's going from department to department doing this kind of deep reporting so there's more to come
to my chowder
is about a book which actually came in two thousand and eleven and probably the last person to read it
but i just happened to read because week i loved it called rob apocalypse bargain your wilson
and clearly trashy book but what it imagines is a future in which a i and the robots
run by but i become sentiment and very powerful and
the enemy of humans and the war that the robots wage against us
you know it's not familiar with him
the terminator terminator and it's ilk
but it's incredibly realistic it's very well told very well done really fun you can read it in an afternoon or two and scary scary in a way that zombies are because on but aren't real
i really recommend or apocalypse
also i recommend that you check out a pod cast played is doing and slate academy
feature three academies from extra pod cast really deep dive extra power guess they do and gentle booing and rebecca onion are doing a reconstruction
series on sleepless plus academy so they are doing a set of pod casts about reconstruction they did a very popular tourist the pod casts about slavery for slate pluses academy last year and now they're during reconstruction those of you liked our conversation with a good blight and are interested in in the topic for construction which is just a big
be complicated topic but probably enjoy checking out the sleep academy on reconstruction from juniper and rebecca

a huge thank you to they might be giants who are not only the most delightful musicians i know but they're also very philosophically difficult and i would give you this conundrum

which goes like this clowns are from the circus barking comes from dogs eggs come from a chicken and log cabins come from logs
but where where do they make balloons
hello and welcome to deflate political gap for december twenty eighth two thousand and seventeen the conundrum addition we are live in front of a sold out crowd noise

right that we come we knew philosophers to conjugate into mall
to consider into way to ponder into puzzle over the most important problems of our aid such questions as would you rather put clean clothes on your dirty body or dirty clothes on your clean body
and is it insulting to get someone the gift of a cleaning service
so now let me introduce the knights combatants first on my far left standing six feet one inches tall the reigning world champion of gentlemanly interrogation

emily bad

i'm and i'm david clots else obscurity
the no to their socrates

so let's start our conundrum share with one we already mentioned emily
would you rather put clean clothes and your dirty got a dirty clothes and your clean body which is the right thing to do okay so i tried this one out on some of my law students and a couple friend to speak and i not impassioned by different answers
wow
i feel like the natural answer is that you want your body to be clean and your close be dirty but here's the thing and i'm not actually sure you either of you are going to relate to that but if you're on a long back packing trip and your dirty in your ears okay you will relate that's but david kind of hate like nature so i was six
call so that like blog right for pinocchio not go ahead anyway so if you're on that packing chip in your your your your your a demon leave dirty and you've stopped worrying about being dirty it's like not thought of you at all anymore you can smell her every smell and that's that's the way it is it's actually really great
put on a clean pair of socks i really love that moment you dig that last clean pair of socks of your pack

i'm not going hiking with you
yeah i think that's right i think that's right but isn't aren't you know isn't that overstating the case like i mean that case any kind of relief from the fuming fetid cloud
of affluence is
is welcome
so what are we talking about here are we talking about mildly dirty or
well i think of it under any circumstances the clothes are absolutely filthy we love you can't even be clean for dirty clothes and then either although i guess you could take a dip in the stream
that's child left that part i'd rather be i'd take a dip in the stream and put on some like clean warm socks because frankly i did all this hiking i got all of sweaty and i got all the way up here to this incredible stream and unlikely to find the sox more appealing than that cool stream than i am i too i agree with that you should definitely
bathe rather than were clean clothes but i will say that when you come across people who smell the smell because of their clothes not because of their body or and if he had something to think about and if you feel clean and then you put all that smell right we're not talking about caked with my like who cares about kate with nine i would argue it's all
to do with odor and like sweat
but that's for other people's in this for you but don't you feel really self conscious when you think is now i do it like that unless you're not self conscious and somebody needs to write you a little note anonymously
say you're you're kind of dna
what's gone next one is an an audience question your phone somehow connects the internet and the cell towers of two thousand and twenty five you don't know how long you have to stay connected what do you call myself to see if i'm still alive
how do you think your number would be that you think the number would be the thing
well you how do you call yourself because you'd have your number you'd call and your phone well how would i get cell service and twenty twenty five i may give me some to working with iraq
that would be a terrible thing to find out why would you want to know them
well perhaps it would inspire me to do something to either a keep myself alive or be do something incredibly powerful with the remaining years i have like figure out how to go into the future and call myself a spooky
one can be really boring like i'd want to make sure that all the countries that currently exists still exist like our country in particular i want to know what do we still have united states of america that's so we haven't you go to wikipedia him look up united states
could figure that out by asking a more interesting question like who's president and what's the balance of power why they would oh my god you guys are to it is so have you go and check the stock now it's just like oh invest in at us and now you know and who won the left and super bowls you can lay bets on that yeah
you know as well
that's smart
are not a smart can you imagine if you're too fat two thousand and seven self had been able to do this you called and you did just what you said now
now i'm like what i came back from somewhere in believe it
yeah the money was an afghan pew dump
cop came back from being in captivity and did not believe the downtown
very recently yeah of was a joke thank you
okay here's one it's kind of time we would you rather work for a great boss who's a terrible person
or boss who's bad at his job but a great person
actually let's pull the audience let's do that there's always a fun thing that i
sales or with the first one the for don't do anything at first will do cheer for great bad boss bad person second which year for a bad boss great person so who would want a great boss who's a bad person
who would want a bad boss who's a great person
but
what if your definition of a great boss that there a good person
well that's obviously that you start arguing that what happen
how mad
well they're bad boss or bad person yeah i know that that person's like easier to a i mean they could be a bad person in many ways
had her son holy outside the context of work that they now i don't think that you have to imagine they're bad person i mean they're mean and they're not like they're hard to work for and women they're not
that you could be very strategically good at making judgment calls are lots of magazine editors who are not
i accept the head president company excepted
many many companies except but like someone who is very authoritarian and doesn't treat people on is undermining but has excellent judgment
you didn't speak and you're the boss
well i don't i think if you define bad defined bad person to say that are unpleasant person to be around the office than than i think i would
your definition i guess my i think the good case is this a person who is like outside of the office is a total humanitarian they're constantly going to the mid song sung frontier and they are raising foster children but in the office and then a lovely in the office but in the office is a mess companies
total wreck no one knows what they're doing to losing money or someone who's a an absolute beast outside of the office who who's on his seventh wife
cut off all of his children commit crimes but in the office is it is just like making sure everything is happening i think i would take that person yeah
it's a much harder question if you imagine that the bad behavior is in the office but it separated from the person's professional imagine that the boss and the offices actually can't really imagine that is a good boss
it's impossible but imagine a black guy and he had like a real it was making a lot of money and giving you a raise etc we don't definitely the lesson of the last few weeks has been the people who are bad people like are brilliant that
the and they're mad yeah no ne
solve on do you did you have a position that i
no i don't have a definitive position that would benefit from additional illumination and this question
would you rather stop aging at age thirty and lived for thirty more years or stop aging at the age of seventy and lived for seventy more years and presumably here's the question do you do you live at seven need for seventy murray will stop stop
embedded in the question you know
just singing think other ages where we do it because i think the right answers like forty like are just a few years ago
yeah i'm now forty seven and i already had my body is is not what it used to be but for it
so let's mean
well i guess at what point would you know this point would you know what will because of you knew you were gonna live for seventy years at age seventy then and eight age for you wouldn't let yourself go
let's have already so you would take your forty year old south for forty more years over your seventy year old self for seventy more years definitely you're really i don't think when as seventy i don't think i'd feel that way it's not because i feel like when i'm seventy all hate life it's that i actually feel that nobody that people shouldn't live to be one hundred forty i don't think that's i think that's a
against the natural order and that basically your time and ninety like that
what would you do in a lifeboat if he had to kill somebody question
well david sentence you are and and all that party
it's dinnertime
what if you didn't worry about that for a second like you gave yourself special dispensation then do you think
i think probably than seventy and seventy one if you use but none of us would take thirty and thirty it seems like i don't think so that doesn't seem like and also i haven't been thirty bucks so much better than the also i guess it depends what you're going to be like an eight seventy what if you use your phone call in the future to figure out how you're going to be seventy to say if you're going to be er at seventy and then you can make the
you're not old enough that twenty twenty five will do that for yeah but for the purposes of the joke it was ok
seventy over would you pick seventy over fifty yeah i want i want agora with you pick your ninety ninety over seventy years
the for ninety more what do you think it's going to feel it
in movies and conversations you can have you get to see your great grandchildren read old guy they'd be dead your great grandchildren
very dead i live to ninety the chances that they are having them be regulated the bowl or any myth about this ever it never ends well and and about that you want to turn things to go oh no wait a minute
you're the one who wants to find out what the stock market's going to be like so you can make the money i mean and if it's a curse at age ninety it's a cards at age fourteen it's not like it gets more curse the longer you live
the rumble still going argument would work at age forty or nine and i guess you could always if you did ninety you could say well can if i don't like it i can always kill myself unless you're a you oblige she live to one of us who have to yeah
there's an actor
long i pick seventy over thirty forty fifty and ninety let's do this one suppose we live in a state in which it is a requirement for every citizen to run for elected office at least once in their adult life think of it and give it like election duty instead of jury duty you can pick any job any
elected office what level of government what position do you want to me
somebody desperately wants to be on the school person
sign up on it
home
this feels like not an obligation and would happily do it if i didn't i didn't hand written so many things that would disqualify me for every ever any
i would run i would happily be a governor or mayor i would love to do it either
good at being a legislator legislator i would but i really really want to be mayor over governor
i think i say in to be governor i think mayor never though if they're both really fun i think mayors have a little bit more power ugly like that
yeah they had organizers our constrained
let's city would you want to be mayor
i don't think so i don't live in boston so that would be weird i'd have to commute
that
no i think the mayor of new york is the greatest job in the world
incredibly fun as you get to know all those yankees games
what about you go
now i have two answers so i want to be on the parole board because that's really important
unsigned and i don't think there should be like a long line that's great that really and that's really my answer but also since i'm writing a book about prosecutors that's about elected prosecutors i would want to be elected prosecutor and they have a lot of power
i'd want to be a mayor but a i don't know what the size town but but manageable city where you could actually innovate and tries to out and not
like older or i a man
that barreling to burlington vermont
wasn't burning as and i get better than i could remember he made a man and then
then you and bernie areas

max level they're defending life hack
which i have an infinite supply you have a maximum of maxims
well do unto others as you had them them do unto you that's a good one the worst thing about somebody isn't the truest thing about them
dickerson favorite that's a one that's a great on know always go to the funeral
that's good or other than life event in question is does always go to the funeral have a more gentle
version which is always go to the book party
yeah often similar
the day before in the theater how it
i like this is immoral war career one but if you can if if if lay flowers or finances allow do the thing you like not the thing you think you should do
that's good
i have to one requires is little story the one is never go somewhere you can't leave so i don't tend to get on boats for that reason
unless they're docked in listed on daughters of their dog
the other is actually my brother's here tonight and you probably remember this is there a nominee would probably have seen the movie street fighter
but the movie street fighter his role julia's final movie and he plays a character named gen bison and i probably a mis remembering this the street fighter peasants out there just lay off
and the final accommodating see the movie the heroine who is is accompanied by jean claude van damme the hero have finally tracked gen bison down in his lair and if confronted him in a heroin says to gen bison when i was seven years old you and your soldiers came
to my village you murdered my mother and my father and my brother and sister in front of me and burn down every building in that village and ever since that day every breath i've taken every step i have taken has been with the intent of seeking revenge on you have getting revenge against your general
bison and gen bison says to her
for you that was the most important day of your life for me it was tuesday
and that's kind of the way i feel like you have to remember like for the things that feel important you for other people often it's like for them it's tuesday
now go and
good
maybe a thing as i remember that
he'll busload
i were gonna do one more question and then they might be dancer going to come back for a little bit if you were down to your last fifty dollars to spend on something other than food or shelter what would you buy
in a team
you were like you said before you i've got an answer
like you and your jacket
that was the thing were so excited and i guess i did have added i just said that was the first answer the can't and i didn't reflect upon it
is it the proper answer either music or a book like that that was his in for your whole life the last fifty dollars you can spend before you say for the rest of your life now
he had about an imam but your food and shelter is taken care of
late nine and and says
dad and
i meant by that phone they couldn't called home germs in the cost more than good ives what would you buy what would you spend your own thing and how much do you write and how long is the fifty dollar let's say it's a week
well we but you have food and shelter rate your food and shelter and but nothing else utah i need something to read books yeah yeah i would think i might get a bike i'd get like if i could find a cheap bike
i would like that i really like rank i feel no yeah i mean it is a great i think you could you have you could buy food and shelter and close personal good i yeah well so the problem is you could borrow by just like you could borrow a book so you might be what if you are house pound
that your your bike problem by the time the time
once i think they can
yeah yeah so so the libraries are closed
yeah he can he logs to make a fire i guess that i'm out there etc
how that affects i was thinking about now that's a good idea
what about you know like pool it was it some are like a beach some other
be going to a national park right yeah just entry a ticket to some but they think the thing is when you buy something useful or just be like okay let's blow it on pleasure
i mean i think that i'm not gonna the reason i got a national power yeah you get bored the beach her week
i am the national park could be that yeah that's good may their ago
ladies and gentlemen they might be giants

how many days before a long planned and can you send an invitation without undermining the line you write that says we'd love to happier
right right so i got intimidation was like we really love to see you oh that's cool when is even it's a day
selling days not and say well i had my first reaction was wow a lot of people said no
then did you not want to go was at a party
like him or water was as it was something to which i couldn't attend because
i had to wash my socks romantics taking
when you're extending invitation than you do something last minute it's not with ellen it's not necessarily a plan b or c or even if it is it could be like whole heartedly will do you live him
yeah well
amazing that to go to it all
i mean i have often forgotten
somebody who's a dear friend or something you know and me like a buddy read them alone you say i can't believe this of all the people i want to do
then presumably because they are a friend they know that your absent minded and slow witted
and along and own laid planner and they forgive you
very few people actually in the world who owe you a decent it right
it's a good idea to keep one's feeling of being insulted to a minimum in general and now i have many that mac address
that's absolutely right
now
totally right and the corollary is also did not feel a sense of obligation by somebody who are you a false sense of we'd love to see you that's that's right all right we weren't going to put that on the maximum witnessed on the fridge i feel like it's good to be open until last many invitations ending them and taking them and as long as right
but but if it's ask you to do something professionally and it's super last minute then i mean this i think this well because sometimes not infrequently i am the only woman on a panel or whatever and so it's really clear oh yeah
you don't like seven me in the last minute you're sort of
by this is something that happens so when i get a last minute invitation for that i don't think all the woman dropped out and woman and i'm sure i'm correct about that actually go get a little spicy wanted to go depressed after dark here
so if you're being offered the option to extend your spouse's life by twenty years by having an affair with someone you're attracted to and your spouse will never find out about it
would you do it
can i can this isn't the aren't the incentives in this question messed up
it should be
if you is if it were to extend your spouse's life by twenty years would you let your spouse have an affair with somebody
men are more interesting is that isn't that more spicy
so how long as the affair is it like a really long and ball well
it is about turning years
what know what
you're going to this was kind like you never find out about it right so you don't know well as you can't grant sent to the bubbles
it's a two year affair
who got so long
like very emotionally of that one
at that point what are the remaining eighteen years going to be really lucky can
team years of recriminations
when you have or find our road
that's the key you never find out where you wanted to find a maybe it's better if you find out you're going to honey i'm extending your life by you going to having an affair with no harm
h r
well and then who gets to pick the is that of your spouse's choose your spouse's
it's it's
as obviously yes the yeah yeah yeah yeah you're doing it
if you allow yeah then
i guess he gets to him because slightly uglier thing about the original question is framed the original question do would you have an affair extend your spouse's life were having an affair
yeah i think you do yeah
i mean i don't know how the mechanism
i think you get in trouble which every answer you pick but this question because it's all benevolent you're only thinking of your spouse
anything i framed so
right
o k l a rake the yard
take out the garbage in all right i'll go and have an unfair to extend your life for twenty years but you know i mean not to cast a pall and this but of you said it was your child you'd say yes and a second right oh yeah corso
your where you're saying yes anyway so why does that make this much more acute version of the
say yes faster i'm saying it it when i went stress you like
why your spouse to die earlier image cases in that sort of so you can go have an affair what if it's a stranger what if it's a stranger but you know explicitly the you having an affair will extend that stranger's life twenty years
oh that's good
tell me more
live by the golden rule
yes right it's an act of charity
fair or do anything like how could you know that seems to attenuated mean your they were hungry and new fed them they were naked and new clothes them
they were naked
the same percent is brought to you by health care if travel nursing is lost its allure discover a better way and healthcare take advantage of their clinical latter designed for professional development work study program to advance your education and a personal career coach to god the way down to settle

oh yeah that's when okay would you rather have cat's whiskers that you cannot shave off archive or a lot and fairy tale
that is literally the easiest question i would like along for retail period
i could get a transplant today for a fairytale i would do it
just added itself as a ferrari yeah i've got the same way if i was going to know something i would be afraid that is for sir
what a beard has incipient version as course yeah no and of course you pick the tail because the tail is as more versatility as an accessory really but david have whiskers the cat's whiskers and
where were you would you take the whiskers no i totally would take the town i didn't realize there was so obvious though is there any that case
is there anyone not to make a pejorative is there anyone here in the audience to take whiskers
a minority interests
they're functional whiskers definitely was a it
i mean for sure
when you're going to stir your cocktail
no offense that since danger
he said
a bit of a danger is that close to your face kids you see it
should be like dogs years that's really useful years that work like a dog i think i would choose that may be over at hell even though they would be what animal what animal quality would you most want well besides flight which is obvious
i would want to curtail i would love a tail more sense of smell or hearing from like it never
there are a lot of really good mit scientists here tonight
just know that there's a mark
that hard tail and irish i would totally peck i think olympic sound but i'm really torn about this now except then you have to smell the bad thing where is it so his flight flight is often because if you have a lot to have is okay
i would want i would want the cheetah like reflexes i mean more than i already have
what about would you want to be of the rock climb a mountain goat or one because i know be a mountain goat
i guess you don't have to inhabit the lot of either
the talent i would want to move like amanda mean just actually i'd rather run faster than be able to climb
yes i've lost my climbing fuck am i feeling the climbing is more out of body experience
yeah
is it insulting to get someone the gift of a cleaning service
so let's hope way can be pulled this one because i feel like it is it insulting to get someone to give to the clean service first we're going to say it is insulting them will say it is not it is insulting to get someone to get to the cleaning service
it is not insulting to get some of it
i have a hand to the person and think you can give your parents or your parents and cleaning service gift that seems like a super aggressive and maybe not what about your daughter in law oh no pride actually also not that any fraud family relationship this is not that i don't when
your friend
yeah and are you get it added are you getting it just out of the blue or is it their birth think it's their brakes their birthday it's their birth and get and they have just returned from hiking
i just had a baby that some people need know that's different you they just had a baby that's fine no it's more like this is their daily you know their everyday life in the house next year dirty if it that they have like really mall the sponges that their think that i
the audio didn't capture emily's delightful expression and
so why do you think it's okay i actually think it's hugely insulting i would be hugely insulted if someone did that to me i feel like the that that is something which is very personal and to pass judgment on someone else is life and to say they should be improved it's like buying somebody who is overweight a gym membership yeah
yeah it's like that's not that's not what like want us there
what if it's just a nice way to take a load off your finances by getting you know him well okay yes there is a model of it which is like that there's a model which is yes
it's a person wants for themself it's a luxury the you know you go to their house and you see that they live like pigs and like they shouldn't live like pigs they what they really need is a clean service they don't bid maybe they don't want to clean service maybe they like living like like pigs why did your neighbor has a really messy line and you offer am i
i don't know usually people do this just by cutting the name of the landscaping service like in a car and in the mailbox listen if you know them and they're located in the a nudge them in the landscaping than they're going to get a leaf blower and then every saturday morning at eight a m
that am leaf blowers going to be going so let's ruin my family leave let them live wrapped in the vines of there was syria and
if it helped me listeria am problem who'd the period of your life that defines you is an interesting question again and to hear you that what period of your life to find you
for me it is that the period when i had my first job and journalism the city paper i was learning to journalists in my mid twenties i met on a rosen who would become my wife
i yeah that's right
not having an affair to prolong your life
that you know
the joke is whether a new didn't she is so
good point the
yeah that's when i learned i learned i learned professional habits i learned my profession i learned what it meant to be in love with somebody and to build a life together that's definitely a fascinating because my period is from the the same time not when you met your wife but from been
but from when i met my wife at college because it coincided with the period is junior senior year of be becoming intensely interested in a specific area of study which then turned out to be the thing that i would do for the rest of my professional career assuming i don't follow my dream
becoming a i don't know what my dream and see i'm so bereft of other options
so i wonder if if it's really the the meaning of your spouse that's so far in this experiment two of us have said that emily would you
there's a lot of pressure here
sorry i didn't mean to do that at all
my husband never listens to this
never now
let's see well no i think that all makes a lot of sense i guess so for me i got married when i was twenty five i think emphasize that feels young to me but then i didn't really tired then i tried to be a journalist from lousy newspaper and then i went to last
school and then i read
and then i was a journalist far from
publications i like better and so i would actually put it later my kids are born and i was twenty eight and thirty i think that so that is the most life transforming event that's ever happened to me for sure but i think i would say that it was like my early thirties when i had really little kids and i was
trying to figure out how to be the professional south i want to be because i think actually having young two young kids is the hardest time to a parent and for me it coincided with the psych important and then my husband had to really like support me and helped me there are so he's still crucial
arts or a new one more question than there may be it's so audience question
if you've been dating for months and she takes you to the conundrum show
does that make it a great night to tell her you love her for the first time
yeah
yeah yeah yeah
we love the idea of being associated with such your mouth it
yeah i just not to raise the stakes but this is a defining moment in your life

them into you know you doing
the nautilus machine is probably we do and him and sometimes out of the be demons going to be considered to and then soon
who knew to see and thinks he knows what the nothing she could see them
they've been over feel good he said essential and sweaty and met a group in a few comedians
amanda go when you can say only and see and say things both hell broke loose when we have come to reenter they've been through on your now let's go to the lightning around john marty marty who you are you going to do to some baroque genetic condition you have to give up either all food and beverage over room temperature
we're all food and beverage under room temperature
which you choose
marty the other snare over and drove her under
it's really hard
wait you're weight sorry to let's keep it what do you going to continue to consume so you can hold food or hot cold yeah you're going to keep the cold food or keep the hot food i eat much more called to not been but keep it really sad to imagine giving up hot
colin thing my escape and i think maybe i have to go over to hot even know i'd be giving up like eighty percent of my diet but happen
oh so your point is that the the hudson it even though you eat less frequently is that much more powerful yeah i never have hot breakfast or hot lunch but they're just from the laziness or choice
no no no no i mean i agree and like good hot breakfast can't be the which is or money or blue apron is one of our sponsor
make fantastic home cooked meals
and take pride in your own cooking
is anyone going to pick call on the
maybe should know blue a for wouldn't meals or call their own
i i'm a i'm a caffeine addict and i need in the morning so everything else and
what about when you're really hot sweaty and you need a cold drink but way
your dirty clothes
do actually this is a crucial question so and the hot coffee front what about you'd be getting a cold martini
and not and not just for the article
year and a cold gate area in areas
it's called bubble tea i would be bereft of bubble tea
although a maybe you could be used to a higher higher
can you get used to it after a while
right so who are going to what do you want to keep so if you want to keep cold will go first and hot go second who wants to keep cold
who wants to keep
stronger presence for cold than i would have expected but emily you made a very good case for ours
next you are wrongfully convicted for a crime you didn't commit you're up for parole do you admit to the crime he didn't commit and get parole and live free or continue to proclaim your innocence and stay in prison so i hear a lot of stories of people who do plead guilty or admit
helps but then the and even to get out and not then it's very hard to live their lives
that's really tough on the other hand if you imagine being in prison like for the rest of your life vaccines i guess worse i would definitely admit the crime committed and it as a member of the parole board how would that affect your view well actually the reason this is important and happens is that you usually can't get parole and that's you
net response really or crime and so if you maintain your innocence you can't get out but when you i think it depends what the crimes
it has to be a bad crime should we are in for a lot like it depends them how bad jail is
well i guess that would depend yeah because i ever got like you can't leave
oh no budget say state
hard time
well i could be really i just feel you just pick a side pick a on with that i mean i will admit guilt but i might bleak and worst case
yeah like yeah i did it
marty
username marty marty marty
going to stay and man and connection and more in the lead the the general has the strength
dig his way out
six
john did you did you say
you stay in prison for wives or for the remainder of your turret doesn't say then add to that so imagine it was murder and it's the difference between getting out now versus twenty more years
it's murder you don't come to you took some
internet minutes
it's just that one of my maxims
have enough of that you're not going to kill anyone in the first yeah it's devlin mags and don't kill anyone although you can have exceptions
but not present company which fictional character would you most want to be friends with if they were plopped into your life here and twenty seventeen lyra from his dark materials
always there
that lizzie bennett from pride and prejudice should be super fun to hang out with and then really yeah no yeah she'd be so fun to chat with be a great friend and then i think that the clark gable from it happened one night
and i would pick that now that it's arguably mum no know the clark gable character affirmative name is whatever the character hand his journal of these this is opened up the whole new realm of possibility it then you could go to like catherine oh really
he's a kidney a fictional character
she so annoying and i like that character
have fun margot channing room temperature region
i thought of films cash gandalf
i marnie
a minute
a great time on this one so i really i have to remember no ads name but the main character and middle march i really love our maybe dorothy my name and then and this would be complicated and a little dark but the main character and house of mirth his name is not merely by yes
presumably when she's alive yeah and in hopes of keeping her
he needed a friend ray know
read fred taylor feel they would really be out at writing on your in atlanta i think i could somehow what two books
define you are most important to you
do most important to find new maybe define you
emily
while the book that i read over and over again that like the most relevant as a journalist in the murder
but the books that i feel from my childhood that i think about a lot the to tasty ten bucks to the and those bucks prime nobody on the stage they're mostly read by girls but i think they were great and me a lot of ideas about family and friendship and what a good happy life is come from those books they're not books that are about it
tragedy or like or offends are ending
okay
mine are similar to yours i mean i would say farmer boy laura ingalls wilder
about the boy growing up on a farm in upstate new york as the eats a lot of pie and funny he any were any works really hard and only are they have the learning about the books which i and i thought of those two that's the one that made it's the most
boring and has a lease plot in it that after i like books were nothing really happened
i mean that you have this and all those books that are descriptive but that one in particular really has no arc
sometimes he buys just books full of blanket range and ox he trains his team of oxen yeah but anyway
the dynamic of the teacher friends to whip them he can't control them yeah
yeah the and the other one maybe is i think david copperfield because my father read it to me when i was eleven or something and just the memory of just sitting with him is just very important sense memory for me i'm totally took to find to me in a different thing i thought you meant like you are now i am a different
it was like that yeah
so the glory and the dream
new seeds and contemplation and bob dylan's lyrics are probably
just invasive answer
flat land an average
that and
the ice storm
tells my job
but not your adult life no longer my
it's an obvious when but catcher in the right
you know gave you a definition of and authority for sure important here
in and i don't know but define you but a book recent book called wonder which is
i wonder how
yeah
i cried and cried
i think the shock of the new which is just about modern our power to use the guy with the australia book and please and rereading please kill me
and it's having a profound effect what does what can please kill me it's an oral history of of the new york punk rock scene minus the people that wouldn't talk to them i'm very concerned that you're saying that defines you
we'll talk about it after the shogun
art last question the six of us are adrift in a life raft with no food starvation is looming how do we decide whether to eat someone
if the answer to number one is yes how do you decide whom
oh yes and it's it's definitely a john but
you are
i just say marty marty is an incredibly excellent physical shape
gonzales on drumming
but there is the healthiest the you're probably understated you already said that age forty is living too long so you'd pass you didn't understand it it's age eighty do you get to live forty more years
no no but you said at some point that was so what's your what's the age that you think he is determined that my life had already forty to eighty four to eighty
and while i eat subway
i'm totally i'm very i'm pro cannibalism i'm would eat and i would be i'm sorry you wouldn't get on the boat in the first place

quite to eating
bad idea to you either
just how are we going to decide that's an interesting question how much longer it's a good group because we have two groups of three year because we were on it we were on a boat tour together and like oh no we split is there a way to consume portions of each body in a way that didn't kill the host but the prolonged everyone's life
is there a doctor in the house
you couldn't get enough you could me right now and you wound and how would you treat that well that some need you need one hell of a first then we're going to vote all of us are going to vote
feed david would he really yeah he met with one of them
that's kinda great very guys boat how do we decide booty
already baylor well eat marty
whoever said they would no longer eat cold food would be a good person
i'm not even anyone i just like that i'm not getting involved in deciding and not eating any when it's you
the dead that girth down to be alive and eaten alive
he dead
guess no no no no no fresh and i resign be totally fine
one hundred percent
