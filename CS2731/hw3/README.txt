Homework 3

How to Run:
The program is built with python. I used version 3.9.5 in development.
The program uses the nltk library.

Before running all tasks, make sure the training and test data is in the 'hw3_data' directory.
Also make sure that there is an empty directory 'models' in the same directory as the program.
To run all tasks, run the following command.
  - python main.py

Task 1 - Builds the following n-gram models for each language in training data.
Saves models in csv format under the 'models' directory.
  - standard unigram, bigram, and trigram model
  - interpolated bigram and trigram model
  - unigram, bigram, and trigram model with Laplace smoothing
Task 2 - Calculate average perplexity for interpolated trigram model for each language on training set.
Task 3 - Calculate average perplexity for smoothed trigram model for each language on training set.
Task 4 - Generate 10 sentences using unsmoothed bigram model.
Task 5 - Generate 10 sentences using smoothed bigram model.
Task 6 - Generate 10 sentences using unsmoothed trigram model.
Task 7 - Generate 10 sentences using smoothed trigram model.
Task 8 - Calculate average perplexity on training set for the following models.
  - unsmoothed unigram, bigram, and trigram english model
  - smoothed unigram, bigram, and trigram english model
