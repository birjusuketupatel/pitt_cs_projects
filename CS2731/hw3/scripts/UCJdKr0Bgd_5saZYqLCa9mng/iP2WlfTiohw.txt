ladies and gentlemen
please join me in giving a rousing and i
mean a rousing
clemson welcome to our panelists
all right we will accept that as rousing
are you sure are you guys all right with
that for rousing i was a little worried
at first because when he said free
speech and we got like one clap over
there
you guys are kind of looking before free
speech we are this is a we're for it
right we're four
feet
i'm very excited to be here i was
wandering around campus all day long i
don't know if you guys are following me
on twitter uh i saw a squirrel
outside the library garbage can eating
an oreo
and
i walked around for another hour and
then he was eating another oreo when i
came back and i thought there's
something special happening here at
clemson
so i'm very excited there's squirrels
eating oreos we got these guys they know
their stuff where's morgan by the way
who i was tweeting with earlier where's
morgan morgan over there she normally
only wears sorority shirts and nike
shorts but she dressed up in regular
people clothes to be here that's pretty
good give her a round of applause
i also was gonna wear a sorority shirt
and shorts but
then they made me put this on uh i'm
very excited to talk to you guys we've
got about an hour and a half which i
know is gonna fly by uh the university
the administration was great too because
we're doing a free speech thing here and
they gave me a list of topics we're
allowed to talk about so
let's see what we can find oh by the way
i also i saw that outside there were a
couple nazis out there so thank you for
those you that punch them because you
got to be
punching nazis
just just a joke people there were no
nazis outside
i know twitter is a blaze right now oh
god you heard ruben the nazis showed up
all right
okay we're going to talk about free
speech and uh and we want this to be a
conversation so we're gonna do about 45
and then you guys will jump in with a q
a at the end of that so i think first
off to kick this thing off the fact that
we even have to do
talks about free speech these days seems
sort of tragically ironic or hilarious
or depressing depending on which way you
want to look at it that anything that
we're going to say up here
i'm pretty sure you're not going to hear
anything racist and you're not going to
hear anything homophobic or
i mean i'm gay married
i'm not even gay i just did it to prove
a point
and
what you are going to hear is people
expressing their views and that is
simply the most important thing that you
can do as a college student that you
guys get to not only learn uh from great
people one of them sitting right there
and i've had them on my show but you
you get to express what you think and
learn how to think and these two
gentlemen are quite good at uh
explaining how they think so first uh
jordan i'll start with you um the fact
that we even have to do this that that
we can't do a talk perhaps on uh on maps
of meaning although that's going to be
sort of part of uh what you talk about
that we have to talk about free speech
in and of itself does that sort of show
you what a precarious position it's in
well i think what it shows me is
just exactly
how powerful ideas are you know
and people have the misbegotten notion
that
the strange things that are happening in
our societies in canada and north
america and in the western world in
general are somehow
academic issues that only affect people
in colleges and universities and nothing
could be farther from the truth than
that
you know it's just that the wars between
different sets of ideas manifest
themselves first in the colleges and the
universities before they
went their way out into the general
public and this is a war of ideas at an
extraordinarily deep level it's it's not
political
it's not philosophical even i think it's
really at the level of religious
thought which is one level below one say
one it's the substructure of
philosophical thought in some sense and
it has to do with the
place
that is deemed appropriate for the
individual versus the group in
in the world in being itself
and
the post-modern claim post-modern
neo-marxist claim let's say because
there's an unholy alliance between those
two branches of
pathological thought in my estimation
their conclusion is is that the
individual is first of all nothing but a
concatenation of
cultural and biological forces with with
heavy emphasis on the cultural no real
capacity for free will no separate
identity from the group identity and uh
and therefore really of little value or
merit or significance and to me that's
anathema i think i've pronounced that
right i've probably only read it but um
because the west is founded on the
principle that the individual is
sovereign and that is not a trivial idea
it means that
we've recognized and and much death went
into this realization that's the thing
that's important to understand
we've realized that
states that are not in the final
analysis subordinate to the
to the
spiritual and intellectual supremacy of
the free individual are doomed to
dissolution or tyranny
and i think that
it is it's very difficult to make a
stronger
moral and philosophical claim than that
one now it's a frightening claim because
it means that each individual
is of value and also
that what the individual does matters
and that's actually quite a terrifying
proposition because it means that your
moral errors actually have some
ontological weight i would say they
actually affect the structure of reality
itself in a profound manner and to
contemplate that deeply especially
in the light of the horrors say that
individual actions allowed or
contributed to in the 20th century is a
very terrifying proposition so this is
no
lightweight
this is no realm of lightweight
consideration but make no mistake about
it we're in one vicious
war about the structure of reality and i
hope that
the classic virtues and values
are are able to organize themselves and
articulate themselves so that young
people can understand what they are and
so that this thing can turn out properly
so
yeah well i think talking about this in
the frame of a war is sort of an
interesting way because
it seems to me we chatted with about 30
students earlier today and what
everything seemed to be coming back to
is about learning how to think so that
you don't have to silence your opponents
and it seems that this is the place
right this is the place where you guys
are right now this is the place where
you're supposed to learn how to think so
that if someone says something that is
counter to what you believe that you now
can think your way out of it show them
what the truth is
what has happened to that the ability to
to know what you think and and own your
own mind
yeah i mean i think that goes to the the
initial question you were asking of
isn't aren't we in a weird circumstance
now that no one is really on the side or
very few people on the side of free
speech
but if you go jordan brought up which i
think is really important ideas are
powerful so if you look historically
authorities have tried to control ideas
because they're so powerful most
societies have never had freedom of
speech and even when you look in the
west i mean the first
the comprehensive philosopher plato has
a system in which you don't have freedom
of speech and it's because he doesn't
think most people can reason they're not
autonomous in that kind of way so he has
a philosopher kings who were at the top
they can think they can reason so they
have full freedom but the people
underneath don't and it was a radical
idea that came as a result of the
enlightenment i think of that no the
individual each individual has within
them the power to control their own mind
to direct their own thinking um and to
reach knowledge so just as it was a
radical idea in the way the american
founders framed it of the pursuit of
happiness there's also the issue of the
pursuit of truth
and that each individual is capable of
doing that he might default he might not
really be pursuing but he's capable of
doing that but the only way that he can
do that is if he's free and that means
no authorities hemming him in and
telling him you can't look at that you
can't hear this person you can't
investigate this in the way they try to
hem in galileo and say no you cannot do
this you're under house arrest no more
investigation you have to be free to do
that but you have to have to really
value free speech you have to have this
view of yourself that i'm capable of
doing this i'm worthy of doing this and
i demand my freedom
and i'm not going to submit to any
authority telling me what to do and even
like if you put an albert einstein like
plato's idea of a philosopher king at
the top of government i would not submit
to him telling me well don't look at
holocaust deniers because it's all
irrational i think it is all irrational
but i need to make up that opinion or
belief for myself if i want to look and
read some holocaust deniers i want i
have to be free to do that to look at
and say oh no this is all garbage it's
all rational i won't look so it comes
from a real the value of free speech
comes from a conception of yourself as a
pursuer of truth and i think the
post-modernist who i call the
anti-enlightenment crowd are driving
into people that you're not capable of
that and you won't value free speech if
you really think you're not capable of
yeah so really knowing what you think
and why you think it is is really the
key to this whole operation uh it's
interesting you brought up holocaust
deniers we we did an event a couple
months back at university of arizona and
i looked in the crowd and i saw a
diverse the diversity that the left
loves i saw diversity of color
and sexuality and all that stuff and i
said that's not really the diversity
that i care about i care about diversity
of thought i said well for example how
many nazis are here and actually someone
in the back raised their hand and uh
said that they were a nazi
and and then they started going on about
holocaust and i said you know what hang
tight we'll honor some free speech when
we get to the q a we'll give you the
first question so then i we got to the q
a and i threw it to her and she uh was
going on and on about auschwitz whatever
i had michael shermer was there who i'm
sure many of you guys know from skeptic
magazine and he debunks a lot of this
stuff and he clearly explained to her
why she was wrong now of course
she doesn't come around no one's going
to come around but i thought it was a
great example of what free speech is
that we let her share her ideas everyone
in the audience kind of looked at her
like this is nutty and
we we honored free speech an interesting
little caveat to this as i mentioned to
you guys earlier she was trans which is
kind of how often do you meet a trans
holocaust denier that was
that was pretty good you know that was
something hitler loved those trans
people didn't he
um
so we yeah i wanted to pick up on
something
on that ankar said um
you know
there's this idea that
the reason that
we need the right to free speech is
because let's say of the nobility of the
human spirit and there's an element
that about that that's true but there's
a more important and more
practical reason that has more to do
with the stupidity and the ignorance of
the human spirit and
and so i'm going to kind of come at this
from two places i mean carl jung the
psycho analyst said that uh the fool was
the precursor to the savior from a
mythological perspective and
you can see an echo of that in the idea
that comedians tell the truth right and
that the the jester in the king's court
is the only one because he's beneath
contempt he's the only one that can
actually say what's true and so that's
the sort of thing that jung meant
but
it's also the case that
the reason the fool is the precursor to
the savior is because when you first
start to think
you
have to express yourself badly and as if
you're ignorant because you don't know
how to talk or think and you are
ignorant and so what that means is that
if you're not allowed to do
to think badly
and and then you can't think at all you
can never learn to think at all
and so that's part of why the
restrictions on free speech are so
indefensible because everyone starts out
foolish and ignorant
and so
and
the
part of the enlightenment idea and and i
would say even more deeply rooted ideas
before that that had been developing for
centuries is that
people are at least capable of in moving
towards enlightenment even though
they're not there and they never will be
there it's possible to stumble forward
towards enlightenment and and you can't
also do that just by thinking by
yourself because you're just not smart
enough to think by yourself and so free
speech isn't merely the right to
criticize those in power and it's often
it's often viewed that way and it's not
also only the right to say what you
think it is actually the right to think
because even what we're doing right now
