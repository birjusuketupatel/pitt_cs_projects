joining me today is the author of the
art of the argument western
civilization's last stand and the host
of free domain radio
stephon molyneux welcome to the reuben
report thank you
great pleasure to be here it's been a
while it has been a while i i've been on
your show a couple times
uh before we get into anything of real
substance though i do feel we have to
address the amount of gray that we both
have
in our beards because it what what's
with the chin area though
i don't know i mean first time i had a
beard and it went gray i've been outside
in canada in the winter
and i was like oh it's just a little bit
of you know a little snow a little ice
or something like that it's like doesn't
brush away
because it's father time doing his work
i have never had a beard in my life this
is my first beard ever so i didn't even
know
that gray was there now i feel old and
tired
and here's the thing too once you have
the beard in public view
you can't darken it no you can't because
it's too late like soon as you like
even if you get a bit of stubble because
you know there's people who obsess about
everyone's looks on the internet get a
little bit of stubble
you can't yeah you can't shoot polish it
up you can't do that you know you just
you got to let it go what number are you
buzzing with uh i'm sort of like a
number two kind of thing
i'm like eight oh okay we'll see
see i went into the controversial stuff
well now here's the thing because
you're okay because you have fairly
lengthy hair yeah but i
cannot be the guy with a beard much
longer than
his hair that's a hole like montana
living in the
caves kind of look that has you like
everyone thinks that you're cooking
beans on a fire in an old shoe waiting
for the end of civilization
there's got to be a youtube series about
that i'm sure but yeah so i've got to
keep it fairly trim
no matter which way yeah all right well
we have a lot to get to and i really
want to talk about the book but i
thought the
best way to sort of start this is that i
know i'm going to get a certain amount
of hate just for sitting across from you
and as i said i've been on your show a
couple times before and we've had
nothing but pleasant conversations
have talked about liberalism and logic
and reason and all that stuff
but i think you're you're somewhat aware
of that type of thing that for some
people you are
negative opinions about a a free thinker
on the internet i think actually
pre-internet it was socrates and then
you know copernicus not to put myself in
such lofty categories but
there certainly is when you are an
original thinker and when you really try
and
particularly when you scrub things down
to the bare minimum like
randy dickhardt said like what if i know
nothing whatsoever what if i just wipe
everything out and try and build a
cohesion
uh and rational framework of thinking
and
of understanding the world and of
understanding ethics what if i just
pretend i know nothing which is a
socratic commandment you know nothing
what are you gonna build from scratch
and i think that's the modern world
is when people said we don't know
anything we don't know whether the sun
or the the earth is the center of the
solar system we don't know anything
let's just pretend we know nothing we
don't even know if the king is put there
by god we don't know if the aristocracy
is put there by god we don't know if the
priests are right about everything what
if we just wipe the slate clean and then
we build things up
and we get modern civilization i think
out of that but there are a lot of
entrenched interests
that profit from existing error and when
people come along with better arguments
uh well it can be a little kind of like
it can be a little controversial
toss in a certain dose of twitter and
then yeah you know you get
where we are now it's funny because i've
had a little bit of a change over the
last couple of months where i was kind
of
really just you know everybody talks
about well we've never been more divided
we're all angry at each other we all
hate each other
i think there's actual great opportunity
right now for people that are talking
about ideas and i include you in that
but what would you say is the thing that
people uh
find most controversial about you is
there one topic that you consistently
hit on
that you think people either give you
the most flack or you think is sort of
wading into the most dangerous territory
if i knew that dave i would hit on it
more well
i've got a couple i've got a couple
right here but i thought i'd throw that
to you i think
i would say
i would say that the concept so so
there's some abstract ones and there's
some personal ones yeah and people tend
to get most upset about the personal
ones because that's where people have
kind of like a stake
in in their life in their world so for
me for sure i think
people get most upset when i talk about
say for instance
you don't have to have abusive people in
your life you know whether they're
that's what the one i have that's number
two i have one above that but let's
let's
we can start with that sure so you know
when i was growing up
i don't know for some of your listeners
they may you know paleozoic maybe
but when i was growing up this was
everywhere
when i was a kid and this was part of
the feminist revolution right where they
said
if you are with an abusive man you
should get out
you should you know hit the road jack
don't look back deep in the rear view
nothing but dust right and that was
something that i grew up if you're being
abused if you're in an abusive
relationship
then you should not be in that
relationship now i actually think that's
a little too harsh i think you should
sit down and talk with people and try
and reason things out and so on but
that seems relatively uncontroversial
when you're talking about adults but i
think one of the things that people got
upset about is when i logically at least
to me
extended that to if you're an adult and
you had an abusive parent
do you actually need to continue to
spend time with that abusive parent and
the answer to me is well
no because if you marry someone that's a
chosen relationship right i mean but
your parent is someone
like i'm a parent right and i recognize
that my daughter did not choose me she's
like eating me
there's no there wasn't like some you
know this platonic idea that you're kind
of floating above the world you look
down and you
unless there's some cosmic game that you
don't know about no i don't really i
mean
so she didn't choose me so it's an
involuntary relationship
for for children and to me you have to
have the very highest standards
when you have the least voluntary
relationship and so
when i put that argument forward um
well some people seem to get quite upset
and
it has always been you know from a
logical standpoint it's completely
baffling from a sort of personal
standpoint
i can understand why so on the logical
front it makes sense because you would
just remove bad influences from your
life whether they're
part of your family or not your family
it's just that that
i think well i think talk to them first
yeah i mean you don't that's what you
don't understand
how far do you think you have to go
before you would cut out
something like a parent
i i know it's yeah no i mean i i have
this sort of rule
i don't tell people what to do in the
show because i mean not only would that
be
kind of megalomaniacal but also let's
say somebody just obeys you they haven't
learned anything right so
i wouldn't so to say to people what but
i would say that
it's hard to have a better relationship
in your life than your worst
relationship
and so if you have a very dysfunctional
relationship and there are certainly you
know people out there whose
parents were unfathomably evil towards
them you know like a
molestation rape violent abuse you know
massive neglect and so on right so
i think try and talk to people in your
life
but do not think that it's like physics
that you just have to have relationships
because i'm very big for free will very
big for choices
and i always have a kind of reflexive
pushback
against you have to you know well
it's your father's birthday you have to
call him it's like well he beat me up
every day if our child said do i
do why do i maybe i'll skip this well
because because people don't say well
you chose this man you have to stay
married to him even if he's drunkenly
beating you every night people said no i
mean and
and again that's a chosen relationship
so involuntary relationships
i think there's a higher standard so i
think it's important you sit down you
talk about
if you've had a difficult history with
your family or parents sit down and talk
about it with them and you know if they
want to go to therapy or if they want to
try and find ways to resolve it
so much the better what can be repaired
should be repaired but that's not up to
you in the end
in the end is part of the conflict there
that so many of us walk around not
really
dealing with issues in the first place
so i remember once years ago about 10
years ago
a good friend of mine was telling me
about his relationship with his dad
he said his dad was abusive and was
always drunk and that one night
he came home his dad came home drunk and
basically just beat the living hell out
of him and that he as a 12 year old
knew at that moment this guy is just you
know
a dirtbag and i'm gonna always treat him
as such
and in a bizarre way he had very clean
feelings about it because the the act of
being punched and beaten was so clean
yeah but i think a lot of people if you
don't get
hit there's all sorts of other abuse so
you walk around in this sort of half
truth phase you know i mean you can't
quite parse it out do you think that's
part of it that people don't
quite yeah people have good mental
adventure yeah you know that there's
very few people in the world that's like
well that person was evil
from dawn until desk they woke up they
were evil and there was never i mean
people always have good memories
even of bad people in their life and so
it definitely is complicated and if you
can use the good memories as a way of
hooking
the relationship to a better place
fantastic but
we were talking just a little bit before
about you know the sort of weinstein
scandal and all this kind of stuff and
just while we were talking that the
thought popped into my mind dave that
we look at hollywood and we say oh you
know these people
they seem to know or there's lots of
indications or lots of jokes or lots of
stuff where people said
oh we knew we knew and then people why
didn't they say something why didn't
they say something it's like well you
can
think that the only problem with that is
somewhere out in hollywood some are out
among the rich famous pretty people
who have massive talent more money and
it seems like decreasing
levels of ethics as every day goes
forward but what about people in your
own life do you know
for instance not you personally but do
your audience do you do you the audience
know
somebody who's mistreating a child do
you know a parent who is
and this can be neglect neglect is a
very very powerful form of abuse
that is very hard to um unpack in in
your mind
do you have suspicions you know do you
see parents you know screaming at their
children or spending their whole time on
the cell phone and not talking to them
and so on
is there something that you can do to
improve that to remind them and say you
know
your kids are only young once try and
engage them in a positive way
teach them how to be rational by being
rational to them and love them and be
positive to them
because it's not just out there in
hollywood where there's all this bad
stuff that people
aren't doing people most people if you
have any kind of extended social circle
extended family and so on most people
have something
in their life that they could stand up
for and say this needs to be better this
should be improved
yeah and i think that's one of the
fascinations that's going on with this
hollywood scandal is people are saying
they do say well what about all the
people who knew but didn't do anything
but i think most of us
and i care myself in this as well in
parts of my life i've looked in the
mirror and said
i know that something's not right and
i'm skating over it i'm kind of
you know sidestepping it i'm crossing my
fingers i'm
or maybe just withdrawing contact if
there's some difficult situation you see
between a parent and child or anyone
so i think we all have that
responsibility but i think it's kind of
erupting in our consciousness through
that very distant event that's easier to
talk about for a lot of people yeah what
do you make of
this whole situation i mean we're
watching it seems like the entire
industry is collapsing in front of us
i know you're not a major fan of what
hollywood has been putting out in the
type of moral preaching that these
people do and i i'm not either
i don't mind moral preaching from good
people well right yeah
these people do um so that i i would
assume at some level you're you're
enjoying watching it be exposed but we
briefly for a second before we started
taping we're talking about how
this now could bring its tentacles
everywhere where everyone is gonna look
back and go 20 years ago someone touched
my knee
me too you know like that and i don't
want to really focus on that part but
but we just don't we're sort of opening
a pandora's box here that yeah that is
kind of dangerous
but i think it's essential yeah i mean i
think this has to be done and this
absolutely i'm glad
to be clear i'm glad the monsters are
going down well but who knows who's who
knows who's a monster at the moment
right now it's dark
there are lots of eyes out there there
are tentacles flying around like i don't
know who's a good guy and who's i mean
okay clearly there's some people like
the weinsteins and so on it's like
you know that's some pretty nasty stuff
and i know he's got a bunch of
investigations into rape
i think in new york there's no statute
of limitations so they can go after that
but right now
i think we're kind of in the midst of a
hysteria and and that
is fairly common when these kinds of new
things come out
so when i was a kid this was child abuse
sorry this was um a wife abuse wife
abuse was the big thing
that was going on you know this was not
talked about you kind of
i had um a feminist advocate aaron pitzy
on the show a couple of years ago and
she was saying that she ran one of the
first shelters
for uh women who were being abused and a
lot of times the priests would come down
and say
sorry love you got to go back you made a
vow and and all of this
this was when i was a kid this was the
big thing that was coming out and then
it was child abuse that came out a
little bit later
now this kind of sexual harassment stuff
is um
something that is coming out and
because it's kind of a hysteria it means
you know there are some bad people who
are being exposed
there are people who are kind of on the
line who are going to take some real
hits to their
reputations and of course inevitably
there are going to be some good people
who are taken down
unjustly and the you know what we need
to do is have a conversation about all
of this
as a whole you know where there is this
power disparity whether it's this sexual
exploitation
and i i do believe and i made this case
before that that
there is a very very dark heart
somewhere in in hollywood you know the
stuff that corey feldman has talked
about the stuff that
elijah wood talked about the the
pedophilia and and all of this
there is some very very dark stuff in
there and the what do you think the
genesis of that is do you think it's
just
power and money and then
crazy morals lack of morals i mean what
is it about hollywood
although this could be happening in any
industry right now and we just so happen
to know that we've
you know we're hearing about it in in
the sports world um
we've heard about it in academia i just
did a show recently on how prevalent
this kind of abuse can be in government
schools
it is i think it's just something that
needs to come out
where it comes from in particular
