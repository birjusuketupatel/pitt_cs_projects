okay so we've talked about the family
and that's one of the things people find
controversial about you i think really
though the one that you didn't mention
is the race and iq stuff this is
something you you
dive into a lot and i think people think
that there is somehow
a racist element to it so i don't want
to put any words in your mouth so do you
want to make your basic argument around
race and iq
can you can you sort of no no no listen
i'll be very clear about this because
yeah it's like saying do you want to
make
your argument that the sun is the center
of the solar system it's like well it's
not a personal thing like
this is not an idea i have come up okay
so it's not your idea it's not like
my formulation like i've got some
beautiful mind set of like
uh charts and lines in my basement it's
like it's all about the price of
magnesium man you know i mean
so i'm glad you countered with that
because in a way my question
accidentally was almost a setup so yeah
so i'll take that i'm going to give a
very very brief history of of
what it is and for those who don't know
where the science is and i'm not a
scientist so you know people verify
all of this i've got a whole list of
interviews with subject matter experts
on on the show about this topic so
listen to the experts this is my
amateur summation just for those who
want to know so
the the us army for over 100 years
has been giving more or less iq tests to
people to figure out whether they're
sort of officer material or
you know grunt material so to speak and
what they noticed was
between blacks and whites and this
becomes this bichromatic nonsense
because
the the question of ethnicity and iq is
a whole layer cake
you know just very briefly that the very
top the ashkenazi jews it is the jews
that are the uh the wandering jews so to
speak the ashkenazi jews you're sitting
across from an ashkenazi too can you
feel the iq just i actually am trying to
hoover up some
some language skills from you uh i'll do
it later with a straw but i i've been
dumbing it down for you so i know
and i appreciate that you know you know
as a caucasian i really need to go slow
yeah i love
lots of subtitles hand puppets and
health as well so yeah ashkenazi jews as
you know and
the science is like 115 iq on average
but lower on spatial reasoning and
higher like
even higher than 115 iq on verbal stuff
right i mean
verbal acuity among ashkenazi jews is
through the roof and the highest
recorded that there is
some of how this fits with our general
experience i mean what we're talking
about
everybody kind of knows deep down it's
just that we don't have the scientific
language or the mathematical language to
describe it
and that's what we're trying to do so
you know there's not a lot of famous
jewish architects or engineers because
jews test an average
around the hundreds in in spatial
reasoning
but crazy high on verbal acuity verbal
reasoning so of course you would expect
among novelists among playwrights among
lawyers
where high verbal iq is very important
you're going to find a lot of ashkenazi
jews
and lo and behold you do so what that
means is that let's say ashkenazi jews
said 120 125 verbal iq
and there's a certain proportion of them
in the language field but it's not
anything to do with
judaism it's to do with iq and so what
that means is that
if you look at any group of people
wherein they're in that iq
they're going to be equally represented
or proportioned
and then under that you have i don't
know the word oriental has kind of come
out of favor which is kind of
annoying in a way because how do you
differentiate people from india people
from
east asians whatever the chinese
japanese and so on uh
10300 405 iq in general
very high on uh spatial reasoning which
is why you know
software engineers uh other kinds of
engineers you see that you know like
google has this like it's like 40
or something like that of their
engineers or not much more because after
this diversity thing goes through
they're going to just have to pick
everybody by
color and all that but but this is the
thing right so if you're looking at
east asians with very high spatial iq
they're going to be quote
over-represented in those engineering
fields and so on but
not because everyone who's got that iq
is up there there just happened to be
more of those right
you've got uh your run-of-the-mill
vanilla caucasians coming in
at 100. then 100 is just i don't know
it's just that the baseline they
recalibrate it from time to time and so
on
and then uh below i i did some of this
what kind of mestizos or or uh hispanics
sometimes called oh that's very
loosey-goosey
term and uh that's sort of 85 90
and so on and then you've got uh blacks
uh in
in north america particularly uh african
americans coming in at
85 and there's been some upper drift a
little bit
and then uh below that you start to get
uh sub-saharan blacks
70 there are pygmies at uh in the high
50s low 60s there are
um the indigenous people of australia
i think in the low 60s and some of these
numbers again i don't have them all
tattooed on my you know wrists or
anything but so there is this
range it is unbelievably heartbreaking
i mean just just i'm straight up about
all of this like this is one of the
most difficult facts
i've ever had to absorb in my life i
mean i've gone through a bunch of
iterations
as a thinker you know i was a christian
and and a socialist and and all i mean
i've gone through i'm gonna go through a
whole journey
but i found almost nothing harder to
absorb
than this question of differences in iq
between
groups and this goes back many many
decades uh this was talked about by
hernstein uh in murray of course in the
bell curve
in 94 and nobody's been able to overturn
that and their basic argument
is to say look blacks
make less money than ashkenazi jews
but if you normalize by iq they don't
and this is
again it's heartbreaking stuff and it is
so difficult
to absorb this into your daily thinking
because i'm just going to
well i just want to pause you for a
second because it's interesting you're
describing it as heartbreaking and
struggle because that's what i was going
to ask you is that
because you do talk about this stuff um
i was going to ask you are you troubled
by it because i don't know that i've
gotten that exactly
through your videos but i obviously
haven't seen everything you've done on
this so hearing you frame it in that way
is actually different than the
a bit of the impression i had of you on
this oh
do you know how much i would give
dave to to know that it was just racism
because that's a solvable problem and
and people have been working on trying
to solve the problem of racism
for hundreds of years i mean it is
i mean i wouldn't say i give my left arm
because i'm left-handed but i would give
a lot
to i would give so much for it to just
be racism
so if you look at criminality
right i mean as you know uh black males
are
you know young black males three to four
percent of the american population
responsible for more than 50
of the homicides you look at what goes
on in the south side chicago
it's horrible and yet in general
it is not if you normalize by iq
everybody who has an iq of 85 has
similar levels of criminality
whites in america have a certain
particular
level of homicide that's pretty low and
whites around the whole world have the
same level of homicide
whites in england whites in belgium
whites in america all have the same
level
of homicide and
the question of course is environment
versus
genetics i would love to have a clear
answer to that
um science is making its way forward but
it's such a volatile topic that a lot of
scientists
you know like would rather do anything
than delve into this particular topic
but uh
it is oh it's extraordinarily
heartbreaking and
it means to me that no amount of
screams of racism can be guaranteed to
solve the problem and i think isn't that
what we've seen that the consciousness
about race
and racism has gone up so enormously and
and good you know like this there was
definite
racism in the world but without this
central
fact and it is a fact at the moment even
if we say it's 100 environmental it's
still a fact at the moment
you know even if we say well but is
there evidence that it's genetic
this is i'm not a geneticist genetic in
what regard i mean if we took
the brain of a 25 year old black man in
the brain of a 25 year old white man
what is it that they're doing that
different sizes
yeah yeah and again this is dependent on
every ethnicity the higher iq in general
there's lots of exceptions and so on
there are different sizes there as
evidence that um
if you take a um
a white kid from a middle-class
household for whatever reason ends up
being raised by a black family the white
kids can end up about 100 iq
if you take the average black kid have
them raised by an upper-class
middleweight family or jewish family and
so on they're going to end up
at about 85. so it does not appear to be
strongly environmental i don't believe
that there's no environmental causes you
know i've done
lots of videos where i strongly urge the
black community to
to breastfeed longer to to not hit their
children to do things that
will give their kids the best shot at
having higher iqs because that's going
to make a huge amount of difference in
american society and this is something
that
people need to talk about more is
equality and black parenting the quality
of black parenting
around the world but you know where in
america the most could possibly be done
is still quite
low they hit their kids the most and uh
if that can be improved i mean who knows
what could change how far do you go down
the rabbit hole of where all that starts
you know what i mean that they that the
most black people in america their
ancestors were brought here as slaves
that they didn't have equality for many
hundreds of years all of this
and then end up in poorer neighborhoods
then they get stuck on the welfare
system and
of course we're painting with sort of
broad brushes here of course but that is
the environmental factor right
yes and i you know there's nobody who
says no no sane person who says
any human characteristic is 100 genetic
um but again and i would love to i mean
i'm
very keen on improving um particularly
childhoods that's where i think the big
thing is
but you know a couple hundred years ago
in europe uh people were like a foot
shorter than they are now
and that was not genetics that was
environment you know not enough vitamin
d not enough nutrition as a whole and
back breaking labor and starting
in childhood and so on and so even if we
were to say
it's 100 environmental these are the
issues that we have right now
so let's say that that i could have been
seven feet tall but i didn't get enough
food as a kid
okay so that was environmental but i'm
still not seven feet tall at the moment
maybe my kids it could be different and
so on but uh nobody knows
how to improve it at the moment that's
the challenge you know you get this head
start program
what do they pour 100 billion dollars
into trying to close the black white
achievement gap
and with no effect a few little bits at
the beginning and then
it all generally tends to fade away so
it is something that
it it's a very difficult unpleasant
challenging phenomenon when we have
different iqs and we haven't even talked
about male female which again is a whole
other
challenge to to sort of absorb and
understand but
you know and it's funny because the left
is always complaining about i'm neither
left nor right but the left is always
saying
anti-science people are anti-science and
so on this is science iq
is a very very good measure it's one of
the few metrics in the social sciences
that
is you know measurable empirical it's
predictable right i mean if there was
some if people's iq was wildly different
from where they ended up in life
then it would be less valid but it's
very close it's a very close correlation
to where people end up and nobody knows
how to change disparate iqs yeah well
one of the things that you do in your
videos that i really like
is you often offer your audience a
chance to educate you and you say
send me links send me you know some
information that might change my opinion
on this so i think what we'll do for
this episode is we're going to find a
couple articles about this we'll find
something on the brain size we'll find
something on
ashkenazi jews and all of this stuff and
we'll put it down below and hopefully we
can get some of the conversation going
on this
uh because i think it's just one of
those things that
i it wades everyone into dangerous
territory and especially these days when
when everyone's accused of racism
endlessly
even if you're trying to find answers to
hard questions and i think we actually
i think both of us know we can actually
learn a little something from our
audience so
when i watch you do these videos and i
just watched your syria video that you
did the other day
and you said to people something to the
effect of don't just give me your crazy
theory
like it's not a theory i want a link i
want i want a paper
and some science so and i've i've had
you know i've had the subject matter
experts
on my show the geneticists and and the
social scientists i've had people
who believe that it's almost exclusively
environmental on to make the case i've
had people who believe that there's some
genetic
strong genetic elements and so on so i
am
gosh i mean it would be you know if i
could there were very few theories
that would be absolutely fantastic for
me to find disproven you know because
i've got a lot invested in my belief
system as everyone does but
boy if somebody could come along with a
way to say it it can be solved through
this or this is the cause or whatever it
is right i mean that would be fantastic
but right now
the problem of course is and people say
to me a lot and and this came up in a
conversation i think between
sam harris and charles murray charles
murray was on his show talking about
this
well why do you even want to bring this
up you know isn't this going to fuel
racists and isn't this it's like well
first of all
it's an important fact and and we are
tortured as a society by group
differences i mean i think i think
that's fairly
i mean don't worry we endlessly talk
about groups well they are real
and they're tragic you know when you
look at the the average net income of
ashkenazi jews and you compare it to to
blacks
it's worlds apart and and it's
horrible because if it is just attitude
if it is just
racism that's horrible and needs to be
resolved on the other hand
if it is to some degree genetic or for
whatever reason
it is what it is like let's say that
there's a group of irish people didn't
get enough to eat and they've ended up
being four and a half feet tall well
they're not going to make it in the nba
now we can say well maybe they're kids
and so on but saying the nba is
prejudiced against
these short irish people for no reason
whatsoever would be crazy
i always thought the nba was prejudiced
against ashkenazi jews but
here we go although you know the history
of jews and basketball right
i know you guys got it going right yeah
what are you going to do
i mean that's what i'd rather be doing
for after the show
yeah um but but the other concern as
well and maybe this comes out of being a
parent and so on
and i did weigh you know i read the
bell curve way back in the day and i did
way before i mean i don't just
get up and do shows like hey man
inspiration striking
you know i mean i did sort of weigh the
pros and cons
the issue is that um if the
if the iq differences are significantly
genetic
it's a tragedy but it's no one's fault
i actually think that if you think let's
say that you think that that um
blacks are the exactly the same as
ashkenazi jews and the question is why
the blacks failing
relative to jews you could say
