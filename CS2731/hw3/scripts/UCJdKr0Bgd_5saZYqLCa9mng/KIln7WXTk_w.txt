all right we are on location
at the blaze studios here in dallas
texas
and i'm sitting across from mr blaze
glenn beck
aye sir how's it going my man good to
see you thank you for letting us do an
on location shoot i feel
not a problem i know you're here for
about 10 minutes and then you're
i think you're gonna probably be on the
moon and then a stop at the mars
and you know a little bit about
traveling a lot i do
yeah so i'm in between a thousand things
here uh great
yeah it's it's pretty cool uh i wanna
spend a lot of time talking about
this book here addicted to outrage um
but let's just
do everything so right now we're about
two and a half weeks away from this
midterm election
i suspect something completely bananas
over the next two and a half weeks i
mean you can already just see between
between the kavanaugh stuff that we've
been dealing with the general outrage
and all the things you're writing about
here so here we i just said this to a
group of friends the other day
i think at this point a spaceship
could appear okay and and hover over new
york city and
be like huh i mean i don't know what
would surprise me now
well we'd be arguing about the gender
pronouns of the aliens you know i know i
know
it's it's absolutely insane
how everything is everything is upside
down
everything is upside down do you think
do you think we're in a unique time
because that's one of the questions when
i'm out there with peterson often people
say okay it's you know everyone says
we're we've never been more partisan
and we're angrier than ever and all of
these things but does something about
this
seem unique yeah i i'm uh i'm a
glutton for history yes yes and uh it
we have been in perilous times before
i don't think we've hit the civil war uh
confrontations yet
but we are approaching it do you think
we really are because i do
because i'm actually worried about the
amount of people you see this on twitter
all the time people saying oh
civil war is coming you know like
there's like murmur about
what would be the most horrific possible
outcome of all of this
remind me to talk about the window
because i think we have a window right
now
but we have been uh we've been worse
i mean if you look at jefferson and
adams
you know adam's adams was called a
hermaphrodite
by jefferson jefferson jefferson
his campaign
called him a hermaphrodite adams said
back that
if you elect thomas jefferson there will
be
blood in the streets and the heads of
our
children and your daughters will be on
pikes
into every town so we've had rhetoric
like
this before ironically i'd be thrilled
to vote for either one of these guys
if that would be like i'll take either i
don't care heads on pikes that would be
fine but
but it all does go to just in the last
couple weeks you know there was this
hillary clinton line on cnn talking to
christiana christiane amanpour
about how we can't be civil because
these these people meaning the
conservatives or republicans
are so against our values i mean this is
dangerous stuff
here's the difference
we have been in these places before but
we knew our founding documents we
knew who we served or who our god was
and i don't know who our god is now i
mean is it money
is it fame is it anger i don't know what
our god is now
um we knew wait can you let me pause you
there for a sec so when you when you say
that about what the founders believed
now they were also saying separation of
church and state the whole time so
if you were just laying out what they
believed when you say
we knew who our god was um so
george washington they did believe in
the division of
church and state clearly i do too
yeah um that just means if you're an
atheist
you're an atheist we're friends we're
cool let's get along
but if you're a god person you do your
god thing you do your atheist thing
right
do we have what adam smith called moral
sentiment
in common yes capitalism
uh has lost the first volume of adam
smith
the second volume is wealth of nations
the first volume is moral sentiments
and that says look this is an invisible
hand
and the market is powerful and it will
create whatever you want
be careful what you ask for
make sure you are always tempering the
moral sentiment make sure that you're
good decent fair-minded people
we've lost that we're losing it i should
say
and i'm concerned and i
talk about this a bit in the book
i've seen this coming for almost two
decades
and i have been warning against it and
for the very first time i'm at the place
where i'm on the air now saying
this is the time this is the time that i
said would come
yeah and now is the time for you to
remember
who you are um and our outrage is
taking us away from it so as i've looked
at this
for so long i have i have
studied revolutions i have i've studied
giant
movements of chaos i i can tell you
about you know
uh the um i think it was the red
month uh in the 1930s like i can
show you what's happened but there are
three people
in four people in grand movements that
have
gotten it right there was abraham
lincoln
there was martin luther king there was
gandhi
then there's bonhoeffer bonhoeffer do
you know who dietrich bonhoeffer was i
don't think so okay
bonhoeffer lost okay bonhoeffer was
a um a
pastor i think lutheran in germany
he uh was on the air when the fuhrer
declared he was
fewer he was taken his broadcast was cut
and short because he was doing a
broadcast called the fuhrer principle
this is wrong don't go this way
he on kristallnacht the very next
morning he was shopping in those stores
those jewish
stores pacifist
he tried to turn the germans back and
say
stop it stop stop you're going the wrong
way
he couldn't do it he eventually escaped
from
germany was in new york not here very
long because he felt
guilty how can i leave my country when
it's in this much trouble
he went back he realized there's no
there's no reason to stop this guy
maybe violence is the answer he was
involved in
um one of the attempts to kill um hitler
he went to a concentration camp he died
he was executed like five days before
hitler died
here's the thing if you read his
writings
he's gandhi he's jesus he's martin
luther king he's he's he's got it
and i i've read him and read him and
read him how why did he fail
silence in the face of evil is evil
itself
not to stand is to stand he's got it
love one another don't stop playing the
organs so you can hear
the the train going to auschwitz okay
he failed because germans had already
gone over the cliff
they had because of world war one then
the treaty of versailles then the 1920s
they had already lost their
judeo-christian principles they had
lost their center remember if it wasn't
for
england gandhi would have failed
people think of gandhi as starving
himself to get the british to comply
no he starved himself to say
to his own people do not rise up in
anger
they were this close to losing
and he knew it he was appealing to the
sense of decency and
fairness of the british culture
so he knew the people because of their
judeo-christian worldview
would see this oppression and go that's
wrong
if we we have a window and it's closing
if we
give in to our anger our outrage and we
say
you know what i can't take it anymore
we will lose and that window of the
judeo-christian values will close
and then we're done yeah it's so
interesting because one of the themes
that keeps coming up as i'm on this tour
is people keep asking me about this how
much worse is it going to get before
there's some sort of reset
and all of these things and it's like
man i don't want
two months from now or four years from
now to look back at right before the
2018 elections and go boy weren't those
the good old days
because we've gone on on the train to
hell so do you think there's actually no
way to stop it at this point do you
think that no i think there is a way
behind it so
here's here's the scenarios that i'm
looking at
right now if i'm war gaming okay none of
these i know the prediction business
always works out so let's see where you
got here so
if you're wargaming yeah let's look at
the next election
what happens well the democrats probably
gonna win the house
okay they win the house you know they're
going to at least subpoena his tax
records
he's not going to give up tax records
that'll be brought to the supreme court
remember that marker number one that's
day number one day number two
they don't have any place they can go on
impeachment they have to impeach them
even if they don't have anything right
they've already said it they have to do
they have to do it
it'll be the senate that will throw
they'll throw it to the senate that's
where the trial happens
so impeachment just means we're taking
you to court okay
so that's day number two day number
three
uh trump has already filed with the
supreme court saying i'm not
i'm not testifying i'm not turning over
my tax records
i'm not doing this okay well kavanaugh
has already said
he's already seen that that's a
distraction the president shouldn't have
to so
day number three when trump has brought
it to the supreme court
then the house says wait a minute
kavanaugh should
recuse himself we're looking at a year
yeah where uh the three branches of
government
the administration plus the house
and the senate both of them will be
fighting with each other
they'll be fighting with this branch and
they'll be fighting with the supreme
court
when kavanaugh doesn't recuse himself
they will file
articles of impeachment for him and
they're they're leading all of these
ideas already i mean these ideas are
trickling out
this is gonna happen yeah so now you
have the press
the fourth branch already in chaos has
has absolutely no credibility at all
it's deranged and that pushes
what you would call the fifth branch or
the first branch the people
into the streets how do you solve that
right so before we get to the streets
can i give you the one
option that i think maybe saves us from
all that which is that the republicans
win or at least hold in the midterms
thus
finally as long shot as this is finally
the democrats go
okay we've got to drop identity politics
we've got to get away from this
socialist democrat democrat socialist
nonsense there's no evidence that they
would ever look in the mirror if
anything they've only doubled down every
time
yeah but i see that as the only out to
where you're going
so i think if you have if they don't win
the house
if you win the house god forbid if they
win the house and the senate then it's
chaos
but if you win if they win the house the
democrats
that scenario is going to play out in
some form or another
so that just gets worse and worse or
worse i was talking to a friend of mine
just last night about this
and he said you know just exactly what
you said and i
followed it up with what you said show
me the i know there's no evidence
i am spartacus is all of a sudden going
to say
okay i'm not spartacus yeah you know i'm
the
carpenter from you know from nazareth no
wasn't that the danger all along and
this this is directly linked to your
book i mean i remember before the
election i kept saying
and this is when i still considered
myself on the left and and someone that
had basically only voted democrat my
entire life i think the one time i voted
republican was
uh bloomberg's third term in new york
city after he had flipped
like 87 times over something i'm not
even sure if he was republican at that
point
um but that i kept saying before the
election
if you keep calling trump hitler
then no matter what he does and no
matter what reality is
you'll never be able to get yourself out
of that little thing place you've
painted yourself and that's where we are
so you know what's crazy i lived this
i lived this i said
i'm the guy who got in so much trouble
saying i think barack obama may be a
racist
now i immediately corrected it in that
on the spot and said that's not quite
right i now understand i explain it in
the book
i now understand how to express that
i wasn't up on anti-colonialism i
certainly wasn't up on post-modernism
so i'm hearing all these terms that mean
nothing to me
and yet they're always attacking groups
to me and to a lot of people in the
country that's the definition of racism
yeah okay
but i didn't understand the difference
the other part other part of it okay
it's now
social justice okay well social justice
seems wrong to me
that's how i defined it then that was so
divisive
when i said that and i was really at the
time struggling to figure out what is
happening how
who is this guy um and i
got more and more strident uh
and didn't make a lot of friends on the
left
okay yeah it didn't work
it didn't work my base got stronger
my base learned things but my base also
as things went on got more and more
angry as did i
why isn't this working well because you
cannot call
people names and expect them to come
over
we have i just saw a new poll today that
shows
i think it's eight percent of the
american public eight thousand people
interviewed
eight percent of the american public is
the die-hard progressive
radical okay um
the uh the never give up
conservative traditional conservative
is about 29 okay they're both
on the edges 27 29 somewhere in that
area
still on the edges the vast majority
is now being called the exhausted class
and it's the class of people and i'm in
this
guys it doesn't have to be this way i
don't i'm tired of this
i don't i not everybody is a racist not
everybody is a homophobe
stop it stop it the kavanaugh jordan
peterson
got into trouble and i i tweeted he did
tweeted back to him
i think this might be the first time i
disagree but i put i think
because well for people that didn't see
it basically he said
that what would probably be best and he
did this in a tweet which is never the
best way to do it
and he's already he's already had his
media on that and released a correct
nut correction a clarification in a blog
form
uh but basically he said the best
outcome would be that kavanaugh gets
confirmed but then steps down
and what he meant was that wasn't saying
that kavanaugh did do anything or didn't
do anything but if there's any chance
for a little bit of healing
where everyone gets a little egg on
their face but also gets a little bit of
dignity to walk away with
and the country doesn't come apart at
the seams that was what he tried to do
right in a tweet and
in his blog post he's acknowledged that
trying to do that in a tweet
probably not the best thing trying to do
that in a tweet
um where the people who are reading it
are generally
all about politics and tearing each
other apart yeah bad idea that's why i
put
i think because knowing jordan
the little that i do he's a deep
philosophical thinker so my
my feeling was and it turns out it was
right that he's looking at that and
saying
okay in in a normal world in a good
world where we're all really trying to
do the right thing
and if we really were all trying to do
the right thing i agree with him
it would have been the best thing to
have
