let's
let's let's go over this here so this
happened in new york
um this weekend we have talked about
gavin mcginnis
in the past he is uh no longer on
twitter i think he's uh
i don't even know if he's on youtube
he's on the cr tv and they advertise on
our
in front of no i have um
i have said publicly that i would debate
gavin to the extent that he's really i
don't know what i would debate
him on but i'll debate him on anything
um
he's more of a um
like a a merry racist pranker prankster
right like uh back in the day
and look i think i mean having known
gavin
you know and i just i would run into him
occasionally socially i don't think it
was more than a half a dozen times but i
have
we have mutual friends he was always
sort of like one of those
cantankerous contrarian types who was
sort of like
um a little i don't know if you i would
call him like
actively racist but i mean as far as i
remember
um i was living it was around the time
when i was living
full-time up in uh upstate and he had a
place
uh um in near the catskills too and he
would just
uh drag on those people big time
um and the locals yeah he was a troll
yeah he was a bit of a troll and and
then of course
he got pushed out of vice uh because he
was just too
difficult to work with too obnoxious and
uh maybe the wink
link in that organization nevertheless
they paid him a decent amount of money i
mean i think it was you know
a couple million at least but
when all your buddies your two or three
your buddies
who you started with go on to make
billions
or hundreds of millions i i guess
it can eat at you and you're like what
can i do to be relevant and
so i would hear stories of him going on
like fox news shows and having a drink
before he goes on
so that he gets the courage to do what
he's doing um and to go on i mean i
would hear all these stories
before that though he started another
website that was like a vice
knockoff that did not do well yeah i
can't even remember the name of that
it's called uh it was street boners and
tv carnage and you shortened it to
street carnage
let me say i have never heard of that i
am in any way
but that did not do well that didn't
really well he tried to take the do's
and don'ts from vice which he invented
but he didn't own it anymore so he had
to call them street boners
i see well it was not good that means it
did not succeed
you know sometimes it's very hard to
replicate success when you've been super
lucky the first time like you know when
it was just i mean it's hard to do that
i i mean i'm not i'm not being facetious
lightning doesn't strike too much it's a
difficult second album
he failed in trying to recreate what
maybe he didn't really create in the
first place
like bases later work right side exactly
i mean i don't know but nevertheless
faced with
uh not catching on at fox and then not
catching on at
you know his own youtube show oh don't
forget he got fired from his own
branding firm for being transphobic
i mean so he's had a lot of problems i'm
not saying you should be sympathetic
i'm just trying to explain this is how
someone spirals down
into trying to provide for his family
by being a professional racist
i mean that's that's basically what he
always hated women that was very clear
and it was clear in the early culture of
vice which is something that
i got to deal with when i was younger
but uh
yeah he his racism seemed slightly more
like ironic just trolling for the lulls
but no like he
he's a full-on race right and this is i
mean it's it's a fascinating case study
to watch someone
who you know he uh lost all his friends
that were
um that were were famous that i think
gave him
may i recommend going into our youtube
archives
and checking out the fu forever video
for some deeper texture on that
that was unintentionally the funniest
thing that gavin's ever been involved
with that i know of
but i think like you know at that point
he had nowhere to turn and so he just
decided i'm gonna go
all in with this stuff and that's
basically what happens
and so just to juxtapose this weekend
fox and friends this morning this is
what they had to say
about um the violence on the streets of
new york city all on tape
incidentally this weekend this is what
um
no no this is what this is what the fox
and friends
folks decided to focus on this is what's
got
uh killmead uh got his um
got himself in a complete frenzy about
but how unbelievable is it that the
people that this
that the democratic new hampshire
fundraising arm
thought that that alec baldwin or a big
name would have the right message
do you think that's the right message
for democrats to overthrow the
government
i really wonder if uh alex um
or i mean that if alec baldwin was
actually calling for an
actual overthrow of the government i
have the full quote here
the way we implement change in america
is through elections baldwin said sunday
night according to the news agency
we have governments here at home and in
an orderly and formal
uh or we change governments here at home
in an orderly and formal way
and in that orderly and formal way and
lawful way we need to overthrow the
government
of the united states under president
trump is that oh my god
oh my god or a power phrase now
apparently that's part of the sierra
master
apparently uh fox and friends did not
have instagram
because if they had they would have seen
how how
gavin mcginnis was advertising
his party that he was having essentially
at the republican metropolitan club
the republican party had invited him to
the metropolitan club
to hold a um a reproduction
of the 1960 assassination
of the head of the japanese socialist
party
with a samurai sword uh
i think this guy was was killed by a
fascist yep killed by fascist on tv
uh on tv in japan in 1960
you'll recall 1960 not that far
from world war ii uh
where you had a fascistic um
uh japanese government uh you know 15
years
not that far and so you could say this
entire event at the metropolitan
republican club in manhattan
was glorifying violence against leftists
yes
and uh just to um to put a fine note on
it
gavin of course wears like a slanty eyed
glasses
uh because he's portraying a japanese
guy for freedom of speech
right for freedom speech and uh he uh
he brought a sword there this comes into
play in some of the footage that we see
so here is uh and just to give you a
sense of of gavin
you know like look sometimes what
happens is you start a marketing thing
and then all of a sudden at one point
you realize like i gotta deliver on this
otherwise i am not going to make any
money
and like i say gavin doesn't
have really any skill set
uh it's one thing to come up with
listicles
and if you get lucky maybe it turns into
uh you know something that
that's a success but he really doesn't
have any skill set and and look
i i can i if i couldn't do this and make
money at it
i don't know what i would do i i don't i
definitely don't think i would become a
professional racist
but i'm saying it would be complicated
and and sometimes do woodworking
right maybe i do no i don't know about
that but i like that i don't know i'd
become a professional racist
but it would be complicated it would be
complicated i'm just saying for someone
like gavin like i've talked to him he's
he may not have like all the resources
that other people have
let's say i'm talking intellectually
intellectually
and so you know you default to the easy
choice
so for years he's been pretending like
he's a tough guy
right and um and so like you can go back
to
there's a compilation this one starts i
think back in 2015.
what is more annoying can't we just
fight
in my day the nazi skinheads would come
up to your show
beat up everyone and leave you'd still
have a great night
it was only 10 minutes let's just fight
and get it over with you can even win
i'll i'll let you win just shut up
you know uh pause it don't for one
second i will say like i don't know what
he means by his day
he's like talking like he's a 75 year
old man and he's not
uh but you know i guess maybe if you
drink too much it ages you quickly here
he is uh doing a show he's got a beer
here good
and i are armed to the hilt we
are ready and when we hear a noise at
night we think of all the people who
published our address
and put it up on social media and we
think of where our guns are
and we get ready to blow someone's
 head off
uh i've even killed people in my dreams
that's how awesome my gun is
i've had dreams or someone broke in i
went and got my shotgun
and killed them and then i woke up and i
went jesus these are handy
not only they protect you in reality
they protect you in
freddyland if freddy showed up and tried
to kill me i would go
sorry claws say goodbye to your shitty
old garage sale sweater
we were a better society positive for
one
this is this is this is what happens
like you got
you get these fantasies like if you see
that um
uh that movie was a doctor death by uh
uh errol morris aaron morris about the
guy who who just sort of like somehow
became
a darling of of uh holocaust deniers
because he was involved in like um
providing the gas for i think for
executions and he was sort of a loser
and um and and suddenly he found a
community
and even if he didn't necessarily
subscribe i mean on some level there's a
quality of the desperation that i think
see here this is where gavin mcguinness
is uh interviewing
uh chuck c roberts or charlie chuck
johnson who i think she's also been
kicked off
yeah you never hear this guy anymore
better society
when we when we beat the out of
each other weren't we i
i think it's amazing like how many
people under 30
have never been into physical fight like
ever
it's the trouble with the entire right
wing there's too many of them who have
never been in a fight
yeah and i think i think this is
something that canada canada
hasn't succumbed to yet or maybe if it
has
i mean i certainly think that like
they're you know about to go to
australia and new zealand with my wife
and the aussies and you know new
zealanders i don't know
the people from new zealand that i know
kiwis kiwis yeah they're all kind of
badasses
like they you know they're physically
fit they you know they go hiking and
you know they occasionally throw down if
they get drunk i mean when was the last
time you like actually saw like a legit
bar fight right it's probably been a few
years yeah it hasn't been
a very long it's been a couple years and
and then this is in new york city where
they should be happening every five
minutes
i think there's not enough those both
those guys are
horribly out of shape i mean i know you
know like talk about not bad asses but
here is uh gab mcginnis again
again like he's afraid of going on air
without drinking so that's why he's half
in the bag in most of these things
i think there's not enough violence in
today's day and age
when we grew up i was talking about this
on facebook with old buddies from my
hometown violence was everywhere i want
violence i want punching in the face
i'm disappointed in trump supporters for
not punching enough
i think we only have a four or five
punch yes uh he grew up in canada he's
probably thinking of a couple of like
hockey games or something like yeah i
wonder if he can we could be deported
him
i mean that was a dave rubin
today's time our current time like this
guy really does
fight though he probably has a fight
coach because he's a rich person but
like
there have been plenty of videos where
he's like fighting some anti-fog eye and
actually does pretty well here is a
video
from left kissed uh this is outside
the uh new york city uh republican
metropolitan club block or so way
and uh you can see what happens there
were people who
may have been engaging in a protest it's
unclear
but they were walking away you uh jamie
you know who these people are
they're friends of a friend they were
walking away from the protest when the
proud boys found them
and so this a crowd of 30 guys um
wilding gangs i guess we are supposed to
call them
right yeah um uh chase them down
and you can hear them uh yelling things
like and
um uh as they're kicking this guy as
they're
as they're down so here's here's that
video um
a warning it's not uh it is it is
violent so
uh here it is
come on guys
[Applause]
oh
let's go
so uh the proud boys uh yeah let's go uh
as the cops come in and don't do
anything
at all to these um
assailants no gavin was waving a sword
around
in the street right in front of the cops
they didn't do
so okay so um
the the cops don't do anything at this
point now subsequent to this
uh there was enough video that was put
online
and even one of the proud boys i guess
posted video it tried to take it down
and people
found it before he was able to take it
down a little bit too proud
a little too proud and the video is up
there and a lot of these guys hopefully
will be identified
now that there's pressure from the cops
uh to the cops
but um according to uh gavin he
supposedly has friends on the uh police
force
i i would imagine they're not actual
friends
uh they're fans uh more than actual
friends i don't you know people hang out
with gavin for a while and they don't
tend to be friends for him for very long
but i imagine they appreciate the uh the
white supremacy
and the violence but here is fox
looking at what what happened here you
saw the
the protesters three of them getting
beat up by about 30 proud boys
here's fox's take on what happened the
far left group
antifa strikes again this time at a
republican office in manhattan and the
group says
it's just the beginning trace gallagher
is tracking that for us tonight
trace pause it there is a clip there
of a man holding a sword up ahead as
she says this that is the video
underneath what she's saying in split
screen
new york city man with a sword
standing up waving it that is gavin
mcginnis
the leader of the proud boys this is the
way
you do propaganda i mean the
remember we talked about the other day
about bolsonaros
and they were talking about the protests
that took place
against whatsapp pictures and they put
out
fake pictures of a real protest
that made uh the protesters look like
they were some type of like radical
marginal group of people
this is the exact same thing right
there's no one
at fox who doesn't know who gavin
mcginnis is
the guy's been on the network dozens of
times
he might have even earned himself a band
even at fox
and regardless he's known they know who
he is
and so they're talking about antifa
vandalizing
um republicans earlier in the day
earlier in the day
and they have a picture of gavin
mcginnis at night waving
his sword around continue grace
shannon it was around 1 30 in the
morning when the anti-fascist or antifa
members allegedly vandalized the new
york republican headquarters
that is not true that is not true
continue city windows were broken doors
spray painted
glue put in locks and handles and a
