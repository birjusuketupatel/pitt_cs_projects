ready what's up everybody I'm in my new
gamer outfit up hold on my collar I
think is still sticking up but actually
this is a nice jacket drank my first
redbull ever so I think I'm ready I'm
just tweeting it out
Wolfenstein happening now you
 I'm just kidding
not gonna tweet out I'm gonna say you
 so Matt and I did some
training one of the things we did during
the training that maybe wasn't an
amazing idea is we got a little lit so I
was a little impaired because Matt and I
got into some very abstract
conversations so I don't know how on the
ball we were in for my training session
do you have a Red Bull - no actually
back oh this is the campus oh damn it
all right so your can is my problem yeah
all right so we're gonna get started now
Matt who is of course the professional
he's gonna start first and what level
are we gonna play we're going to do my
favorite one it's called monster this is
the courthouse one it's it's an ax
courthouse you know one of my problems
with first-person shooters is that
they're often kind of drab in their
environments right this is one where
it's not it's it takes place in a
courthouse in Nazi America this is
post-war this is like the premise of
Wolfenstein is that we're in Nazi
America in the future yeah and we're
trying to kill Nazis and the main
character that you control has been
captured and this is supposed to what
happens in this courtroom so we're gonna
see so much I mean I love this game I'm
surprised but it would be so much cooler
these were all just like Spencer in
Mianus
pump up the volume be great sure
[Music]
the mission
I like I like this simplistic
I like that it's just about taking
everybody out well at a higher
difficulty level you you get into Bates
and that's good get into Bates they be
like hey we're in a we're in a
courthouse why don't we why don't we
talk about oh really why don't you know
I have a question for you why don't you
ever focus on shooting their kneecaps
like I do I think that's something for
the more advanced players I just try to
make contact get a headshot here there
but if you want to shoot for the limbs
of microphones
I'm totally changed that's like the only
thing right I hope I can remember the
 sequence from the crash yeah I
don't know if you're gonna remember much
from yesterday
hell no I kidding so I'm gonna look you
here that will get Michael
be kind I've been making fun of gamers
for years yeah a good jack yes myself
seems like Michael try to navigate a
hallway watching me play this game is
gonna be like Warhol's movie sleep you
know that you know I haven't film well
it literally just film somebody sleeping
several hours
watching me like try to turn on a
hallway walk around yeah they feel like
oh my god he uncrowded itself the
uncrowned what he actually threw a
grenade right in front of the way does
that hurt you you can use self wounds
and you can sell food no it was funny
yesterday Michael was today Michael was
having trouble he's like five guys
and I said I might I started this ended
I might have might have approached this
approach it not being surrounded by a
bunch of guys it's Swiss cheesy
you up for both direction
you saying that Michael threw a grenade
like just right at the wall
I mean Matt you just put it on a clinic
here I've played this level of lots of
what heart love what I don't think I'm
on a very high difficulty now I think I
didn't get much more trouble you ever
get to a point where you like when you
picture Sam German Shepherds it needs
not these guys maybe they like cannot
see
antic bar but Omega God put the is
2008 you're going to be 5000 is gonna be
like 5,000 I'm gonna do it by I'll do a
music video for that yeah 5,000 food
yeah 5,000 we've seen in school so
whatever 10,000 is really super play
over the top as well I want mm something
as you can see lek very skilled
I did I think it was funny as terrible
there was I did start to like get there
I mean it's not obviously doodles
exercise you know but I totally
understood like the difference because I
go and I'm like oh I'm drained I'm shot
whatever let me just watch something
like watch a movie yeah which I like but
this doesn't matter it's a lot yeah and
not a narrow because line and our brains
don't work that way every time watching
something including from rose by I'm
like you know texting people reading
articles
so I just end up basically doing all the
other that I sort of wanted you
know I accept but I mean this is my
audiobooks or pods
I don't I have the headphones on and
listen to the audio but really you don't
need much sound for the game like this I
mean you can kinda use it to you know
see if someone's sneaking up behind you
but or you can down
would it be cool in God that's the part
I like would it be cool set whatever
podcast or this thing - straight out of
like it would think it walking you an
option
I could it could sync up with your game
system and it could say you're listening
to Marc Maron's podcast
and you could just like if dude up like
whoever you're listing it you're
listening the Michael Brooks show you
listening to Sam cedar in the single
positive Americans in your chapo now and
you could just shoot all of us how do
you give me a really good reason to
listen to us steven crowder right
exactly and then and then like anytime
you did it and then like magic ben
shapiro ad hominem this is amazing dude
so what happens here though like what
what happens when you win what I mean
close your ears if you don't want to
spoiler any gamers who want to play this
but Heather there's gonna be spoilers
here basically what happens here is you
realize this whole sequence was a dream
oh yeah but you know what that's
how you include really fun unrealistic
stuff in games so are you ready to do
this I'm ready to do this well I mean of
course I'm not super ready yeah
[Laughter]
alright we're going to do the same level
underground bunker in New Orleans yeah
alright this is the wall around New
Orleans or maybe it's a levee hopefully
if yes but how should you I am gonna
load it up for you and I'll give you
okay cool controller here fair enough a
stream looks like it's fine yeah it's
nice it's really ghost riding the stream
right yes there's nobody in the producer
Jim that's cool doing a lot you know for
the gamer community yeah I never want
any more complaints from the gamer
community
yeah Red Bull if I had time if I
honestly if I wasn't moving this weekend
had so much other stuff going on I was I
was considered I was gonna try to get a
trench coat but it was
matrix shades all right so uh all right
the this is about to happen folks let me
just say that this is gonna be very very
rudimentary oh my god Joshua Olsen at
hyper gamer at hyper gamer to says is
that a game idea request Michael do I
really need to design this now a game
that knows what podcasts you're what
listening to Matlock can make games I
got some ideas
yeah we've got we've got many ideas I
just heard through the grapevine David
Slavitt close put me in a good mood they
apparently uh our buddy Jimmy is on
Rogen right now great great really good
for the left Brogan should be
talking to me said I'm playing
Wolfenstein that's how we lose Rogen
 yeah I mean he should have someone
from the majority report on tonight at
this point you'd have everybody you
should have three of us on should have
the four honestly have on the whole
 lineup no I mean to press my
cousin yeah why not press my car all
right all right so now
just hold on guys I'm gonna get a little
situated now if you hold down the top
right bumper Michael oh oh you
 now well now just run in
gun all right now I'm just a pure
suicide bomber mode for this Oh what
yeah I'm definitely like the first guy
you sent out well this is like almost
like a distraction like yes that might
be worried somebody yeah there's
somebody else here who knows what
they're doing like Matt's around the
corner yeah how's that there's a guy on
the corner nope
[Music]
that you just dropped
add the shit-talking down
it is very easy there's certain video
games not this one so much but
particularly multiplayer it's very easy
to square yeah I want to just give a
warning a warning non woke language
during the video game playing I just
want to be clear about that yeah because
if there's been times where I've been
playing a game especially when I listen
to audio book or F headphones on well
just you know somebody behind me you
know the real truth of matter is that my
parents are antsy technology hippies and
I never had access to these things I
mean I got I played I beat Mario
Brothers when I was in the hospital when
I was a kid and I broke my femur bone
and that was basically the only time
that I got to play video games it's like
six straight weeks
I don't remember though uh oh wait this
is pause how do i press pause with me
that was at a harder level now no it's
fine
oh okay all right fair enough
I want to have some stealth everybody
which means that I want to get shot like
fifty times what we decided like
the background story of my character is
that he's he's he's like release he's
incredibly strong terrible shooting like
zero brains in his head like the plague
are like you can shoot like my head like
literally like an empty utter just
like fat deposits but his butt is like a
sadist yeah I gotta get into because I
was shooting people's like kneecaps and
feet yeah yesterday it was great I was
doing like Goodfellas I was like hey
spider come here you son of a
wonder what rogue in the door yeah
okay yeah let's do that
I wonder if I wonder what Rogan and uh
oh you oh nice you just killed me you
just committed suicide you bastard I'm
supposed to do that yeah
who's influencing who uh I wonder what
Rogan indoor talking about now there's
like yeah man it's like a lot of people
who like their like their ideological
lane I know that's like because I said I
said that with the Democrats so
I'm gonna vote for Hillary
meanwhile hey there aren't they're out
there they're part of a club
that you're not a part of oh but do you
think like we gotta be mad about that
Club I don't know I just think a green
new deal is good sure sounds
good bro
I think I'm doing a respectable
presentation of the Rogan the
lincoln-douglas debate yeah I mean I
don't know I think I know Rogan is uh
talked about a lot of things I just
don't know no door can't look Jimmy's a
nice dude who actually has like a lot of
super interesting stories
I mean I just doubt he'll be making a
great case for the left all right now
you can shoot guys a bit farther away
with this guy okay but I don't want to
shoot yet I think it was yeah you want
to do it yes yes sneaked up on our own
you ever lose hair on a man so maybe a
little bit further back this time no I'm
gonna still try to stab this guy I think
what do we what do you do for stabbing
again
right joystick down guys there's a
little bit of foreshadowing here but I
commander is about to show up what are
we trying to do
oh I popped it out that doesn't sound
good at all dude no yeah I think we
might have to go without sound guys whoa
oh now you're my bro
all right I killed the commander
[Music]
why am I going so slow how do i uncrown
the red button
 yeah kneecap shot he kept
shot see I don't die I'm like an idiot
I'm like a beast of burden
yup oh
so how do I get out of there it's not
letting me run you're stuck on the wall
oh you sticking me on the
wall you alright
yeah and you need he knew what happened
his knee the shoot the
 neat yeah I get that
cursor right on god damn it what the
 man this is too specific ah so you
really you actually wouldn't go on Rogan
me personally yeah uh not right now no I
just I'd feel like this position can
probably be a better plate by somebody
more prepared right now I mean I would I
mean personally I'd be be fun from my
ego state
I could certainly ayahuasca Elvis oh
yeah I would do acid with children no I
mean like talk ayahuasca all right am I
crouched again yeah you you start
crouched here oh you start crouched
alright there you go
standing up tall like Jordan Peterson
won't ya shoulders back there's a thing
to do you gotta kill futuristic Nazis
wait for the commander wait for the
commander but but maybe they wouldn't be
to be futuristic Nazis if you didn't of
gender pronouns that's winning it create
Nazi robots because grazie
yeah that's the background to this as
FDR during World War Two said we need to
do we need to like stand up for
transgender rights the Nazis won because
we need to respect gender pronouns
whether it's Zed or Fred or bad and then
people are just like that
respecting people's gender pronouns I'd
rather not see let's invite the Germans
over fat you know might cares out of you
but these profound force you to use any
a key gender pronouns should IOA its
press straight down yeah but I'd point
out where he's gonna be there you see
that cursor you kind of want that up a
little bit right here right hey mother
 hey what's up oh this is
bad am i crouched again nope you're up
yeah go on
first death
but some solid hey how come you're still
alive
something behind me no you should be
good behind you a couple of yeah oh
go get in there and to the right
yeah and
Brian kill the commander that pisses me
off yeah no he got away just like that
Borman
yup he'd get away too like Argentina I
think so yeah that guy now is running a
drug cartel Argentina actually you
kidding me the Nazi commander gotta take
a kill probably rent like the CIA is
like definitely the origins the drone
program go back to that guy that I just
didn't kill all right where are you let
me very validating if it turned out that
every bad thing about American Empire
since World War two has been the Nazis
that we brought over for like Operation
Paperclip
I mean very tidy I buy it they're just
pretend that that's the case
oh yeah it was a Nazi program was the
Nazis everyone else was like and it's
like so though Oh get the out of
here you thank you
you can get walk up to that gun there
and hit a walk on to the right look oh
there's that commander
where's ya you shooting pistols look
straight ahead of you
the commander's way down the hall where
you just came thing you shootin
[Music]
we'll be hiding around one of these that
Oh mine let's do this
there yeah thanks there's somebody oh
this best thing about this is like
the robots just saw cuz they've moved a
bit differently their business end of an
enemy but if it's a Nazi robot that's
way less satisfied and like a Nazi real
yeah I want to kill Nazis yeah like it's
a which is what I you know go outside
gonna work out
now I like this really killing one yeah
this is maybe your best yeah you're
gonna want to kill some guys
you're way downstairs I got upstairs ah
all right all right you blended one more
yeah you play the next one that one more
for me and then I you know show prep
like dork oh we may do some more
of this yeah yeah we might we might it's
certainly going to become my next I'll
set the difficulty a bit higher no Mon
 is real man Gabe are you not
entertained are you not entertained
Gorka actually might be fun to play
video games with gorg like imagine
really upsetting Gorka I'm like God dumb
Jobs worth too much lag on my my wife's
hope need to leave to pretend that I was
working for my allowance
this thing is silence this little pistol
here oh I like that
it's the toxic advantage I like the idea
of a silencer actually it's a suppressor
Michael doesn't that still know that the
sounds alarm just hearing him scream no
Wow not to scream these guys are such
idiots
yeah like I mean like my character is
pretty stupid but these guys are like
not-so-bright doing some business before
you take out the commander yeah well I
actually still killed him what you know
what I had a respectable run the last
round that wasn't bad yeah yeah that was
definitely the best before so that is so
great I love the German but it's strange
the bot assassin eyes what is it is that
danger
oh my god it's one ones who respect
gender pronouns Southie alarm who's the
real not supposed to be a Nazi I'm just
interested in the free exchange forty
years
oh dude idea shopping yes
nice
I also love how like infantilizing I
can't even keep up commentary so cool oh
look at the look at Cimarron oh wow
look at the he is surrounded by
everyone
[Music]
oh
do another run I don't really you set
that pretty yard mid difficulty it's a
bit tough to get you see that when you
used to just running and gunning and
then like I like running and gunning so
so when you when you like have a tough
round like that do you think that the
real gamers in the audience are judging
you you know I am pretty unconcerned
about that yeah I mean even though this
is a whole wall of branch that community
I'm gonna maintain totally Dawkins I
don't I don't game socially a lot and
yeah I like this is mainly gaming to me
is a solitary experience like almost to
the point where like I resent anyone
else like joining me this
excuse me Matt well I mean this is a
different case no I understand no I know
I actually I played enough to think that
if I was a gamer I would be a self
everyone as well yeah like there's no I
I never really liked with my friends
because like hey it went on every kid
thing became online game and like the
multiplayer and I just I liked the
single-player experience no I get it
no I like that actually sounds
and also because you're listening to a
