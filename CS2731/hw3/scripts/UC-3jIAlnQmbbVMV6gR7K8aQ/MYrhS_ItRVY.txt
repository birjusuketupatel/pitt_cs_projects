I am so glad we're gonna have one more
opportunity to talk to our next guest in
this year who has made it really frankly
Judy gold I feel like I don't know you
have been such a big part of why I feel
like I'm still standing just in being
able to deal with this stuff because how
much you know you for me because I get
to text you and going on end you
know mystery I mean I just knowing that
I'm not crazy I mean I am crazy but not
you know that kind of crazy knowing that

be bothered by that no she's no in fact
we have yeah we have a clip I'm glad you
said that because here she's going to
explain that about Donald Trump we think
he might be racist he's not racist
he's racial no he's very short yeah I'm
gonna let amorosa it explain it to you
okay okay racial but he is not a racist
the things that he says the the types of
pushback that he gives involved people
of color these are racial exchanges yes
I will acknowledge many of the exchanges
particularly in the last six months
hold on pause it for one second so you
see what you said that he pushes back
against black people and so it's it's
racial it's a racial rights change
because it's white and they're black but
it's not racist
hey you low IQ athlete let me get racial
with you right I'm sorry I just you know
I'm a Mealing right now and my knee hurt
wait I got someone Omarosa can you help
me out sweetie
yeah he's racial not racist
here listen but in the past six months
things have gotten a little bit more
intense not not prior to but the last
six months here we go wait wait there's
my black good many of the exchanges
particularly in the last six months have
been racially charged do we then just
stop and label him as a racist no but
you have the president's not they were a
big crowd and there were bad hopes on
either side yeah and I know that I show
you absolutely yeah absolutely
Omarosa is really setting up her book
when's your book come out I don't know
but it's called Rachel that's what it's
called Rachel it's coming out according
to Robin Roberts you'll be making some
money
how much do you love Robin
Roberts which is she the one who said
it's a divide by Felicia yep and then
I'm Rosyth it wants to start a black
woman civil war over that sounds like
Judy's getting money so yeah
do you need a blanket honey okay makes
me feel good about this is that I'll
tell you what she thinks she's gonna go
out and make this and write this big
book that is gonna get and she's gonna
sell this book and when I look at Sean
Spicer who is now relegated to like
maybe picking up like a fox news
contributor ship which he definitely
thought when he left he thought oh I'm
gonna make a big I think she's going
where to I think like nobody Oh John no
one gives a about you
listen you thought he had so
much power and and that he was going to
help you with your constituents and get
all your policies done
he's a idiot and everyone knows
that you and your you're a idiot
for standing by him and no one's ever
going to forget it
you mother you thought you know
he has its base you go
yourself
look how did he I've been way
more like holding the Bible God hates me
Roy Jesus Christ hates your guts
he doesn't hate anyone but I'm pretty
sure he hates your guts
sorry hasn't it Roy more very very San
Francisco alright that's very San
Francisco how did you connect with
dominoes to Judy how did you get to know
her
well I immerse and I've been very close
to she's with her work with the UJA the
United Jewish appeal right and and the
anti-defamation league does she get some
editor not anti-semitic that's Semitic
oh no she's anti some some racial how
excited were you how excited where you
see Roy Moore lose well you know what it
was like the biggest Hanukkah
present president we were we're all
sitting there and you know it's like a
it looks like a bad just like watching
my son's basketball game you know and
it's like it's close and then it was you
know it gave me so much hope and it
makes me feel like you know what I
thought I didn't know this country and I
thought and it was sad I mean my anger
really comes from sadness right and I
was so heartbroken you know look we're
all activists you know and working for
the for equality and for you know human
rights and living with big
and empty you know and to think that
these who are like oh
my god evangelicals don't give a if
a 32 year old guy diddles a 14
year old and can't go to the mall then
you're you know it it was I was like oh
my god this can't happen again and it's
just it's unbelievable the way it's
building and building that you know what
you want you don't want black people to
vote after church you we're gonna
find a way to get them to the polls you
know and you know just I feel like the
only good he's doing is bringing us
together I want you know I have always
said that black women are the strongest
people we have I mean what the they
have to go through and the obstacles
they have to they have in front of them
you know look we can all complain about
being women but we're not African
American women we don't know what that's
like you know I don't know what that's
like I know what it's like to be a Jew
like yeah or as they call me you know a
 Dyke whatever they call me when I
was in the south anyway but I know what
it's like with it would you get when I
know itself oh my god I was on stage one
in the south and someone yelled the Jews
have all the money and I'm like why and
then the guy said that's not no no no
you why you making fun of your health
oh no he would say I get Jewish I
wouldn't say I'm auntie do is right I'm
getting Jews yeah you know that's that
we own the media we're judicial we own
the moral lawyers I mean what's going on
I mean they're not winning they're not
what and he today did you see his little
you know outside the plane yeah what
questions again like you're in a
mental patient he said how they he also
you know we played a couple of clips we
also said this according to CNN I don't
want to talk about pardons with Michael
Flynn yet we'll see what happens let's
see I can say this when you look at
what's going on the FBI and Justice
Department people are very very angry
he's he's he is retreating he's got a
macro today it's like that is he's
repeating it over and over again in
every context and I don't think this guy
this is not a guy who's you know a deep
deep thinker he may have some this is
more of like a tactic in it it always
feels like he is you know Gary Busey was
like this too like Gary Busey was like
you know I directed him and you had to
just lie to Gary Busey and give him a
lie that he could hang on right so that
you can get what you need it
and you know from yeah I the the I tell
this story a couple of times but on the
first day of shooting I'm with Busey we
were in Arizona I think it was on like
surrounded by these you know whatever
they the I can't remember what they call
them you know like their mountains but
they're like not there like hills but
the you know rock formations whatever it
is and other I come up and Gary's I
can't we can't we can't shoot here we
hit you here this place isn't right and
I just I just know much I just said to
Gary's
well you know this used to be an organic
garlic field because of the the power
that was coming from one of those things
I think there's some word that people
were throwing around out there the and
and that's why this is the only place
you can grow organic garlic for 300
miles from here and hit and it was a
total it was nonsense and he's just like
wait how did you think of that I just
went up and told him a lie I mean
because he was just going around like he
was do you know the guy was always about
like spirituality that day whatever
because he was you know his high or
whatever it was and he goes alright this
is where we're shooting this is where
we're shooting because this is there's
garlic I mean
no idea just needed something to do just
pretend like why there was a reason and
I feel like okay I can get that but the
fact that you go in that your job is I'm
gonna go brief the president but only
say positive things and not bring up
this and not bring up that because he
might have a fit it's like when a buck
are people gonna stand up and say this
guy is you know
Democrat Republican libertarian Nazi let
me tell you something he is unfit to be
President he is unfit he is not he is
not to be the President of the United
States and these idiots who I
mean like Graham what the is wrong
with you well he's got he's got to kill
hundreds of thousands of people in here
he has priorities he has priorities like
becoming Secretary of State and endless
wars yeah what about Orrin Hatch
are you serious look at him what the
 is going on with him he's the
greatest president I've ever served on
her you're full of
but maybe he is Judy they're they share
the same politics Orrin Hatch wants to
have a tax bill that only that guts the
safety net he wants to get rid of
environmental protections he's they're
doing a event in Utah together where
they're celebrating I think it's making
a national park in Utah smaller so that
there can be more like energy
exploration on it and Orrin Hatch seems
like personally there to thank him I
mean they there's no daylight other than
he's obviously got all these distinct
personality disorders but they have the
same agenda right okay it's it's wrong
Orrin Hatch is 80 years old he's
obviously losing it and he doesn't give
a about the world his grandkids
 blow it up in like you're a
selfish prick you
 your money you know Alaska is
turning into water you're a
idiot you don't believe in science
you're in and you know I mean we were
the greatest country in the world people
looked up to us and now all you do you
see someone from another country to like
what happened why did you vote for him
like I didn't vote for him I mean it's
like it's embarrassing and you stand by
him
we all know that everyone there knows he
is mentally ill he is unfit to be the
President of the United States he is
dumb he is narcissistic he is você I say
I have a bigger vocabulary and I think
 every other word I mean there I
don't think we undo the damage at least
in terms of foreign policy for a
generation or two maybe I mean I just
think that like you know we're leaving
things so untethered I think on some
level I mean so much work has been done
and he's like now we're not gonna do
that we're not understanding and
idiot you can't you give him a map and
tell him to point out the Middle East
and where each country is go maybe if it
was a hotel themed map what do you think
about that about moving the and I guess
this happened this week right or last
week right I can't even remember yeah I
have so many Jewish isn't it great isn't
it famine it should be and I'm like look
I I know what I know about the Middle
East I know that most embassies are in
the capital I know that moving it to
Jerusalem is going to hurt a two-state
solution you know any sort of two-state
solution I've been there I don't live
there I I do think Israel gets a bad rap
in the media a lot
of the time I think Israel has
contributed a lot to the world as far as
you know Nobel Prizes medical
engineering the arts your cell
phone you know any first off my
apartheid sorts of stuff they've updated
apartheid that's nice a part of the
duplo to support racial apart
[Laughter]
you know I think it's a very complicated
issue used to be think that that needed
to be done now it used to be the
National South you would that you could
only make sure that the black they
didn't arrive on the world but now we
can do this with our cellphone ships
would make sure it's very innovative we
never get credit for this we've
completely we've disrupted ratio the
racial apartheid market completely but
no one will give us credit for no
innovation the way we deliver
observation when we deliver white
phosphorus to Gaza which has the
population density of Queens we are
using the most up-to-date crowd source
technology dress I know this give us
credit for this nothing nothing no
credit if you want to know about Trump
you needed to follow Israeli politics
that was the precursor I do I do
follow Israeli politics but I have not
the most liberal stance on that so I you
know avoid talking about it like you say
far beyond the comedian but it's okay we
will be the ways of apartheid may I
respond out of character well I'm not
Jude no because no they
I have first of all they scrapped that
several years ago so it's not his
addiction look I mean look there's no
Israel on the math they don't have you
know no they stop it Hamas accepted
several years ago when they went into a
joint agreement with the West Bank
leadership the foundations of a
two-state 67 agreement and they've not
engaged in terrorism essentially since
they've run Gaza since 2006 I believe
and also like you just but they just
reserve the food exactly it's just a
fundamental a symmetry like Israel has
the power period I mean you cannot
there's no equivalency in position right
I'm okay I don't know if you know that
whoa I would not be able to live freely
anywhere else in the Middle East besides
Israel they have a pride parade I'm not
a 'some and that makes it transitive
property and that means that they can
have like an endless occupation I don't
agree it's probably the Barry it's there
that is one of the myriad of reasons why
you wouldn't want to live in you would
want to live in Israel as opposed to say
Gaza I had other being there's no
electricity in Gaza I have talked to the
people who gave Palestinians in fact and
they said yes that is a major issue by
the way very different in the West Bank
than Gaza but my first concern is the
military occupier that regularly kills
us breaks children's bones doesn't allow
us of freedom of movement and has a
siege on a little enclosed open-air
prison that doesn't allow medicine and
food in because as one Israeli Minister
put it several years ago we need to put
them on a diet that's a bigger concern
for this right social
see how much should the catalyst it's
very good before we killed them not good
I'm not a fan of Netanya so much that we
can talk about is going bottom line it
does not help to have the embassy in
Jerusalem I think that's that is that
much we can we can agree on you guys are
making me really want to masturbate
right now the Palestinian children that
we are killing the IDF soldiers are
shooting them for support and you can
masturbate what it is happening it's a
new app they don't do this if they're
out of they just do it I do want to ask
though about are you so getting back to
the performing the south are you still
performing in the South I mean what is
like actually you know all right that
was years ago but I'm going to Atlanta
for Christmas I'm performing and I have
performed in the south and it's been you
know I mean because now people know me
so they come to see me so I'm not
getting the haters you know who are like
I want to kamikaze Big John you
know I guess you know people who are
Judy gold fan you know and it's five of
them down there well I mean do you are
you get in other words when I guess I'm
curious about is like have you noticed
any difference in the way the crowds are
reacting to your I mean I imagine your
people pick up that your anti-trump
I have you know know
why yes I have and actually can I tell
you something yeah I'm curious
interesting is that the ones in New York
like I I did Birdland the other night
it's you know this fancy cabaret room
and I was doing and I opened with my you
know I can't deal with Trump
 you know like I have a few
Trump jokes and you know it's so
interesting that these very wealthy New
Yorkers who know him probably but who
are patrons of the Arts you know are you
know get annoyed with me it's like oh
they really do yeah I mean it's gotten
better where I said can I do Trump and
they're like oh please of course but
there are still in New York cities you
know these rich very wealthy people it's
like I can see how they feel they can't
write off their their local and state
taxes and see how that goes yeah well
here's the thing here's the thing it
which is so interesting to me I opened
with the Trump thing because it's always
what's on my mind
and I always think it's the elephant in
the room like can you believe
what's going on here but I've noticed
that once I do much any Trump supporter
after I do my first jokes and they
realize you know oh my god she really
 hate them they can't laugh at
the rest of the Act they can't give it
up for me they can't just let it go
you know they are done they have no
sense of humor it's like you hate Trump
then I'm not going to even smile you
know it's it's unbelievable they take
themselves like it's ridiculous and they
just come back with hate like even if
there's a well-written joke about him
they can't even if like I can't
appreciate it bush lovers could
appreciate his stupid like nuclear what
what did he used to say Newton say
nuclear nuclear nuclear nuclear no
nuclear whatever
for fun you know what I mean okay agree
yeah the aggrievement the aggrievement
is what it's all about with with trump
voters I got into it with I mean you
know and I think that's never going to
go away there is there is such a sense
of aggrievement that leads to support of
Trump and it's the conservative movement
broadly speaking the idea that like and
I you know I haven't come across it as
much because but when Trump won I got
into it with with with somebody who who
was writing me emails saying that like
comparing being a conservative or
supporter of Trump with people in Russia
who were pulled out of their apartments
at 3:00 in the morning and sent to life
right right like wait what like your ik
waiting my criticism of what you're
saying with literally being exiled to
Siberia right literally being exiled to
Siberia not metaphorically it's
unbelievable to me it's they I don't
think first of all no one in New York
voted for Trump so right there you
should go oh my god they've been living
with him their whole life and they
