all right we got time for a couple more
calls i know people have been holding
for a long time
uh calling from a 905 area code who's
this where you calling from
hey sam uh this is uh david dole uh
calling from toronto
i'm also known as the rational national
oh the rational national
i've heard oh we you came up uh
yesterday on the program yeah
yeah i was uh so i i had a video a few
months ago i guess that's
what the i was referring to about um
discussing or kind of defending jimmy
dore
but uh i mean so just to clear the air
i'm a big fan of both
you and jimmy dore i watch both your
shows i'm sorry i think you both serve a
purpose
and um i feel like jimmy sort of gets
the raw deal from you to be honest and
i i think it comes down to sort of a
misunderstanding so the way i view jimmy
dore
is he speaks to the anger
the emotion that people feel whereas you
speak more to
the the intellect and the um
i mean you have a long format show so
you can go deeper into topics
uh discuss policy and that sort of thing
whereas jimmy dore
is it's for a lot of people they're
either going to watch
are they going to be grabbed by somebody
like alex jones or grab by
jimmy dore and i rather than be grabbed
by jimmy dore
and then hopefully also graduate onto
other progressive voices i i don't have
a problem with jimmy dore being
emotional
but i have a problem with him um
not knowing what he's talking about
i mean you know and i don't know how
much how much
you you dug into what um
the my beef with him was about but
i mean i watched a clip of aggressive
progressive
where and he didn't specifically say
i got no problem with peter thiel you
know what's the big deal about peter
thiel as a
supreme court justice but he did
not seem to know what the filibuster was
and he did think it was
um fantastical the idea that mitch
mcconnell would get rid of the
filibuster
he um i mean these are
basic basic facts
that you can either deliver in a really
emotional way
or in an arm's length way
but to get them wrong it's almost but
wait let me finish
to get them wrong um
to me is uh you're just
you're just talking nonsense and
that is such a basic i mean look
the fact is there's really no debate i
get
that people don't get emotional about
the supreme court maybe
or the federal judiciary
uh or things like you know net
neutrality he was mad
because three democrats voted
uh to uh okay uh
the fcc chair ajit pai who was a former
commissioner
yeah that's a problem but guess what
completely predictable
completely predictable and it's just
like
politics work in this way you do
something
or someone does something and then
something happens
because of it and yeah he divorces
uh those things in in a lot of what he
says i don't watch every one of his
videos
and so it was in that context in which i
said to him
i called him up or i emailed him i said
jimmy we're going to go over a video of
yours
on the show tomorrow if you want come on
the show
and we can just have the the debate
about the importance of the supreme
court
he said no go ahead then apparently he
was
listening to the show and he called in
so we had a debate about it
and what i find really annoying too is
that like look
i came from comedy i have no pedigree
there's no there's no i have no there's
no i have no
uh credentials that uh
make it any more legitimate for me to
sit here than anyone else
and no nor that does he but what i never
do
what he did is i don't say i'm a
comedian
or i don't know what i'm talking about
so i'm not responsible for what i'm
talking about which is what he did on
that program
and then he went on to go and debate it
more
on twitter and so i said hey i'm happy
to have a round
two even though he basically said i
didn't know speaking
i'm quoting him i'm not sure i know what
i'm talking about i get what you're
saying
and then he wanted to continue it on
twitter and i said okay
let's go on to your show and do it
because i gave him access to my audience
to make his argument
and i want access to his audience to
make an argument that actually
it does make a difference if peter thiel
is a supreme court justice
in fact it makes every difference in the
world who that supreme court justice is
because i can tell you in six months
public sector unions in this country
are going to be decimated
decimated and that's just the beginning
of this that's the best case
scenario
and he's telling his audience of 50
60 80 000 people 250
000 people it doesn't make a difference
but then turns around and complains
because
three democrats don't vote to support
unions that's nonsense
it's nonsense and then when he says to
me he's going to have me on his show
then he sends me an email and says i
can't now i'm too busy
the guy is full of he doesn't allow
anybody to question what he says
which is why you could never call into
his show
because he doesn't know about
what he's talking about so my problem
with him
is that he is in the exact same playing
field i am
we have the exact same credentials
a slightly bigger audience maybe he has
on youtube
uh in fact we even bought the same
goddamn suit at gentlemen's warehouse
last time i saw him went on the exact
same suit
and he's spewing to his
audience
and i paid him the respect to come on
and defend his arguments
which he did poorly in my estimation but
that's for people to
to and then he wouldn't let me do the
same on his show
and that says to me that a he doesn't
know what the he's talking about
and b
he doesn't have the balls to
back it up
and meanwhile he's just spewing
misinformation to people
who are important for actually doing
real politics
yeah and i understand all of that and i
understand you know the
i totally agree that it would be awesome
if you were on his show and discuss that
stuff
but we're talking about so
jimmy dore's audience is honestly a
fraction
of what somebody like joy ann reed has
and
i know you think you don't have much
crossover with msnbc but i mean you're
on msnbc
there definitely is crossover and i
think you have the ability to
speak to those um the centrist
democrats whereas jimmy dore has the
ability to speak to people who
may not know all that much about
politics but they're angry
now they know less now they know less
sorry
now they know less
no but i think you're cherry picking
specific
topics and videos oh no cherry picking
would be me saying
cherry picking would be me saying that
you guys cherry picking would be me
saying
hey you can't tell if somebody has
parkinson's uh from
60 feet away in a clip of video that
would be me cherry-picking
cherry-picking would be me saying hey
maybe the
guy on fox who thinks that there's pink
lesbian uh
you know marauders doesn't know what
he's talking about seth rich
that would be me cherry-picking but when
it comes to policy you guys align on
policy
and i think if you were able to both of
you like
come together and be able to hey man hey
he's the one who lied to me about he's
the one who lied to me
call into his show he's the one who lied
to me about inviting him on
call into the show oh wait you can't
oh why don't you tweet at him and see
how long it takes for him to block you
yeah but you guys just have different
shows i mean he doesn't have
he doesn't have a yeah i wonder why that
is not many youtubers
i wonder why he does have a live show
actually uh but i wonder why he doesn't
want to have anyone
question what he says
i mean for a guy who says his stuff as
if it's the god's
truth he sure doesn't want to have an
argument with anybody in fact i think he
even kicked one of the one of his
sidekicks off when they were like hey
man this doesn't make any sense
i don't know i'm not here to speculate
that i i'm not speculating anything
i'm just seeing it from a top level view
where both of you align
for the most part on policy and you just
have different ways of going about it
yes i actually tell people
i tell people facts and i tell people
stuff that
is researched he doesn't
he wants to make some money on youtube
sometimes he thought of the right winger
yesterday
so like we all get things wrong what
i thought you were right the right
winger yeah i apologize for that i
thought based on i mean the connotations
of rational national
are right-wing at least in the american
context but i corrected that immediately
yeah and i know this i'm just saying
people get things and i didn't hang up
on you and say oh
rational national i can't have you on my
show because uh
i don't feel well i can't have you on my
show uh so
click so that nobody knows that you're
not a right-winger
do you don't think that's a material
difference you don't think that makes a
difference
you don't think it's important but you
don't think let me ask you honestly
do you honestly think that it doesn't
make a difference
if jimmy and i both agree that there
should be single payer and that we're
supportive of unions
but then it doesn't make a difference
who the
fifth supreme court justice is
who potentially the sixth and seventh
supreme court justice i mean it's like
that's like saying i don't i don't even
know if i can come up with an analogy
it's like saying hey we both want to go
uh
to uh we both we both want to go to
toronto
doesn't make a difference if we walk or
take a plane
in fact in fact that's not even
no they can't because you know why he
doesn't want to have them
did you not hear that part of the story
where he was the
one who didn't want to have any more
conversations
he was the one who just wanted to
espouse his
i don't even necessarily mean
conversations on the air i just mean
like
oh i'm having a conversation i'm saying
he
is irresponsible does not check his
facts does not know the fundamental
basics
of how our government works but espouses
bullcrap
that's my that's my comment
now he can do his video
all right i i don't really agree with
you i i understand some of
his videos may come off that way but may
come off that way content as a whole
no when you take his consciousness as a
whole your name is rational national
is it rational no you're right he's not
lying to people all the time
but here's the thing how do you know
when he is and when he isn't
i see this is the thing i think most of
his audio of his audience does know
so do you think most of his audience is
my own comments
do you think most of his audience sit
there and go like maybe it doesn't
matter that
peter thiel would be a supreme court
justice
yeah i think most people are are
well then most people can go left to be
able to figure that out
okay then most people are rational
enough no sam's just got to bug up his
ass
and that's it i mean i don't understand
like why if you think the audience can
figure it all out
and it's completely irrelevant why are
you even weighing in
no i mean on some topics like so i mean
wait wait you think the part about it
wait wait wait i'm sorry let me ask you
you think the part about
sam doesn't think that this guy's this
sam thinks this guy is full of
because uh of x y and z is not
decipherable for the audience but the
idea that like the supreme court's not
important
like a filibuster they can filibuster
when they're in the majority
uh the the that i mean
you think that they need you think the
audience needs more direction
about the personal uh the the personal
or
the uh argument between jimmy and i
versus like
the um the not so intricate
but i apparently are incredi intricacies
of policy i mean come on no but you
he disempowers people he disempowers
people
he sends them on act like the only guy
that lies
or that that has that man how much time
do you think i got
online how much time do you think i got
sorry how much time do you think i got
what do you mean well i can't go every
single liar and it's i'm certainly not
jimmy's not the only one
but jimmy like i say we share audiences
you've said that i don't have a lot of
people who come up in mind
i don't have people i don't have people
who come into my comments going like hey
man
didn't like that comment about joy and
reid
i've never met that person yeah because
make rational arguments about joy and
reid they're fairly clear
i mean she has she's strong
on criticizing conservatives there's no
introspection there on the democratic
party
i agree she is a democratically good
argument i mean like
professionally
but i'm telling you that i share more of
an audience with jimmy dore than i do
with joy irene
jimmy dore and i could not be of
similar uh demographics if you were to
go into a factory
and make a jimmy dore replica or a sam
cedar replica
either one of us might come out on the
other side so it makes
every sense in the world for me to be
focused on this guy
who has a substantial audience who is
putting out
what i consider to be
and disempowering
i just think there are better ways of
explaining it than
uh bull crap attacking him well yeah i
mean i mean you know what the best way
would be to lay out the argument for us
to have
colleagues have a debate that would be
the best way to do it
but you know what dude we're just a
discussion like yeah so you guys don't
need to fight on on topics just
have a discussion i agree and he said
that he would have me on
and then he blew it off because he
realized he
didn't want to look like an ass in front
of his audience because he doesn't know
what he's talking about
appreciate the call i mean i think it's
pretty
rational it should be right up your
alley
i think you are i watch all the time i'm
being i mean i think that's pretty
rational
my part so i mean i appreciate the call
thanks all right thanks bye
