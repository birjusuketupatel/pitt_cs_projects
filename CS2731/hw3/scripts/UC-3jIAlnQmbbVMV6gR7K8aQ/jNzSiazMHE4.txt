[Music]
on the phone it is a pleasure to welcome
to the program
the florence kelly a professor of
history at nyu
and author of the second coming of the
kkk the klu klux klan of the 1920s
and the american political tradition
linda gordon welcome
uh to the program linda thank you for
having me
uh so all right let's start well i i
don't know that
i i don't know most people perceive the
kkk
as having had basically um
three waves i don't know that most
people realize that but will you
um uh first just tell us about the the
three different waves obviously you you
focused on the
on the second wave but just tell us
broadly about the the three different
waves just so we have a context
um for for where uh your work
is done here sure
i think that most people's association
with the clan has to do with the first
wave uh when the clan was a secret
and really literally a terrorist
organization that
developed immediately after the civil
war in the south
um it was its main tool was violence
sometimes non-violent intimidation but
the threat of violence
and it had one purpose and that was to
make sure that white supremacy in the
south
was not challenged and um i call it
terrorist in that
literal sense of what terrorism means
and that is that
when the cuckoo's clan went to lynch
some
guy uh the
the what they had against that
particular person
was only part of the purpose uh the
general purpose was to intimidate the
whole
african-american population in the south
um the second clan
and we should just say just so that i
mean we can be specific we're talking
about
more or less uh the period of
reconstruction uh
in the case of the clan late uh 1860s
through essentially the 1870s
no actually i'm talking about the whole
of
the period from reconstruction
all the way through uh into the early
20th century
in that period of time more than four
thousand people were lynched
now they weren't all lynched only by
clan members but the clan was certainly
the
symbol and the organizing force behind
that violence
the second clan really did not consider
itself
separate from the first clan um
and that's why i call the book the
second coming
but it had a very different strategy and
a very different constituency and
probably the most important thing that
i think most people don't understand
about the clan of the 1920s is that it
was strongest in the northern
states and it had somewhere between
three and six
million members we are talking about a
really
mass movement and unlike the first clan
it was not at all secret
people were proud of their membership
they advertised publicly
in newspapers they recruited publicly
they had
traveling clan speakers all over the
country
so that was part of what was different
and the other part is that they
you might say expanded their enemies
list
um i think understanding that in the
1920s there were still only a fairly
small
population of african-americans in the
north
and the second clan focused its bigotry
on
catholics and jews and immigrants
but immigrants because the immigrants
who have been coming into this country
in the early 20th century were
mostly catholics or jews
i i then there was oh okay well you know
what we'll circle back
uh to uh to those questions just so that
we can get the sort of a
first a survey of the three different
waves as it were
uh the third wave is a clan that
re-arose you might say in response to
the civil rights movement of the 1950s
and 1960s and that clan
still exists today and you might even
say that with this current spate of
white nationalists uh we're in a
fourth revival of the klan
but i think it's important to understand
that today the ku klux klan is only
one small relatively small fraction
of these many white nationalist groups
uh but certainly there are many groups
that are continuing
um the spirit of the clan so
all right so when we look at the the the
second wave um
let's start with that notion of
of of the i guess the
the the flexibility the their capacity
to grow
in the sense that um they
expanded the playing field for who they
were going to i guess professionally
hate what why wh
was the was the rise of the second wave
of the clan
and their uh their sort of i guess
slightly changed focus um
was that a function of immigration or
was it a function because
jim crow era laws had been you know
successful
in sort of um you know as a blowback
against uh
emancipation what what what
what gave rise to it
the major force was immigration starting
in the 1880s there were really
millions of people coming into this
country from
uh europe from the middle east from
eastern europe
and what characterized this this period
of immigration is that most of these
people were not
protestants there were jews from eastern
europe
catholics from southern europe
orthodox from eastern and
eastern europe and the middle east um
now there had been an anti-immigration
movement in the united states for a long
time that we used to be referred to as
nativism but um
the clan really built
on this this anti-immigration stuff by
doing what i think all kinds
of of this kind of demagogic
movements do and that is that they built
on fear and they built that
by making all sorts of
somewhat bizarre allegations
about how these immigrants were plotting
to really overthrow overturn
not only the government of the united
states but to take control of it
by a foreign force
and i'll let me point out that when i
started to do this research i
was asking myself how could people have
believed these extremely bizarre
allegations and i could give you some
examples
but i think as time went on
we are beginning to see today that
you can somehow make people accept
um conspiracy theories for which there
is no evidence
linda literally as you were saying that
i was thinking of a clip that we played
yesterday
of the highest rated cable television
program
news program in the country or second
highest i think tucker carlson
saying that in terms of meddling with
our elections
mexico has done far more by uh
by packing our electorate he said i mean
and and and we heard i mean the
president of the united states
for a year contended that four
million illegal immigrants um
made up the difference in the popular
vote uh in this country and we formed an
entire commission
on it so it it becomes far
too um easy i guess to contemplate
what um what people would buy and i
would imagine
i don't know maybe it's less or maybe
it's um um easier
uh easier or harder at that time to to
disseminate these things they didn't
have an internet but at the same time
you didn't have an internet uh
so you could you could both i think you
know there was no snopes
as it were um to debunk these things
okay so
it's it's how much of it was
a genuine fear and how much of it was
because
what you describe in the book is
a broad-based almost like social
um hierarchy i mean it's
it's like a it's a combination of like
almost like groupon and um
and you know the kiwanis club and
the it's it's like a it's a society
within a society
in many respects how how much true
how much was it how much was there a
profit motive involved in this
oh okay well i have to take these things
one at a time please
first of all like many social movements
it gave rise to
all kinds of activities for example the
klan had
baseball teams they had bands they had
uh youth clubs they had sewing circles
they
etc etc you could live your life within
a clan community
um the um well you started by asking
about fear and let me just say
you asked was it genuine and and i would
just like to point out that you can
genuinely be fearful uh
but within in a situation in which these
fears
have been essentially constructed
by this kind of demagogic rhetoric
one of the one of the conclusions i've
come to as to how you get
people to believe uh bizarre allegations
uh let me give you one example of what i
mean on
large scale one of the allegations is
that
these uh all these immigrants pouring
into the united states were not coming
because they were poor or because in the
case of the jews they were persecuted
they were coming because they had been
ordered to do so
the catholics had been ordered by the
pope
to come to the united states to
infiltrate the united states like moles
in an
espionage plot to prepare the way
for the time when the vatican would take
over the united states
the jews were coming because they'd been
ordered to do that by an
international cabil of jewish financiers
who were going to use them in a similar
way to
take over the economy of the united
states
um i my sense is that these
many of these clan members genuinely
were afraid of these things
and i that part of the reason they could
accept these things is because
of the sources in other words if you're
told
things like this by a a source that you
respect
um they they become accepted in the
clans case
uh one of the major sources were
evangelical protestant ministers
uh the clan claimed to have forty
thousand ministers that was probably an
exaggeration but we know
that there were thousands of evangelical
ministers who were
uh praising the clan in their sermons
and
even urging people to join the clan
and so you can understand why in a
relationship
uh in a church uh you know a sense of
respect for that minister
why people are going to believe these
things do you have any
a sense in in the course of your your
scholarship
of this and research do you have any
sense of
of how
how genuine that fear was as expressed
by those ministers i mean i know
you know was there an errant letter that
said hey
good news the the line about the the
the catholics and the pope is we just
you know
our receipts went up by 10 i mean i
imagine people
don't write things that explicitly but i
mean do you have any sense of
of how genuine their belief was of this
no i don't but i i tend to think it was
really genuine
um i'm not sure how
great uh the fear was
but it is also true and this is what you
were
suggesting in the question you asked
before this that there were other
motives
for joining the clan in the first place
in many ways the
1920s clan was an evangelical
revival the
there were a lot of prayers there were a
lot of church services the clan
liked to make donations uh
to evangelical churches in which they
did this in a very dramatic way they
would
in their uniforms they would march into
the church and
visibly personally hand some cash
uh to the minister um
the other aspect of the clan is that and
that
was what you were raising before is that
at least at first it spread
by a situ a system of recruitment by
commission
um one of the things that the klan did
and to the best of my knowledge it may
be the
first ever social movement to do this is
that it hired a public relations firm to
promote it
the klan was a business it was
registered
as a for-profit corporation
and the pr firm developed this network
of recruiters and anyone who
brought in a member to the clan and you
to join you had to pay a ten dollar
initiation fee
and that in the 20s that was worth
way over a hundred dollars today this
was not
uh an organization of poor people but
the recruiters who got you to join could
keep 40
of that then the person they had
recruited could go out
and try to recruit some other people and
keep 40
of their initiation fee and this went on
and on
until you find you've
people find that they have sort of
saturated the field and that there's
nobody left to recruit
and in that sense it's what we call a
pyramid scheme
in which the early entrants uh gain
from this and the later entrants don't
don't
and i think that was part of the fact
that the clan declined
after a while is that that that
opportunity to make profit in that way
um was was coming to a close
but the other thing about the klan just
to lay out
one more of its attractions
is that it was in many many locations it
was very prestigious
to join the klan it was
in a way um functioned
like something halfway between an
old-fashioned fraternal organization and
a
new fashioned rotary club in which you
could network with
some other business people and make
contacts that would be economically
valuable
to you the vast majority of clan members
were actually what we would today call
middle class
and furthermore they weren't rural
people they at the time
critics used to attack the clan by
saying oh they're just a bunch of
rural hicks uneducated etc etc and that
turns out to be absolutely false the
clan had great strength in the cities
the educational level of people in the
clan was easily
as high as uh the average in the united
states
so we we have to keep in mind that this
was a com
not only respectful but respectable but
in many ways
uh people considered it a a privilege to
belong to the clan
a lot of small business owners and and
a decent amount of white collar workers
uh you write and
was there a relationship uh or any type
of correlation between
the and uh you talk about oregon and
uh chicago and you know northern cities
new jersey
was there a relationship between the
number
of immigrants in these areas and
the um the the the membership of the
clan
or was it just sort of was there a sweet
spot in terms of proximity
right like you know if you're living
amongst immigrants maybe you're less
inclined to join the clan but if you are
living
within 50 miles of an immigrant
population
you're more inclined to join was there
any type of is there any type of
breakdown
like like that um
actually i i i think the first part of
what you said is true if you're living
with a lot of immigrants like
you might be in new york city um
you you are not that attracted to the
clan in part because you
may occasionally see these people as
just ordinary people and
uh you know they're not don't seem to be
terribly threatening
what what is really extraordinary was
the clan's ability to rev up
uh this kind of fear and
hatred in situations where there weren't
any of the hated
despised groups i used oregon
for a couple of reasons partly because
it's my home state but partly
because it's such a perfect example of
that
in oregon in the 1920s there were
essentially
no black people way
less than one percent there were
very very very few jews uh my guess is
that the vast majority of oregonians had
never
seen a black person or a jew
and even catholics were really a very
small
minority and yet they were able to
convince all these people that uh these
catholics and jews
were really threatening uh the overall
welfare of the country and the state
um it i think that's a very important
lesson there that these
