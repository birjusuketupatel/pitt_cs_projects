[HBOMB] Hey, how's it going?
Let's talk about what it's like
eating tons of soy
for two months.
[dramatic music]
First, I should probably
give you some background
on what I normally eat.
Um, basically whatever.
Like, whatever I feel
like eating at the time
or when I'm hungry.
So I'm not the most unhealthy
of people.
I tend to fluctuate between 11
and 12 stone,
which is, like, 160
to 180 pounds.
I think I've got that right.
Might be 150 to 170.
I don't know.
We don't do pounds here.
So sometimes I'll eat, like,
really healthily
for a couple days
and sometimes I'll eat, like,
a full, like,
bag of Doritos for a meal,
and sometimes
I'll eat one really,
really big meal a day
and nothing else.
So, uh, my metabolism
is apparently really good
'cause it's compensated
pretty well for the fact
that I'm not very good
at this whole food thing.

♪ ♪
Back when I was an IT engineer,
I tried to get really healthy
for a while.
I basically ate nothing
but fruits
and a couple
of specific vegetables,
uh, like, uh, peppers,
kidney beans,
and just--lentils and spinach,
and that was about it.
That was just all I ate for--
for, like,
every meal of the day,
and I got super healthy
for a while.
I lost tons of weight,
I felt really good,
and then I went out for fish
and chips with some friends,
like, once,
and as soon as I got home,
I immediately had to have a nap
for, like, two hours,
and I realized that what
I was doing was I was being so,
like, rigid in exactly what
I was eating that I was training
my body to be unprepared
for anything remotely fatty
or sugary
and it just messed with me,
so I kinda started
eating normally afterwards
and sort of lived in fear
of going on any kinds
of diet of any kind afterwards,
and apart from whatever amounts
of soy that you get
in normal people food,
uh, I haven't intentionally
eaten anything soy-based
for most of my life.
Uh, I've never really eaten
anything vegany or tofuy before.
When I was about 22,
I went in to get a blood test
because I was really worried
about testosterone stuff
at the time
and my results came back really
high for both T and DHT,
and, uh, that's actually why,
you--you know,
I'm gonna go bald in the next,
uh, 12 to 15 minutes,
because, uh, that's what having
high testosterone can do
although it's disputable, uh,
but I like to think that's why.
I love bringing this up.
You know,
compared to me,
like, 78%
of the human male population
are low-T betas,
and yet I look like this.
It's almost as if endocrinology
is a little bit more complicated
than what Davis Aurini
and his science advisor
looked up on the Internet
in five minutes.
Speaking of Davis,
he actually left a comment
on the last video that I want
to read out now.
Imagine being
almost 40 years old--
like, that close
to the halfway point
of the cosmic human miracle
that is your life--
the one that you get--
and spending it arguing
in the comments
of YouTube videos
on the Internet.
I wanna feel sorry for Davis,
but it's just too funny.
Actually, hold on one sec.
I'm gonna check it's not,
like, a parody account
or something.
[rustling and clicking]
Yeah, it's real.
[chuckles]
The fact I had to check to see
that that was just a parody
of Davis probably says quite
a lot.
You know, when I came up
with that character
that was sort of making fun
of people like him
but especially him, eh,
a couple years ago,
and he's running around
with a sword,
I thought,
"That's a bit much.
They're not that silly."
But, no,
as of two months ago,
I checked Davis' channel
and there he is looking like
a slightly microwaved Cypher
from "The Matrix" reviewing
a sword that he bought online
for, like, $500.
[intense music]
Oh, yeah, I bet I look
so badass right now.
[chuckles]
Do you want some cantaloupe?
I--I cut up a lot
of melons making this video.
[laughing]
Hi, Davis, by the way.
I know you're gonna watch this
so, uh, maybe leave
a better complaint
in the comments this time.
[chuckles]
That said,
the testosterone results
I got were years ago now.
I was maybe thinking of getting,
like, a before and after test,
uh, when I was doing
this experiment,
but doctors are really,
really busy now,
especially thanks
to the policies
that people like Paul voted for,
and I didn't wanna waste more
of their time
to get extra research done
on a YouTube video.
That felt kinda disrespectful
of their time.
So for the Soy Boy Diet,
I basically took everything
that was meat,
eggs, or dairy and replaced it
with some kind of,
uh, soy-based equivalent.
So I had a lot
of Soysages,
a lot of soygers--
that's not a real thing.
[Paul McCartney slowly playing]
♪ Hope for the future ♪
[HBOMB] And tons of soy milk.
I don't actually drink
that much milk normally.
I think milk's rubbish,
but in coffee, I have milk,
so I replaced that
with soy milk.
It tasted really nice,
by the way.
That was the first thing
I noticed.
Soy milk has a really, like,
nice taste to it.
I avoided all
the vegetarian foods
that are made
of stuff like corn.
Uh, corn food is, like, uh,
some kind of fungus
and also egg albumin, uh,
that's been cultivated
a certain way.
Apparently it tastes good
but it sounds awful
and there's no soy in it,
to my knowledge,
so I--I ignored all of that.
I also obviously just ate,
you know,
regular tofu that I'd bought
and cooked different ways.
The initial barrier to tofu,
by the way, is taste.
Tofu in its nascent state
is tasteless,
smells a little bit weird,
and wet.
You have to drain it
or press it
to get all of the water out.
You have to put in
a lot more effort
just to get an actual taste
out of it.
However, people usually use that
as a way of comparing it
to meat and showing
that it's less good,
but actually after doing
some looking
into this over the course
of this stuff,
I've realized that that's not
quite a fair comparison.
Like, all the meat that you buy
in a store has been flavored
or processed in some way
to give it a sense of taste.
You can't just cut
a bacon-sized slice off
a pig and fry it.
That will probably
not taste that great.
Anything that's been processed
or cured,
that's what you're tasting
in the meat when you eat it.
You're not actually just,
you know--
there isn't a nascent good taste
to animals,
it turns out.
We have to make
it taste all right.
With the Soysages,
the first thing I noticed
was that they
were incredibly similar
to regular sausages because
the actual meat wasn't
the thing you were tasting
in sausages.
You were--you were actually
tasting all of the--
the fun herbs and stuff
that had been mixed in with it.
Uh, and that stuff
tastes nice even when
there's no actual meat involved,
it turns out,
so I had a pretty okay time
on this.
Uh, something I got
really into eating right away
was I would just cut up
some tofu
and microwave it with these,
um, chili kidney beans
that you can buy
at the Co-op,
and I would just eat that
for a meal
and it was really quick to make,
and also it was really,
really filling.
Um, so I had a good time
with that.
I wouldn't cook that
for someone else, though.
That's, you know--
that'd be rubbish, but, uh,
I got into eating tons
of that right away because
it was so quick and simple
and it satisfied
the tofu requirements
for this diet.
I mostly stuck
to it pretty fine.
Uh, I had a couple
of times where
I broke it on purpose because
I was eating with, like,
family for Christmas
or New Years,
and I couldn't be bothered to,
like, bring a soy chicken
to Christmas dinner.
[MAN] Yeah. Yeah.
[squeaks]
[clattering]
[HBOMB] Actually I think
the most disturbing thing
about my family
was how when I told them about
this thing they were like,
"Yeah, that's--that's something
he would do."
Like, my family have come
to expect this sort
of thing from me and...
[upbeat music]
It's a little bit worrying,
to be honest.
My initial starting weight
was 13 stone and one pound
but that was while I
was carrying a Canon C100
with a 24-105 millimeter lens,
which is actually pretty hefty,
but I really wanted to do
the shot where I
was looking at the scale
while I was weighing myself.
This is my mother's bathroom,
by the way.
I don't own a scale.
What am I,
a functioning adult?
To get my actual weight,
I decided to just weigh
my camera
again on the same scale.
Oh.
Which didn't work because
it's not heavy enough.
So I weighed it on
a kitchen scale.
All right.
2,543 grams.
That's 5.6 pounds.
183 take away 5.6
is 177.4 pounds,
which is a lot for me, actually.
After doing the diet
for two months--
I'm not gonna give you
all that rigmarole again--
I weighed 11 stone
and two pounds,
so 156 pounds.
So eating a bunch
of soy made me lose 23 pounds
without having to do anything.
That's a pretty
significant difference
for just a slight change
in what I was eating.
Imagine what a difference
it would have made
if I'd bothered to exercise.
In all the really
compromising photos I took over
the course of this diet,
I didn't notice
any marked change
in my actual shape.
I didn't become more effeminate
in any way that was measurable,
and I didn't grow breasts
any larger than
the ones that I already have.
I also didn't get
significantly fitter
or have that much more energy
than I normally had, either,
so it turns out that soy beans
aren't magical.
Basically I proved exactly
what everyone expected
this would prove
in the most boring
and straightforward
way possible.
It turns out that soy beans
are just a kind of bean
that you can eat
and it doesn't make that much
of a difference.
Great.
Hooray.
This is why I didn't
bring this up much
in the main
"Measured Response" video,
by the way,
because it made no difference.
It was, like, nothing really
worth bringing up,
so I thought I'd save it
for this little thing.
At the very least I didn't
become weirdly airbrushed
or turn red like Alex Jones'
supplements seem
to do for him.
Watch out for that,
by the way, Paul.
I think by far
the most substantive change
I've noticed
is an increased prevalence
in what Reddit likes to call
the "ghost poop,"
which is you go to the bathroom
and then when you wipe,
you discover you didn't
really have to
because it came out
in one solid,
contiguous,
beautiful piece.
I wouldn't call that
a ghost poop,
by the way, Reddit.
Um, I would call that when you,
uh, take a shit
and you don't need to flush
because it went down
the drain all on its own.
[beeps]
I don't think tofu is that much
healthier than meat.
I mean, obviously
processed meats
have been linked to an increase
in cancer risk,
but with the kind of meat
you can get at a butcher,
I don't think there's
a huge difference health-wise.
That said, soy milk
is way better than regular milk.
Regular milk is garbage.
Don't even get me start--
I--I got myself started.
Milk is, like,
just absolutely rubbish.
Humans have been
lactose intolerant
for most of our history.
Like, the ability to drink milk
is something
we only really developed, like,
7,500 years ago,
and even then,
tons of humans are still
lactose intolerant.
It's ridiculous,
and then it still had shit in it
that would be, like,
poisonous to drink.
Like, it made people
really sick anyway
until Louis Pasteur came along
and invented pasteurization.
I wonder where
he got that name from?
And then it was finally
mostly safe
for some humans to drink milk.
The fact that we still
drank milk prior
to the 1860s where
we hadn't developed a way
of making it not poisonous
speaks volumes as to both
the rubbishness of milk
and to why humans
are just rubbish.
Soy milk,
on the other hand,
is low in fat,
high in protein and vitamins,
contains zero cholesterol, uh,
it tastes great in my coffee,
which is all I drink milk
for anyway
because milk is weird,
oh, and it's not full
of estrogen.
Oh, by the way,
did I mention that regular milk
is full of estrogen?
Not, you know, fakey-fake
planto-phytoestrogen.
Mammal estrogen.
The kind that effects mammals.
You know that cows make milk
for baby calves, right?
How's that for hormonal havoc,
Kayla?
[scoffs]
I don't know why I'm getting
so annoyed about this.
I think the main thing
this taught me
was to bother to think
about what I'm eating.
Having to actually measure
what's in food
and look at labels has caused me
to think more about what I'm
actually eating,
which I really wasn't before.
I've never counted calories.
I've never thought about fiber,
carbohydrates,
fat, protein,
anything like that before,
and the modicum of research
I had to do
for making these videos
has caused me to go,
"Well, if I actually thought
about this just a little bit,
I could vastly improve, like,
the actual state of my body."
So there has kinda been
a positive effect for this,
but it's nothing to do with
the food itself.
It's all just been the lessons
I've learned over
the course of trying it.
So I wouldn't really recommend
the soy diet to anyone.
You know,
there's no spectacular effects,
but I would recommend looking
into what you eat
and how to improve it.
I'm actually really obsessed
with responses
to the "Super Size Me"
documentary.
Like, Morgan Spurlock, uh,
made a couple of, like,
quite important
methodological mistakes,
so tons of shills
for the fast food industry
or, like, weird paleo
diet people have come out
with these semi-legitimate
criticisms in order
to push their own
personal agenda.
I think it's hilarious.
There's this "great" documentary
called "Fat Head,"
which I've seen more
than most actual films
that basically, uh,
takes a couple
of the legitimate problems
with "Super Size Me"
and turns them into,
like, just--
"And here's why you should eat
fucking steak every day!"
That topic is actually on
the big board
of weird niche subjects that
I'd love to make
a video about at some point,
so, uh, mention in the comments
if you'd like me
to do something like that.
That's actually something
that I've noticed
with YouTube skepticism
for a while now.
No one's bothered to mine
the area of health
and diet science yet,
which is bizarre because
it's such a fantastic thing
to delve into.
You know, like, uh,
"nutritionist" is not
a legally-protected term, right?
So you have Kayla Danielses
everywhere
and they're, like, saying stuff
that's really easy
to make fun of and debunk.
We've got all kinds
of stuff like that
and yet we're so busy
talking about, you know,
moon landing conspiracy theories
or feminists
when there's this whole thing
that we could be doing.
I think that's great.
I'm also going to look into
a book by Tim Ferriss called
"The 4-Hour Body"
which I've heard is actually
fairly similar
to the kind of diet I adopted
a couple years ago
when I got pretty healthy
and then had a weird experience
with some fatty foods.
Uh, apparently his diet, uh,
suggests some kind
of cheat day where you eat
a ton of calories
and fat and stuff
to sort of reset your metabolism
every now and then.
I'd love to have a version
of the stuff I ate then
that actually works properly
and lets me occasionally eat
fatty things
without having
to have a nap afterwards.
I think I might start going
to the gym more after this.
Like, I joked earlier,
"Imagine what it would
have been like if I
had bothered to exercise,"
and I actually quite liked
imagining that.
So, you know,
I'll give that a shot.
Anyway, thanks for watching
this quick update
on all the weird stuff I've
been putting into my mouth.
Normally at the end
of my videos,
I used to do readings
of the credits,
but then unfortunately,
too many lovely people decided
to help fund me making
weird stuff like this
so the credits started
being super long.
It's actually starting
to affect the length
and pacing of my videos
to a degree that I think
is not good
for the videos themselves
so I'm gonna change it over.
Uh, this and one more time
I'm going to do readings
of the credits just so everyone
who wants to be in them
has a chance to
and I can correct
if I get the names wrong
this time,
and in future I'm gonna
have different rewards
for backers at that level,
so I'm gonna do streams
of me editing the videos
and some other stuff like that.
If there's other stuff
you think I should do
for backers like that, uh,
please let me know.
But in the meantime,
as thanks for allowing me
to afford to spend the time,
effort, and money doing
ridiculous stuff like this,
I'd really like
to thank 3/5s of a brain,
