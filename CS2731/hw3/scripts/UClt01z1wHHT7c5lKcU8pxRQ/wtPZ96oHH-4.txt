Christmas and New Years
are always a time
of sadness and horror for me.
Not because I don't get on
with any of my relatives.
They're great
and I've forgiven them
for almost all of their crimes.
No, the last decade of holidays
have been a nightmare
for me because I've had
to prepare for yet another knife
in the back of "Doctor Who."
[snaps]
I mean, who can forget
"The Christmas Invasion"
in which the Doctor farts around
in bed for 40 minutes
and then at the end he wakes up
and has a sword fight
in his pajamas
with Blood Skull Man?
That's his name.
Don't go and check.
Partway through the fight,
he loses a hand,
but not really.
It comes back and he wins.
Yay.
Woo!
Oh, by the way,
that hand turns out to be
an incredibly important
plot device
22 episodes later so I hope you
were paying attention
on Christmas day.
Oh, and 16 episodes after that,
the Doctor doesn't want
to change his appearance
while regenerating so he pours
his excess energy into the hand
and it forms a new version
of the Doctor
who goes of to live with Rose
in an alternate univer--
[inhales deeply]
Look, all I'm saying
is this Christmas special
has a lot to answer for,
and it will not be forgiven.

[HBOMB] Or who can forget
the 2007 Christmas special,
"Voyage of the Damned,"
which is set on the Titanic
but in space
and Kylie Minogue is in it
and there's robot angels
and they portray the Doctor
as a literal messiah figure
on Christmas day?
[scoffs]
This episode incurred criticism
not only
from fringe religious groups
for, you know, this,
but also from the last living
survivor of the actual Titanic.
"But a spokeswoman
for the show insisted:
"No offence was intended.
"'Voyage of the Damned' is set
on a spaceship called
The Titanic and not a boat."
This year, however,
might at least prove
to be the last bizarre
Christmas nightmare
I'll have to endure
because this year
it's the end
of Steven Moffat's occupation
of the "Doctor Who"
showrunner position.
His regime is ending.
And that means this year might
truly be cause for celebration
even more than spending time
with your loved ones.
Let's take a look at Moffat's
final episode of the show
and then speculate about
what "Doctor Who" can get up to
now that it's finally free
of his grasp.
[unsettling music]
It--it--it talks if you press it

[alarm buzzing]
No!
If you've seen
my "Sherlock" video--
which, um, I think a couple
of you might have done--
you'll already know
that Moffat's relationship
with "Doctor Who" is lifelong.
He was a fan
of the original series
and he wrote the Children
in Need charity spoof
of "Doctor Who" which
was actually
the first appearance
of the Doctor on television
for quite some time.
It ended,
perhaps fittingly,
with the Doctor regenerating
into a woman.
Now, when I saw this years ago,
I thought,
"Wow, wouldn't that be nice?"
But I realize in retrospect
after reading
some recent comments
by Moffat that this
to him was meant as a joke.
[DOCTOR] And of course
my Sonic Screwdriver.
[buzzing]
Oh, look.
It's got three settings.
[EMMA] Doctor, stop that!
[HBOMB] Like, ha, ha,
the Doctor keeps dying
in silly little ways
and regenerating.
What's the next comical thing he
can regenerate into?
Oh, a woman!
[laughing sarcastically]
Oh, imagine!
A woman Doctor.
That's a laugh riot.
Back before Moffat
was showrunner,
when all he'd done was work
on several
critically-praised comedies
and the best episodes
of the show so far
and that one other really,
really bad show which
we pretended didn't happen.
You know,
we did him a favor.
It was easy to interpret having
the Doctor regenerate
into Joanna Lumley
as this cool,
progressive thing.
Like, "Hey, why not have
a female incarnation?"
But Moffat's actual intent
is made much more clear
by closer inspection
and of course
by his more recent statements.
"This isn't a show exclusively
for progressive liberals.
"This is also for people
who voted Brexit.
"That's not me politically
at all-
but we have to keep everyone
on board."
I haven't actually met
a Scottish person before.
Okay, firstly,
credit to Steven for recognizing
the mysterious correlation
between people who voted Brexit
and people who would have
a problem with a female Doctor,
but secondly,
isn't it telling that
he views casting a woman
as a move
for progressive liberals?
Like, is that really
the only reason anyone
would ever think to cast
a woman in this role?
Moffat's approach rears its head
in the special itself
with the first Doctor's--
shall we say--
ironic sexist comments.
[FIRST DOCTOR] Older gentlemen,
like women,
can be put to use.
[12TH DOCTOR] You can't--y--
you can't say things like that.
[HBOMB] Look how silly
this old man is being.
Hey, remember casual misogyny?
Hilarious!
Look how far we
and the Doctor have come.
But writing like that loses
its appeal when it's written
by the man who had several
great opportunities
to actually cast a woman
as this character
and didn't because he
was worried about upsetting
the kind of people
who actually think like that.
That's not to say I don't
think Capaldi was a good choice
for the Doctor.
Like almost all the actors
this show gets nowadays,
he does a great job
with the material he's given,
and season eight
was almost all right,
but even the episodes
of the show written
by other writers are affected
by Moffat's poor plans
as showrunner
for the overall direction
of the wider story.
While most of the good episodes
like "Mummy on
the Orient Express"
or "Flatline" get to be
their own thing,
there's still a lot
of mucking about
with this overarching story
about deciding whether
or not the Doctor's secretly
a bad guy who kills people
and it's bad,
and Missy--
a mysterious figure
who keeps meeting up with people
who died during each episode--
saw a fairly decent chunk
of each writer's episode
get stolen to serve Moffat's
inevitable nonsense
season finale.
Moffat's plans weaken
the individual episodes
not just by literally leeching
away precious script pages
they could have used to tell
the story at hand,
but it also means
the individual writers
can't really do anything with
the Doctor or his companion
for that season, Clara,
because that would risk messing
up whatever big
character moments Moffat
had planned
for the end of the season.
The characters couldn't really
develop their relationships
with each other
or change as people.
At best, sometimes Clara
realizes the Doctor's not always
the best guy and then changes
her mind in the next episode
and goes to hang out
with him again.
Capaldi and Smith's Doctors
didn't get to develop
or grow the way Eccleston
and Tennant's did.
You couldn't really have
an episode
quite like "Dalek"
or "The Empty Child"
in a show led this way,
and that's especially sad
because Moffat wrote one
of those episodes.
Moffat's approach
as a showrunner
inadvertently prevents
these kinds of episodes
and great moments that define
a series from happening,
and that just really sucks.
The third Capaldi series
was basically a soft reboot.
The first episode
was even called "The Pilot."
The Doctor gets reintroduced
in a new context
as a prestigious professor.
Hey, Steve,
wouldn't it been great
if we--we--you'd written a bunch
of episodes
that show him reaching
this point in his life?
[stammers and exhales]
[slaps hands on thighs]
I mean, like, literally, like,
a whole season of television
could have been written
about how
the Doctor ends up where he is
and the place he's at
at the start of this season,
and they just don't.
It just starts here.
That's a whole good season
of storytelling
you could have had,
gone.
Bill was in this season,
and I think she starts out
as a really interesting
companion,
but then the series kind of
is sort of generic
the whole way through,
so she doesn't really get
to be as interesting as I think
she could have been.
It's clear that Moffat still
has no idea how to pace
a full season of television.
Long story short,
at the end of that season,
Bill dies sort of,
and the Doctor saves the day
but is critically injured
in the process
and he starts to regenerate.
He wanders out into the
south pole
and meets the first Doctor which
is where our Christmas
special picks up.
I will now attempt to recount
in full the plot
of the 2017 "Doctor Who"
Christmas special.
[inhales sharply]
The story begins
with that meeting again.
Then for some reason,
time stops.
Then a first World War soldier
played by Mark Gatiss--
because why not--
is about to die,
but then time stops
for him as well
and then he gets pulled into
the North Pole
at the same time
as the two Doctors.
An entity reveals itself
and abducts the TARDIS
and demands they hand over
the soldier
and then manifests a new version
of Bill who the Doctor
thought had died.
The Doctor doesn't want
to hand the soldier over
without getting more information
so instead
of asking what's happening,
they all, uh, run away
and pretend to let
the TARDIS get stolen
and then they all run off
to the other Doctor's TARDIS
to go to a planet
we haven't seen before where
the Doctor claims we'll find
the biggest database
in the world.
The Doctor assumes
this glass lady thing, uh,
is based on a real person
and just needs
a really big database
to look them up for some reason.
The database shoots
at the Doctor
but gives up when it realizes
he's already dying
for some reason.
It turns out to be the Dalek
from that one episode
two seasons ago
when they all went into a Dalek
and made it want
to kill other Daleks by accident
while trying to turn it good.
He's just sort of hanging
out here shooting Daleks
whenever they turn up
to shoot him.
So it turns out that Daleks
are all hooked up into some
special, um, mega mainframe
that's the biggest database
in the world.
The Doctor tries to convince it
to tell him who
the glass lady is.
Meanwhile, the manifestation
of Bill keeps turning into
the glass lady, uh,
and sort of messing
with the soldier and the Doctor
but not actually doing anything
with them.
They just--she just sort of
turns into glass
when they're not looking
and then nothing happens.
Um, it doesn't actually
do anything.
Anyway, the Dalek looks up
the lady's face
and it turns out that she's
the creator
of a future humanity's
time traveling super computer
designed to--get this--
abduct everyone who ever dies
from time
and scan their memories
at the moment of their deaths
and then put them back, uh,
to build a big database
of all of their memories.
The Doctor realizes there
was no threat, uh, this episode,
and there were no stakes,
uh, gives up,
and, uh, the soldier
hands himself over.
[HBOMB] We're 14 minutes into
the episode, Steven!
They go back to where he
was supposed to die
but then he doesn't because
the Doctor delayed
the death by a few hours
and it turns out that
it's that one time all
the fighting stopped
at Christmas.
Oh, hey, they actually
worked Christmas into it
and semi-justified having
this random guy be the guy
who gets abducted.
Oh, also,
he's an ancestor
of Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart
for some reason.
[ARCHIBALD] Captain Archibald
Hamish Lethbridge-Stewart.
[HBOMB] That's a thing
that Moffat keeps doing
and I'm really not sure why.
The entity which it turns out
is called "Testimony"
brings out Nardole as well
so, uh, he can say bye to them
and then also Clara
who he forgot because
of time bullshit
in the last season,
but Testimony gives him
his memories back using magic,
and then both Doctors give up
and decide to regenerate
out of spite.
Capaldi gives a speech
to his next self saying
that they should
b--be nice to people.
The scene would probably be
a real tear-jerker
if it was attached
to an episode of television
with any stakes or plot.
And then he finally goes out
the way we all wish we would--
by exploding violently
into light and fire
while transforming
into Jodie Whittaker.
[inhales]
[exhales sharply]
I have a few small questions.
Why didn't the entity
just explain itself
and make it clear it didn't have
any ulterior motives
the way it happily did once
the Doctor asked a Dalek
to Google it for him?
Why did it threaten him at all
considering that it has
the memories of everyone
who ever died so it knows all
about him
and knows that he's
a peaceful guy
who doesn't need
to be threatened?
Why did the Doctor decide
the only solution
was to go find that one Dalek
from two seasons ago
and didn't get mentioned again?
How does he know
where it ended up?
Uh, why--if the Dalek
hates Daleks
and wants to kill Daleks
and can clearly see down
to the ground level
and make fairly accurate shots--
has it not killed all
the deshelled
and still alive Daleks
squirming around on the surface
where it can definitely
see them?
I mean, the catchphrase
is, "exterminate,"
not, "I'm gonna break off
your outer casing
"and then just sort of chill out
and wait for someone
"to come here and have
a half-baked horror scene
"where one of them squirms
on Mark Gatiss' face
for five seconds."
Why has the Dalek since
also decided it wants
to kill the Doctor?
Why does it give up when
it sees that he's already dying?
And even if for some reason
it's decided that the best thing
to do is leave the dying
to die without killing them,
why does it actually
believe he's dying,
even though it definitely knows
Time Lords regenerate
because, A, Daleks know
how Time Lords work--
that's, like, one of their,
like, main things--
and, B, Daleks apparently have
a mega hive mind super database
bigger than the one
the Time Lords have.
Next question.
Why did the Daleks have
a comprehensive mega hive mind
super database
bigger than the Time Lords have,
who--by the way--
are the lords of all of time?
And who plugged all these
bloody wires in?
It--it doesn't even have arms!
It's just a plunger
and a whisk!
[stammers]
How did it--
Why a World War One soldier?
Why didn't the Bill Potts entity
just explain itself right away
and clear everything up instead
of insisting she was real?
Why undo the Doctor forgetting
Clara in the last five minutes
of the last run
of the last episode
of this incarnation
even being around?
Why did Testimony pretend they
got away for a while
and unfreeze time even though
they happily froze it again
partway through the scene
with the Dalek?
Why bring back this Dalek for,
like, a two-minute conversation
that doesn't actually progress
its story or relationship
with the Doctor at all
and imparts five seconds
of exposition and yet spend half
the episode farting around
on the planet getting to it?
Why were there
no stakes whatsoever?
And most importantly,
what exactly was Steven Moffat
actually trying to do?
Um, I think I figured out
the answer
to that question,
at least.
Remember "The End of Time,"
the last special
with Russell T. Davies in charge
and the last one
with David Tennant
as the Doctor
where he saves the day
and makes a heroic sacrifice
and then starts to regenerate?
Remember how
the regeneration started
and there was still, like,
20 minutes of the Doctor
going around saying bye
to everyone,
even old companions
who we hadn't seen
for quite a while like Rose
and Martha,
and we even find out
what they've been up to
in the interim like that Martha
and Mickey got married,
and all the memorable
alien creatures we met get
to say goodbye and/or be hit
by a hammer by him
one last time?
I love that stuff.
It was the end of both
the lead actor's
and showrunner's tenure on
the series
so they gave a proper send-off
to all the characters
from that era of the show--
some recurring,
others small
but memorable enough
that it was great we got
to see them one last time.
They even bring back Alonso.
Alonso, the guy
from a Christmas special
three years ago
who we didn't see again
comes back to feature
in David Tennant's victory lap
and that's just great.
It got a little bit silly having
the dying Doctor say bye
to everyone before
his heroic sacrifice
actually kicked in,
but it was kind of nice
to remember
how good the story had been
overall until that point.
It's a nice changing
of the guard moment
since the old recurring cast
mostly goes away after
this point along
with the lead actor
and the producers
and lead writer went, too,
so it's kind of cool that
this era of "Doctor Who" got
to say goodbye to itself
in this big way.
It's clear that Moffat sort of
wanted to do that for himself.
Remember that with this
episode's invention of Testimony
Moffat could have written in
a meeting
with almost any character
he wanted ever
because Testimony's literally
a database of every human
who has ever died.
Moffat could bring anyone back
to say bye to them,
but then he discovered that
he hadn't created any characters
worth going back to and finding
and reminding us about.
This is a serious question.
Who else from Moffat's episodes
for the last five years
does anyone actually remember?
Oh, yeah, I really missed
the sinister puddle,
or all eight flavors
of the new Dalek
gumdrop brigade.
Just kidding.
Everyone quietly tried
to forget that redesign
and even Moffat said
they were a mistake.
All the memorable Moffat-written
characters I'd ever want
to see again happened before
he was running it.
So Moffat's opportunity
to say bye to all
of his beloved characters
amounts to Clara,
Nardole, Bill, the first Doctor,
and, what, this Dalek?
Can't even say bye
to Emily Pond either
because Karen Gillan's too busy
on "Jumanji"
or "Guardians of the Galaxy"
or "Untitled Avengers Film."
Now, I really did want
to answer the question
of why Moffat would decide
to have this Dalek
and this planet
in his last episode.
Well, luckily I've tuned
my brain into the dunce
who thinks
he's smart wavelength,
so I know what Moffat
was trying here.
The planet he goes to here
is called Villengard
by the Doctor in a seemingly
throw-away line.
[12TH DOCTOR] The weapon
fortress of Villengard.
[HBOMB] That's actually
a place referred to
in a similar throw-away
line previously
in a part Moffat wrote
for season one back in 2005.
[NINTH DOCTOR] Sonic blaster,
51st century.
Weapon factories of Villengard.
[HBOMB] In fact, I used that
scene in the "Sherlock" video
as an example
of Moffat's good writing.
It was a reference
to something cool
the Doctor did that we never got
to see,
and in retrospect,
is a huge red flag
as to his major problems
as a showrunner,
but it's a kind of line
that works in a show run
like this season was,
where the Doctor actually
does stuff
and interacts with the story.
So it's like Moffat's coming
full circle by having
the Doctor go
in the last episode
he's gonna write
to a place mentioned
in the first episode he wrote.
This is clever
but in a very particular kind
of way.
All it does is make
the few people
who will even get the reference
feel clever
and I remember
a time when "Doctor Who"
had loftier goals than that.
It's not a problem in itself
that he did it or anything.
It's just indicative
of the structural flaws
in his work that he put in
the effort of making references
like this
to his own previous stories
but not enough to write
a story that was good
and worked on its own,
which I think is a flaw.
Moffat is so sort on old
familiar faces
from his run to say goodbye to
that it brings back that Dalek
they ran around inside of
for an episode
and had that scene I used
in the "Sherlock" video
as an example
of really poor writing.
