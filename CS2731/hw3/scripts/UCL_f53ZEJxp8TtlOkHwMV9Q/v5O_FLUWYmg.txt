once again this is the book we're going
to talk not only about
the book today the new one the boy
crisis but also about dr farrell's
career and his goals and his aims and
all of that and so i'd like to introduce
everyone to dr warren farrell and ask
him to tell us what he's up to and why
well i guess what i'm up to is sort of
the evolution of maybe
all that time since 1969 and
when the women's movement surfaced i was
very interested in it and felt that
women really needed to be able to be
equally respected and enter the
workplace and have options open and
i was upset that women were not playing
sports to the degree that i felt that
was creating the benefits to them of
sports and so i started articulating
this and started talking to my
doctoral dissertation advisors about
doing this and their first reaction was
warren the women's movement is just a
fad and i said i don't think so i think
this is the beginning of the change of
of gender roles from both men and for
women and so i
talked with them about that eventually
convinced them that i could change my
dissertation
and that led me to being
seen by now as someone who was a man who
was receptive at a time that the
feminist movement was getting a lot of
um accusations of being man-haters and
so i think i served the purpose of
here's a who here's a man a real-life
flesh man who advocates but we're
advocating here um get up and say what
we're
saying it's going to be harder to call
you a manager and so um the i i started
doing that and then ended up speaking
all around the world on women's issues
and the value of women being secure
enough and competent enough to
be able to share the breadwinning
burdens that men handle um and that was
uh my focus for until the mid 70s and in
the mid 70s i began to see that the
feminist movement um had made a great
deal of progress and
was everyone was sort of getting on
board who was in at least in the sort of
um
middle class above and educated and so
um that was
but it was also a huge number of
divorces occurring and so i began to say
it's important for the children to have
both parents after divorce and
betty friedan and gloria steinem and a
woman named karen de crow agreed with me
but uh now the board i was on the board
of now at that time had gotten elected
as a result of my um advocacy to the
board of now and my fellow um and you
know female
co-workers on the board of now said we
we're at a dilemma here and the dilemma
is that the women are writing us saying
they're going to withdraw from now if
they don't have the option to determine
what happens with the children after
divorce um and uh
we don't want to lose now membership
because it's not only important for
family purposes but for all the other
agendas we have and so i said well the
important thing is not women's rights or
men's rights the important thing is
knowing what's best for the children and
they said yes warren great theory but we
really need to focus on empowering women
and on a broad spectrum and so they
ended up all voting in terms of giving
women the option to be fully involved
with the children or not depending on
under the guise that women know the best
know the children the best and therefore
they know what's best for the children
and so now and i began to have a
significant amount of tension over that
point and betty friedan and gloria
steinem didn't weigh in they weren't on
the board of now and then all the other
boards of nails
around the country began to go the same
way that the new york city now went and
so that led to my um
disengagement um and also i started
forming hundreds of men's groups
one of which i think you know was joined
by john lennon and um and that was uh
that had a big impact on both the people
in the groups and i began to see what
men's pain was and so i began to
articulate men's pain in as well as
women's pain in my um in my
presentations and when i was only
articulating women's pain and women's
challenges i would always almost always
get standing ovations and maybe an
average of three
invitations for a new speaking
engagement and that was helping me live
financially very well um but then when i
started to integrate the perspectives
and feelings of men from the men's
groups there was a lot of i didn't see
those standing ovations why not why not
what fights
for new speaking engagements went from
three to two to one and then eventually
to zero well it seems it seems
self-evident in some sense that if
you're articulating
truthfully and carefully
what would be good for either sex
in some sense you have to be
articulating what would be good for both
i mean unless you view the the
battleground
unless you view reality as a
battleground between the sexes and as
and as a zero-sum game we can't have an
intelligent conversation about what's
good for women or what's good for men we
have to have a conversation about what's
good for men and men and women and women
and men and women
and so why do you think what was your
sense
of why it was when you started to raise
these other issues that you were
that you were immediate immediately
unpopular two questions why do you think
that made you unpopular and
why is it that you so early cottoned on
to the fact that there was something
going on that wasn't exactly
kosher in relationship to
now's push for for
for a particular kind of family
structure and a particular view of
women's rights
yes yeah i i think what happened for me
was um
i i just when i started focusing on what
was best for children and then i began
to
we only had minimal amount of research
up for that at that point in time this
is your early 70s and but we had enough
for me to make a case to the board and
when i saw the resistance the degree to
which um there's there was two things
happening one is we
we don't want to lose our power base we
don't ever want to have a woman say
whatever option she wants should be
closed to her and so i began to see that
the women's movement was caring more
about women than they were caring about
the children that was the first
disillusionment that i had okay so your
first your first ethical point in some
sense is that when you're speaking about
families and you have to balance the
rights and responsibilities of men women
and children that it makes sense to you
to put children's well-being first and
foremost and then to to
place men and women as individuals say
or perhaps even as a couple below that
yes exactly what i was saying was that
freedom of choice is wonderful but when
you make the freedom of choice to have a
child
you then start prioritizing the needs of
the child you made but you knew that
those needs were going to be the child's
needs first
when you made that free choice so it
wasn't like you were coerced into the
into or pressured into making that
choice you made the free choice to have
a child that incorporates the need to
put the child's perspectives before
yours that's part of your free choice
right so it's basically the freedom
there is the freedom to take on a
certain kind of relatively permanent
responsibility and then to abide by that
come hell or high water essentially into
the future
that the children should not respect the
parents needs because part of what i
talked about in the boy crisis is that
uh ain't nobody happy you know um that
everybody has to be happy in a family
and that and that part of choosing a
child to be responsible is to choosing
the child not just to have its needs met
but to also
care about what whether what their moms
or dad's needs are being met as well and
that has to be very primary and primal
and introduced early um but that the uh
and then secondly um i i also felt
and betty ferdan felt this way also that
the women's movement would never go as
far as it could go unless the unless men
were equally involved and proud of being
involved in the fathering role because a
woman who has to take on the entire
response a woman who wants to break
glass ceilings and go as far as she can
but also wants children can't do that
all if the man is working full-time and
she's working full-time either the
children get neglected or um you know or
something something has to go and so
women will often say to me you know i
want to be a habitable woman and i say
you can be a habit all woman revere find
a man who wants to be home full-time
with the children and let's reshape
society so we're saying that that men
are not only worrier warriors that we
that we praise and call heroes when they
go to war and they die for us but
they're also warriors if they choose if
you if you choose a man who wants to be
fully involved with the child let's
honor him and respect him because we
know that the the social bribes that we
gave men to die allowed men to be
willing to sacrifice their lives in
exchange for being called hero uh well
if we if we reframe
being a father as being a different type
of hero men will follow because men
basically go wherever the praise goes
okay okay so in the 70s so you started
to put forward the case for children and
to some degree as well simultaneously
the case for fathers and you received a
fair bit of resistance as a consequence
of that and it sounds like
the way you're setting up the argument
is that the conflict
what was the conflict though was it that
the the women who
were being appealed to by now wanted
untrammeled freedom of choice for them
under all circumstances
the reason i'm asking is because if you
have children obviously half the
children you have are female and you'd
assume that if it was a matter of of
women's opening up what would be best
for women in any kind of medium to
long-term manner that the concerns about
daughters would be perhaps even if it
isn't concerns about sons it would be
concerns about daughters that would
emerge as paramount even over the
concerns of the mother so so what is it
that was i still don't exactly get why
it was that you weren't being successful
because it it doesn't make sense
because the pri
the priority there was two things
happening simultaneously one was such a
strong emphasis on freedom and the
freedom manifested in two areas one is
in the area of divorce in divorce the
women were often saying i i don't like
my husband i want to start a new life i
want to be able to move out of state if
i wish to to get a job that i want or my
new husband my new husband or boyfriend
has a has a wants to move out of state
and so i want to be able to take my
children or child with me um because and
and and i know what's best for my child
which would be like the you know medical
community saying we don't want women to
be participating in the medical
community because we know what's best
for for the patient and not not
not that women might have a separate um
contribution to make on the other hand
there was the
that there was women who wanted to have
the freedom to be able to have children
without being married um and so 53 of
women under 30 today who have children
in the united states have children
without being married and the belief was
again that women knew what was best for
the children so
we could they they could take this on if
they wanted to and if they couldn't find
a man that they really wanted that they
could raise the child by themselves or
the children by themselves okay so so
part of it was actually driven by
questioning the necessity of the nuclear
family as the smallest viable unit
and part of that
hey that's correct but and b
the feminist community started um when
when i would go to feminist rallies and
so on uh there would be many books about
you know lenin and the the
nuclear family being the the
patriarchal
that were oppressing women and so there
so i think the feminist the feminist
movement grew out of two huge iterations
one was the civil rights movement where
there was an oppressor and an oppressed
then there was the um the the
the movement of um
not just civil rights but um
after the fem after the civil rights
movement came the
the
marxism and the belief that there were
oppressors and oppressed in among
marxists and a lot of the feminist
movement the early feminist movement was
very we had groups like red stockings
and many other groups like that that
were socialist worker party type
feminists that very much believed in
marxism and they had the dichotomy of
oppressor versus oppressed so when it
came to men men because we earned more
we because our biological not our
biological but our socialized and
biological responsibility was to earn
the money and do that type of nature of
providing
the feminist movement looked at the fact
that we earned more money once we had
children and so therefore we must be the
oppressor like those
like the bourgeoisie of marxism and
women must be the oppressed so you have
two things happening simultaneously this
belief that the oppressors are wanting
to be equally involved with the children
and then secondly men having no idea
why they had value
third men who the very few men that did
study the value of being a father and
how important it was to children
um didn't speak up about it and women
can't hear what men don't say so
we had this world then where women were
sharing the burden of about breadwinning
but no one was even interested in asking
the question about whether men could
share the burden from women of of of
earning of providing equally for the
family and and women weren't even
interested in that because they were so
focused on their freedom and saw men as
the oppressor and so there was no space
to
articulate the value of fathers and men
in the family okay so well you know your
terminology is interesting too because
you're attributing the
the desire of the women who were pushing
against what you were saying say
um you're attributing that to a desire
to freedom but it seems to me that you
could easily use irresponsibility as a
terminology there you know because
free well freedom without concern for
the medium to long-term consequences of
your actions especially when you're
bringing in
when you're dealing with minors when
you're dealing with children that's not
freedom that's irresponsibility
that is absolutely irresponsibility and
that is where we as a society have
failed to come in and say
um you know first of all whenever either
sex wins that is a woman wins custody
for example whenever either sex wins
both sexes lose and it's worse than that
whether whenever either sex wins both
sexes lose and in the case of family the
children lose enormously
and we also need to sort of understand
exactly what is it that that that lead
to children doing so much better when
they have fathers involved i was i
started researching that and they ended
up as you know with the boy crisis ended
up with more than 70 different ways that
when children have
their father involved in it about an
equal way
that they do so much better than well it
would be a lovely thing if you could
detail out some of that now and then
we'll go back to the
the political ideological story here but
but see one of the things that's
happened in ontario recently is that
we've our our government has introduced
legislation that is predicated on on the
idea that all families are equal
and the
the idea behind that you could argue is
laudable
i i wouldn't argue that but you could
argue it
that
you know people have a variety of ways
of solving the problem of having
children and that there's a variety of
viable solutions to that problem and
that no one family
organizational type should be
privileged above the others i mean i
suppose with the exception of
multi-partner marriages which we we
still
don't approve of let's say
the problem with that as far as i can
tell is that it does appear from the
research that the nuclear family is this
my smallest viable unit which is not to
say that
there aren't single mothers or single
fathers who do an admirable job under
trying conditions but part of the
problem this is a deep problem is that
whenever you
whenever you posit something as a value
so you might say well we want intact
families mother and father that's that
that's the value we're heading for
because that seems to be best for the
children then you produce a rank order
of accordance with that and the people
who aren't in accordance with that value
you can easily make a case that they're
being discriminated against and we're in
a situation in our society now where
even if the discrimination occurs let's
say because of the pursuit of an
admirable value it's regarded as
prejudicial and i think that's fed by
that underlying hypothesis that was
anti-nuclear family that
any sort of hierarchical structure is
