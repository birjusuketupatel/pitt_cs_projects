Who's a professor at NYU and I have him here for a bunch of reasons
Jonathan is an extremely interesting researcher. I've been following his work on disgust and political belief for
Literally for decades he was one of the first people who
started to do serious research on disgust which is its own emotional system and therefore very much worth attending to
But we also have some other
interests in common Jonathan also
Started this institute called the Heterodox Academy
Which is attempting to bring back a reasonable diversity of views or what he regards as a reasonable diversity of views to
University faculty and and campuses and discussions, so I first met Jonathan
It's gonna be just about 30 years ago
25 years ago in
2014 yeah I'm sorry it was in 1994 was in 1994 yeah yeah right right so yeah
You came to do a job talk at Harvard to for an assistant professorship position
and I had been aware of your work on disgust then and and
Agitated hard for them to hire you because I thought it was of great significance
Which turned out to be exactly the case, so what do you remember about that?
I Remember I was so excited to have an interview at Harvard. It was my only interview. If I didn't get that job
I had no job for the following year, and it was a very strange day in which I didn't feel particularly
Welcomed or wanted, and then I had my session with you in which it was this guy who was it he had it
He actually got a job at Harvard, and he was studying Jung which is like almost taboo
And he was talking about dreams and creativity
And so I just that was the really bright that was the bright memory of the day was our hour-long conversation
Yeah, well I was also really interested at the time man now in in the biological basis of behavior right and so and and in
in the relationship between fundamental motivational systems and thought because
Obviously our thought is grounded in fundamental motivational systems and your work on disgust
Which maybe you can tell the viewers a little bit about was really interesting to me because it was an emotional system that
Hadn't been studied much. I mean you were really one of the pioneers in the in the psychological study of disgust
Well the way to explain it is that Paul Rozin, my advisor at Penn is
The pioneer in the study of disgust, and he'd studied it as a food-related emotion
he'd written a bit about it being a moral emotion and I was a graduate student at Penn and
I was interested in morality, and I was reading the Bible and I was reading
anthropological accounts of different countries and different cultures and at the time morality was all about
Reasoning, about harm, rights and justice so Lawrence Kohlberg was the leading figure in the field and because I was looking at morality across cultures
And when you look across cultures
It's not just about fairness and harm and rights, it's about menstruation and food taboos and skin lesions
And it's very physical, and I was you know why why do so many
Societies why is it like the normal default way of being is to somehow bring the body into morality?
Why is that and so I just happened to be at Penn where the world's expert in
disgust was I went to talk to him and that started one of the best collaborations of my life and
What it led to is is a broadening of the of the moral domain basically, there's a sort of Western
Secular approach that you see in Western philosophers either morality is about harm and utilitarianism
It's minimize harm, or it's about rights and principles
Immanuel Kant and
a
Much better way psychologically, I think about morality is virtue ethics. It's just a lot of stuff
it's just we have just a lot of stuff that we judge on and
This led me eventually to realize that people on the left and people on the right
Care about different stuff everybody cares about harm and fairness
But the stuff about keeping you know boundaries around the group build a wall protect the group hold the group together
hate traitors
You know everybody can do that
But right wing morality builds on these additional additional foundations of these additional emotions and foundations
So that work on disgust that I was just beginning to talk about then when we first met in
1994 led eventually to what we now call moral foundations theory and with my-- with about five or six
colleagues if you go to yourmorals.org
You can take our test you can learn all about it
But it led to the perspective that
Ultimately was I think the right perspective as the cultural war was heating up and as left and right
We're essentially becoming like different countries different cultures
So so it's not obvious on
first
Consideration why disgust would be a moral emotion so you know most of the work
That's done. That's outside of the disgust realm
I would say is predicated on the assumption that the reason that conservatives in particular
But perhaps people who are more authoritarian in general draw boundaries around their territories
Because they're afraid of the other
But that isn't really that isn't really how it plays out as far as I can tell because conservatives for example are less neurotic than
Trait in the big five traits sense than liberals although. It's um
It's a minor difference
But the disgust issue seems to be particularly relevant, so so can you tell us a little bit about why disgust per se?
Well first conservatives are a little less neurotic
But they also at if you do very low level perceptual experiment just like a puff of white noise in the ear
People who react more strongly to that to any sort of very low level threat are more likely to vote Republican in this country
So they're you know there are all these interesting personality differences that lead to different politics, but as for why disgust?
So I'm I'm a Durkheimian. I would say I love the
Sociologist Ã‰mile Durkheim, and I'm also a social psychologist
So I'm always thinking not about people as individual utility maximizers
But people as members of social groups people who are totally focused on
Belonging in their social groups and people who have some pro-social motives about keeping the group together
About doing things that are good for the group, so as I try to argue in my book The Righteous Mind. Yes
We're selfish
There's no doubt that we often will do things to advance our own self-interest at the expense of others
But we're also really group-ish which means we'll do all sorts of things to advance our group at the expense of others
Basically, we're tribal. We evolved as a tribal species and we're doing we have all this software. I would say oh, there's all these
predispositions
predispositions for life in in tribes that are battling other tribes
And that's why it comes out so easily if you look at the way boys organize themselves when they get a fraternity
The hazing rituals when you look at the way
It's especially clear in boys the way street gangs organize themselves girls tribalism is a little different
But I would say this is and that's why again. I love the Jungian approach of archetypes there's something
There's just this weird stuff that is pan-human
Even if it comes out slightly differently around the world there really is a human nature
And it comes complete with a whole bunch of like pre-designed ideas, so there was a new article
I think it was published in Nature. I'll try to find a link for it. It's about a year old
That was based on
high-resolution imaging of
Neuronal connections, and it's actually reviewed in Kurzweil's book How to [Create] a Mind
I think that's the name of it
And so it turns out that the cortex is made out of these columnar structures that are pre-organized units of neurons
And they're replicated across the entire cortex. It's basically the same structure and like the
The older let's say Connectionist idea was that neurons that fire together wire together right that's happening of course
That's pretty standard neurology, but the the columns are already pre-wired, so it's actually columns that fire together that wire together
But there's but there's even more with the high-resolution scanning, so it turns out that underneath the columnar structure there are these pre-built
Highways that are connected connective tissue that are pre
pre-prepared so the columns have the option to
connect to the to the underlying highway, and then that highway can connect to other columns, so it's as if
Implicit in the brain organization, and this is at the cortical levels say nothing of subcortical organization. There's already
preexistent
Likelihoods that certain neurons will fire will wire together. Yeah, so and and what else is cool is that this is actually
architecturally quite
Regular, so they found that the these super highways are arranged in lines, and and and and in
At right angles to one another so it's almost like a three-dimensional structure of wired cubes that underlies the neuronal structure
So that's some neurological evidence for the archetypal idea, so let me just explain to explain to the viewers here
Why this isn't just some like
psychological geek conversation
This is actually really relevant to a lot of the things that we'll be talking about and that your audience probably cares about
because one of the most contested ideas in the social sciences is the idea of innateness and
Yeah, the idea is well
If something is innate then it can't it can't vary across societies, and if it varies across societies
then it's not innate and if gender varies if
Masculinity or femininity vary across societies then it's not innate
It's socially constructed
But that's the wrong understanding of innateness
The definition that I use comes from Gary Marcus who was actually a neuroscientist here at NYU
He says innate doesn't mean hardwired is almost nothing interesting
That's hardwired innate means structured in advance of experience
But then experience can still revise it and boy does that work for gender for almost everything
Yeah, that's right almost everything that we're not a blank slate about anything and something I used to tell my students at UVA I taught
At UVA for 16 years is you know everything's a social construction
masculinity femininity
Cancer the Sun death everything
There's a social construction for you won't find a society that doesn't have thoughts about these things
but the fact that societies have social constructions tells us nothing about whether there's not also an
Underlying biological reality and in almost all cases there is well otherwise we wouldn't be able to communicate which is one of EO Wilson's
Comments right when I mean Wilson is the entomologist to study ants at Harvard and also wrote number of books about
Sociobiology that got him in trouble with the radical leftists
And he said even if we could communicate with ants there would be nothing to say to each other because their
Fundamental mode of being in the world is based on
Motivations and interests that are so different from ours that there wouldn't be any structure for communication
And you can kind of tell that with regards to the animals that we make friends with right
We're much more likely to make friends with animals who has a who have a fundamental biological and social nature
That's very close to ours like dogs because we can basically speak their language even though not completely
A mammal language of love and you know I miss you, and I want to play you yeah, that's right
Yeah, exactly and that bonding. Yeah, okay, so back to discuss back to discuss so
So the fundamental thing that I learned from Paul Rozin is to see us as these amazing omnivores
This is part of our survival strategy even more than other other Apes
We are just brilliant omnivores, and we have the Omnivore's Dilemma, which is we've got to be interested in all kinds of new stuff
We're not tied to any place we can roam on to a whole new continent, so we're interested in stuff
But stuff has all kinds of toxins and microbes so we have to be careful about that stuff
And so these motives have to be in tension
And this is actually an interesting way to understand the left-right difference you have to have both motives
But if so imagine two siblings one of whom is set more towards trying new stuff seeking out new stuff
And the other is a little more fearful
Then we're like whoa no let's you know let's not try that let's stay with what's tried-and-true
I mean that's progressivism and conservatives, and that's the origins of it
And if you look at kids behavior at the age of two or three it does predict
How they'll vote much later not hugely, but there is a clear prediction there, so
so disgust is part of a regulatory system about our engagement with the world and whether we are just sort of out there and
You know we we seek out variety and diversity
We think diversity is just a great thing or whether we want a little more order structure predictability
conservatives are neater than
progressives if you take photos of their rooms
You know you can actually you know cleanliness and organization you can predict how they vote
Disgust it turns out what's really cool about disgust in modern politics is if you look at all the different things that we're fighting over
Especially in this country our culture wars over. You know going back a few decades
You know sex, drugs, the flag, immigration all of these things
I have a study with my colleagues which was led by Sena
Koleva in which we asked all these cultural war attitudes of people and we also had their scores in the disgust scale
But one of the foundations of morality is sanctity and purity and it relates to disgust
What we found is that if you know if you know
What people's left-right how they place themselves in a left-right scale you can pretty much predict where they fall out on most culture war
Attitudes except for those that load on or implicate sanctity or purity so what I mean is
flag-burning, okay
Do you think you know do you think that people should have the right to burn the American flag or the country's flag as an
Expression as a political action. What do you think people just give some answer on a one to seven scale and
People on the right think you know more like they say no people on the left with yes
People who score high on loyalty are more likely to say no people who lower on it
Say yes, and that's even taking account of where they're on the left-right dimension, but here's the cool thing
It's only if you add in the purity or sanctity thing that you can really understand
What people are doing because some people see the flag not as just a piece of cloth
They see it as having some innate essence some something sacred about it
Which must be protected and so so this is
They think of it as a unifying center. Exactly, that's right
So if there's something sacred and this is that this is the central piece of my work around
Politics and morality is the psychology of sanctity
If you hold something sacred then your team circles around it and it's only
Those who circle around with you and sometimes literally circle around like Muslims at prayer in Mecca
They literally Circle the Kaaba circling is a very primitive ancient
It feels right to circle something, but even if even if you do it symbolically or you all bow at the same time
That binds you together. Children do that with their mothers when they when they engage in exploratory behavior, right well
They use their mother as a center of the world and children differ in the degree to which they'll move outward from their mothers
So they move out until they they they trip over there their uncertainty threshold
Is it a distance like it's a distance?
And so so the more exploratory kids who are lower in negative emotion will go out farther before they come back to their mother
So the mother's a center
And you know that that would be associated
Symbolically with the idea of the center as a motherland or potentially as a fatherland
That's right that makes sense so this way that we're we are incredibly symbolic creatures
we're not just out to make as much money as we can we're
Symbolic and social creatures and this psychology of sanctity or purity has become really
Not just on the right. It's always been important for
Especially religious conservatives, we're beginning to see it even on the campus left
and this is why I think we see some of the odd things we see on campus that the
Campus must be kept as a sacred and pure space
One of the things that really alarms me about what's happened on campus the last couple of years is that
The older idea we had that it's a place for contesting ideas
It's a it's a zone of enormous choice people can take what courses they want to say what they want it's kind of a wonderful
free-for-all with some with norms of respect it's now becoming much more of a religious zone where the perimeter of the campus is the
Boundaries and within it's there are almost they're blasphemy laws basically
And I really started noticing this when you look at the videos of the Middlebury
protests when Charles Murray spoke at Middlebury and
As everybody knows he was shouted down so the students are chanting and they're chanting in unison
And it seems like a religious revival meeting and they're swaying and they're saying their sacred you know racist, sexist
Anti-gay, Charles Murray, go away. It's like a ritual incantation
So that all-- to define the space as safe, and it's safe and look I'm the maternal warden
So far all this happening is they're binding together
They're moving at you know synchronous movement and call and response so it it's using a lot of tropes from religion and religious worship
But here's the cool thing
When the administrator I forget who it is comes on to say
okay, we have moved we're moving the talk and
Then you hear a couple people screaming out "off campus, off campus"
And he says to another location on campus, and there's like oh no no
Because you know look no one had to go to this talk so everyone could have just stayed home
And the students did succeed in shutting down the venue, so they could have declared a victory
But it's not a full victory unless he is physically off the campus
We can't have him speaking on campus because that defiles us that pollutes us
We must shut that down, and that's where I started saying wow this is like full-blown
psychology of religion, Durkheim, sanctity, purity, blasphemy
And that I think you know that doesn't describe most students that that describes a sort of the core those who
Really have their identities wrapped up in this movement. Okay, so so with disgust
I wanted to I wanted to ask you a couple things about that so you
Know the Big Five research into political differences basically shows that the liberals are high in trait openness and low on trait
Conscientiousness, and the Conservatives are the reverse
but we've fragmented conscientiousness into orderliness and industriousness with a Big Five aspect scale and
Orderliness is strongly associated with disgust
So so right, right?
Right exactly it does sound a lot like Freud
but it but it also is in accordance with your observations that conservatives have neater spaces for example, so
So now in-- and their meetings start on time-- yes, and yeah exactly right right so
So then the the nexus for political beliefs seems to be openness. So that's that exploratory tendency that you talked about
exploration of ideas and creativity and low
Orderliness and so then I thought well why in the world would why would the political nexus go across those dimensions which are some
Relatively uncorrelated then I thought and this is in keeping with your work on disgust is that it's an issue of
Borders which of course seems more or less self-evident in the wake of Trump's election when he talked about borders
But you might say
And I think this is reasonable that the conservative is someone who wants the borders between
categories to remain intact no matter what level of analysis
so it's borders from the highest resolution level of cognition all the way up to the actual physical borders of
rooms, towns
States, countries all of that so the borders should be thicker and the reason they want that
Now there was a paper published in PLOS ONE. I don't know if you saw it it was a couple of years ago
It was a mind-boggling paper
It should have been like front page news as far as I was concerned and what the researchers did was between countries and then within
provinces or states within countries they correlated the level of
of
Frequency of infectious disease with authoritarian political beliefs and
Found a walloping correlation was like 0.6
It was one of the highest by that for those of you who don't know social scientists never discover anything
That's associated with anything else at a correlation of 0.6
Other than heritability right other than heritability yes
and so what they found was that the higher the prevalence of infectious disease the higher the probability of of
Totalitarian or authoritarian political attitudes, and then they controlled for governance because one of the questions was was this top-down
authoritarianism or bottom-up authoritarianism and the answer was that it was bottom-up okay, and so I thought about that in -
from two perspectives
Simultaneously at the time, okay, so we identified disgust sensitivity with orderliness
So it's a a fundamental sub trait, and I was reading this book that was called Hitler's Table Talk
And it was a it was the recordings of virtually everything he said at dinner from 1939 to 1942 - yeah
so it's a spontaneous utterance assay and
It's full of discussions about Jews and gypsies and all the people he tormented, but what's really interesting is all the language is disgust
It's not fear so so Hitler's basic metaphor was that the Aryan race
And country was a pure body and that it was assaulted by
Parasites right and then I remembered what happened to the Native Americans when the Europeans showed up and shook hands
What happened was that 95% of them were dead within 50 years right because of smallpox and measles and so that
That border issue that separates conservatives from liberals. Let's say as the Conservatives say
The novel is potentially contaminated. It's not so much that it's dangerous. That's different. That's fear
It's contaminating and the Liberals say hold on a minute if you make the borders too thick then information can't pass through. Exactly
So that's the Omnivore's Dilemma right there. Right right and and then since we have a biological
Architecture on which our cognitive platforms are erected
We have the same attitude towards abstract information, which would be ideas that we do to
things like food or illness
This right right and so we can think of an invading idea or a polluting idea or a contaminating idea. That's right. Now
I'm a big fan of George Lakoff, Metaphors We Live By
That we yeah
We use our bodily our
Bodily schemata to think about abstract things like politics and like what our policies should be about borders and immigration
There's a Canadian psychologist, Mark Schaller, he and his colleagues have developed what they call an account of these the behavioural immune system
Yeah, right that we don't just try to you know
Microbes killed probably many more of our ancestors than did lions and tigers and bears and so whoever can keep themselves and their children
From being exposed to fatal illnesses wins the evolutionary game and so a lot of that is
Judging carefully about people is he dangerous, is she dangerous and that's both for sexuality, for contact, for all kinds of association
So yeah in a lot of ways our emotions and our bodily interactions structure
how we think and feel about about social interactions
Well even with the black death in Europe
I mean so the black death occurred in Europe when the Europeans started to move around the world and they brought back rats that were
Infected exactly so so what you saw there was both of those forces at work at the same time so the European expansion
produced a tremendous
Interchange of ideas from all around the world that's globalization
But it wiped out somewhere between 30 and 60 percent of the population at the same time
So wouldn't it be good if in every society or every organization we had some people who specialized in
Specialized in saying "hey, what are the opportunities?" and then we had other people who specialized in saying "well
But what are the risks?" and it just so happens that a lot of people have trouble doing all that in themselves
When we have systems that are well constituted with people who have different
Personalities and different motives and goals we actually can get better outcomes. We can have a discussion between them
Yeah
well
That's exactly why that
it's it's for that precise reason that
That I've been so interested in free speech as a as a value because well even on the economic front
it's pretty obvious if you look at things economically that the
entrepreneur types who start businesses are lumped in with the liberal creative types
We've done a lot of work on the prediction of entrepreneurial behavior and ability and it's openness. That's the big predictor
It's not the only one its openness an IQ fundamentally but for managerial and administrative
expertise it's oh
It's IQ and conscientiousness so the Liberals start businesses and and but they can't run them
Because their their their interest's flipped, and they don't have the organizational ability and the Conservatives can run them
But they can't continue to transform and expand them it yin, and yang yin, and yang, yeah
so so
One more thing about what happened in Nazi Germany
That that's very relevant and interesting because it's it's useful to get these motives right you know
first of all if if something disgusts you if something if you're afraid of something then you run away from it or you freeze
But if something disgusts you you try to burn it or kill it right you try to get rid of it or
Expel it that's that's right though. You want to get it away and destroy it
What so when Hitler first came to power he
Put in a bunch of public health schemes like he had vans that went around and screen people for tuberculosis
then he went on a
factory cleanliness
campaign
So the factories were supposed to be tidied up
And he washed, he bathed about four times a day by the way, he was also a great worshipper of willpower which is associated with
Orderliness and seems maybe to be associated with disgust sensitivity in some way that isn't yet understood
Yeah, yeah
I don't I don't understand that connection either
so they he convinced factory owners in Germany to get rid of the rats and the mite and mice and the and the
Insects in the factories and also to clean them up and beautify them
But the gas they used to clean up the factories was Zyklon-A and
It was the variation of that gas, Zyklon-B
That was then used in yeah, so you could see this ramping up, eh. So it was yeah absolutely
So it was public health, then it was
Social cleanliness, then he went into the asylums and cleaned them up
And so it was just this expansion of of who was contaminated and who was impure
and I think also his fascination with fire and his use of fire symbolism was also associated with that with that appeal to
purification because the whole idea of purification by fire is a very ancient idea so
okay, so
so how did your work on disgust change the way that you looked at things
Fundamentally, I mean you gave some indication of that already, but what else has it changed
so
since I was coming out of a
Psychological literature that was very focused on on sort of secular
secular ethics about justice and fairness, and then I began studying disgust and
Looking at the broader moral domain that almost all societies have
That then also led me to think about well. Okay, if disgust is a reaction to things that seem to be
Degrading so an interesting element of disgust is this notion of degradation there are always these vertical metaphors
In which disgust brings us down and and disgust it so a lot of some religious practice and Judaism and Islam
and and Hinduism is about preparing your body to approach God and
Purification and so that led me to think well if there's an emotion which is about seeing our lower, base or animal
Biological nature is there an opposite emotion is there an emotion of that we feel when we see some manifestation or a higher
Nobler nature, and I was just beginning to think this when I moved to UVA. I got my first job at the University of Virginia
1995 and I read the set of Thomas Jefferson's letters and in one letter he describes
He describes the feelings you get from reading great fiction
He advises a cousin of his that he should buy fiction for his library. Not just you know serious works of law and philosophy
And he described he says doesn't he describe the feeling of
Of having your sentiments be elevated does it not dilate your breast, give you an open feeling in your chest
When you see these acts of beauty and kindness and gratitude. I thought wow that's exactly it
And so because I've been studying disgust. I then started studying its opposite, which I and some others called moral elevations
So there's kind of vertical metaphor of elevation and degradation-- maps onto the body too with regards to-- that's right high, low
clean, dirty
yeah, it's a beautiful pairing and so having this language of elevation and disgust just really has helped me see a lot of things I
Just I could just see a lot of things happening it allows me to like
even you know manipulate like if I'm applying for a grant proposal like I get very good at like having an
elevating ending you know to
to end with a notable uplift
And so it just broadened, it just broadened by thinking about morality and this was around 1995 and so again
It just prepared me so that
And I'd already been to India by that point I spent three months doing research in Orissa in eastern India
So it just broadened my thinking and that's what allowed me
Finally to understand conservatives because I had always been on the left. I hated Ronald Reagan
I
Thought Republicans were stupid and evil and it was only when I'd gone to India and really tried to understand a traditional
religious
Hierarchical, gender stratified society tried to understand it in their terms
They didn't try to just bring in my own my own Western left. You know left-leaning perspectives
That I was and this was all under the guidance of Richard Shweder, my postdoc supervisor at the University of Chicago, where I did a postdoc
It was only then that I was able to
Sort of get inside their minds and their moral system and see that there were alternative moral worlds
They each had their own logic and that was the metaphor I came to it. You know the time
You know The Matrix movies were very popular so the metaphor, The Matrix as a consensual hallucination
Made a lot of sense. It's waking up with the idea of just speaking with moral matrices
Which every different moral matrices. That are grounded in biology
They're biology in the sense that gives us the potential it's like the building blocks of this matrix
Can't be just anything that comes it comes from our
experiences our embodied experiences and again George Lakoff is the master of that thinking and so it was only then that
that I was able to now listen to conservative talk radio and
Christian religious radio and see rather than just saying oh those stupid terrible people say like oh wow yeah
You know I can see that they're striving for a certain virtues. Right right so you started to understand their metaphorical language essentially
That's right, and that was like kind of like my you know I know great awakening or scales falling from my eyes
But you know since well it took a few more you took a number of a lot more years
But eventually I kind of just like pulled out the implants from my eyes
And I stopped seeing everything so through a partisan lens
And I'm not on any side now and just trying to understand what the hell is well. It's really useful
It's really useful to understand that there are
Actual reasons why people see the world differently and that you can't just easily say that one is right
and the other is wrong because
The Liberals are correct when it comes to borders that if you thicken them too much and diminish the information flow
You risk making the society so static that any radical
Environmental transformation will sink it it's the case
But the Conservatives are right in that you pay a big price
with regards to newcomers and new information with regards to risk to exposure to
contaminating, well to contamination period but also to
contaminating ideas and so then I've always thought you know the the
Environment itself moves back and forth like a snake in some sense and what we're trying to do is stay on the center of its
back
And the only way we can do that is by people
By having people pull to the right and say be careful and people pull to the left and say well
Yeah
but be open with that dialogue and the the
exchange of information that that dialogue allows we can maybe specify the center of that moving target and stay and stay
Well and stay on the back
Yeah, okay, so that's a really complicated metaphor with the snake
But I think it's a perfect way in to what's going on on campus and to why viewpoint diversity is so important because that's I
agree exactly with what you just said and
So what I the view that I've come to in studying moral psychology, is that we is that humans are
ultra social Apes
We we evolved to live in these small groups that are fighting with each other
We evolved to have these low-level animistic religions. That's our steady state. That's the way we were for at least 100,000 years or much more
probably closer to a million in some form
So that's sort of our design. That's what we were designed for in a sense
and
In that sense where as individuals were really kind of stupid tribal creatures designed to do post hoc reasoning
But if you put us together in the right way with the right checks with the right the right systems
The the whole can be vastly smarter than the components that go into it
Which is true of the brain - the brain is composed of neurons each neurons really kind of a stupid little switch
But you put them together in the right way, and you get something really brilliant and in the same way
I don't know all the history here, but my understanding is that science begins or
the culture of science the scientific revolution begins in Europe
In the 17th century as you begin getting you get the printing press so people can share their ideas
but you get communities of people who are challenging each other's ideas and
That's what makes it so brilliant is that is that people have to do their best
We're really bad at disconfirming our own ideas
It's very hard to make it's very hard to do that, but you put your ideas out there and then
Everyone else is motivated to challenge them and so if you put us together in the right way the truth comes out and so adversarial
systems of law
Journalists know this they have to listen to both sides
Scientists know this social scientists should know this okay, what happened well
The Academy has has always leaned left in the 20th century
But leaning isn't the problem
So people think oh viewpoint diversity. We need we need everybody we need Nazis. We need every view. No we don't need everybody
What we need is no orthodoxy
That's what's fatal
orthodoxy
so if you have if you have to field like sociology or
Social psychology in which it's two or three to one left to right that's totally fine with me. That's totally fine
Because if someone makes some claim, that's just like ideologically blind
Someone will say you know common sense other evidence that you've missed and then the system works
But what what I learned when I started down this road in 2011 I gave a talk
at a big conference of social psychologists
I gave a talk about this problem that we're losing our diversity that I
Could only find one conservative in the entire field. I gave a talk on this
and
And
So what I've learned since then is that
The ratio in psychology was between two to one and four to one left-right all the way up to the early 90s
We've gathered together all the studies we could find so all the way up to the early 90s
It's only three or four to one left or right which would be okay?
but then between 1995 or four and 2010 it goes to
14 to 1. You do you have any idea why and why that time? Yes, so
So you get the same story whether you look at
republican-democrat ratios or liberal-conservative
They're they tell the same story so the two the big things going on there are one
Is that the Greatest Generation which had a lot of Republicans
so a lot of men go off to World War Two, they they're on the GI Bill they enter the Academy in the
1950s a lot of them are conservative or republican
So you have a lot of them
but in the 60s and 70s one of the main reasons to go to grad school in the social sciences is either a)
To stay in school to escape the Vietnam War draft or b) to fight for social justice and against racism
so in sociology and psychology in particular in political science
Maybe I'm not sure you get a huge influx of left-leaning people who are there to pursue
Social justice, so you know the motives are fine, and if it was balanced to be totally fine
but
As you get these young junior people on the Left come in in the 70s and 80s
And then you get the older people that are more politically balanced retiring in the 80s and 90s
By the time you get to the late 90s, it's all Baby Boomers. And so do you get a
Do you get a positive feedback loop developing in there? Like you said it's like three to one
It's okay
But maybe when it hits four to one it goes to like twenty to one? Then you said exactly so you so
Then you start getting hostile climate so I wrote a review paper on this with
with Joe Duarte and Phil Tetlock and Lee Jussim, Jarret Crawford
and
And we
So we reviewed everything that we could find we concluded that
Most of what's going on is self selection that is people on the Left, and we're open to experience they're always gonna
Get self selection, but then there's really good evidence that there's also hostile climate
I mean, it's it's undeniable now that if you are not on the left in a grad program
There's just constant little subtle or not so subtle reminders that you don't belong and look in the Academy
We're all about saying hey, if there are subtle hints here and there you can't succeed right
I mean, that's what we do for a living is we say that little things will stop people
Well little things are put in the way of anyone who doesn't fit politically
And so you do get hostile climate you do get overt discrimination
There's evidence of that and then there is also
It is part of the story here that what it means to be a conservative in the 90s and especially two thousands has changed so
It is true that
You know that that conservatives were not in any way anti-science
until much more recent times now actually all sides are anti science about different Sciences, but
in America the the right wing the Republican Party had
