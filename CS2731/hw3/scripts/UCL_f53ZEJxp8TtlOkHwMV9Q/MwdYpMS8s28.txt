I know that today's lecture has
generated a great deal of Interest as is
evident from The Pact Hall here today
it's also generated a certain amount of
heat
the proposed topic the rising tide of
compelled speech in Canada
is for many a controversial one
and I know that many of you in the
audience will hold widely Divergent
views
I fully support your opportunity to be
heard and should you wish challenge the
speakers to defend their positions
I know that today's speakers likewise
share this conviction
and will welcome your comments and
questions
as might be appropriate for a lecture
series named after Liberty
I believe it is also important for me to
affirm at the outset that the core
values of the faculty of law end of
Queen's University include academic
freedom and respectful dialogue among
those with differing views
this includes providing our speakers
with the opportunity to be heard
and providing all of you with the
opportunity to respond
in a respectful environment free from
any harassment or any attempts to shut
down the conversation
so it is in this Spirit of free and
respectful academic exchange that I am
pleased to launcher this new lecture
series
and welcome again and Welcome to our
guest and I look forward to our
discussion thank you
[Applause]
thank you Bill
welcome and thank you for coming
I would like to underline what Bill said
which is that this event would not have
happened without the initiative and
support of Greg piazewski so Greg thank
you very much
as well before we start I would like to
thank some people from The Faculty of
law Diane Butler Adam Blake gallipol and
Christina ulian for their help in
putting this together
I would also like to acknowledge the
support help and generous assistance of
several people around the university uh
Lisa plater and Event Services
David Patterson and the campus security
office

straightforward and I thank you very
much for making this possible
I would also like to return to
Dean Flanagan's observation about the
importance of this moment
and to acknowledge the role that both
Dean Flanagan and principal wolf have
played in enhancing the reputation of
this University in terms of its
commitment to academic freedom and
academic debate
they have
reflected an unflinching commitment to
those ideas as principal wolf said on
his blog informed respectful debate
is Central to Academia and gentlemen I
salute your academic statesmanship thank
you very much
[Music]
so we're going to proceed as follows uh
the first thing I would like to say is
that in the hall
behind you afterwards there will be some
of Jordan's books on sale 12
um
what's the title again 12 rules for life
12 12 rules for life wanted to get to 12
what it was right that's not 12 steps
it's 12 rules right
um
we are going to proceed as follows
Jordan and I are going to have a
conversation
for
half an hour maybe 40 minutes
and then we are going to throw the floor
open to questions
we'll describe what kinds of questions
that you should ask later on when we get
to that stage but our topic is
the rising tide
of compelled speech in Canada
I am going to take just a couple of
minutes to give us some context and set
it up and then I'll uh ask Jordan to
tell us what he thinks
you may have seen the CBC production
of the tutors
the story of King Henry VII
in one episode
the King has condemned Thomas More to
death
for refusing to say that the king is the
head of the Church of England
more is in his cell
awaiting execution
a friend comes to him
to plead with him
to say what it is the king wants to hear
more says he cannot do that
for he does not believe it to be true
in exasperation
the friend says
you don't have to believe it
you just have to say it
when your brain
makes that kind of calculation
you know you are under the thumb
of a tyrant
and Thomas Moore
lost his head
the tide of compelled speech in Canada
is rising
the Law Society of Ontario has
introduced a new policy that requires
each lawyer to develop a statement of
principles which endorses
and acknowledges an obligation to
promote
certain values
the Ontario Human Rights Commission
says that under the Human Rights Code
failing to address Somebody by their
preferred pronoun
will constitute discrimination
for which you may be investigated
and prosecuted
the elementary teachers Federation of
Ontario
has introduced
new curriculum
to require teachers to teach elementary
students
about white privilege
and the federal summer grants program
requires applicants to attest
to the values
that the government believes in
they don't have to believe it
[Music]
foreign
[Applause]
[Applause]
okay
security
[Applause]
that's pure narcissism at work by the
way
you don't want to hijack to hijack an
event like this
that other people put time and effort
into and to use they their their
civility of the crowd and the civility
of the organizers as an excuse to
blatantly yell out your ill-informed
opinions there's no way to conduct a
civil dialogue it's absolutely appalling
the people who do that should be
embarrassed
[Music]
all right I guess I would also say that
as students and as faculty members you
shouldn't put up with it there's no way
that you should allow people who are
doing this to hijack your educational
opportunities and to bend and twist the
the functions and the structures of the
University it's it's not a good thing
not in any way at all I would say that
was a very disgraceful display
fundamentally so let's let's stick with
it why
why do you think people are afraid of
free speech
well you know people develop an
ideological view of the world because
they don't want to think through things
in real detail and they're aided and
embedded in that endeavor by their
pathological professors who are feeding
them uh what would I say and
oversimplified
an oversimplified radical view of the
world that in my estimation is
fundamentally based in in resentment
not that there's no reason for say a
left-wing view of the world and we can
get to that later
it's it's easy virtue you know you can
stand up in front of 900 people with
your placard and your and you're
screeching and you can you can decline
to the entire audience your fundamental
moral superiority you can tell everyone
at once that they're all beneath you and
you're standing for the right thing and
absolutely none of that is earned you
know like what the heck what the hell
was that there's it's come no seriously
man there's just it's just complete
misbehavior it's embarrassing and the
fact that people the people who do that
don't have enough sense to go hide their
head in shame just tells you how badly
socialized they are and how terribly
educated they are and the thing is the
thing that's so awful is that there are
professors and Educators who promote
that they say well that's how you change
the world it's like it is how you change
the world but it's certainly not how you
make it better you make it worse clearly
you know there's no comfort in that and
and there's nothing about it this
impressive it's no it's no better in
some sense than a two-year-old having a
tantrum on the floor it shows as far as
I'm concerned it approximate the same
level of psychosocial development
so when the fact that that this is
happening continually universities is
it's it it truly makes me embarrassed to
be associated with the university and
now I say that with great displeasure
because you know I've been working for
great universities for a very long time
and the university is an absolutely
remarkable institution you know it's
survived for a thousand years
and and to see it to see it brought down
by by people whose Behavior would be out
of place at a four-year-old's birthday
party is is something something visible
to behold
so so what about the actions of
government now because it is Government
after all that is the source of this
compelled speech as law as well as other
ways in which they seek to restrict
speech but the compelled speech is the
most egregious form of violation yeah so
tell us about that well I've been trying
to I've been trying to sort this out
because
you know if you're a clinician
I would say one of the problems you
always have when you're dealing with
behavior that's gone astray is to
understand at what level of analysis you
should address it you know is it a
theological problem is it a
philosophical problem is it a
psychological problem is it social is it
economic like these are very complicated
questions is it a trivial issue is it an
issue of Rights is it is it something
else the people who put in the in bill
c-16 for example and its Associated
legislation make the claim that it's
it's a legislative movement that's
facilitated by nothing but compassion
and desire to expand the domain of of of
let's say of of Rights and Freedoms and
you know there's nothing wrong in
principle with expanding the domain of
Rights and Freedoms except of course for
every right and and for every freedom
there's an attendant responsibility and
obligation so you have to keep that in
mind
when I looked at bill c-16 and the
legislation that surrounded it
especially that was written by the
Ontario Human Rights Commission the
policies that surrounded it and also the
policies that gave rise to the social
justice tribunals named social justice
tribunals appallingly enough that that
gave rise to those tribunals in Ontario
the things I read just made my hair
stand on end you know the social justice
tribunals have the right to place
themselves outside of legal out of
outside of jurisprudential Precedence
it's like what the hell is that it's
really you're going to make the case the
only way I think that you could justify
doing that is that if you tortured
yourself into the ideological
proposition that English common law is
somehow an oppressive branch of the
patriarchy and because of that you have
every right and even obligation to S to
place yourself outside of its structure
of precedent but we don't want to place
ourselves outside of the structure of
precedent of English common law I can
tell you that it's it's one of the
Supreme achievements of the human race
it's it's Purdue societies that are as
free and as productive as any societies
have ever been anywhere on the planet
and certainly are now and to dare to
state that you would Place yourself
outside of that President that's the
sort of thing that made my hair stand on
end and and there are other elements of
the policies that were equally
reprehensible not least their complete
incoherence of formulation you know I
couldn't understand some of it like I
don't understand for example with
regards to the gender
propositions how it can be that you can
be anywhere on the gender Spectrum which
by the way is not a spectrum technically
and it actually matters which words you
use if you're writing law you can be
anywhere or nowhere on that Spectrum
like I don't know what that means and I
don't believe that the people who wrote
it know what it means either and you
don't write things that you don't
understand into the damn law you don't
do that because the law unfolds in
society and it Tangles people up as it
unfolds and it's no joke when that
happens so you'll be very very careful
when you're writing law and you
certainly don't want to write law to
push forward your ideological
commitments especially in the face of
precedent because precedent is what
keeps law from degenerating into
ideology essentially and so well and so
to answer your question you know more
more more more fundamentally I don't
believe
that this argument has ever been about
the rights of transgender people I think
that it's an attempt by the radical left
ideologues to push their ideological
agenda forward using using their using
attempts to manipulate the linguistic
domain and I'm not willing to seed the
linguistic domain because I don't think
there are any more anything more
important than the words that you use
and then when the government says well
you should start using these words you
should start thinking hard about your
damn government because your words are
no different than your thoughts and your
thoughts Orient yourself your thoughts
Orient you in the world and if someone
is going to tell you what it is that you
have to think then they're going to
disorient you in the world and I
wouldn't recommend that because there's
lots of terrible things that can happen
to you and if you're disoriented you're
going to run into a very large number of
them so that's how it looks to me so but
but the ideological context of this
seems like something has changed yes
because if you think back decades
earlier
liberals were the champions of free
speech Yes it was the conservatives at a
certain moment in time
who were the sensors you know they they
sought to curb blasphemy and obscenity
Sedition and so on and and the Liberals
said no free speech is the way we want
to go
and yet today that has flipped
uh if you if you look back to what left
leaning
officials and authorities and and
figures said let me just give you one
quote this is Samuel Gompers who is the
founder of the American Federation of
Labor
in 1886
he said this he said the freedom of
speech
has been granted to the people in order
that they may say the things
which
sorry misquoted that have not been
granted to the people in order that they
may say the things which please
and which are based upon accepted
thought
but the right to say the things which
displease
the right to say the things which may
convey the new and yet unexpected
thoughts the right to say things even
though they do are wrong now that is not
a sentiment now carried on by the left
in today
what has happened
well again I see that it's a consequence
of continual agitation by I would say a
minority of of the left of radical left
in particular and those are people who
aren't Marxist slash neo-marxist in
their fundamental ideological
orientation and have joined that in an
Unholy Union with the worst of French
post-modernism
and and there they push it Forward
ideological certainty and the thing that
the thing that's really distressing
about that is that if you know anything
about the history of oppressed people
let's say much as I hate to engage in
that particular form of dialogue under
the current conditions it's pretty
obvious that its freedom of speech is is
a freedom that's particularly important
for people who don't have anything else
right it's if you're supporting freedom
of speech you're not supporting the
status quo I mean just think about let's
let's use the logic of the radical
leftists and assume that Society is a
tyrannical hierarchy and the people at
the top have the upper hand in
everything including access to
communication
foreign
are not your friends
[Music]
they would say you know
