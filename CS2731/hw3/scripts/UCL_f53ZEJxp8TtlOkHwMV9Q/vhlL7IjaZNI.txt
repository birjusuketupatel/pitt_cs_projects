So I'm here tonight talking to Howard bloom
Who's a fascinating person and an an author of many books and a polymath of sorts and we've known each other by?
Electronic communication for quite a long time, it's it's something exceeding a decade
but we've never met either in person or electronically by video until now and
Howard is definitely well he's a singular sort of person and he has a very broad range of knowledge
As broad as anyone I've ever encountered
I would say and so what I'm going to do first is turn this over to him so that he can tell you a little
bit about himself and about what he's done and
Then we're gonna talk about his newest book which is called how I accidentally started the 60s and then well
We're gonna see where it goes from there, so Howard. Thanks for
Showing up here and let's let's see where we can go, so why don't you tell everybody about yourself?
Well, it's a pleasure to see you in person because I think it's about been about 14 years
maybe 15 years that we've known each other I
Put together a science of the soul initiative a long time ago, and and you were one of those kind enough to sign on
but I am the author of six books the first book is called the Lucifer principle a scientific expedition into the force of history and
Even though it's about 25 years old
People are buying it at because it feels like it was written yesterday
For tomorrow and people call it their Bible the second book is
global brain the evolution of masked mind from the Big Bang to the 21st century and
the office of the Secretary of Defense in the United States the reform based on one of the on that book and
brought in people from the State Department the Energy Department DARPA IBM and MIT
The third book is called the genius of the Beast a radical revision of capitalism
I preferred its original title which was reinventing capitalism porting soul the machine and that
Book the man who runs Dubai the Sheikh who runs Dubai
named a racehorse after one of that after that book the
His former minister of development who's on Dubai's ruling council and runs a thirty
Three billion dollar sovereign real estate company to built the tallest building in the world
went in front of the Arabian Business and Economic Forum and
told them there is a book that I particularly resonate with it's the genius of the Beast and
It contains the future of Dubai and he proceeded to read passages from that book and dr. APJ Kalam the eleventh President of India
Said that that book is a visionary creation
And this is despite the fact that the Sheikh who runs Dubai his former minister of development and dr. Abdul J
Column are all Muslims
And I'm a Zionist atheist Jew so if there's any sign of hope for peace in this world
That's it I've done lots and lots of other things just a few months ago. I
Founded and shared the Asian space technology summit with a large
groups of representatives from china the chinese academy of space technology and from
England space program, I've done the weirdest variety of things you've ever seen in your life
Oh, and I should not forget once upon a time. I found it. I knew nothing about popular culture
I founded the biggest PR firm in the music industry
I used my scientific tools since it's my background of science my life is science my bones and my flesh our science and
It became the most successful PR on that firm in the record industry
So I worked with Michael Jackson Prince Bob Marley about Midler ac/dc
Aerosmith kiss Queen Run DMC Billy Joel Paul Simon Peter Gabriel David Byrne Run DMC Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five
little things like that
Yeah, well it's a crazy biography
You'd think you'd have to think that someone was making that up if you didn't know it was true
And then you also accidentally started the 60s apparently yes, and it was just reading that book about a week ago
And thought what did you think of it? Oh? I thought it was very funny
It was it was it was I also thought
It was remarkable that you managed to have a foreword by or was it wasn't a foreword
I don't think it was caught it by Timothy Leary. Yes. Well. Let me tell you how that came about
There I was well. It was about 1981 and I
Started to go back to my science. Yes, I was running most successful PR firm the music industry
Yes, we were still on the ascent
Yes were establishing
Taking unknowns like prints and establishing them as major stars or joan jett who've been turned down by 23 record companies
And we made her double platinum in a year and a half
But I finally got a little time for you to go back to my science
And then I was taking a bunch of journalists out to Long Island to see REO
Speedwagon and a bunch of them said bloom all these ideas you keep talking about us
you need to write a book and one of them took me under his wing and
Actually mentored me Timothy white who wrote for The Associated Press and Rolling Stone
So I started working on a book in 1984 about
1988 I had gotten up and running and written the first chapters on a vacation and then I came down
Well for two things happen first. I really needed to get out of publicity in the music industry
I had satisfied all of my intellectual questions because there were SATA questions. I was answer answering
What are the mass exhilarations the mass ecstasy's the mass emotions that are the forces of history that power?
historical change
that's what I was after and you see that in miniature with the Beatles or with Michael Jackson or with Prince so I
Gotten as far as I could I mean you two would approach me to represent them. I wasn't interested
Mick Jagger had sent an emissary talk about representing him. I wasn't interested I'd been through all of this so
Let me ask you. Let me ask you a couple of questions there, so I mean the first question would be I think
How what is it that you had done that had prepared you for that and how and how did you manage it?
So I guess that's two questions, but also what did you?
What did you learn from all of that well these were these are very good questions to prepare me for this Martin Gardner
From the time I was 10 I was reading two books a day
My teachers hated me because I was reading a book under the desk at all times and never ever paid attention
to them and many of these were science books and I read the Scientific American from cover to cover and
Martin Gardner who was a mathematician
Had a column called mathematical games, and I learned what I know from mathematical games it taught me certain techniques
I was able to bring into the record industry, so so that's it's a hell of a stretch
I mean yeah, but singular story, so okay, so elaborate on that well what it taught is how to look for correlations?
and more than
mathematical techniques for finding correlations it gave you a gut feel of what a correlation looks like so that you
didn't have to
Go off to a world of mathematics of a cell or Kane that had no relationship to reality you could take the search for
Correlations into the real world I listen to music as obsessively from the time
I was about 10 years old my uncle and I used to stand next to a huge old
Burlwood radio that was as tall as I was at the time
And it had a giant speaker in Jordan in those days 12-inch speakers nobody to receive 12in speakers
but it had one, and we've listened to the classical music station in Canada because we were in Buffalo on the border and
we would compete to see who can identify a
Piece of music by its first four notes well often we could both identify the piece of music by its first note however
It was all classical music it was Rachmaninoff Barto Beethoven Stravinsky
Mozart stuff like that so I can't really say that I was properly prepared
Because I was hated by the other peak it's my age in Buffalo nior and my parents didn't have any time for me
So I was an outcast and the crowd of people that shut me out
Listen to popular music, so popular music. What started is with Elvis Presley
What was around before Elvis Presley and then moved on that was alien music to me?
and I wasn't the least bit interested in it and but in the
1970 will late 1960s and early 1970s
I
Knew I had fellowships at for grad schools in what is now called neuroscience at that point?
It was a do-it-yourself proposition
I was going to have to take courses in the med school at Columbia and put them together with courses in psychology
At Columbia and make my own neuroscience because there were no neuroscience courses
But I had four fellowships to do this, and I realized that grad school would be Auschwitz for the mine
Why because I was fascinated by these ecstatic mass
fashions that
give people that boost people out of themselves that lift them into something much bigger than themselves a
deep need that every human has to feel at some point a part of something much bigger than his or herself and
Those are the mass passions that create historical change
They are the forces of history, and I was not going to get to study mass fashions
I was not going to get to make contact with mass fashions if I went on to an academic career
I'd be spending the rest of my life
Giving paper and pencil tests to 22 college students in exchange for a psychology credit now exactly how much
Ecstatic experience are you going to see in a classroom of that sort with paper and pencil tests 0 the entire?
Phenomena I wanted to understand would not be there anywhere in my life
So I took advantage of the fact that I had basically been kidnapped in my junior year
By the poet in residence at NYU who had said he'd said look bloom when everybody rose out of the room
Close the door
I thought I need to talk to you well Jordan that means a bawling out right
So I waited till everybody left. I shut the door I sat down and you're about to be bawled out chair and
the poet in residence
Said to me look last year I asked you to be on the staff of literary magazine
You didn't even show up this year. You are the literary magazine
You don't even have a faculty advisor the minute you walk out that door
You're it now walk out that door and I walked out the door looking totally
Baffled because I hated literary magazines they were the most boring things you had ever seen you could have a group of
Vikings each of whom had drunk a quart of ale
Bunk parking up against the wall on bonking each other
And if you put a literary magazine in the room that pale blue cover and the mists chosen type would
Make you I'd to put everybody to sleep instantly or would drive them out of the room
So I looked very confused and a student walked up to me and said you look troubled about something can I help you?
Why don't I take you down for a cup of coffee?
I didn't know what a cup of coffee was I grown up with lab rats and and hamsters
not with human beings
but but I followed him obediently down the stairs and
When we sat down at the we shop, and I ordered water, and he ordered coffee
He said if you could do anything you want with this magazine. What would it be and I said a picture book so
That that'd be Jordan. I learned that question that question is a very valuable tool
So I turned it into experimental a graphics magazine
And it was a wild hit and it was a wild hit not just on campus where they doubled our budget for the second issue
It was a wild hit in the art directorial community
I think I think you covered that in in how I started accidentally started the 60s right I think yeah there
Yeah, you know so what that allowed me to do
is
When I and my wife was putting pressure on me
She had had a previous husband who was assuming she was tired of having student husbands
She made it clear in a kind of sotto voce way that if I went off to grad school at Columbia
I could kiss her goodbye not a nice idea after three years of marriage so with all these pressures on me I
threw my lot in with the artists that I'd assembled for this magazine we we formed an art studio and
the first year we are in $75 a piece which is
Which is just enough to get you food and possibly a little bit of shelter in New York City
But eventually I made another cover of Earth Direction magazine. I invented a new
animation technique for NBC TV and most important my studio did all of the graphics for
ABC 7 FM stations at a time when there was a revolution taking place in radio there was this brand new form of radio called
rock radio or album radio or progressive radio it was ditched which disc jockey said actually play what they wanted and
I was there because ABC 7 FM stations all converted to this new progressive format
And they used me and my art studio to get that across
to kids all over the YC, I see so yeah, you're responsible that was I got to thank you for that because I
Listen to album-oriented FM stations a lot when I was a kid and so and a lot
I mean lots of people did but I didn't know you were you had a hand in that so that was very good thing
Well, I thank you for the thanks. I had a hand in that and
ABC asked me to form an advertising agency to handle all of their advertising and
Jordan I didn't want to get involved in time buying that was just too dry for me
But because I was walking into a we did one other thing there was a new magazine
With a bunch of Harvard kids. It was a monthly version of the annual Harvard Lampoon
It was called the National Lampoon and my art studio art directed the first seven issues that that it was ABC
PG o Ruth got his start there. Yes exactly and I acted in a Michael. O'Donoghue script that we did for the Evergreen revue
Which was leading a bohemian publication of the time it's art director was all those people who had called me
After he saw the Washington Square review the student literary the graphics magazine that that I've been putting together
But the the promotion person at ABC was
Extremely kind to me and every time I walked in I'd hear Carole King or James Taylor who were the biggest people in
Rock music at the time on the speakers on the floor
and she would do things like I mean she was just
Clue me in she was bringing me into the rock and roll world one day for example
she said we're going to have a stew we're gonna have a live performance in Studio B by a pianist and
Why don't I give you two tickets? So I took her two tickets?
I went down to my art studio on 4th Street and 2nd Avenue in the East Village
And my my leading artist was just a brilliant brilliant
cartoonist and
I invited him to come to this event with me we went to the event
The pianist took through the stage my artists sat next to me and from the minute the pianist played his first chord
my artist was on his feet going Wow yippee Yahoo and
Totally embarrassing me I mean I wanted to crawl under the seat and become absolutely invisible
The the pianist on stage was Elton John what I failed to get was that my artist was
Giving Elton John the energy he needed to do the very kind of ecstatic
Performance that takes you out of yourself and makes you feel part of something bigger than yourself that I was trapped trying to track down
using things like William James the varieties of religious experience and
taking advantage of my my
Special vantage point so why do you think you know? You're you there's car
There's a kind of a contradictory narrative that runs through that story
Which is that?
You know when you were a kid you were sort of isolated you were booked as she were more scientifically oriented
but at the same time you obviously had a
What would you call it a feel for ecstatic experience and like was that was that a consequence of your?
Participation in the counterculture in the 60s or was that something that had emerged even before that
It was suddenly an emerge probably between the age of 10 and 12
It probably came from the fact that I was suffering serious social deprivation
I really I had one friend at a time and that's about as much as I had and I was I was an indispensable
Figure when it came time to beat somebody up because I was the target
Okay, so okay, so that's interesting too because that also I mean
It isn't obvious how you get from that position to being interested in ecstatic experiences per se so
What's the connection there with your rather like what would you call it isolated childhood experiences?
do you think I mean you said it had something hardly to do with music which makes a perfect perfect sense to me because
Music is almost
Uh, what would you say it's an unerring gateway into that ecstatic experience right and for for very complex reasons?
I'd like to talk to you about that a little bit, but
it
It isn't obvious why someone who was more scientifically oriented say would also
Make that leap over to the more mystical end of things and then of course pursue it through pop culture so you laid out
You know you're surprising involvement with literary magazine your transformation of that into what was essentially in a visual art
publication your entry into the world of radio and then into
Rock, I don't want to lose that thread because that also leads to your PR firm
And I presume we're getting to that
But right what what?
Deikun is there anything you can put your finger on you you associated there also with with?
like being physically bullied and being a social outcast
But why did that give you the hunger for that experience for that ecstatic experience well remember back to the days of the?
1960's and 1970's one sleep deprivation was a new discovery and then back in the 1990s and early
2000s Jaak panksepp took that a step further and in his studies of rat behavior
He discovered that if he deprived a bunch of child rats little rats, baby rats
If he deprived them of the ability to play yeah, and didn't give them access to each other as peers
until they'd they'd become adults they
suffered play deprivation
And they spent just as much time
Playing with each other as adults as they would have spent playing with each other had they been allowed to as
Children okay, so I want to make a quick glad remove there
And we'll get back to that you know I've been thinking about these these strange
modern manifestations of
Identity fantasy or that's what it looks to me like these people who are playing at
what do they call them other kids and playing with their identities in a really fantasy based way and
Sometimes I wonder if part of that isn't a consequence of play deprivation in childhood
Well, that sounds that sounds like a distinct possibility, but remember
Herrmann has said that there is somewhere deep dark in the mind
There's a closet with 10,000 hidden personalities one of the things that I discovered we're going to get out of chronological order
But one of the things that I discovered when I first became full-time
Involved with rock and roll was the story of Alice Cooper and the story of Alice Cooper
Reveals something about the question that you just raised okay
Alice Cooper
was a little bit like me when he was a kid his mom used to dress him up in a suit every day and he
Was a gawky thin with a huge nose
I was lucky thin with a huge nose
I can identify and ever wore suits though
And he was always a teacher's pet and the result was the other kids hated him
and he was kicked around and beaten and and
Excluded the way that I'd been kicked around and beaten and excluded then one day a neighbor was in his kitchen
Who was into a Ouija board and making contact with spirits through the Ouija board?
So a spirit allegedly contacted her and said I am the ghost of a witch
Who was burned at the stake in the 16th century and?
or 17th century and
You pointing to Alice I'm pointing to his name was rince Fournier at the time
Pointing to Vince you are my modern reincarnation and my name is Alice Cooper
Now when when Vince Fournier won on stage and a dress with mascara at a high school?
talent night for the very first time playing his own music chopping up baby dolls with an axe
Which is the more real?
Person Vince ferny a the shy little kid dressed up in a suit who gave apples to his teacher
Or Alice Cooper the person on stage who comes to life with an ecstatic
Identity that makes him a surfer on the back of those mask passions those masts
Exhilarations that make the forces of history well Alice of the two
They're both real people and they're both inside events Fournier
But the one that's in there that has the greatest passionate intensity is the Alice Cooper not the Vince Fournier
And that's why though he had been picked on and none of the kids in his school had liked him the minute
He finished his first performance all the football guys who used to beat the crap out of him
surged down to the foot of the stage and
Volunteered to be parts of his band and when he when he was super famous some of those guys were still
Mainstays of his bin we carry many selves well inside of us and my job in PR
Was to find people who deserve to be iconic and then to explain to them first of all I will not
if you think that I as your publicist I'm gonna fashion an artificial mask an image and
Through that make you a star, I'm gonna get you an appointment with my best competitor immediately you'll be with them in hours
If you're gonna work with me you have to understand something the music you make is about human soul
that comes from the very soul of you and what happens to you when you go out on stage and feel as if
Yourself leaves you and you are danced like a puppet. They're like a puppet on a spring like a marionette
onstage the force that moves you that's one of the gods inside of you that is your soul and what you're
Experiencing with that audio is a soul exchange if you're willing to put up with the fact that music is not about marketing music
It's not about product. Music is not about downloads
music is about the exchange of human soul then I will work with you and quite the statement for a
Zionist atheist Jew yes
it really is all it not matter that you know I
Listen tell us Cooper a lot when I was a kid and still now especially that
Record welcome to my nightmare which I think is an absolute classic
You know there's a couple of pop songs on it, which which I think?
I mean record companies did that a fair bit on on?
Concept albums you know they throw a pop hit on there, but right as a concept album
It's brilliant, and it's really well arranged and it's really
Like
Not horrifying exactly because that's not exactly right, but it's unbelievably dramatic I would say
theatrical in in the best way
and I really think it's a work of genius that welcome to my nightmare so
And I had no idea that that was Alice Cooper's background although. I did hear that
He was the child of a minister is that also correct oh, no no, no his father was in the aerospace industry in Arizona. Oh
big aerospace territory
Right, but a lot of the kids who were turned on to Alice Cooper and were turned on by other shocked bands like that were
the children of
Ministers the children of deeply religious people from another religious, right
Because he's bringing out the other side of things he like exactly the kind of things right well
He's there obviously the precursor of people like Marilyn Manson yes exactly
Marilyn Manson was a sort of cheap even though Marilyn Manson signed enough to be good to me Marilyn Manson was a kind of cheap
Take off on Alice Cooper didn't have the staying power that Alice seems to have had but the point is that I?
one of the things that I told you if you were gonna be my client as what you just don't you don't just owe your
Audience your songs you owe your audience your life now Jordan typically 20 years to articulate what I meant by that
And it's simply that if you deserve
super sir
then you doesn't you will become an iconic figure and
Twelve-year-old kids will paste posters of you up on their bedroom walls
And you will be you know the concept of the trellis you grow tomato plant on a trellis well
You will be the trellis on which people grow you will be the role model so your life is
One of the most important things that you have to offer
But I wasn't just after their superficial life. I was after I was after this when you sit down of an afternoon
Let's say two o'clock in the afternoon with a blank computer screen or a blank piece of paper
And you need to write a lyric you
Feel as if you could you don't know how you've ever written a lyric in your life
You certainly know you can't write another one again and by four o'clock in the afternoon on a good day
There's a lyric in front of you by 4 o'clock in the afternoon on a really really rare
Good day that lyric is so perfect in itself, but it feels like it wrote itself through you
When you go onstage if you see the dot the pupils of the audience dilating if you see their faces
melting losing individual characteristics if you see their energy
fusing into a collective energy rather than just individual energies, and if that collective force reaches a
Pseudo pod out to you and hooks into something inside of you
That's bigger than yourself and again
you feel like an empty pipe and something inside you is transmogrifying all of this energy and
Flooding it back down to the audience and a reverberatory circuit
And you have an out-of-body experience
you watch yourself from the ceiling as
you're danced that self inside of you that dances you on stage that is your fucking goddamn soul and that's
My and tend to find and that's what I intend to introduce you to why?
Because you are about to become an icon
and if you become an icon you have to be a force that takes hundreds of thousands or even tens of millions of
Kids who feel lost in the world who don't dare express their feelings because there are no
except socially acceptable words for their feelings and who feel crazy
Isolated and alone and you by revealing. What's deep inside of who will validate. What's deep inside of them
So I think you had the other made the other shoe drop for me
Then because you know you're talking about that at least in part. You're talking about that ecstatic experience as the as the
necessary
counter position to isolation and abandonment loneliness and all of those things
Which which I think is a very?
very reasonable way of thinking about it's like meaning as the antidote to isolation and why and trap and tragedy and
Malevolence for that matter, and I think music is you know I've thought deeply about music. I've tried to figure out
Why it has what it represents?
and why it has the effects that it has and I think and this is a
neuroscientific view of it to some degree and you know it seems to me that
It's better to think about the world as
Something that consists of patterns rather than as something that
Consists of objects so an object would actually be a pattern that sustains itself across time
It's that's not all that very very good insight. I you get applause for that. Thank you
Thank you
and so
Then you think well for you can even think about the way the visual system works this way so
You know we tend to think that there's a world out there
And then there's an image of that world projected onto a retina and then the images is
reconstructed say in our visual cortex, and then we
Then we we could become conscious of that image and plan our actions and in consequence of that, but that isn't how it works
The way it works is that there are patterns in the world and then the patterns are shifted into patterns of light of
Illumination and then those are shifted into patterns of neural activity on the retina
And then those are shifted into patterns of neural conductance along the optical nerves and then patterns in the visual cortex
and then those are expressed as patterns of movement so it's all the
transformations of patterns and the meaning of a visual perception is the
Pattern of action that it gives rise to which is why you need a body meant to be able to perceive
And I think the reason that music speaks so deeply to us of fundamental meaning is because it's actually the most
Representative art form you know because people think about it in some sense is the least representative art form
I don't think that's right at all
I think it represents the reality that exists in a profound since beyond
What our senses revealed to us moment to moment and so it puts people?
Then when you're moving to the music and we're all moving to the music or when you're dancing
Let's say with someone else and you're and you're as pairs, and you're all dancing together
It's that the patterns of the cosmos so to speak
Manifesting themselves as the patterns of the music manifesting themselves as the patterns of your body and in
syncopation with everyone else it's also a symbolic representation of a
Harmonious and ideal Society and there it is something that's beyond us
and so it's it's interest so I get it so so partly what you're saying if I understand you is that for you the the
ecstatic collective experience that was associated with music for example in pop music perhaps was
You could see it out very clearly as the antidote to painful isolation, and I mean one of the things that struck me as
Struck me as near miraculous about music especially in a rather nihilistic and atheistic society is that it really does
Fill the void that was left by the death of God and it's partly because you cannot rationally critique music
You know it speaks to you it speaks of meaning and no matter what you say about it. No matter
How cynical you are you cannot?
Put a crowbar underneath that and lift it up and and and toss it aside
and it's like music was so such a powerful cultural force in the 60s and the 70s and the
Overwhelmingly powerful force so the other the other element is very important to this is music is the voice of a subculture?
So when you tell a hundred million kids who felt utterly isolated and alone that they that their
Experiences had not been reflected in the experience of any other person on earth that in fact. They are not alone layer a movement
you give a subculture a voice and you can see that with well when I
Finally got into working with music one of the first things. I did was work with country and western music now Jordan
I worked with a company called dot records
I was hired by Gulf and Western to found a public on artist relations department for their 14 record companies
And one of those companies was dot records and dot records was number three on the country charts
And that it was with third place company, and it wanted to be number one
In country and western music now when I was a child when I was about three and a half years old
I
Woke up on a Sunday before anybody else in the house had woken up
went out to the front room where there was sunlight which I didn't get to see as often as I'd like and
Turned on the radio and because it was six o'clock in the morning or something like that
But I got were farm reports and Country and Western music this was in nineteen
nineteen forty six or something like that or nineteen forty seven and
I immediately knew that that music was alien to me
And I knew that it was the music of another subculture would not necessarily be kind to the subculture from which I came
So I never liked country music
But in the 1970s when I got this position with Gulf and Western
One of the things I crusaded for the hardest was country and western music
Because I felt that these people had a right to express their identity
I felt they had a right to get beyond the ghetto of the Bible Belt
Which is where they were kept and where they were suppressed. It was an era of
Subcultures finding themselves and expressing their right to exist
It's sort of music really does seem to have that binding capacity you know and I think there's also something
Neurological about that because I think you tell me what you think about this if this is in accordance with your observations
But it seems to me that
The music that people listen to as they're catalyzing their adult identity say between the ages of about
Fourteen fifteen to twenty you know there's a there's a there's a real intense
Period of neural pruning that occurs at the end of adolescence so you get then this amount of neural pruning after
After you're born in the early stages of infancy because you have a lot of neural connections
And then a lot of them you kind of die into your childhood self, right
You're you're born with twice as many neurons as you will actually need right right exactly and so
You're you're a massive possibility, and then you die into your actualities and then that happens again
It laid out lessons right which is also in schizophrenia develops because that process seems to go wrong for some people
but
As you're dying into that adult identity one of the things that seems to catalyze that is
The music of your culture at that time and that also seems to unite you in some way underneath
rational thought with the people of your generation
Let's say with the people you'd have to cooperate with and compete with and so there's something really deep about that, too
That's not well understood and and and
So alright well
So I I don't know what you think about the second element of that because it's a brilliant
Observation and the second element of that is that me in your late teens your prefrontal cortex gets wired up now. What's the prefrontal cortex?
It's probably we talk about it as the the center of Administration in the brain executive functions
Its primary job is making you human
What does that mean you would think that means encouraging certain things like creativity and thought no the job of the prefrontal cortex
and making you human is to
repress things
It's too damp things down
It's to inhibit things and you are learning which things to inhibit after you become utterly
Grafted into your subculture
And what is one of the elements that has drafted you into your subculture music and so what Freud would call the super-ego
Is formed to a certain extent based on your sub cultural connections that you've developed as a team and again
Music helps identify that sub culture of which you feel apart all right well, okay, so so partly what's happening there
Is that because music is poetic and also it's poetic and emotional, let's say it also
constitutes the
Pre rational substrate from which the values of that subculture emerge, so it's like the it's part of the mythological
substructure of the values of that culture and you can make absolute yeah, yeah
You can see that expressed in the lyrics right right and where which layout a system of values in some sense, right?
Something like hip hop for example well roughly 95 percent of the lyrics in pop culture are about mating they're about mating
rituals they're about courtship rituals and
You as a person who's wait the meeting has been upgraded by the best and now includes, okay?
God knows what it was trying to tell us so at any rate
You have just emerged from childhood
Your hormones your sexual hormones have begun to act girls as young as 11 can become pregnant already
and you were obsessed with finding your place in the world and finding a mate and
Courtship rituals mean an awful lot to you
They're about to what they're there what you are about to embark on for the next ten years of your life at least
and so this obsession with courtship rituals with mating and dating and breaking up and
And betrayal and all of that kind of stuff makes makes absolute sense
Right exactly well the thing is music frames that too because it gives you something that's in common with your
Potential mate, and it also gives you a set of rather
I wouldn't say stereotyped activities
But at least predictable activities that are associated with courtship and mating and so that would be
going to concerts and going to movies which are heavily musically influenced and dancing and and even discussing your
Your shared immerse Minh tin whatever that subculture happens to be right and my guess is that at some point?
Music provokes oxytocin because oxytocin is the ultimate bonding hormone and music is a bath in
The sense of human belonging in the field, but even if you're alone and you're listening to Pandora
Awesome or Spotify all by yourself. It feeds you social bread and meat and
in the in the
nervous system the central nervous system
everything boils down to
inhibition or excitation
there is a hormone of
excitation and it's glutamate
there is a hormone of inhibition and that's gaba and
Oxytocin feeds down into the gaba system the system that keeps you calm down
Basically it gives you a sense of peace
Now music itself. I mean the first musical first
I have to give you an experience that I had that allowed me to see into all of this. I had already been
Fascinated by the gods inside of us
I concluded at the age of 12 that I was an atheist and if there were no gods in the heaven above us and no
Gods in the ground beneath us where were the gods while my parents were trying to drive drag me an atheist off to high holiday
Services and they were so intent about it that I was literally holding onto the doorframe of their blue Frasor by now
Forgotten car and and they were shredding my socks. They were very regularly tearing my shoes off
they were doing everything they could to get me up to the temple and
So I realized in that moment if the gods are not above if the gods are not below
Where are they they're inside my parents if they're inside my parents they're inside of me
They're inside of all of us so my task at
Basically the age of 12 to 13
Became use your scientific tools to find the gods inside of us, okay, okay?
Well you also again you
Elaborated on that part of the story that also made you attune to those ecstatic
Experiences because the case that you've just laid out and I suppose we laid out together to some degree is that?
Perhaps it was that the fact that you were isolated as a kid made you even more sensitive to the collective belonging
Element of music because you were so starved for it and right
and then the idea of the gods within that you just laid out seems to me to be very much akin to
What you described as either your tactic or your philosophy with regards to PR for the rock?
Personalities because what you said you were doing was trying to make them reveal some of these
archetypal figures within and
that that would and that you were actually trying to foster that which meant in some sense you were doing PR and all like I
Don't know what the hell. You'd call it. I call it secular shamanism. There was a name
I was never comfortable with because it's so unscientific but
That was the closest I can come to it
It's like dowsing for the human soul what I would have been a good name for a PR company a second
Yeah, yeah, but I think that's a very well. I think that's a very useful way of thinking about it because obviously
one of the
Holdovers from the shamanic traditions is obviously music
