Well, good evening, London
Two weeks ago Sam Harris and Jordan Peterson
Met in person for the first time on stage in Vancouver
Two nights ago the three of us got together for the first time in Dublin and it's a huge thrill for all of us
To now be here with you in the o2
As I said to Travis when these events were planned I'm not moderate enough to be a moderator
But I'm going to do a little bit of
fielding to begin with
so
Let me start by saying a little of some of the ground. We are going to be trying to cover here tonight
We're going to be dealing with the conflict between science and reason
We're going to be addressing the legitimacy did I say science and reason
We're not addressing that
We're going to be looking at the legitimacy of holding on to religion in any form and
We are also going to be addressing the fact that we need to hide in a sports stadium
to address serious issues
But I think to begin with I'm going to hand over to Sam and he's going to kick us off properly
Thank you. And first thank you all for coming out. I you really can't imagine how humbling this is
Be here with you
You really just should just take a moment to appreciate this from our side because
Justin Bieber is not coming out to sing and in the middle of this as amusing as that would be
and you know though we
Put a date like this on the calendar with apparent confidence
There's really no guarantee that you guys are going to show up and we will never take this for granted
So it's really an immense privilege to be here with you. So
I thought I could start by
first acknowledging how fun this has been to have this these series of dialogues
With Jordan now, this is the fourth event. We've done and the second with Douglas and
We clearly share a common project we are trying to figure out how to live the best lives possible
both individually and collectively and we're trying to figure out how to
build societies
that safeguard that opportunity for as many people as possible and I think we each have a sense that
Ideas are really the prime movers here
That is it's not that the world is filled with bad people doing bad things because that's what bad people do
Oh, there's some of that it it is mostly that
So much of humanity is living under the sway of bad ideas
And it's bad ideas that can cause good people or at least totally normal people like ourselves
to do bad things all the while trying to to
Live the best possible lives and that really is the tragedy of our circumstance that we can be that confused
So this is where the difference between Jordan and and me in particular opens up
Which is how do you view religion in this in this contest of between good ideas and bad ideas and for me religion?
emphatically
gets placed on the side of bad and old and and
worth retiring ideas or ideas worth retiring and
I
Guess I but by analogy I would I would
Ask you to consider astrology right now Hannah. Maybe I can just get a sense of what I'm talking to
What percentage of you I want to know believe in astrology which is to say but who among you and you can signal this by?
by applause or howls of
Enthusiasm what what percentage of you let me just spell it out. So I know you know what you're committing to
And you know how crazy your neighbor is in fact
What percentage do you believe that human personalities and human events and the difference between good and bad luck and a human life is the
result of
What the planets are doing against the background of stars?
Let's hear it somebody out there
Okay, so then you should know that something like 25% of your your neighbors believe that
There you go, so the
I'm here. Wait, wait wait, I'm hearing I'm hearing a heckler among the astrologers is that
Is the FIR the first?
Astrological heckler I've heard haha
You must be an aries, sir
So it won't surprise you I have a related question which is
What
what percentage of you I want to know our
religious which is say well who among you believe in God a
Personal God a God that can hear prayers a God that can take an interest in the lives of human beings and occasionally
Enforce good outcomes versus bad outcomes
What who among you and now again, I want to hear applause or silence believe in it that sort of God
Okay, so this is my concern is my concern with with what Jordan has been saying and right in
lo these many months
I
Feel that you're in danger of misleading these the second group of people that the way you talk about God
has convinced and will continue to convince some percentage of humanity that
It's it's fine to hold on to this old sword of God this God that can hear prayers and they can intervene or not in
the lives of human beings
And you know as we've begun to explore that I think there are a lot of problems with that kind of belief
If nothing else there are many such gods on offer and there and and devotion to them it becomes irreconcilable among the true believers and
My concern is it you could do
Exactly what you do with religion with astrology, right? It would be it would be no more legitimate to to
Obfuscate the boundary between clear thinking and and
superstition there because
the
This traditional God and the and the doctrines that support him or are no firmer ground
Than astrology is now today an astrology
Almost everything you say about religion
It's the fact that his organized human thinking for thousands of years that it's a cultural Universal
that every every group of people has has given rise to some form of it that it has archetypal significance that it
has powerful stories all of that can be said about astrology and it and in fact some additional things can be said about
astrology that are would argue in its favor for instance astrology is
Profoundly egalitarian, you know, there's there's no bad zodiac sign every whoever you are. Everyone's got a great zodiac sign and
You know, it's just a inconvenient fact of the discipline that if I read you Charles Manson's horoscope
you know 95% of the audience would find it relevant and
and that's just that's how easily falsifiable stralla g is but
My concern is that we could live in a world
Where societies are shattered over things like, you know different zodiac
Interpretations and we don't live in that world for good reason because we have beaten
Astrology into submission and I would say that religion in terms of revealed religion and belief in a personal God
is over the centuries getting the same treatment by science and rationality and should be and it is a a
Preferred circumstance that we live in a world that is that is shattered by religion
So, I think what I'll do first is adopt the
Exceptionally difficult and likely counterproductive position of saying something
Not so much in defense of religion, but in defense of astrology
knowing
knowing full well that that's fundamentally a fool's errand but there's something I want to point out is that
First of all
Astrology
was astronomy in its nascent form and
astrology was also science in its nascent form just like alchemy was chemistry in its nascent form and
so sometimes
You have to dream a crazy dream
with all of the error that that crazy dream entails
Because you have an intuition that there's something there
To motivate you to develop the intuition to the point where it actually becomes of genuine practical utility
now when we look back on the astrologers and
we view their contributions to the history of the world with
contempt we should also remember that the people who built Stonehenge for example, and the first people who decided
determined that our fates were in part written in the stars were people whose
Astrological beliefs were indistinguishable from their astronomical beliefs and you might think well in what sense is your fate?
written in the Stars and I would say
It's certainly the case insofar as there are such things as cosmic regularities
so it was the dream of
astrology that there was some relationship between the movement of the planetary bodies and the fixed stars and
Human destiny and that's what drove us to build the first
astronomical
observatories and to also determine that there was a proper time for planting and a proper time for
Harvesting and a way of orienting yourself in the world for example by using the north
It's also the poetic
ground that enabled us to identify the notion that you could look up and orient yourself towards the heavens and that there was a
Metaphorical relationship between that and positioning yourself properly in life and at a deeper level
The the the cosmos was the place that the human imaginative drama was
Externalized and draped itself out into the world as something that was essentially observable so that we could derive great
orienting fictions from the observation of our imagination and so
Part of the problem that that Sam is pointing to is the difficulty of distinguishing
Valid poetic impulse from invalid poetic impulse and that really is a tremendous problem
You you see that arise also in people who have religious delusions attendant upon manic depressive disorder or schizophrenia
but so much of what eventually
Manifests itself is hard core pragmatic scientific belief has its origin in wild flights of poetic
Fantasy and it's also the case by the way that that's actually how your brain is organized
As far as I can tell that when you and and it isn't just me. I actually it's it's there's a very large
What would you call it research literature?
Outlining the relative functions of the right and left hemisphere and it certainly appears to be the case that when we encounter something. Absolutely
unknowable or unknown
What we do is drape that unknown thing in fantasy as a first pass
approximation to the truth and then refine that fantasy as a consequence of
Iterative critical analysis and so Sam believes that what should happen
Is that the the poetic and fictional domain should be some planted by the rational domain?
Well, let me just close the loop there
it's not quite I think we we need poetry and fiction and then there's there's more to engage in with reality than being a
Scientist in a white lab coat, but we need to be able to clearly distinguish
fact from fantasy or fact from mere merely fertile flights of the imagination and
we want to be rigorous there and rational there and it's not that it's not that there's no place or
Mere creativity. That's not well, I guess well
then the rails of rationality look fair enough then but I mean then then partly what we are disputing is the the relevant the
What the relative import and the of those two domains?
Let's say the heretic and the fictional and the rational and status of religion now in that
Well, I have a hard time reconciling that to some degree with your with your more
What would you say formal statements about the problem?
because your mechanism the mechanism that you put forth above all outside of truth is
Rationality and it isn't clear to me if you're willing to allow the utility of spiritual experience
which you do and and and if you're willing to make
What would you say allowances for the necessity of the poetic imagination?
exactly how it is that that is also
Encapsulated under the rubric of pure rationality see
Let's see and here's something you can tell me what you think about this
And I've been thinking a lot about what Sam and I have been talking about by the way, you know
So I'm making the case in my writing that the democratic institutions not only grew out of the judeo-christian substrate
but that their that that they're properly ensconced within that substrate, but I'm also perfectly aware that
not every religious or poetic system gives rise to democratic institutions first and also that there are
Christian
Sub structures may be the most obviously in the case of the Russian Orthodox Church. Where the same
metaphysical principles apply but out of which a democracy did not emerge and so it does seem to me that
what we have in the West is the consequence of the interplay between the
fantasy predicated poetic
judeo-christian tradition and the
rational critique that was aimed at that by the
Enlightenment figures and that seems to me to mirror something like the proper balance between the right hemisphere and its poetic imagination
and the left hemisphere and it's critical capacity and
Then I would say that part of the way so one of the questions you brought up was. How do we
Decide which let's say religious in
Intuitions are valid and I think we do that in part through
negotiated agreement, you know because people have
Look even even among the Catholics say in the medieval time. There was an absolute horror of heresy
So if you were some mendicant monk
And you had a profound religious vision?
the probability that you were going to be tried as a heretic and burnt at the stake was extremely high because even the
gatekeepers of the religious tradition realized that
religious revelation untrammeled by
Something like community dialogue something like that was something extraordinary
Danger and so I would agree with you that
The poetic imagination and the ground of religious revelation is something that can lead people dangerously astray
But I would say at the same time that it constitutes the grounds of our initial exploration and that it's actually in a radically necessary
Okay, well briefly address that and I want to ask a question that brings Douglas directly in here
I I think this is an instance of what's called the genetic fallacy the idea that because
Something emerged the way it did historically
As a matter of historical contingency, it is the the the the origin is in fact good and worth maintaining
or that it was in fact necessary that we couldn't get these good things like democracy any other way or were unlikely to and I
Would say that that there's no Abrahamic religion
That is the best conceivable womb of democracy or anything else
We like science that were a great place to get Douglass involved so it but but I would just add one other category of
Thinking here we have what we think is factual and
Methods by which we derive facts and I would put rationality there and an empirical engagement with with reality
then we have
other good things in life like
Fiction and and flights of fancy that are pleasing for one reason or another and could be generative
toward the first category, but then we also have
I know I would acknowledge we've spoken about this before
Useful fictions and cases I would you know, hope rare cases where where fiction is
more adaptive or more useful than the truth right that there's a
Sometimes the truth can can be not worth knowing and I would argue that they you know, there are those cases
Okay
But they're not so they're few and far between but we should focus on that but some degree of so
I wanted to point to Douglas here and focus on that because I think your fear Douglas is that
my style or you know, Richard Dawkins or style or Christopher Hitchens a style of
Anti theism, you know, just let's let's just throw the vicar's from the rooftops now because it's time to end this thing
Literally get off Twitter now. But yeah
That's a hashtag. Yeah. Yes
Your concern has been that
And I think what Jordan shares this that that so much of what is good in our Western developed societies?
is
The very least maintained by mayn't maintaining
so-called
Judeo-christian values or the or the remnants of our past religiosity and that you know
there is a baby in the bath water that can be difficult to discern and
We can to empty the tub all at once because and this is very much of because there's a zero-sum
Contest with the the religious enthusiasm. We see coming from the Muslim world
And of course the Muslim world is all over the world at the moment
So in that contest between a very an older style of religiosity and the theocracy
really and modernity
You are not as eager as I have been to to pull up
Western religiosity by the roots
Or chocolate vicars. Yes
Yes, I think that's fair. I think I sit
metaphorically as well as literally between the two of you I
Realized from our conversation in Dublin some of
what your concerns are about what Jordan has been saying and what he is saying and I share some of the concern I
said to you then that I used the
analogy of water
And Eric Weinstein recently described to me as Jesus smuggling
But it was a consequence of a discussion about biologists. What do you do if you're discussing?
design intelligent design
You can be okay as long as your own
Bandwidth on this on the issue as long as your own depth of knowledge on the issue is very considerable. You can be okay
discussing that biology with somebody even a fundamentalist Christian
So long as you can follow every step of the way
But the fear will always be at the moment. You're not looking they're gonna smuggle Jesus in
Or they'll wait till the moment that you're not comfortable
anymore with the argument the bit when you're at the very end of your cognitive ability, and then they'll
Trust me. There's Jesus. There's Jesus
and
one of the things I realized from Dublin was
Although I think you may not think that Jordan himself is going to try Jesus smuggling on you
You fear that?
Somewhere down the line from what he's saying. Somebody else will do that trick. Yes, it's worse than that
I actually know the people the people who were clapping are doing that
I hear from those people on a daily basis
right so that the segment of Jordan's audience that is that is
Very happy to be told they can stay on the riverbanks of their traditional
Christianity for the most part and they don't have to get into the stream of
totally monitor and rigorous rational thinking about everything from first principles right that there's something that that the Iron Age
Scribes got right and it's right for all time
those are
those are the applause I'm hearing and and and
However, consciously or not Jordan is telling them it's okay to stay stick right there with a with a shard of the cross
Actually tried a little conscious Jesus smuggling on Sam to see how that would in a discussion we had about
The central archetype of superheroes, but I'm gonna try something a little different tonight
I'm gonna try a little direct God smuggling we won't bother with Jesus. Let's go right to God. Why not?
So one of the things I've really tried to do when I've been analyzing
Religious texts is to take them as to take them
seriously in the sense that I don't presume that I understand them and I presume that they're a
Mystery of sorts and at least the Bible for example is a mystery because we don't really understand the processes by which it was
constructed and we don't understand the processes by which we all agreed collectively over several thousand years to
Organize the book the way it
Is organized or to edit it the way that it's edited or the and to keep what's in it and to and to discard
what's not in it and why it's
Lasted and why it's had such a huge impact why I don't want to
Derail you but we do understand that the first part of the process all too
well
We know that the this there was a political and all-too-human
process of voting certain texts in for inclusion and some were in for centuries and then got jettisoned and
and sure a revelation came in far later than
whole
Generations of Christians who lived and died under the banner of the Bible and it was a different Bible at the time
They had the wrong Bible so well
But it's the same
It's the same issue that that we really don't just we really don't understand fair enough Sam and I'm not saying that political etcetera
Considerations didn't enter into it
I'm sure all human considerations entered into it
But there was some collective process of winnowing and you can attempt to reduce that to economic or political causes
Which is generally what secular?
Assessors like Freud and Marx both did and with a fair degree of success. I might add but there's still some mysterious
assessment of what it is that will be remembered that entered into it, but
It's a separate point to some degree. I'm just saying that my point my
My point of departure when looking at these texts is one of an essential radical ignorance. I don't
that I understand the mechanisms by which they were generated or edited or collected or kept or remembered or
Why they had the impact they had now
I've been thinking a lot about the idea of let's say God the Father because that's a very common archetypal
representation of God God the Father so I'm going to tell you an
Experience that I had that I've never really told any audience about I had a vision at one point
That and the vision had to do with a dialogue that I was having with my father and you know
You have a father right and when you're a little kid you
act out your father when you pretend to be a father and what you're doing when you're acting out your father isn't
imitating your father because you don't
Duplicate precisely the actions that your father ever took in his life
what you do is you you watch your father across multiple contexts and you abstract out something like a
spirit of the Father and then when you're a child you
implement that spirit of the father in your pretend play and you come to embody that
Deeply so the notion is that people can abstract out something like a spirit of the Father and that that's part of our min
Pneumatic tendency, which is a very powerful human cognitive tendency
and in this vision I
first started to talk with my father and I would say more with the spirit of my father because he wasn't actually there and
I would say it was the wisest part of him and then that sort of
transformed into a discussion that I had with a series of ancestral spirits and then that
transformed itself into a vision of God himself with whom I had a conversation and this was a visionary experience and
then that all went away and I spent months and months thinking about it and I thought
So you guys can tell me what you think about this and this sort of stretches my cognitive ability to to its utmost
Limit to contemplate such things but here's a biological argument
I already made the case that a child can extract out the spirit of the father and embody it and that's
Necessary insofar as you're going to be a father in the wise one
But we can also extract out the spirit of the father over much longer periods of time
Because my father was a father because he imitated his fall
Who imitated his father who imitated his father as far back in time as you can go and there's a cumulative
development of the Spirit of the Father across time
now then the question might be does this spirit of the father have any reality other than the
Metaphorical and I would say damn right?
It has a reality and I can describe a biological reality and and and I don't know what this says about any background metaphysics
But here's our hypothesis
We know
that human beings
Separated from chimpanzees over the course of the last 7 million years at least in large part because of human female sexual
selectivity so it was the spirit of
Femininity collectively that helped elevate us to the degree that we have been elevated above our chimpanzee Co ancestor
But here's in something interesting to contemplate
What is it precisely that makes men what makes men desirable to women and so I have a bit of a hypothesis about that
So here's what men do
They get together in productive groups and the orient themselves toward a certain task and they produce a hierarchy
around that task because whenever you implement a task you produce a hierarchy and
They vote up the most
Competent men to the top of the hierarchy and then the women select the competent men from the top of the hierarchy
But the vote that determines who the competent men are that are more likely to reproduce as a consequence of male
Evaluation of men and that's occurred over millennia
And so there's a spirit of the father that's embedded in the patriarchal hierarchy that acts as the primary selection mechanism
that offers men up to women and plays a
cardinal role in human evolution and it looks like we've we've
Personified that spirit of the father in our religious imagery and and that's that's how it looks to me
But then there's something that's even more mysterious and deep about that. That's worth considering is that
apparently the entire course of
evolutionary history has conspired to produce human beings and we could argue that it could have been different but it certainly hasn't been different and
That means that that selective spirit of the Father has been part of the process. That's
Generated our very being and it's certainly possible that that collective spirit of the Father
We fly something metaphysically fundamental about the structure of reality itself
Yes, well
Insofar as I
Agree with with virtually all of that. I should say that none of that
Should give comfort to people who want to hold on to this notion that
Certain of our books might have been revealed by the creator of the universe
Well, it depends on what you mean by the creator like well, you know
I'm just saying that that that the world we're living in now is one in which we have whole societies
Shattered over this notion that some books weren't written by human beings, right? There's a different class of book, right?
there's a different shelf in the library where the the products of
almost certainly merely human brains are
Venerated for all time and and considered uneditable and unag nora Bulai by the majority of human beings
yeah, it's it's clear clear that revelation can devolve into but
Unbelievers are real. But any
There's a risk in all this always is is it often made critique
But that when you're talking about religion you're talking about the Inquisition you're talking about the jihadists. You're not talking about
Somebody who wants to go to their local Anglican Church once a year
Maybe get the children to school and maybe when they're at some desolate moment of their lives
returns to this as the place that stores meaning
I mean the thing that I think Jordan and I are in agreement on in this is is that thing?
Quote from shop and how and the dialogue on religion when he says, you know
The truth may be like water and needs vessels to carry it and when we were talking about this the other night
You know you admitted that one of the consequences perhaps of the you know
The parents sort of going through the belief structures. They may not believe in anymore
But they keep doing it as a demonstration of what you said was the the you know
the non embarrassing options that atheists have come up with but it may also be that
That since we don't have very many vessels
that cracked and
damaged and sometimes transparent as they are what vessels you have might be worth holding on to
well, no, I think I think the challenge here is
I mean it feels that well, first of all, we should first notice that these comments very often take the form of
You and I don't need this stuff
But most other people do right and that is it can't do it. Yes
I mean that's inevitably and if it is it's sort of to took that format one moment the other night
whereas where you acknowledge that that people of low intelligence are best placed in a
Conservative paradigm like traditionally conservative paradigm because there's less to think through right now
Obviously, you don't want your your view on religion summarized by it's good for stupid people
well, I do I do want to summarize to some degree that way because for
The opportunity again to put a foot in your mouth I
Would say not not only I mean the thing is is that we're all stupid and and some of us are far stupider than others
But we're not we're not that stupid
Well, but there's another problem Sam I think and and and this is obviously a contentious one one of the things I I don't go
to church
But there is one thing I admire about the church and that is that it's managed to serve as a repository
for these
Fundamental underlying fictions for two millennia, and that's really something bloody. Unbelievable. I mean the great
What would you say is bloody? Unbelievable? Look Sam there. Everything's everything's everything's soaked in blood
We have no disagreement about that
but the secular
Alternatives that we produced in the 20th century were certainly no less blood sword and they produced nothing of any program within it whatsoever
We did not do it now, but we have to put to bed that secular canard what we are using
well, it's just it's just not so that
Stalinism was the product of secularism or atheism. And nor was that product
It wasn't an inevitable project or is our product
Well, it wasn't Bey and please anyone who has this meme in in your head
Please just allow the next sentences I speak to just push it out because it's I'm so sick of hearing this
This this idea that the greatest crimes of the 20th century were somehow the product of atheism, right?
They say when you look at what actually engineered these atrocities
It was something that looked very much like a religion
It was a religion in every way apart from an explicit commitment to other worldliness
It was based on that's a bit different dis dogmatism through and through it was based on a personality
cults that that grew up around figures like Stalin and Hitler and now
It's these were it was not the ideas of Bertrand Russell and David Hume
That brought us to the gulag or to Auschwitz, but then you say it's the thoughts of Jesus Christ. I very well know
It's true. No, I can say that I can say it was the thought of st
Augustine and I can say it was the thought of st. Thomas Aquinas
Explicitly that gave us the Inquisition. This is the fact
It can I make a suggestion? Yeah, I mean, this is a general one as well as one for tonight
but the whole discussion
I mean I said the other night in Dublin that to a great accessory
books are written about the period we're living in they'll probably be described as the
Post Holocaust period in history the post-world War two ERA in Europe. It's still going on
they were still we're still going through this try to work out what happened and
I
Have to say one thing that I had any rated equally tired of is the claim that this has got to be a tennis game
between the religious and the non-religious but people say
That the 20th century's crimes were committed by atheists
Sometimes true often wrong or that the 20th century's crimes were committed by people who are religious sometimes true often wrong
Why do you think nobody you're not observing a crucial distinction here because I would never be tempted to hold religion accountable
For the bad things that religious people do that have no connection to religion, right?
So if a Muslim Rob's a liquor store, I'm not gonna blame Islam for that
There's no job
Not a us
There's no doctrine that makes sense of that behavior what I blame religion for and likewise
There's no doctrine in the mere loss of religion a ie atheism that gets you the gulag, right? Oh, there is
No, there's not there's not I just let me just flesh out this point for one more a second
The only thing I blame religion for are the things that it becomes
rational to do by the light of these beliefs if you accept these doctrines a
rational and good person
can be tempted to join Isis
That's my concern a rational and good person can be tempted to support the Inquisition. But of the many things they had in common
This is the point that David Berlinski made in his book
What did the nkvd have in common with everyone who oversaw the gulag the SS
People who guarded the camps of people who put people on trains. What did they all have in common?
What are they have in common with MAO?
Among other things they had in common the fact that none of them thought that God was watching them
None of them thought that they were being observed and would be held it
You dick God is on your side
We have just as many examples where people do it because they think God is on their side, right?
Sure, cuz I think watching and clapping. I'm not denying that I'm saying that the attempt to make this at a tennis match
Over the 20th century's mistake. We we're still trying to work out what caused it religion had a role a fizz amader role
But that the perpetual tennis match of it
I think well and there is something to be said at a more sophisticated
level I would say for the idea that you have an obligation to a
Transcendent ethic now you make that claim in the moral landscape you lay out a transcendent ethic in my estimation
that's one that puts the
onus of the of
responsibility on the individual to act in a way that at
minimum
minimizes suffering and so and you think of that as a statement of fact that that's
The proper way of being and I think about it as an axiomatic statement of faith, and that's one of our differences
but I have
been very careful in my analysis of the relationship between the idea of sovereignty and the idea of
Religious belief and one of the things that I have worked out
I think partly from reading such people as le atta and Jung was that
the there is an emergent idea of sovereignty that does involve being accountable to a god and
Here's how he would justify that and I would think about this essentially from a practical and biological perspective
independent of any metaphysical reality that it might have so the ancient Mesopotamians for example believed that their
emperor was the incarnation or the representative of a god named Marduk and
That actually bestowed certain ethical responsibilities on the ruler
And so the ruler had to be a good Marduk in order to be a sovereign to be regarded as sovereign he had to be
the embodiment of these divine principles and it took the Mesopotamians a very very long period of time
perhaps several tens of thousands of years
they weren't Mesopotamian during that whole time obviously to work out what those principles of sovereignty should be and
The Mesopotamians encoded this in their fictions and their religious fictions
Making essentially the proposition that the proper ruler had to have eyes all the way around his head
because that was one of the attributes of Marduk, so he was someone who was genuinely paying attention who was capable of
Coming into voluntary contact with with the great
chaotic sub structure of being and cutting it into pieces and making the habitable world and also speaking words that were
truthful that that had the power the magic power of truth and
The the the ruler had to act that out if he was
going to be the sort of ruler that his people weren't entitled to slay and
Sacrifice and then once a year at the new year's festival
he would go outside the city the walled city and he would act out his role of Marduk and
The priests would humiliate him and ask him to confess all the ways that he hadn't been
good Marduk, so that he could remember that he had a
