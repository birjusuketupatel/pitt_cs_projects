Who I regard as a genuine modern-day heroine and a role model for all individuals who desire to speak and embody the truth?
I'll tell you a little bit about her before the discussion starts
Ali born in 1969 is a Somali Dutch American author and scholar
She's received international attention as a critic of Islam and an advocate for the rights and self-determination of Muslim women
opposing honor violence
Arranged marriage from which she escaped by immigrating from Somalia and female genital mutilation
To which she was subject as a child
she's a fellow at Stanford's Hoover Institution at Harvard's Kennedy School a
visiting scholar at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington, DC and a member of the Council on Foreign Relations
She founded the ayaan Hirsi Ali foundation explicitly for the defense of women's rights in
2003 her CLE was elected to the Lower House of the Dutch House of Representatives a
political crisis related to her Dutch citizenship, led to her resignation and
indirectly to the fall of the second Balkenende cabinet in that in 2006 a
former devout Muslim Hirsi Ali left the faith and became a vocal critic of Islam
particularly in its radical forms she collaborated on a short movie with Theo van Gogh in 2004 entitled submission
The film depicted the oppression of women under fundamentalist Islamic law sparking controversy and threats of death
van Gogh was in fact stabbed to death by Muhammadu Buhari a Moroccan Dutch Islamic terrorist later that year
Hirsi ali maintains that quote Islam is part religion and part a political military
doctrine the part that is a
Political doctrine contains a worldview a system of laws and a moral code that is totally incompatible with our
Constitution our laws and our way of life
her best-selling and influential books include the Caged virgin
2004 infidel
2006 nomad
2010 and most recently heretic
2015 where she calls for a reformation of Islam and the defeat of the Islamists
In 2005 Hirsi Ali was named as one of Time Magazine's 100 most influential people in the world
She's also received a free speech award from the Danish newspaper
Jyllands-posten the Swedish Liberal Party's democracy prize and the moral courage award
Her critics accuse Ali of building her career on the denigration of Islam and Muslims
Questioning her right to speak authoritative Lee about Islam, and the Arab world and portraying her as the embodiment of the Western colonial
civilizing mission discourse I
Guess you'll be able to render judgment on that yourself after watching our discussion
The first thing I'd like to say is
Thank you very much for agreeing to do this video. I'm very happy to be talking to you
I've been nervous about it all day actually
Oh please don't be nervous
Anything new she tells me to do.
I see I see, okay, okay, so well
I sent you some questions the other day and
I thought that I would first of all ask you
I read your recent paper the one that you wrote for the Hoover Institute called the challenge of Dawa
And so I thought maybe I'd ask you if you would to begin with just to tell people
If you could give them a brief summary of what you were attempting to accomplish with that that might be a good way to start
So what I was trying to accomplish was to get the attention of
our society especially the government
To the ideology that underlying is the outbursts of terrorism the misogyny against women
homophobia this demand by Islamists who wants to kill and eliminate all homosexuals
The outburst again
of the increase in anti-semitism the persecution of Christians
trying to kill people like me who are apostates who are ex-Muslims and
Draw attention to the venues where these ideas are disseminated these are in schools
It's in the mosque. It's in the madrasa It's in the neighborhood
And it is authorities, you know, imam's
sometimes its Parents
These professionals who say that they are theologians who are telling young people as young as
kindergarten age
how to hate and what to hate and once we understand Dawa once we understand
This commitment to get into the heads and hearts of
People the ideas of radical Islam, then I think that we will be able to deal
Better with the terrorism and symptoms which are the outcomes of it
Dawa is the call to radical Islam. Jihad is an extension of Dawa
that's what I'd like to say Jihad is an extension of Dawa
and for me jihad constitutes the violence the terrorist acts and the political violence thats used to make
that's intended to change
Society but will never be able to eliminate Jihad unless we eliminate Dawa
Okay, so, and what exactly would you say is the relationship between, Dawa
And and jihad, you're formulating it
By the sounds of it that Dawa is the precursor to jihad and are the concepts reasonably separable
And and I guess a subsidiary question of that would be we're talking about radical Islam
But of course many of the people who are watching are going to be, it's going to be difficult for them to
distinguish between moderate Islam and radical Islam
And I'm also curious about your feelings about exactly that distinction and how such a thing might be pursued
So my approach to it is there is one Islam, but there are three sets of Muslims. There is one Islam
That is unreformed and that one Islam
Consists of different components it has a religious component
It has a political component, a social component, but it's all-encompassing
Now if you look at the different sets of Muslims what you see is one set of Muslims who just adhere to the religious
prescriptions, and they see being a Muslim as something private and when they're confronted by others about
The political activists or the bad things that other Muslims do - they invoke the Quran. They invoke the Prophet Muhammad
He's the founder of Islam by mentioning on his life in Mecca
these are the early days when he first started with religion in he is fight persuade people to come to his God and leave theirs and
using along (war and power?)
But then there's that other set of Muslims. I call them the medina Muslims
They're the ones who are waging Jihad they are the ones who are engaged in Dawa
They're the ones who have the objective of subduing the entire world to Islam
They are the ones who hate homosexuals to hate women and who hate non-muslims and to say that it's their
duty to
Die converting people to Islam
I call them the medina Muslims
because they invoke the Prophet Muhammad's life and example and legacy in Medina and
then there's a third group
I call them them the modifiers or the reformers
These are Muslims who are standing up to the medina Muslims
Who are saying within Islam as a civilization, as a culture, as a religion, as a political philosophy?
We have a theological problem, and we have to deal with that theological problem
So this for me these are the three different sets of Muslims
The problem are the medina Muslims they are the ones who are engaged in Dawa. Now we want to differentiate between Dawa and jihad
For the medina Muslims, the Islamists will tell you is, well we first start with Dawa
We call you to Islam, and if you reject it
Then you are an enemy of Islam and the fact that they use violence is your fault you are to blame for it because
in their reasoning which is secular
They are not going to try and convince you with good argument on why Sharia or Islamic law is good for you
good for women, good for non-muslims
Good for gays they are not going to try and bother doing that. They are going to tell you, this is what is in the Quran?
This is what Muhammad said
I am informing
And if you refuse, and this is steps to inform to persuade to call you to invite you,
then they apply force and that force, the application of force, that is Jihad.
But Jihad really, for Medina Muslims means, it's a holy-war against non-muslims
it is to convince non-muslims, convert or die.
There is this other status of purgatory
you know where you have to pay discriminatory taxes
And we lead a life of second-class, third-class citizens if you will. Look at the Christians who live in Egypt
Christians who live in Pakistan Christians who live in other Muslim majority countries it's that kind of status.
So the Mecca / Medina
Distinction seems to be very, I would say both complicated and problematic because so
So tell me if I'm wrong ok because my understanding is that?
Mohammed spent most of the part of his life that was associated with the establishment of Islam in
Medina and not in Mecca and that it wasn't until he went to Medina that Islam actually became a force so back in Mecca
Although his doctrine appears to have been let's say more peaceful
It was also much less successful as a, as a both a religious and a political movement
So then he left Mecca and I believe under pressure from the inhabitants at least to some degree
Moved to Medina and then that's when Islam became more
more rep more
Revolutionary and expansive, and so what do you see, now I know that it isn't
universally accepted among the Islamic community that that Mecca / Medina
distinction is a reasonable one to make because of course the presumption is that there's an essential unity of thought across the doctrines, but
But given given your interpretation, and I've read the similar interpretation among other among other people
Do you see, what you see as hopeful within the Islamic community with regards to bridging the gap between the, say the earlier
works so to speak of Muhammad and the later, the later more
Revolutionary element of the, of his actions and his faith. Is there a way that that can be reconciled
Well, so dividing Muslims into make a set of Mecca set of Medina and modifiers
That's not of course an official
Distinction it's not accepted anywhere. You really want to get to you-know-who
Which individuals, which Muslims
Are at war with us and should we be worried about, what about the vast majority of
Peaceful Muslims, what about these other Muslims who are speaking up, you know, what kind of labels
Do you want to give them? If you study the works of the Islamists what you will notice
I was raised as a Muslim what I think that was the first thing that I noticed is that they're selective, and in their selections
who justify their actions, they rarely invoke Mecca
Or Mohammad's legacy in Mecca
Because as a Muslim if my sister tells me "Ayaan, you've missed a prayer you need to get up an pray"
Won't involve some verse for Mecca and say oh come on
My relationship with Allah is intimate and unique
It's none of your business to tell them what to do
And then she would come up with some other Haddith or some other verse, saying well
But it's might duty to command right and forbid flaw and on and on it goes
So this is the within a Muslim family, but then the Medina Muslims, they extend (???), so it did strike me
And I'm not the only one the other scholars like Muhammad (???) there are many other scholars
Who are Muslim, who believe that they must see a way of preserving Islam
As a tradition, as a culture, as a civilization and at the same time putting to bed this violent
Human rights? violating concepts within Islam
If you try and do that then you're going to see, you're going to make a list of all
The concepts
The derees that we really don't have any problem with, like people being told to pray five times a day or
visit Mecca or fast in the month of Ramadan and all sorts of, you know, religious rituals
I really don't have a problem with that and when I look at where all of that's concentrated
That's in Mecca, it's in the early days. In Medina, as you said, then it turned into a political philosophy, it becomes a military creed
Mohammed wages wars, he leads them, he elects others to lead and that's exactly when Islam becomes
Successful and Islamists of today are trying to, they're trying to emulate that power
And then say so explicitly, they write it 
 and they are proud to be
You know to be emulating Mohammed in this way, so that's I think
When you say, you know, the Mecca / Medina is problematic. I think any kind of
Classification that we apply in social sciences has its problems
But one sort of simplifies because it focuses our attention where it should be
Okay, so you see this as an externally applied
Category system essentially, that's useful. That's useful for, outsiders who are trying to assess the situation
To determine who it is that you're dealing with that might be regarded as an ally and who it is that you're dealing with that might
Be regarded as a foe so to speak and that would be on the more militant end of things
That's a reasonable way of looking at it?
That's reasonable. That's a reasonable way of looking at it, but also if you take the moderate versus extreme classification or categorization
That has become commonplace
It doesn't tell you when we look at moderate we think of people who are not using violence
Whereas if you look at Medina you will see that there are
hundreds of thousands of Muslims
Who do not apply violence now
But who do preach violence and they do preach the Medina legacy and they believe that Sharia should be
Instituted and in places where they get, where you get a majority of these non-violent Medina types
then suddenly they start applying and enforcing sharia law.
So I think in the terms moderate and extreme are just not good enough
They don't cover the...
Right well and they also don't they don't also seem to bear any relationship to the internal dynamics of the faith itself so that that's also problematic
okay, so
You have to keep going back to the theology have to keep going back to the internal debates among Muslims
on how to move, how to move on and how to relate to the rest of the world.
So I personally think Mecca and Medina is much more useful as a tool, as an external conceptual framework for understanding the
Problem we face with Islam, then extreme versus moderates and all the 
other, you know, all the other terms that we have
Okay, so let me ask you another question about that then so, see one of the problems that I've had because I've been trying to look at
The potential for a true relationship between Islam and Christianity you know to the degree that I understand Islam or Christianity which of course
There's plenty to understand about both, so it's no easy thing to manage, but there is this claim as well that
that's widespread and rather vague that that Islam is in essence a religion of peace and but when I look at the
historical data say stemming from the Medina
The Medina time and then moving forward and the fact that Mohammad was definitely someone who engaged
personally in warfare and in an expansionist warfare
It's not an easy thing for me to make the leap to to
Comprehending or being able to accept the claim that the fundamental doctrines of Islam are peaceful
Or are associated with peace because it looks to me like there's an element of it. That's quite militaristic, and I've also thought that
Let's say, there's a religious element to Islam, and I mean this is not an original thought obviously, there's a religious element Islam
But there's also something that's clearly more like a political movement and more like a governmental movement
And that's also
Complicated by the fact that there isn't any clear separation between church and state in Islamic doctrine as far as I can tell so
When we hear claims that, or when claims are made that Islam is essentially a religion of peace
Then that doesn't seem to be the case with the Medina end
Of the theological discourse or the actions that emerge thereof and then part of the problem is how do you reconcile that with the
Contradictions in relationship to the earlier as you say Meccan doctrines
And it isn't clear to me how that can be done so...
Medina muslims see Islam as a political creed that the believers should enforce, are obligated to enforce so number one they argue
In that conditions they fight, that Muhammad in Mecca did not give the Meccans a choice
He didn't say oh you can have your gods like
and you know, I have my God. His message was you guys are worshiping false Gods
These are idols, you live in a time of ignorance, and I have come as a last messenger
To convey to you
you know, the light
and enlightenment and come with me
Now what is peaceful in his actions in Mecca, it's not the message that is peaceful
it's the fact that he didn't apply force, he didn't put together a militia and
Attack the Meccans that which he described as a polytheists and unbelievers
in Medina he does that.
As in Medina, as he wins war after war
The numbers of Muslims increase, and these are people who come to [be] Muslim by force
Then he says everywhere where people accept Islam
That is peaceful. So the definition of peace in Islam is only after you accept Islam as long as you refuse to
abide by Islamic law or
Accept to be subdued by Islam, you are at war
That's why they the Medinans make this distinction between the house of Islam, feasts
And the house of war, (right) and the house of war is everywhere where there are infidels
And it's the job of the Muslims in the house of peace to convert them
So it's a religion of peace insofar as its final utopian aim is the cessation of conflict?
but it's the cessation of conflict in part as a consequence of conquest
Absolutely
Ok yeah, yeah
Well that was more or less how I understood it so
When the claim is made that it's a religion of peace, then that isn't precisely
It's it's a sleight of hand in some sense with regard specifically to that phrase
There are individuals, [the] ones I described as Mecca who are saying
When they say Islam is peace what they really want to say is, I am a peaceful individual
And I have no problems with other religions and
I do not want to be engaged in any politics of any sort or to link politics with religion, please leave me alone
Right right right and that I would say would be the majority of Muslims worldwide
I'm not sure you agree with that
But it seems to me that it isn't
Self-evidently the case that the majority of human beings are violent and warlike and so my sense is is that
given the essential peace
peacefulness of most people they're going to take a look at the Islamic doctrine and extract from it those elements that are
Supportive of that more individual peace, but that still leaves open the question of exactly
What the doctrine means as a set of
motivational principles and that seems to be a big part of the current problem and also the need for
Current discourse what I would hope is that it would be possible to undertake a dialogue with Islam
Let's say between Islam
and the West or between Islam and
judeo-christianity and to find within Islam itself the seeds that would enable that dialogue to occur so that some sort of long-term
Negotiated conceptual and practical peace could be attained, but the more I've read about Islam the more difficult
It is for me to understand how that might be managed especially because of its
well, because of the warlike tradition that emerged from Medina and then moved outward at a staggering rate from that
and also the thing that's quite disconcerting to me, I mean
It's not like Christianity hasn't been rife with internal divisions like that between the Protestants and the Catholics
But I mean it also was the case that
What you might describe as the civil war that's been occurring within Islam
More or less started, as far as I can tell, more or less started the day that Muhammad died and has never stopped since then and
That also seems to be, well obviously it's a problem for the Islamic community itself
But it also seems to be a problem, an increasing problem for the West because we can't not be tangled up in that
Yeah, we have to share the planet with one fifth of humanity
And it's very clear that things have to change and that is duty of Muslims to change the theological
underpinnings of their religion
And as far as I'm concerned. This is being pushed by those that I call reformers or modifiers. (Yeah)
And these are Individuals, who maybe now a little bigger in their groups
They're forming groups, and maybe even being led by some nation states, the leaders of countries
Who are pushing for that change
The big question is are they going to agree on what to change, so what is inbuilt into Islam is this idea
that you cannot argue with God. You cannot unsubmit
And edit to the Quran and it's the same thing you know Mohammed was
Is seen by Muslims as infallible (Yeah)
As someone who never made a mistake so it's an uphill battle for those Muslims inside Islam, who were seeking
modernization, who are seeking reform
to
Agree on, you know, how to edit God how toughest to pursuade Muslims to accept
a truly peaceful
(Right) and a truly tolerant idea of religion that separates religion from politics respects the rights of women
respects the rights or people of other faiths and people within Islam who want to leave their faiths, so
How do you get the theological underpinnings for that? (Yeah)
That's the big button within Islam.
Well yeah, and the danger there too
Is that, I mean, when that sort of thing is attempted, often, reform from within a religious community, one of the dangers there is that
Instead of reforming it peacefully all you do is add another sect to the conflict
Yeah for us secular people it seems from from a distance, It seems kind of easy to say well why don't they just separate
Religion from politics and then people 
who want to be religious, they can be religious
But to look at it that way is simplistic because
Then you get people who want to be religious, this Medina subset, who want to say
For a medina Muslim, an expression of his Muslim-ness is to convert you to Islam
(Yeah) to kill me as an apostate. It's to get women to cover up. It's to keep warning us about life after death and all of that.
It's the thing that's that made me, I would say nervous to some degree from the perspective of someone
who analyzes totalitarian ideology because the thing about
Totalitarian ideology is it tends to be totalitarian, right? It's all absolutely
all-consuming and (yeah)
That's that's why
also when I've been assessing because, I've done a fair bit of research into comparative religion and done my best to
Expand my knowledge base
And I've always had a hard time
With Islam in that regard because it's difficult for me to extract out the purely religious elements and to compare them to
Let's say religious sentiments that have emerged across, across humankind in all sorts of different times and eras and to separate that from the political
Doctrine and sometimes I'm tempted to think more that
Islam
You know, broadly and vaguely speaking, is something much more like a political movement than it is in fact like a religious movement
It is a political theory and it's a political movement it started out
Even in Mecca in the early days come to my god, which was a political message
It wasn't just a religious message (Right) even in the early days in Mecca it was absolutist, Islam by its nature is
Absolutist because it seeks complete and total
Submission of the individual to God and in Medina Muhammad then came around with a political
blueprint for how society ought to live the relationship between the individual and God
The relationship between men and women, husband and wife, the relationship between parent and child, the relationship between the government
the kalif
However you want to pronounce it
And the subjects and their duties, it has a court system
It has a military system. So from it's very beginnings
Islam was more of a political theory than it was
A religion as we understand religion today. Jesus Christ founded his religion within an empire the Roman Empire existed
Before and what he was talking about was all religion
Whereas Muhammad founded an empire we forget that.
Yes right, that's a very important distinction
I mean it really might be the crucial distinction, so to speak
Definitely the crucial distinction, and there was this Empire and this empire grows and declined and fell and those who feel that
They have inherited that legacy, they want to go back to the days of empire
(Yeah) they want to go back the days when, you know, Islam was supreme and
They want to do this in the 21st century when wanting all kinds
it's not just that you can't come on horseback and invade
An existing empire in decline like the Byzantine or like, you know, old Rome and
Some of these Indian empires that they took over, you could just take things it's not like that, but they're driven
They're convinced
They have this legacy,
and they're not afraid of death.
and that is key because, and here's why I keep going back to Dawa
all Muslim children learn that life on this earth is temporary
(Yeah) That it is transitory and that there is something in the hereafter. This is no point in investing in this life
Except in a religious sense, so for the Medina Muslims
It really becomes easy to recruit and inspire into their ranks
Muslims who have already been taught that
They've only got to work for the Hereafter
there are problems with Islam, and I think if, once we understand of course the basic elements of
Mohammed's role, the role of the Quran, the role of the Hereafter. All of these things and what Sharia law really means
And then we get to the Dawa part this is how do they manage to teach?
Young people how do they manage to teach all of these thousands and millions of people, who is subsidizing this?
Countries like Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Kuwait etc. Once we understand that I think then
It makes our job as westerners, western governments, whatever, easier.
Let's talk about the Saudis for a minute, the elephant under the Western carpet
I mean I understand that in the aftermath of the oil crisis in the 1970s one of the things that
Dictated American foreign policy was the desire to maintain stable oil production and I can understand that although I think it was short-sighted, I can
I can see the logic in that
But it's very difficult for me to see that in any possible way the Saudis can be regarded as true allies of the West
and so I don't understand why we have the
Relationship that we do have with the Saudis given first of all that we're pumping
literally trillions of dollars every, about every decade into their economy and then given that they practice a particularly pernicious
Form of, I would say viciously militant, Islam and second, or third I guess that is, is that they're pumping out
Propaganda that pushes this Wahhabi viewpoint in massive doses everywhere in the world
I mean
I don't understand and maybe this is also part of your perplexity with regards to Western attitudes towards
towards the complex problem of Islam, I don't understand why
The West doesn't do more to put a stop to that and so what are your thoughts about that how does it look to you?
I'm perplexed
I believe that the Saudis have put the United States and other Westerners under their spell
And someone has to come along and break that spell
I mean I agree with everything you said
Within Saudi Arabia there are, I believe, at least three forces, the royal family, who I believe
Now they want to be more secular and more modern
They want to go down the path of the UAE
Then there is the clergy.
Incredibly powerful, maybe even more powerful than the royal family, because
The Clergy in Saudi Arabia
They have the power to put into people's, you know, heads and hearts
the Wahhabi doctrine
and so, They're all about.. in Saudi Arabia
The people who decide what's right and what's wrong
Morally, are the clergy. (Right) They are that powerful. And then you have the tribes the various tribes who obviously
depending on their size
Can either empower the royal family or the clergy or both. There's a dynamic there
that is very interesting to watch, but in that sense
Saudi Arabia has used and has indulged and accommodated the clergy, not only to establish
this Wahabbi doctrine, which is pure Medina legacy, Saudi Arabia is a theocracy (Yeah) its pure Medina.
Not only inside the borders of Saudi Arabia, but across the entire world.
(Yeah) and now I think we the United States and other countries need to demand
From the Saudi royal family because they're the ones who are the political,  at least
The political individuals that we deal with and sit across from at the table, to demand  and say you know we need a divorce
Between the house of our south and the house of our (???)
Because these clergy people are really destroying the planet
They, you just, you have to think through what these people have done in South Asia in Africa
All over the world it's the duty of
Theocracy like Saudi Arabia to commit a part of its wealth to the spread of Islam
(Yes) and to the strengthening of Islam, that's pure Dawa that is through institutions
And this is this is their foreign policy we probably could refer that to a soft power
That's where the soft power goes, but that if you look at what is happening all these terrorist
activities across the world
People wanting Sharia back all of this Saudi Arabia is behind it, and I think it's time that (Yeah) we wake up to that.
Yeah, okay, so let me run a theory by you. It's kind of a two-fold theory so one is that
there's a paternalistic attitude in the west towards the Saudis that stems from perhaps events that were as
Far back as a hundred years ago, and the paternalistic aspect is to underestimate them as enemies
Right, because you say well we could say well
We need the oil and we're gonna stabilize it and maybe that we'd rather not have chaos in Saudi Arabia
And so a known dictator is better than unknown chaos and I mean we saw
Some proof of that perhaps in what happened with Libya, but so the idea would be
There's nothing sufficiently dangerous about the Saudis to justify us
destabilizing their regime especially when we're particularly dependent on their oil. And then underneath that would be an
Underestimation of the danger of ideas and also especially when ideas are combined with money, it's something like that
So because the Saudis in some sense
I think are fighting what you might regard as a stealth war against the West and they're doing it by convincing
Upcoming generations of the rightness of their particular viewpoint, and so they're in it for the long haul in some sense
And I think we're radically under estimating the danger of that
They're waging and idealogical war and we're not (yeah, yeah, yeah)
They're waging and idealogical war,  we're not, I mean you have to think of when the Soviet Union was around
If we hadn't done anything in response if we had only viewed that in economic terms or in military terms, yeah
And that is our way, not just Saudi Arabia there is Qatar there is Kuwait
There is even Iran, you know, these countries are waging an ideological war and we are not because here
They believe well, It's religion and religion is protected and you know we don't talk about religion
That's one thing we believe
We're under the spell of these
incredibly charming Saudis that come to attend our
Universities that have their embassies here and business leaders and that we are sure as their more westernized than we are
Yeah, well you can tell that by how they treat their women
Yeah, so in a way, I think again
I just keep going back to saying we are under some sort of spell
And at some point you know someone has to come and break that spell (Yeah)
through more globalization, through you know
As Saudi Arabia opens up to the world economy we really see with our eyes, what goes on inside their own country and inside
Not just Saudi Arabia, all these other countries
It's the American people, the Canadian people, Western people who should say no
To this and demand from their governments that they engage with Saudi Arabia in a different way.
Yeah, well one of the things I really can't figure out. Maybe you could shed some light on this too
Is that you know of all the things that women's political movements should be doing in the West is
Demanding, as far as I can tell, that the Western countries
Let's say led by their male rulers stop treating the Saudis like are they're our allies, and I cannot understand why there hasn't been
Concerted pressure put on Western governments by women who are concerned, at least in principle, with the
equality and freedom of women around the world to
stop treating the Saudis like they're our allies and so, that's another thing that perplexes me entirely and the
Cynical part of me thinks that the feminists who are more or less hell bent on the destruction of the Western
Patriarchy, adopt the attitude that the enemy of my enemy is my friend
And so they're willing to put up with what the Saudis do
But I don't think that's a sufficient explanation so, like, and I mean you can view our
culture so to speak a little bit from from the outside position because you've moved in as an immigrant and and that gives you a
Viewpoint that that it's much more difficult for someone within it to share and so like what do you see as driving the
Absence of pressure, let's say from women on governments in relationship to these, I would say, reprehensible dictatorships
What's going on?
So the feminists who are pre-occupied with
Western patriarchy, with the white man's patriarchy, what I see is that they have
first of all that's all that they're focused only they do not talk about discuss raise the issue of
men of color and the patriarchy of men of color, of immigrants of
the nations and countries men in nations and countries outside of the West.
Number two these femenists have also bought into the identity politics
They've bought into cultural relativism
They've bought into Multiculturalism
And all these things are bad for women bad for Western women and bad for all women
So if you believe, take multiculturalism for instance, that all cultures are equal and that
One person of one culture, the white culture, should have nothing to say about the culture of Islam or, you know,
Since it's, they're all sort of equal then
They feel that they can't use
their institutional power
To pressure our government to address the patriarchy of the outside
They believe that if black women and Muslim women and, you know, women of color if they wanted to get out of

I am organized with other ex-Muslim women to talk about the misogyny, that's
Subjected to women in the name of Islam
I get it from white femenists
White feminist atheists, and that to me is the biggest puzzle ever
I know well I think that the treatment that you've received at the hand of Western feminists to me
That's something that's just absolutely...
it leaves me absolutely speechless because
Not only me, it's all of us who are fighting...
Again like just only two ex-muslims, but they're black women who are fighting for their rights and they all get shut down
So we were talking about your treatment at the hands. Let's say of Western feminists, and like I read infidel
I Don't know, very shortly after you published it which and I loved that book man as soon as I read that I thought
