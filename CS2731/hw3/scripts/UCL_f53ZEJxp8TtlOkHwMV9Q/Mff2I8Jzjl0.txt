okay so i'm talking today with dr
michael shermer
and dr schermer is among other things
the publisher of skeptic magazine but
more importantly for our purposes today
he is also the author of this book new
book
and we're heaven on earth and we're
going to talk about this today in some
detail and so i'm going to turn this
over first to dr shermer who's going to
tell you some things about himself and
then we're going to have a discussion
he's going to outline his book and then
we're going to have a discussion about
about why he wrote it and what it
contains and what the implications are
and all of that so
over to you michael
uh sure jordan thank you for having me
on the show it's
well the the book is uh kind of an
extension of my previous work most of my
books when i write them they kind of
push off from the previous book so going
all the way back to my first book why
people believe weird things which was
about the supernatural and the
paranormal and
and all that then that led to how we
believed which was why people believe in
god
and then if you don't believe in the
supernatural and you don't believe in a
deity what about morality so i wrote two
books on math the science of good and
evil and the moral art last book
uh so then you know kind of covering all
the big subjects uh
from a skeptical scientific perspective
um the afterlife is obviously a huge one
and i had really dealt with that too
much in my previous books and you know
now that i'm in my 60s i guess you could
say i'm cramming for the final
thinking about these big issues it's not
something i obsess about i'm not
terrorized by death like like some
people allegedly are but but i think
it's a super interesting subject because
um
it's obviously a part of the human
condition it's something people do think
about and
apparently we're the only species that
can do this although i have a chapter in
heavens on earth on animals that grieve
clearly quite a few mammals do grieve
and they have some sense of loss
death and grief you know for fellow
group members or family members that die
but it's not clear that they understand
that they're mortal
um and then like you know i covered the
the possibility that neanderthals were
self-aware of their mortality because of
grave goods that have been found
although that's you know it's hard to
fossil
fossilization of thoughts is difficult
to interpret but you know it seems
reasonable that they had some sense of
that but in any case um
uh so i deal with um the you know the
the monotheisms versions of the
afterlife heaven immortality uh judaism
christianity and islam mainly because
you sort of have to although mine's a
science book and those are sort of
low-hanging fruit that atheists have
already kind of picked at so i don't
spend a lot of time on that i'm focused
more on scientific attempts to achieve
immortality and it's a book of science
so i actually start with what doesn't
seem like a scientific attack but deepak
chopra's world view of sort of western
buddhism that
um that there is the idea of
birth death
after life life before life is all kind
of meaningless because it's all
consciousness in a deepak's worldview as
he puts it uh you know consciousness is
the ontological primitive
you can't get underneath it uh you know
the scientific attempt to explain it by
material means will always fail because
that's not where consciousness lies
anyway so i i um thanks to my wife uh
you know actually delved into his
worldview
deepak and i have clashed for you know
20 years and i've called his worldview
woo-woo and
pseudoscience and and you know we've
been kind of at odds at each other so
as it changes i mean he's sort of the
main you might say intellectual force i
don't think it's unreasonable to say the
main intellectual force behind the new
age movement or associated with the new
age movement is that certainly that's
one of the yeah certainly one of the
most prominent ones he's got a huge
following you know he goes on oprah and
talks about these things and dr oz or
whoever and and you know he has a lot of
following so
um so my wife and i actually went down
to his center the trooper center in
carlsbad california and spent some time
there i we delved into meditation and
yoga and the tea and the chanting and
all that stuff just to kind of see what
it's all about and uh you know i think
there's something there in terms of
behavioral change that is how it affects
your body and your mind and you're
thinking and i could definitely see
something to that and um
and but but also the difficult part that
that deepak and i have had is the same
problem that most scientists have
with um new age uh beliefs but not just
epic but
non-western traditions that what depot
calls the eastern wisdom traditions that
it's the language the difficulty of
language we have to use words to
communicate
and the words you use matter
at some level you have to be able to be
talking on the same
level with words so when deepak says
um you know the ontological primitive or
consciousness is the womb of creation
you know these are it sounds sort of
metaphorical and he means something very
specific by that and if you can't get at
that then you're wasting your time
talking so um deepak and i have kind of
become friends and we you know we're
constantly communicating just to try to
see if we can find some
ground where we're talking you know
on the same plane and so i think i've uh
learned a lot from him in that in that
sense and so my chapter is devoted to
him on that and and the general eastern
wisdom traditions you know that when you
die
because i always ask him well where do
you go and he said he's just the wrong
question i mean you just returned to
where you were before
because when people ask me well what do
you think happens after you die my
standard kind of quip is the same thing
you go to the same place you were before
you were born
people say what are you talking about i
wasn't anywhere before i was born right
and you'll be nowhere after you die but
for deepak you know time and
consciousness kind of overrides the
concept of time at the beginning and end
right
your consciousness just returns to where
it was
and that the this physical body and
brain is just a temporary instantiation
of consciousness into physical being but
it just goes back to some other place
and and as near as i could figure we
don't have the words to even conceive of
what that means
uh that is that the western language the
way scientists talk
can't really capture what uh he's
talking about in that sense and so
that's why i think
uh we kind of hit an epistemological
wall there where
you have to actually get into
introspection meditation and that the
deeper parts of that tradition that i've
never been able to you know really get
into personally so i can't say i
understand it although i i kind of see
where he's coming from in that regard
so let me ask you some questions about
that so
the first might have to do with this
idea of the ontological primacy of
consciousness say
now one of the things i've learned from
studying mythology is that the
mythological worldview first of all i
think the mythological worldview
conceptualizes the world as a place to
act
rather than as a place of things so it's
sort of like stephen jay gould's idea of
two magisterium that don't overlap
there's a moral magisterium and a
materialist magisterium say but it's
been striking to me looking at the
archetypal foundations of mythological
thinking that in that that in the
scientific world view there seem to be
two fundamental causal elements you
could say nature and nurture something
like that or biology and society and
then
technically sophisticated western
academics argue about the relative
contribution of each to any given
uh existential phenomena but in the
mythological world view there's always
three actors there's nature
um usually personified as female or
experienced as female because
personified isn't quite the right word
there's culture but there's also the
individual and the individual seems to
be the same thing as the conscious actor
and that would be the hero the dragon
slaying hero say and
there's a there is a kind of primacy
given to that so in the oldest creation
myths you always see this interplay
between
the the mother often mother earth and
the father the sky and then the hero who
separates the two and somehow brings and
perversely in some sense although being
their product clearly as the offspring
is also the thing that gives rise to
them at the same
at the same time
and it seems to be something that's in
keeping in some sense with our lived
experience is that we confront the
social world
obviously and are
beneficiaries and victims of it and we
confront the natural world
in the same manner but we also seem to
be agentic actors
and without us as a gentic actors the
idea that there's a reality seems to it
seems to be full of paradoxical holes
like reality without a conscious actor
and i think that's the sort of thing
that that generates the thinking that
you've referred to as characteristic of
of deepak chopra and the people who who
make those sorts of claims and so
i mean what
what's your what's your take on on
consciousness and its role in being
well and on the one hand it's everything
because
um it it's what i tell what i tell deep
what i write about in that chapter is
that um you're you're familiar with the
anthropic principle so i call this the
the weak consciousness principle that um
without consciousness without
consciousness nothing exists you know
this is one of the points deepak makes
uh and for me and you personally if
we're dead or we're not conscious the
world doesn't exist for our brains it's
gone there's nothing there's nothing
uh this but but he goes further than
that he says this is what i call the
strong consciousness principle that that
consciousness is required our
consciousness is required for material
things to exist and
and so there i have a discussion of what
um
donald hoffman the cognitive scientist
at uc irvine calls his
um
the interface perception theory
uh i don't know if you're familiar with
this but his analogy is like you know
your laptop screen here and you have
these icons on the screen
and like the little trash can icon looks
like a trash can but of course there's
no trash if you open
if you open your laptop there's no trash
can in there you know these are just
kind of icons that represent something
that we think of as a trash can and um
you know this is gets the problem of you
know what it's like to be a bat
uh famous thought experiment i can't
know if i bolted on some
some huge ears and and i had an
echolocation system in the neural
processes to process that information
and so on i would have some sense of
what it's like to be a vet but
but to have everything on
to actually be about them i would just
be a bat and i wouldn't even be
i wouldn't even know i was a human
wondering what it's like to be a fat
okay so at some level we can't actually
know
um you know what it's like to be
something else and so you
again with deepak and i and these kinds
of traditions like that we hit this
system logical wall of language it's
difficult to say what you mean by
certain things yes yeah well especially
when you get down to the fundamentals of
things well it's pretty clear that
the things that
so let's look at that user interface
idea
so
obviously what happens when you're
looking at a computer screen is that the
complexity of the screen is reduced to a
set of icons that can serve as tools
right and i think that that's a
reasonable way of thinking about how we
look at the world is the complexity
that hoffman's theory is that natural
selection didn't select our brains to to
record an accurate representation of
reality
like a scientific model attempts to get
ever closer to what reality is really
like no natural selection just wants us
to escape predators doesn't matter what
they look like what the icon is in your
brain a breath fat's brain or whatever
as long as you survive that's all that
matters so uh this is why we're so
easily deceived by illusions and magic
tricks and things like that that you
know our brains aren't really wired to
to to represent reality as it really is
whatever that means and um
yes you can say that without human
consciousness the iconic reality that we
inhabit would not exist
right okay okay
that slightly is that um
as i told them so let's say you know
what's it like to be a dolphin
i don't know okay so some kind of
echolocation system so and his point is
well they're you know the sharks are
dangerous so uh his they avoid sharks
but so the question is what does a shark
look like in a dolphin's brain versus
what it looks like in our brain
um it's probably quite different and i
really have no idea what a shark looks
like to a dolphin but i do know this
there really are sharks and they really
have sharp things on one end and a tail
on the other and they're eating machines
and you should avoid them so yeah
so that's actually a weakness of the
icon
claim i would say because yeah it looks
to me like here's a twist on it
what we see in in our conscious
experience are
functional icons
but they're also low resolution
representations of the things that are
actually there yes and and i don't think
that computer icons are low resolution
representations of the things that are
there they're just functional icons now
i might be wrong about that because
because it's hard to to conjure up that
analysis on the fly but the trash can
for example on your desktop
is actually
it's actually a low resolution
representation of an actual trash can
not a computer trash can even though it
functions the same way right
so so i like the icon idea but i think
it misses some element of the actual
relationship between the perception and
the reality we definitely see in low
resolution which is why we can stand
animated pictures like say the simpsons
that you know where where everything is
well extremely low resolution but that
makes no functional difference to us
whatsoever
and we definitely see and hear in low
resolution but the resolute like i i
think what we see are something like
instead of icons they're more like
thumbnails that are functional
that's a good analogy and then well i
like it because the thumbnail the
thumbnail
actually is an unbiased sampling of the
actual
object right because a photograph is
relatively unbiased sample of an object
and you can compress it you can you can
you can
until it and
and what you're doing is blurring out
distinctions between
you're blurring out distinctions between
different aspects of it without
without losing the relationship between
the parts it's something like that yeah
that's right yeah and all in in a way
much of science operates at a
metaphorical level you know that string
you know have you ever seen a string
theory documentary that didn't have
violins featured in it you know that
that the compute the brain is like a
computer it's like a dual processor it's
like a quantum information
we can't because we have to talk and we
have to you know transfer the literal
meaning of metaphors to move something
from here to there in the original greek
so you know we're trying to capture some
idea that's really hard to get that by
something we're very familiar with so
right part of the problem we have too
that addresses some of the issues you've
dealt with with
some of your recent um conversations
with people is is we're operating at
different levels so but deepak for
example uh pounds me with articles about
quantum physics that show
you know the the
stuff is really just energy atoms are
mostly empty space
and so forth and you know this this
table is you know it's actually mostly
empty space okay this is all true but we
don't live at the quantum level right
you live at the micro level where i'm
sitting in a chair and i'm not passing
through it because
at that at this level you know it's it's
not the same as at the quantum level and
yeah
and i think making that distinction um
you know helps clarify a lot of things
so like when you talk about the truth to
be found in uh biblical stories or
literary stories like dostoevsky or or
shakespeare or whatever
and the materialist scientist says well
no i mean something different by truth
it's not that one of you is right the
other is wrong it's just that these are
different levels or different
uh ways of talking about yeah whatever
you think about them as different tool
kits
yeah that's right different tool kits
that's right yeah
that's what makes it kind of a classic
american pragmatist is that i think of
these things as tools you know and
there's a scientific toolkit and there's
a there's a toolkit for action in the
world and they overlap but they're not
the same
so for example i call this um
alvey's error
alvey singer the character in woody
