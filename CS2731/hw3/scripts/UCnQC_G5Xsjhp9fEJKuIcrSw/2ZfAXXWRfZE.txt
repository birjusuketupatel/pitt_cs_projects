well hello there we're going to talk
about abortion
and sex in hollywood and lots of things
having to do with trump and dead
soldiers and all sorts of stupid things
also i'm ben shapiro this is the ben
shapiro show
little behind the scenes there every
time we open this show i have to look to
a different camera and i am very awkward
at it so if you can't see the show
that's what you're missing out on folks
okay so
before we get to any of these things so
somebody on the left this morning on
twitter presented the greatest
pro-abortion argument of all time uh
and then i refuted it and then he
blocked me so i will explain to you why
this was not in fact the greatest
pro-abortion argument of all time
and why it is that people think it was
we'll also
talk a little bit more about the metoo
hashtag that is going around all these
women posting on social media
about how they've been sexually harassed
in the past which is fine and dandy but
i
do have a couple of questions that i
think need to be answered if we're going
to actually
do something practical with all that
information plus president trump goes
after president obama for
not caring about dead troops or
something which is just
awesome we'll get to all of that but
first i want to say thank you to our
sponsors
over at legacy box so if you are a
person who wants to preserve your
memories

memories you want to make sure that all
those boxes of old films that are
moldering out in the garage
those don't go to waste you want to make
sure that your parents have access to
those things
this is why you need a legacy box we all
have these things sitting in the garage
and then there's we don't care about
them for years we let them
gather dust and there's spiders and it's
gross and then there's a fire and we run
out there and we grab the box that is
covered in
dust mites and we bring it outside to
the car and it turns out we don't have
enough room and the pictures are
waterlogged
don't be that person that's why you need
legacy box legacy box

upload them they clean them up and they
put them on a dvd or a thumb drive for
you

actually okay so
we begin today with an argument that was
going around twitter this morning i woke
up
and there was a tweet storm that was
going around it has now been
liked almost 19 000 times and retweeted
9 000 times it's a big tweet right
especially from a guy
who no one's ever heard of this guy's
name is patrick tomlinson i would tell
you how many followers he has except
that he blocked me
so patrick tomlinson is apparently the
author of something called the ark
trilogy he's a sci-fi
author calls himself a comic i'm going
to read you his nasty
little his nasty little tweet storm and
then i'm going to explain why it is so
appealing on the surface to pro choices
and then i'm going to explain why it
makes no sense so
here is his argument in favor of
abortion and it just drips with
condescension and disdain anyone who
disagrees with him as a fool and a liar
i'm so sick of that attitude i really am
if i haven't made that clear with regard
to jimmy kimmel i'm gonna make it clear
now with regard to patrick tomlinson
here's what he tweeted quote
whenever abortion comes up i have a
question i've been asking for 10 years
now if the life begins at conception
crowd
in 10 years no one has ever answered it
honestly
then he says it's a simple scenario with
two outcomes wow i mean just
the brilliance this guy must carry in
his head it's just mind-boggling
no one ever wants to pick one because
the correct answer destroys their
argument
there is a correct answer which is why
the pro-life crowd hates the question
here it is are you ready so good you're
in a fertility clinic
why isn't important the fire alarm goes
off you run for the exit as you run down
the hallway you hear a child screaming
from behind a door
you throw open the door and find a
five-year-old child crying for help
exciting no
they're in one corner of the room in the
other corner is
there by the way spelled t-h-e-y
apostrophe r-e
the genius writer knows they're in one
corner of the room
in the other corner you spot a frozen
container labeled 1 000 viable human
embryos
the smoke is rising you start to choke
you know you can grab one or the other
but not both before you succumb to smoke
inhalation and die saving no one
do you a save the child or b save the
thousand embryos
there is no c c means you all
die
he says in a decade of arguing with
anti-abortion people about the
definition of human life
i have never gotten a single straight a
or b answer to this question
and i never will they will never answer
honestly because we all instinctively
understand the right answer is a
a human life is worth more than a
thousand embryos or ten thousand or a
million
because they are not the same not
morally not ethically not biologically
this question absolutely eviscerates
their argument
and their refusal to answer confirms
that they know it to be true no one
anywhere actually believes an embryo is
equivalent to a child that person does
not exist they are
lying to you they are lying to you to
try and evoke an emotional response
a paternal response using false
equivalency no one believes life begins
at conception
no one believes embryos are babies or
children those who claim to
are trying to manipulate you so they can
control women don't let them
use this question to call them out
reveal them for what they are demand
they answer your question and when they
don't
slap that big ol scarlet p of the
patriarchy on them
the end wow mine
blown just amazing i mean
just the other genius of this guy if i
thought of this example like
i thought of this hypothetical stupid
question like i don't know 10 years ago
totally would have changed my worldview
i would voted for hillary clinton and
i'd be wearing a sticker
uh with a hat on it okay so let's
put aside the fact that this guy's
obviously a douchebag
the the commenters on the twitter thread
are properly puzzled the reason they're
properly puzzled is because
he is correct that your moral intuition
suggests that you save the five-year-old
child
and not the box marked 1000 viable
embryos here is why this does not prove
the point he thinks that approves there
are many reasons why this has not
even come close to proving the point he
thinks it proves he thinks this proves
that human embryos aren't life
he thinks that this proves that we are
all liars when we say that human embryos
are human life
he says that this proves that human
embryos are not babies
uh he says that this proves that we are
all liars okay so here is why this is
not true
in any sense so here are four reasons
first
moral instinct does not always mean you
thought things through so we have lots
of moral instincts
those moral instincts may be good they
may be right they may be wrong
that does not provide a moral logic okay
just because you have a moral feeling
does not mean that the logic is well
thought out
so for example here's another famous
thought experiment i love thought
experiments i think they're fun
so that's why i'm focusing on this
because i think that it's good for you
to get better at dot experiments
and it's fun for me to go through them
so here's another famous thought
experiment this of course is the trolley
problem everyone has
knows of the trolley car problem this is
where
you are standing on a railroad track at
trolley car track
and the track is right at the fork okay
you're standing right at the fork
it goes to the right and it goes to the
left on the left there is nell who is
tied to the track
and on the right there are five people
who are tied to the track
okay do you pull the switch and switch
the trolley car from the one that is
going to kill
the five people to the one that is just
going to kill mel most people say yes
right okay pretty easy answer right this
utilitarian answer we will save the five
instead of saving the one okay now here
is the more famous trolley car
question you are now standing on a
bridge over the trolley car track
and on the track is titan l and five
other peoples there's six people tied to
the trolley car track
you're standing above on a bridge and up
next to you is standing michael moore
okay some big fatso now do you if you
take michael moore and you push him over
the side of the bridge
and the trolley car is stopped by the
weight of the
of his grease against the skids do you
throw michael moore over the top of the
bridge
most people say no most people say
there's a moral difference between me
throwing a switch
and me pushing somebody physically off a
bridge to their doom
that's a moral intuition but can you
justify it the answer is probably not
and what this demonstrates is that most
people's moral intuition
is not necessarily a thought through
logic and let's give another example
okay we can give all sorts of these
thought experiments proving that the
moral intuition goes the other way so
for example
let's say that instead of a
five-year-old in a box of one thousand
random viable embryos it was a box of
two embryos
and they were your children right you
were infertile and your wife was
infertile but somehow through a miracle
they've created two embryos that are
your children your only possibility of
having children and they are viable so
we know that they will implant and be
fine right that's the premise of this
question
so do you save the embryos or you save
the five-year-old the random
five-year-old
a lot of people would say save the
embryos now because they're your
children that's a moral intuition
doesn't make it right
i assume tomlinson would say no it's
just because you had a moral feeling one
way or another doesn't mean that the
feeling
is justified and let's make it even
easier okay let's say that you have your
five-year-old right it's your child and
it's a five-year-old now right it's my
daughter and she's three and a half
years old
and in the next room there are a hundred
screaming adults and i can only save one
right who do i say my three and a half
year olds are the hundred screaming
adults
most parents would say they would save
their three and a half year old does
that make that a moral choice
okay this is the premise of every 24
episode ever right it's always kim bauer
that idiot getting captured
and then jack has to decide whether to
save the entire city of los angeles or
his dumb ass daughter
right it's like it's the premise to
every ticking bomb thriller is
do you i mean it's it's spider-man right
mary jane is falling off and spider-man
has to save mary jane or he can save the
bus full of screaming children
which does he choose and naturally the
producers allow him to get away with
saving both
but his tendency is to save mary jane
right
does that make it immoral does that is
that a moral decision or is it just a
moral impetus so just because you feel
like you want to save the five-year-old
that doesn't necessarily mean that
you're correct
okay second point on this stupid
hypothetical
it doesn't actually reveal the value of
embryonic life so
we can agree with tomlinson that you you
should save the five-year-olds rather
than the box of embryos on a moral level
and still that would not admit that
embryonic life is meaningless it would
just mean that you care more about the
five-year-old life than you care about
the embryonic life
whether they're viable or not in fact we
can imagine a counter scenario where you
care more about the embryonic life than
the five-year-old so let's take a sci-fi
scenario since tomlinson is a sci-fi
writer
let's take the the sort of battlestar
galactica scenario
okay the fate of humanity rests on this
one box
full of 1000 embryos that have males and
females in them
and now there's a fire on your spaceship
and you can save a screaming
five-year-old
the only child or right it's just you
and the five-year-old there are no other
people
alive right it's ju that's the end of
the human story you can save those 1000
embryos
and you can and you can ensure that they
are born from artificial wombs and they
will live and create a new human species
or you can save this one five-year-old
and you can both die alone in the middle
of space
which do you do right so again every
sci-fi movie ever says you save the box
of embryos does that mean
that the five-year-old is no longer a
human life right because what he's doing
is he's creating a false binary and then
saying whichever one you choose the
other one's not a human life i've just
given you a bunch of false binaries and
then said
whichever one you choose is still a
human life so clearly that isn't true

next point on this on this idiotic
argument that the left thinks destroys
all of the all of the various uh
arguments in favor of the pro-life
movement
okay most pro-lifers already acknowledge
that an already born
human life takes priority over a not yet
born human life
how do we know this because the vast
majority the vast majority of religions
in fact all that i know of including
catholic doctrine say that if you have
to choose between the life of the mother
and the life of the unborn child you
choose the life of the mother
this is in catholic doctrine to give a
perfect example from catholic doctrine
because catholic catholics are most
strict on this
the doctrine is let's say that you're a
woman and you have uterine cancer
