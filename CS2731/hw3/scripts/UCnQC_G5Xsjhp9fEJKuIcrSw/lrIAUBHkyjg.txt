right now okay so the breaking news
today
is this really really awful news that
explosive divisives have now been
found addressed to hillary clinton and
barack obama this after yesterday
there's a story about an explosive
device sent to the home
of george soros the major leftist donor
all of this of course is abysmal
disgusting horrific whoever is doing
this should be arrested
they should be tried and they should go
to jail for the rest of their lives this
is
this is just an awful awful thing and
what's amazing is that if you say that
publicly there's a group of people who
immediately suggest that it's a false
flag attack
or that depending on the target of these
sorts of bombs that it's okay
which suggests to me that there is a
collective a sort of collective
mental illness that's fallen across a
small but but significant group of
people
who believe that the other side is so
evil that everything
up to and including sending pipe bombs
in the mail to them is justified which
is just
sick that means that we have a sickness
in our society that needs to be
eradicated a mental sickness in our
society that needs to be eradicated
here's the story from abc news explosive
devices addressed to hillary clinton's
home
when the house of former president
barack obama were intercepted the time
warner center that is home to cnn in new
york city was evacuated
after a suspicious package that
apparently looks like a pipe bomb was
sent there a suspicious package was also
received at the new york city office
of governor andrew cuomo sources told
abc news
which should narrow it down a little bit
it sounds like this is probably somebody
from new york state if they're sending
it to
andrew cuomo as opposed to say governor
jerry brown in california
investigators are working to determine
whether the two devices addressed to
clinton and obama are connected to a
pipe bomb found earlier this week in the
home of mailbox
of billionaire george soros near where
the clintons live in chappaqua
new york the preliminary belief is that
all three devices are of similar pipe
bomb style construction
now the immediate jump by folks on the
left was to suggest
that this was a right winger who hates
left wingers and has been inspired by
president trump
as i have said for years now i despise
when people blame individual acts of
violence or attempted violence on
generalized political rhetoric
unless you are actively calling for
violence and someone takes you up on
that offer
you are not responsible for the violent
actions of people
who take you to the ultimate extreme
in terms of violence so for example when
a bernie sanders supporter went and shot
up a congressional baseball game
and nearly killed the house majority
whip and the media covered it for all of
15 minutes
i didn't blame bernie sanders because
that wasn't bernie sanders fault
when a when a kind of fringe member of
black lives matter shot up police
officers in dallas a couple of years ago
right after barack obama had made
speeches condemning police officers is
broadly racist
i didn't say that that was barack
obama's fault it wasn't barack obama's
fault it was an act of evil on the part
of a person
who was actually evil or mentally ill or
both
and that had nothing to do with barack
obama's words
i think that you can raise the
temperature in society
and do serious damage to the society
because you have raised the temperature
of that society
but i'm not going to attribute
individual acts of violence and evil
to individual political viewpoints
unless those viewpoints are actively
calling for violence and to do anything
less
leads to the sort of censorship that
makes the country a worse place in that
way
if you believe that free speech is
inherently connected to violence you are
more likely to crack down on free speech
in order to prevent that violence
and that seems to be more of a broad
danger than individuals in the united
states who do evil things
so with that said obviously this is
really really bad stuff
and it goes to the question of motives
because
what we are seeing now why is this
breaking out so much why
are we seeing ricin sent to susan
collins
in maine why are we seeing rocks thrown
thrown through the windows of kevin
mccarthy's offices in california
why are we seeing bombs put in george
soros's mailbox
it's because they're a group of people
who have been fully convinced that the
other side
and i don't just mean the other side
ideas i mean people who are on the other
side are actively
members of evil they're hilarious
figures
you know that sort of rhetoric is is
responsible for heating
up the temperature it's not responsible
for individual acts of violence but it
is responsible
for an increase in the temperature and
the more you increase the temperature
the more you can expect that there are
going to be people
who are going to go to the ultimate
extreme of attempting to engage in
violence you've seen it on the left
you've seen it some on the right
and it's really ugly no matter how you
slice it it seems to me
that a lot of this is springing from
a basic failure of values and the basic
failure of values is something that
we call in hebrew there's a there's a
hebrew commandment that you are supposed
to consider everybody in their best
possible life the hebrew phrase word is
which literally means that you're
supposed to think of everybody's merits
we don't do that anymore we tend to
instead think of everybody's demerits we
tend to think of the worst form of
everybody's arguments we tend to think
of the worst motives
on the part of people with whom we
disagree we see someone say something
and the first thing we think is not okay
what's the reasonable explanation
for what they're saying or what maybe
were they thinking instead we
immediately jumped to
this person is the worst person in the
world and their rhetoric is obviously
intended for in for the worst possible
effect now
i can't say i've been innocent in this
because i don't think anybody in
politics is innocent in this
but i do think that we're going to have
to start trying to attribute to
people perhaps a less a less
vicious motive than we have been
attributing to them so far because
people hate each other not because of
what they do but because of what they
think
they are they think the other person is
thinking that's where we are in american
society
it's one thing to hate another person
because of something that they do
right they somebody murders your father
you're allowed to hate them
but what we have come to in society is
actions that can be interpreted in a
couple of ways and we have decided to
interpret them in the least flattering
most nasty way about somebody else so to
take an example
there's a religious baker in colorado he
says listen i don't want to bake a cage
for cake for a same-sex wedding because
i believe
that homosexuality is sinful we
immediately attribute that to malice
we immediately attribute that to that's
because the baker is a mean man who
hates gay people
never mind that the baker's been serving
gay couples for years in his
establishment
and he's just saying i don't want to be
roped or hamstrung into violating my own
religious precepts
no we have to attribute to him hatred we
have to attribute to him viciousness
and we see this on the other side as
well there are folks on the left who
will say things like
well i want nationalized health care and
instead of us saying
on the right well maybe they want
nationalized health care because
they don't understand the issue or
because they
misunderstand how nationalized
healthcare works or because they have a
good faith argument about how we should
redistribute resources
instead we go to it's because they want
control it's because they want control
once you start explaining people's
motives without reference to their
actual behavior
you're going to get yourself into hot
water politically and you're going to
divide the country on a more
significant and long-lasting level and
yet this is also here's the problem
this is also the stuff that wins the
elections the stuff that wins your
elections in today's society
is castigating your opponent as morally
somehow
deficient saying that your opponent is
not just wrong but evil
you know ronald reagan was famous for
saying that
it isn't that democrats are are just
uh are evil it's that they know so much
that isn't so in other words he
attributed to ignorance
what he could not attribute to malice
and it's it's
it's a rule that i've had on the program
try to attribute to stupidity what you
can't attribute to malice
but when it comes to political fights
the easiest thing to do
is attribute malice to the other side
and you're seeing this manifest in a
couple of different ways let's take for
example
the way that the left has decided to
read president trump's comments about
nationalism so the president of the
united states gave a speech a couple of
days ago
in which he was talking about illegal
immigration and president trump is no
stranger to character attacks he uses
them on a fairly frequent basis against
his political opponents
whether they're former opponents like
ted cruz or whether they are opponents
in the democratic party why because it's
effective
it's a lot more effective to attack
somebody's character than to attack
their ideas
because we tend to vote based on whether
we think somebody is a good person or
not
not based on whether we believe their
ideas are good see evaluating ideas
takes time
and effort evaluating ideas requires you
to actually sit there and determine
whether you think that the evidence is
there to support a particular idea but
evaluating a human being you can do like
that
and science tends to show that that's
exactly how we deal with other human
beings in our daily life and in politics
more broadly
when you meet somebody you tend to make
a judgment about that person within the
first five seconds of meeting them
whether you think this is a good person
or a bad person a nice person or a mean
person
a person who you think is going to
benefit your life or a person who's
gonna be a detriment to your life you
make that decision in seconds that's a
lot easier
and a lot more instinctive the human
brain is built for that rather than
thinking through okay what are the
policies that this politician is
suggesting
we as a society need to start thinking
about the policies a lot more and stop
attributing motives so much
but again it is easier and more
electorally lucrative to suggest evil
motive
on the part of people that you face down
character attacks are deeply effective i
wrote an entire book about this in 2013
called bullies
and the entire premise of the book was
that basically the left had decided to
leave
idea arguments outside the realm of the
norm
and instead have decided to attack on a
character basis everybody on the right
so the latest example here's president
trump a couple of days ago
saying that he's a nationalist not a
globalist now even implicit in this
comment by president trump
is a character attack on the left the
character attack on the left is that
people in the united states who disagree
with him about immigration
actually don't care about the united
states right that's sort of implicit in
what president trump is saying
but the real point that he's making is
that his priorities
are the protection of the american
people above all
else and other priorities such as for
example
kindness or human rights those take
second priority to protection of the
nation's borders
maybe for human rights reasons maybe for
charitable reasons but that's the way he
thinks of things
we're going to see in a second what
president trump said and also
how the democrats responded because they
didn't respond by making a critique of
president trump's ideas or what he was
saying
instead they basically suggested the
worst form of president trump president
trump
wasn't spouting an idea president trump
is only saying this stuff because
president trump is a big meanie a
terrible terrible person
again this is not unique to one side of
the aisle it's just the most convenient
example
today and we'll get to a couple other
examples of it too in just a second
first
let's talk about improving your business

to hire okay so
here's president trump talking about
nationalism and then we'll look at the
democratic response
because this is driving up the
temperature again it's not unique to one
side i keep repeating that because i
think it's important
i think it's important especially in
