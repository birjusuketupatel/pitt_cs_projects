burr is going to be here on tuesday also
important to note is that today is young
shredder's birthday he turned one years
old so
let's keep the round of applause going
glad
um we are going to be playing
everybody's favorite game know your meme
featuring the one and only
shoe nice that's right shoe nice is back
in a big way call us in at 808
hot meme that yes that is our real phone
number and yes we are taking calls there
808 hot meme ooh speaking of hot
i've been having diarrhea a lot of
diarrhea
labor day so hot well no the the poop is
hot like
parts yeah got it yeah why is diarrhea
hot by the way like
never had a chance to like cool you know
when you bake bread you're supposed to
let it cool
and like go room temp so that's what
diarrhea
is it's poop that never got to they
never got to go room temp
but that's why it's hot undercooked that
is the scientific
experience is what diarrhea is
i uh man happy labor day i hope you guys
all had a nice break
i had one too many hot dogs or something
because i've been having diarrhea since
4am
been really pooping my brains out what's
the deal with labor day by the way
the that freaking mailman's walking
around delivering mail yesterday
i'm like on labor day on labor day
federal
employees don't even get the damn day
off labor day what the hell
what are we celebrating if the mailman
can't go
you know take a seat that's weird i find
that really
very bizarre he just like decided to
work on his own
i don't think it works that way in the
federal government
i don't think you just pick up your mail
bag and just start passing out
you sure was a usps guy usps
because there's those amazon guys you
know what i'm not sure i didn't see him
there's probably an emergency
oh isaac well either way it's like you
know
late labor day the everyone who gets
labor day off for like white-collar
workers you know
the real people that need labor day off
are the ones that are like slaving away
at amazon and mcdonald's and all these
shitty jobs right
it's just so funny labor day has turned
into such a
stupid thing labor day was originally
made to celebrate unions and celebrate
like worker rights and [ __ ] and like
meanwhile you got the postman
and around envelopes but that's enough
about labor day
the real takeaway is that diarrhea is
under cooked poop that makes sense
um guys let's get started we got a lot
to talk about meme royale
is coming to fruition ksi versus logan
paul
everyone's saying oh that's the fight of
this year fight of the century not even
the fight of the year because we are in
the early stages
of organizing what is going to be known
forever as meme royale 2018 because this
my friends
is an annual event
we've got people that are in so far joey
salads
prank invasion shoe nice they're
bradberry
soflo all squaring off
hundred thousand dollars of prizes i
think the big
the big fight should be prank invasion
vs joey sauds
and then i think a great undercard would
be shoe nice for verse ethan bradberry
which would be the battle of madness
because they're both a little crazy
and i know shoe nice is like over the
hill so to speak
but he terrifies me and by the way he's
been working on he looks really good are
people going to place bats like sure why
not it's lost
i mean i'm not going to take bets but
somebody will
you know that's crazy i'm sure there'll
be a spread if we so guys
get excited memeroy l 2018 is
happening i want to see kobe person
getting
his hands dirty his face is too pretty
he would never jeopardize that
god kobe person who would you i would
like to see kobe versus like mo
because you know i was originally
that's a good match up i originally
wanted to pit ethan bradberry versus moe
bradberry like the
the boys yeah but i think i think ethan
would smash him
you can't contend with this the pure
madness that is behind his eyes
like you even see in their videos when
ethan's like
intimidating mo that's like damn he
would never have a chance so we'd have
to pit mo against
someone like dennis yeah that would be
pretty hot
super excited about that in fact guys uh
you may have been following the story as
it's been evolving here on this h3
podcast uh correct opinion
episode we've been having a little bit
of a altercation with prank invasion
who called me out to box me which was
the
you know i want to say how would you say
the
the breaking point for this meme royale
because prank invasion challenged me to
a battle and of course
that's not something that i'm interested
in doing seeing as that
i'm a pudgy little guy and prank
invasion
literally just got out of prison for
three years for some kind of sexual
crime
um that is not well it's literally well
i don't know what he i mean
no it's a it is a joke yeah that is it
is a joke what i'm saying
do i need to say that every time
maybe once guys i do not think i'm not
saying
that it's i wouldn't be surprised can i
say that if you went to prison for a
sexual crime
you can say that that's not that's not
definitely i wouldn't be surprised if
you're
i won't be surprised at all i'm
anticipating it um
so he he edited this footage together of
what i said last
episode and he said respect to h3h3
productions
for admitting he's scared takes a real
man to admit that
respect bro now send me your address to
the podcast and i'll actually play you a
quick game for a quick kiss
dude this guy wants to come
to our podcast i mean it's always so
demanding in his twitch
now quit playing i mean here's the thing
dude send me your address well i don't
know how he i don't know how he
yeah i'm scared of you i am scared of
you that's not like
that's not like unmanly to admit that
i'm scared of some unhinged psychopath
who's roided up and just got out of
prison for a sexual crime
like if you if you walked by some
unhinged lunatic with like a
hell's fire between his eyes under his
behind his eye
it's not crazy to be like yeah i'm
scared
scared of you dude um and not i mean and
and
it's because you're insane
you know let's get it straight then
you're not a man
you're not a man also like i'm not okay
well anyway let's just watch
his little edit here bro you look like
you disappeared for a year
and you were in prison and you've been
lifting weights that whole time
like the last video you made i was
scared i was scared i was scared i was
scared i was scared
this guy was in prison for a year bro
you literally
repeated me saying i was scared that you
were in prison for your first sexual
crime and we're lifting weights that
whole time
i am scared that you want to come to the
podcast and kiss me
i'm terrified of all these things and i
openly admit it if that makes me less of
a man
god bless okay
i wouldn't be surprised that all of that
guy went to prison for a sexual crime
within the next couple months
that's not defamation right i just want
people to know that this is a joke
because i could see some people start i
could see some rumors
starting to pile up that actually went
through the prison chris went to prison
for a sexual crime yeah
chris went to prison for a sexual crime
it's a joke he didn't but i wouldn't be
surprised that's all i'm saying
do you think i'm insane do you think
that's my skill that i would get in a
ring with you and fight you
i mean he his veins were like surging
like what did you do to be in prison for
the past two years to be there
he sees that as a compliment he's like
he thinks i'm so jacked he thinks i was
in prison for two years
well at any rate chris i would
definitely like to play you for a quick
game for a quick
kiss and i think that could be a special
segment at
meme royale 2018
quick game for a quick kiss bonus
edition
are you gonna play a rock paper scissors
can you imagine kissing chris his breath
is probably
so gross i bet you he has tonsil stones
i'm just worried about the noises more
than anything
a whole stain of people just listening
to him you think that i'm gonna make
that noise with them hilah
not you we should bring you know what
would be funny you know how you have
these ringside models at boxing matches
if we brought one of these girls to do a
quick game for a quick kiss with them
into the mic that'd be [ __ ] epic
either
seriously i'm down anyway
so yes i am scared of you good job
prank invasion you freaking sk you scare
the hell out of me
now interestingly joey salads is on the
phone
who was gonna who joey has challenged
prank invasion to a fight
i think it's gonna be a really good
fight
did brink frank invasion acknowledge
joey's
yes challenge it took some time it took
some finagling but we have actually
lined them up and i think this is
something that is going to happen
at first it was really hard to tell i i
had answered in response to this
fight joey sells my money's on salad all
day and the thought of you getting mommy
make out
date by a salad head keeps you up at
night
and then he said you want to put a
hundred thousand on it i said abso
[ __ ] lulu put 100 000 on it
goes to the winner winner takes all
those guys are gonna be out
for blood it's meme royale 2018.
where were you when the salads fell
now is this gonna be a real fighting
like or like fake fighting
what was this wwf yeah i don't know
pranks fake
fighting this i mean a hundred thousand
dollars is on the line to the winner
i'm not saying one is better than the
other like i mean
i'm not faking you want to fake it
i just can't believe like people will
actually hurt each other
well it's like logan ksi i mean they're
wearing gloves
yeah well this is this is when again
joey salad sent me this dm and i cleared
it with everybody to get the permission
to show this
so joey was trying to talk prank
invasion into having this fight and
again this is why
prank invasion scares the hell out of me
because this guy is so unhinged
that i wouldn't be surprised if he went
to prison for a sexual crime within the
next couple of months
joey said have you been training when i
had a box so anyway he says are you
going to do it prank invasion says
i'm thinking not boxing but mma
no gloves caged bear knuckle
fight we sign waivers and the fight
lasts until someone gets knocked out
unconscious
gives up or dies we'll need lawyers
like this guy is
i mean i can't tell if he's serious but
that sounds like the worst of us
absolutely joey said dude that's just
stupid
let's at least wear gloves i like how
joey's actually entertaining
is this not entertaining do you not
watch the h3 podcast live correct
opinion zone
for content just as this i asked who is
entertained right now
joey salads and pregnant bare knuckle
fight to the death
joey salads first prank invasion cage
fight
to the death we need lawyers and waivers
whoever thought we would get to this
point without all being said we've
talked enough about it let's see what
the salad man has to say about this
joey salad you are on the air and are
you scared like i am of prank invasion
i am i'm scared for his life really
because he's gonna have to sign a waiver
before the fight in case i accidentally
kill him
you think that you've got what it takes
to take out roid it out prank invasion
yeah i mean he's a little crazy a little
more than a little crazy but
now joey have you seen his physique in
his new videos he's clearly disappeared
and he's been lifting weights and he's
been getting a little crazy have you
seen this
i have seen it it's not right now it's
just it's
it's newbie games i mean he just started
working out
newbie games and um joey you had
mentioned to me
uh something about him wanting to fly
out and
fight you is this something that you
guys are going to be doing
off camera well and separate i don't
think so
it just sounds stupid he wants to
fight to the death i told him at least
let's do the boxing match first
and then fight today why does it want
someone to die
now what do you think now what's your
take on prank invasion joey do you
think he's being serious what has
happened because he's went from kissing
cuties on the boardwalk
to literally wanting to have a death
match what has happened in the world of
prank invasion joey can you tell us
you know what i i can't tell that i was
friends with him for like a week
like two years ago his friend's room for
a week and he seemed kind of normal
but then he was telling me uh that he uh
he suffered from low testosterone so he
needed to take testosterone
enhancement but i think he just started
taking those
and that might be making him lose his
damn mind because i know some people
they lose their minds when they start
taking like performance enhancing stuff
so so you're exactly dealing with so
it's possible that he turned up this
testosterone to
levels that are unstable
yes that's what i believe that is
fascinating now are you gonna be able to
contend with that massive overload of
male testosterone joey are you gonna
have to counteract
with your own testosterone or steroids
i've
i've got i've got my own testosterone
that
should be sufficient and um you had told
me an anecdote about how he has a secret
technique
that he did he beat up a bunch of dudes
on camera recently
but he didn't want to show you the video
do you have more information on that and
if you could stop washing dishes for a
moment that would be good for the show
you kept me on the line for 30 minutes i
started cooking so now i got to clean my
deal
can you hold off cooking the meal i mean
jesus come on man this is our moment
here we
we've we've prepared for this what are
you cooking joey what are you preparing
hopefully
i got a hard i got it's my protein meals
i'm already training i got like i'm
training in like an hour right now
are you doing meal prepping
yeah i got hard-boiled eggs i got uh
turkey patties all right as much as i'd
love to hear more i did ask but that's
enough of that
i've heard enough for your meal time
prep now tell me about this video that
prank invasion he says there's a secret
video of him
beating up several people by himself
now joey tell me about this video i
would give him a thousand dollars cash
if you would send it to me
because i don't think it exists because
you had asked him send me the video he
said i don't want you to see my secret
technique he said that verbatim
which made me think that it's kind of a
kissing prank thing of like
my secret technique yeah that's what it
kind of sounded like i think maybe what
he did was
he he uh tried to get into a fight with
someone and tried kissing them and then
they just ran away
very interesting theory that's the
technique
is there any other closing words any
words that you have for prank invasion
anything you would like to say
would you like to cast the gauntlet any
accusations any slander
about him being a sex uh criminal that's
been in prison for the last couple years
what would you like to add before we say
goodbye and let you cook your meal there
that you're so eager to cook
all i gotta say is if he bails out
i'm gonna be pissed and you're gonna be
