ring seat geek and quidd today we've got
a whole slew of juicy topics to get to
including greg paul the father of jake
and logan paul
has not only made a tape in which he is
having
how do i say this without getting in
trouble with youtube where
uh he's uh his genitals is going into a
female genitals
people have speculated that this tape
that it records his genitals going into
another person's genitals
sex tape you could say sex tape yeah sex
tape
right that's the i don't know um
he said people are speculating it's an
underage girl
there's no evidence of that at all why
is it still called a tape
it's not really a tape is it we need to
update that
yeah sex footage vid tape sounds a
little more like
hidden away though it's like oh i got
that tape in my closet but really it's
just
on your phone yeah so it's not that fun
anymore but sex tape it still is sex
debut uh post malone has apparently been
cursed i love this story that's great
and of course the hilarious hilarious
antics of reporters from the recent
hurricane
there's a new trend and not really a
neutron they've been doing it for ages
where they just stand
in hurricanes and it's hilarious
and i've put together a whole thing so
these are this this and so much more
welcome everybody to the h3 bug guest
beyond the experience
fully enlightened i am your host ethan
klein with the beautiful
talented lovely incredible loving
elo client thank you love of my life
beautiful wow so great to have you
well enough about uh ela let's get to
the
one person in the world who turns me on
even more
greg paul
now
okay so let's start from the top because
this is a whole story that's kind of
developed so
i want to explain to you guys from the
top what happened
okay now first of all i think the first
thing that happened and dan correct me
if i'm wrong on anything but i think
i've got my facts straight
is that logan paul's channel was hacked
and the attacker uh
uploaded a basically a fake
iphone giveaway which is honestly not
that much of a departure from his usual
content
so i'm surprised anyone even noticed
because they took it down really fast
click the link in the description to
claim your free iphone x giving away
1500 iphones apparently people were
clicking this link and just getting like
straight up key loggers and
viruses which is great you know all the
best stuff on the internet has to offer
so that got taken down pretty quickly
and um
on sunday the hackers released jake
paul's
calendar via their twitter page which
has since been banned
it included the address and contact info
for many celebrities including justin
bieber yikes
and what was thought this is a great
twist thought to be ethan
me of course that's me um when jake paul
was on our podcast
he saved dan's number because he had a
pre-show call with dan
yeah and he saved it as h3h3
so dan's phone number was leaked
over uh blowing up with phone calls yeah
that was fun
tell me about that dan um yeah it was uh
what
sunday afternoon um was just chilling at
home and all of a sudden get a call from
an unknown number oh that's
weird no i ignored it what kind of
maniac
answers unknown numbers in 2018 yeah
that's just
crazy absolutely um but as soon as it
ended uh another one and then another
one another one and
pretty quickly i was like okay something
something happened this is
this is not normal and uh yeah just
tracked it down and see the old jakey
poo
did you not answer one of the calls no
no
did you get any texts or anything yeah
text well again because they thought it
was you
so it's just all kinds of people saying
what's up ethan and like
what kinds of messages for you so
anything uh interesting
no no really nothing interesting at all
yeah
i mean these people it's like you get a
hold of a number of a famous person
they have no idea what to say yeah
they're just calling a call you know
i'll say
when my phone number got leaked
previously when we got hacked dealer
and they posted our phone number on
twitter and we were
we were pro i swear to god we're getting
like 100 calls a minute
our phone was actually it i can't i
couldn't access my phone because there
was just incoming calls non-stop so i
didn't like swipe it open yeah i
couldn't even do anything
but i was getting tons of text messages
and i don't think i actually ever
told you this but somebody sent me i
don't know why i even opened text
message because i was generally not
but one of them was a dick pic and i
have to tell you
really i did feel violated and in that
moment i had
a i had a moment of like empathy and
sympathy
for all the females out there getting
unsolicited dick pics because it felt
it felt very vi i felt very violated
that i saw this
man he was a fat man with a tiny small
penis it looked almost like my own if
i'm being honest a tiny little penis the
pubes were much longer than the penis
itself
and i was like whoa is that a picture i
took no it was someone sending me
their own so um
you think it was his picture and not
something off the internet no it was
definitely dude just snapped his junk
and
sent it to me yeah so there's a fat
chubby little penis so you were me too
i was me too i've i've been trying to
tell you that for a long time
trying to take back me too for us for me
meet anyway so apparently me third
apparently the hacker this this kind of
perplexes me this hacker got into jake
logan and their father's account all
three like
i mean these guys are big shots
they have run big companies how first of
all is their security
not tighter run third of all how do you
get into all three of them
at the same time what i was wondering is
are they still all on the same family
plan at verizon or some [ __ ]
you know what i mean like how do you
explain that they got all three of their
accounts yeah i don't know
fascinating stuff well regardless of how
it happened
um it could only happen to these
geniuses
um apparently so in jake's
dm's there's all kinds of uh stuff of
him flirting with girls
i don't know apparently they they teased
all kinds of stuff but they didn't show
anything so i don't know but definitely
the most [ __ ] up thing to come out of
it by far was um
the greg paul sex tape greg paul being
the father um
this guy is a piece of work man greg
paul is the guy who has
notoriously made out with little girls
in one of jake's videos
kissed kissed i mean there might have
been sorrows
and he seems he wears a p he's a he's 40
how old is he down he's like 45
54. yeah i think that's right i mean
here here's all you need to know about
the guy he's a 54 year old man with a
puka shell necklace and a goatee
i mean rules hit me with some of those
sound bites would you zack
gp coming at you gp is coming at you
that's his interests
he talks he like lowers his voice and
talks like uh it's like he's doing
anything
imitation of his sons yeah yeah
hey yo it's jp coming at you yo
what's going on
it sounds like he's auditioning for the
new blues clues opening
um anyway so so there was a sex
tape but there's no faces
there's some voices obviously the girl
herself there's no way of knowing
her age or identity which is good for
her thank god for that i mean
it's so graphic you guys i've watched a
lot of porn in my day a lot of porn
let me emphasize a lot of porn in my day
this is one of the most graphic things
i've ever seen in my life i mean it is
horrif i mean it was horrifying it's
really horrific
let me play you a little sound bite the
lovely thing was that it was just on
twitter and like
i just saw people talk about it
and going up the thread of a
conversation it's just there on twitter
yeah that's how i saw it first too
but i saw what i saw was like
him like fingering her but then i
doing my research i watched the whole
thing on one of these
uh you know websites
and it is so graphic bro there's one
scene where he's slapping her with his
ding i'm i'm gonna use i'm gonna use pc
words here because we
are family friendly show he uses his uh
carrot he he puts his carrot in her soil
but what happens is he's slapping her
slapping her peach with his carrot and
she starts to
water his carrot he she pees on his dick
i swear to god she pees on his dick and
this is the sound
that it makes this is the sound from the
video she pees on his dick i swear to
god
so he's slapping her and she's peeing on
his dick
do you think asmr people would love this
sound greg paul sex stick asmr that's
interesting let me try to experience
stuff that stays smart
i'm definitely getting the time i'm
feeling a tingle in my forehead
so this video is so
graphic um but again there's no
there's nothing identifying the man or
or the female
yeah so my first thought was like okay
this could be anyone let's let first of
all i want to see is this actually
greg paul not that i'm not willing to
believe it
i mean i'm very willing to believe it
but i just want to know
what's my hunch so here we've got some
evidence here
um let me see here
um you ready to come again
definitely sounds like hit me with the
hit me with that
coming at you you ready to come again
could be
what's going on people coming at you
well here we do a little csi photo
matching
and this is fairly conclusive in my
opinion
um here it's hard to tell okay but like
here's uh from his instagram his dog
sleeping on his bed
now what we're paying our attention to
is this floral
kind of pattern here in the woodwork and
you can tell
i know it's i know this doesn't look
that good okay it does not
but i'm telling you i've watched the
videos there's better screenshots
but it definitely it matches it's the
same headboard when
when it's in motion in the video yeah
it's a lot more evident that it's the
same thing
it's definitely the same so what do you
think is happening
but um i thought i had more evidence
than that
well let's leave that that's all the
evidence i've got
it's okay let me say this it's
definitely the same headboard
in your opinion and my humble alleged
opinion
it's not even an opinion it's an alleged
opinion
is that your opinion sir allegedly
um is she under age though i mean
who could ever say that that's dangerous
yeah i don't i don't want to
put out the guys having sex with
underage girls i would believe him he
was having
would i would it be a stretch of my
imagination
to think that greg was having sex with
energy girls no absolutely not videos of
him kissing
absolutely not um
but what about what
yeah the first thought i had was like
that's not you can't really use that as
evidence in court because it's illegally
obtained
yeah well regardless there's no evidence
this girl's underage at all so
um i don't want to insinuate that now
basically though greg
has acknowledged that the hack has
happened in this instagram video which i
will
play for you all here today
just a little something to tell you over
as i open this
by the way greg is a high level
instagram
user he starts the video with he got a
paper bag from like ralph's
supermarket and he just sharpied a
message so that this would be the
thumbnail
it's very creative i'm telling you he's
high level dude
he learned it from all the teenage girls
he [ __ ] allegedly
allegedly i don't even have an opinion i
have an alleged opinion
uh my hacker thought my hacker taught me
a lot
please contact me so i can hire you
bro you couldn't find a piece of paper
you really had to use a ralph's shopping
bag
all right let's watch this enjoy this
yo yo
she be here gp coming at you
you ready to come again you ready to
come again you ready to come again guys
gp coming at you all right so a lot of
you guys know that i was hacked by the
way this hacker dude is something else
man he is crazy smart
i learned a lot he sounds like such a
[ __ ] he sounds like he's 15 why does
he talk like that
he reminds me of the guy isn't there
character in like fast finds at
ridgemont high played by matthew
mcconnery
mcconaughey he's like a 30 year old that
hangs around
that's confused yeah what what is what's
that great line
he he has all right all right all right
oh there he is
had it ready to go he has a line he goes
i get older but they stay the same age
something that's what he loves about
high school girls is the line so he
pretty much is that character and really
from him um
you know hacking is actually an adult
way of bullying
what do you think about that i thought
that was kind of interesting hacking is
actually an adult way of bullying
is this him saying he thinks he's been
bullied right now
we need to call uh trump's wife see
where he's coming from
with that statement really it is a
little bit but
okay what do you think i don't know you
thought it was funny thing
he's being bullied poor guy and uh
you know i don't know why the guy does
it because he doesn't get any
real recognition for it uh he's not
really messing up my life that bad
because my life
my i'm just not that important but um
i learned a lot from him i learned about
some ways to prevent hacking and all
this stuff but dude if you're out there
i want you to reach out to me the guy
still has my aol
it makes it sound like his password was
like password
i learned a lot about security
greg paul rules he still has his aol
account oh i missed that
wait i can't remind you give back my aol
account including your information there
because i want to hire you
of course craig paul uses aol he wants
to hire the hacker
how about thrown into jail i think this
was probably an elaborate ruse too
to get them this was his mastermind
but you know greg paul probably still
has aol dial-up
on autopay you know what i mean i read i
read a stat that there's like a million
people still paying aol
on a dial-up like all these old people
that never upgraded their internet
they're all
like i bet you my grandparents he's like
94
still pays aol for dial up
we can use your smarts in in your skill
set in a positive way and probably make
you a [ __ ] ton of legit money
anyway i hope you guys have a great
weekend i hope you guys have a great day
and check these out
those were the two fingers gross i'm
just
telling you honestly he did this and boy
i saw those fingers
and a bucket of piss it goes
you ready to come again anyway i feel
bad for him hacking's no fun it is adult
bowling you're right
i feel bad in a way i hope that girl
wasn't underage all those hackers
just say such a nice adult bullying
oh so now you agree i agree i came
before i came around
it's adult bowling it's it is i don't
know it's it sucks it's the worst thing
to go through and it's like
yeah it's awful anyway my heart goes out
to greg paul
and um it gushes for him you might say
my heart gushes for him
one might say that and um i really hope
the girl was not under age
for for his sake for all of our sick for
the world's sake
please greg don't be [ __ ] underage
girls and recording it
because like we're the world is just not
ready for that
the polls aren't ready for that youtube
is not ready for that
greg please my heart gushes for you
though
