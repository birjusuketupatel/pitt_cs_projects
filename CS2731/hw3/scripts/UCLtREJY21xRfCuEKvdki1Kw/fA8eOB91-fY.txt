we had it on the screen as well okay
this one this is what all the sponsors
make you do they go
r r e p s r e s
e n t dot com you just may spell yeah i
don't know
yeah i don't know how to spell
represent.gov
slash h3 twice
just look what's on the screen i don't
know what i'm doing
um let me ask you this ela
what when you give somebody food you
feed them
right but when you give somebody water
what is that verb called you will water
them
there's no word for that is there what
is the word for when you give somebody
water when you
give them a drink not feed could you say
feed them water no you drink them
there's no word how is there no word for
that
quench you don't watch
i quenched him no you water flowers
right
yeah but you don't want that doesn't
mean this like this has been really
troubling me this week
people say ethan you've got serious
troubles people say
ethan you haven't been posting videos
and disappeared what the hell have you
been traveling here i haven't been able
to get over the fact
this whole week that there's no word for
the word to drink to give somebody water
in the english language we have we're
celebrated for having hundreds of
thousands
by far the most words of any language
that ever existed english language no
word for giving water
anybody in the chat gotta answer there's
no chat there's no chat
that's true i don't think there's a i
don't think it exists
to drink so that's been really
driving keep it me up at night frankly
speaking
maybe in the comments you guys will
figure it out
but guys i googled it and for a baby you
suckle them
yeah that's something that only applies
that sounds right oh uh yeah my friend
was thirsty so i
suckled in some of my water i think that
that sounds like it was like hey buddy
here
ethan is suckling the microphone for our
audio just so you know
no you've got a word for thirst i'm
thirsty
so what happens when somebody's thirsty
and you give them something
there's no word you suckle there's no
freaking word
how is there no word for that you
is that mind bending
like and and i've gone my whole life too
until this week without realizing that
that's what's weird too
this person is saying i would go with
hydrate
get get real you know what can i have
some water
yeah here dehydrated let me hydrate you
no that's not
right feed i fed him
[Laughter]
there's no freaking word um
for some reason you would say water the
horse water the horse or water the
flower but
it's not for people you could water a
horse apparently you could say feeding
and watering the horses
so you could water the i mean it's a
little confusing let me be honest
half of me expects that somebody's just
gonna say it and i'm like oh of course
yeah uh you tinkle oh yeah have a tinkle
like oh obviously no there's no freaking
word
so i'm i'm looking to this ongoing
debate
i bet you wish there was a chat right
now yeah it would be nice
can we invent a word like what works
with fed
feed and i drink i drank them some water
that sounds weird
feeding schmeed schmeed hey little
schmeed
so anyway let's get on with it all right
i got a good one actually i've never
heard of this word before
apparently this is a thing to slake
someone
okay like a lake hey dan get the frick
out of town
nobody's liking nobody on this show all
right this is a family show dan
um slake that's a new one to me i don't
know
so guys we've got a lot to get to today
oh my god we've got alex jones banned
from every social media
i got some thoughts about that i think
you guys might enjoy listening to or not
it's one of the things when you express
your opinion about something like that
it's like
i liked you i followed you for years up
until this very moment when our opinions
diverged on this one thing
and now i'm going to stalk you and
threaten your family
it's just an opinion folks you might
disagree with it
but it's just my opinion it's not a
right opinion so that's coming up
very excited about that ajit pai is back
in the news
i'm excited to talk about the fact that
me and el are trying to have kids and i
went to a fertile
fertility clinic and scored it in a cup
to analyze my semen
and it was a freaking weird and wild
experience that i can't wait i took
pictures i can't wait to share with you
all no it was something else man
and a lot of other really exciting
headlines i think you guys are going to
love there was apparently in louisiana
we'll save it i'll save it i'll save it
my dudes i'm gonna save it all
but before we get into all of that it's
the goof of the day
what do we got let's break the ice does
the goof of the day work ela
let's break the ice let's see hey
definitely
pierce morgan tries to sound smart
on good morning britain i haven't seen
this one
her forehead's really glowing huh damn
her forehead's very small there's makeup
that is
for glow like you should think she's
trying to be reflective you put it in
here
and it's like glow but that's not a good
look it just looks like she's got a
greasy ass for it i mean
i'm not trying to make fun i shouldn't
make fun of her i'm just saying
i'm just saying it could be that she was
going for that
there is makeup for that i i'm just
saying if you put her at the top of a
light tower and spun her ass around you
could probably navigate some ships home
you know no no
no no no no no no no crickets really
i thought it was right not that bad
yeah so anyway
a brief history of time it's that
history definitely so just avoid those
types yep to treat a girl right
hey have you ever read the brief history
of time by professor stephen
a brief history of time it's that
history so study into black holes
um
to the nearest five decimal places do
you
first what's your favorite color do you
this is like
i'm i'm embodied by so much cringe that
he's trying to like make her look stupid
what did they ask i didn't understand
that have you ever written
a brief history of time by professor
stephen hawking
oh like trying to see like oh you're
dumb
i don't think this girl ever tried to
sound smart i don't think she ever
presumed to be smart
and then so the genius piers morgan
imagine being a grown man dude
and trying to humiliate some girl who's
obviously not the brightest
but she's not out here being like
she's trying to give a phd dissertation
you know
she's dumb and she knows it he's like
have you ever read this book by
professor stephen hawking i mean i
haven't sir yeah who has except [ __ ]
nerds
but like
um she's not up there trying to be smart
dude what are you trying to disprove she
knows she's dumb she's like no i'm not
into that stuff i'm an idiot you know
that
like what's your point and then the best
part is this he exposes himself
to be the real turd sandwich
let's see it you know that the chris
theorem to this
3.147 there's certainly the first four
digits
here's the best part first of all he
names the digits for something entirely
else it's pi and
he gets it wrong nice i don't know that
that's just what they said
that's pine or pythagoras and you knew
that didn't you haley it was wrong
or maybe i've written it but like a
normal person would wouldn't
know that pierce yeah dip
yeah you just showed yourself up yeah
are you humiliated i've
i don't even know how you get back on
the tv after that humiliation
but um so that's a bit of a goof of a
day what were you saying dan ian has an
answer about the drink
situation no i just typed that when you
said only nerds have read that book
ian's like
all right i'm kidding i i i thought
about i thought about picking that book
up
i'm sorry and anne's like [ __ ]
damn ian do you know the pie to the uh
fifth
digit uh no
[ __ ] idiot what a [ __ ] you idiot
uh what else we have one other
announcement good for the day yoko ono
the legendary
uh lover a soulmate of the great john
artist artist yeah don't i don't mean to
discount her she's done so much more
than just be the
soul mate of john of john lennon so
she's come
out with a new album and she released a
new single
that i thought was uh provocative
emotional um incredible moving
moving it's called warzone anyway guys
as i said
pre-orders are available now great while
supplies last
[Laughter]
is it bad to make fun of somebody for
their artistic i'm not i'm not making
fun i'm a doorstep
you're promoting an independent artist
dude i'm promoting it and thank you for
doing that warzone we're just enjoying
some art
and now my dudes on to the main story at
hand
alex jones you all know him the
notorious
conspiracy theorist right wing i want to
say a lot of people consider him right
right wing
i don't consider him right wing i
consider him an alien
i feel like i'm making him affiliated
with the political party is like
aliens trying to pin down like
what country you exist to on mars
i don't know if that made sense i feel
like even mars is too
uh mars is too pl it's too s too
grounded of a yeah
uh well anyway we'll get into that but
essentially you guys know alex jones
um infowars he was recently
banned by youtube apple
spotify and facebook banned all his
channels removed
he um has been making videos since about
early 2001. now today he's mostly known
for
conspiracy theories and he's very right
leaning and that he has a lot of
conspiracy theories and
a lot of targeted opinions about like
hillary clinton
and obama and what what do you call the
the pizzagate stuff he was deep into
i find it kind of interesting if you go
back
into 2001 just to lay the groundwork on
who this guy
is back in 2001 i have this clip from
waking life
he wasn't really a politically
affiliated guy i just found this
interesting he was very much
anti-government anti-party
[Music]
of enemy propaganda rolling across the
picket line lay down g.i lay down gi
we saw it all very much just about the
government system of
control you know very much
he specifically says in this clip like
that
he's not a member of any party so
somehow his his you know
his style has changed since then
regardless um
so this is what happened this is
from verge which is confirmed by youtube
they confirmed this
this information here conspiracy
theorist alex jones youtube channel
received a strike on tuesday for
violating
the site's community guidelines verge
has learned youtube room four videos
from jones channel which has 2.4 million
subscribers
that contain instances of hate speech
child endangerment
sources familiar with the matter set
youtube channels are deleted if they get
three strikes in a three-month period
two videos contained hate speech against
muslims a third contain hate speech
against transgender people sources said
a fourth showed a child who was pushed
to the ground by an adult man under the
headline how to prevent liberalism all
four videos
yeah all four videos are currently
posted on infowars
now obviously i can't speak about those
specific four videos because
it's so hard to find
i mean his shit's been like scorched
earth from youtube and [ __ ] so it's
really hard to find the clips in
question
so i'm just you know reading the
description
uh but this one i do have the offending
video
oh those videos don't include a new one
which was one of his new greatest hits
of him making a threatening rant about
robert mueller
is it mueller or muller mueller i always
thought it's
molar but he's saying he says
we're stirred a controversy earlier this
week after was posted on facebook that
video does not appear to have been
uploaded to youtube post on infowars
said the video had been posted in a news
documentary scientific or artistic
contact
by the way there's anyway the first
reached out to infowars yada yada yada
jones channel previously received
strikes from youtube in february after
it promoted the false theory that
survivors of the parkland shooting were
actually trained crisis
actors that violated youtube's policy
against harassment and bowling
but strikes expired three months after
they are issued meaning jones child
currently
had just one strike against him now
i actually was able to find the clip of
him talking about robert mueller
and i thought well let's let's see what
kind of stuff this guy's saying
because the question right now the real
debate is like is this a
it's being framed by the people who
support alex jones as a political
silencing that he's being shut down
because
all these big tech companies are super
liberal leaning
and it's a it's a it's a political
shutdown
right it's censorship right so i'm like
all right well
like some of the videos they described
could easily be like
completely open to debate like they're
like pushing a children to the ground
it's like i don't know i have to see
that
yeah who knows but here i have this one
of molar
so let's watch this let me pop this baby
open
now this just happened uh very recently
that's the thing
is like once it's mueller everyone's so
scared
that's what he says he's in front of
people what she did so here we go
this is what he's saying that's the
