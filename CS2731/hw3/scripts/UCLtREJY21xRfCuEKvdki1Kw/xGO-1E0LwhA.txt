because ever since
that we found out you're pregnant and
we're always like all right you're still
pregnant because you
because it's like kind of uneasy during
the first three months because
you can have a miscarriage somewhat
commonly like 10 to 15
i read but i just i think it's so
amazing
you're so cool i always think that to
myself
they say apparently there's already a
heartbeat
that's unbelievable oh where it is and
they say
well this was we read they described the
baby that she has
as the size of a pip an orange seed
an orange seed but they called it a pip
which i thought was really funny a pip
squeak
a little pip but i just think it's so
amazing that eliz
has this little pip inside of her i
don't know i just
i'm so charmed by that i just think it's
amazing
and you've gained a little weight you've
been eating great she's super healthy
she's
radiant i'm already gaining weight let's
see how much
look at this i just i'm i'm so in love
with my beautiful pregnant wife
who's got this little pip inside of her
we've got our first ultrasound in like
uh two weeks
a week a week oh shh right
yeah i think it's two weeks i can't
believe it
it still feels so surreal but yeah
that's gonna make it feel real
yeah yeah sure there's your little pip
we're trying to think of a name maybe
pip
ela hates now go with your first
instinct pen for sure
just go for it at any rate guys let's
get into the show
i'm charmed to be here you're let's get
started right away with your goof of the
day there's a lot to get to
um under the gazebo here today
now this video comes courtesy of your
boy tom segura i saw this on his
instagram
and i had to share it with you
so this is a professional boxer who is
having
promoting a big fight he's having and um
this i'm trying to break this down for
you guys because it's so
it's so wild okay let me show you the
video so he's on a daytime television
show and some
mascot comes out dressed in a burrito
and um i think he was meant to punch him
in the stomach because you can see the
house being like
hit him right here hit him right here
and this box this is a boxer
a world-class fighter he punches this
[ __ ] guy in the
face as hard as he can dude and you
could tell
that burrito that tortilla padding just
isn't enough
so let's see who's usually inside those
two it's probably
not like a guy not someone who can take
a punch
so apparently something flew off
and so apparently he broke this poor son
of bitch's jaw and you see him writhing
around in pain and everyone's kind of
clowning on him
but he you see he's like trying to like
yeah
he's like dude i'm not okay and
everyone's clowning on him
he goes right in the stomach in the
[ __ ] phase
he does pat the stomach and then last
minute yeah
i think it's his fault really the host
well i don't know if anyone speaks
spanish maybe he was like punch him here
definitely don't punch him maybe
he just decked that poor guy he probably
had like padding like extra padding in
the stomach
yeah and nothing in there oh
so apparently he broke his jaw and this
guy said on twitter
i don't know it sounds ironic his
apology because it kind of gave me a
good goal he said
i sincerely apologize to the brave man
that was injured
i have the utmost respect for him his
part he's talking about the guy in the
burrito suit
i have the utmost respect for the
burrito boy
uh his participation willingness and
courage he says
true hero if this is true i would
personally like to invite him to my
december first fight are you
trying to give this guy flashbacks does
he have to wear his burrito costume
i don't know why i just it had me uh in
stitches frankly
uh he he tossed the he he beat the salsa
right out of the burrito
not a mexican joke a burrito joke let's
be clear i've gotten way more classic
integrity you can make race
related jokes about because they put
salsa in burritos
as well as rice and beans and stuff like
that i thought that was clear
do i need to make an apology
[Laughter]
um here's another good one
shannon your pizzas here okay
this is just a goofy we're just getting
started here we're lubing it up we're
lighting it up you know what i'm saying
so this person decided to order a pizza
and they put a sign on the door that
said scream
shannon your pizza is here do not ring
the doorbell or knock
our grandma is sleeping upstairs you
know i have to say
what do you think about somebody leaving
a sign on a door for pizza delivery guy
to scream shannon your pizzas here no
one would actually do that
yeah it's a kind of it's asking a lot of
a pizza guy scream
most people will probably not even read
the letter
i'm not about asking someone to scream
like i'm not
screaming yeah you know what i mean but
this guy
he he receives the note
and he reciprocates so what did the note
say again it said
scream please scream shannon your pizzas
here because my grandma is sleeping and
the doorbell will wake my nan up
so let's see how this uh brilliant mind
reacts to that
and look at this guy strutting up like a
thousand pizza like
this guy's a pizza god if i've ever seen
one he assesses the situation
he strolls up with the confidence of a
thousand fupas a thousand pies
i feel like there's no sound yeah
there's no sound oh well that's pretty
critical
do you have oh yeah i got it i fix it oh
let's try it again there we go there we
go
so foopish maximus approaches the door
with pizza in hand
the cru the crows are calling in
anticipation
of what's to come
and then she opens the door and screams
in her face too
now what i'm wondering is because asking
a pizza boy to shout
i wonder if this was his way of being
like [ __ ] you for making me shout it's a
little bit of rebellion
yeah malicious compliance well first of
all you know nana
woke the [ __ ] up from there you know
what i mean and second of all she opens
the door and he continues
to scream in her face so you know what i
mean
it's just so weird like i wonder if it
was a revenge because who
this guy really sees the opportunity
you know i love that the crows are
crying
i don't think i've ever screamed like
that
it's like he took a full breath
maybe this guy who's so passionate about
pizza understands he's like
they might be in the backyard they might
be in the attic they might be far i need
these people to know that i'm here
it's so dedicated to it this guy's a
legend
you read it exactly they've got some mr
pibb in the bag so that's
these are people that respect pizza and
sodi
because you don't order mr pibb unless
you're deep in it
what is that it's a off brown dr pepper
oh
she's laughing at this
i want more i want i want more i want a
reality show that follows this guy
delivering pizzas
oh my god pick that up
the screaming pizza man tonight on tlc
tlc is on fire yeah
oh my god tlc is on fire because we've
been making all these videos about tlc
and how insane they are
but i've never actually put on the
network and watched i'm like well
this is all amazing stuff why am i not
watching tlc
we started recording the channel yeah i
started i started saving on dvr all the
programs
been watching 90 day fiance holy
shits this is the best show on i swear
to god this is the most entertaining
show on television
um these guys will make a show about
any goddamn thing they have like five
shows about little people
and giant people and giant people
and everyone in between um
i have this whole segment but first i
wanted to show this tai lopez
is using me in a [ __ ] ad you believe
this guy remember we made that video
with tai lopez
yeah here h3 here in my garage with tai
lopez
it's an ad what the [ __ ] ty
this is all the meme layers i knew he
was good
i knew he had it all started from his
ads and now you're in his app what the
hell
i don't think he's allowed to use our
footage like that is he
i don't know i i saw this this morning
and i tweeted i dm'd him on twitter i
was like ty what the hell dude
with the crying laughing emoji really
because
soften the blow a little yeah soften the
blow but give me a [ __ ] break doug
what is this [ __ ] did you reply
i don't know i don't know oh [ __ ] yeah
and what the [ __ ] ty now you're using me
to sell your [ __ ]
i'm not i'm not even getting paid not
endorsing your message
when we first saw his commercials on
youtube like two years ago
if someone told you this
would you believe it not for a second
either
i guess there is some kind of beautiful
poetry to to
you know acknowledging this
that i'm sitting in a lamborghini in a
tai lopez ad is pretty amazing yeah
that is pretty amazing jesus ty what are
you thinking doing this
we got to get him on the phone or
something
so anyway i just wanted to point out
that beautiful little thing that
happened
but i've got clips from 90 day fiance
okay so this show
first of all i got to tell you guys this
show every episode is two hours
long we just found out yesterday like
this [ __ ] is so consumable we
sat in bed the first episode we watched
and we didn't even notice
we thought it was 30 minutes it was just
all of a sudden it was like 1 30 am and
we're like whoa
how did that happen but yesterday we
were watching an episode
yeah and it's been forever and danny is
like how long is this it feels like
we've been sitting here for a while
and i was like i don't know 40 minutes
or something and we look and it's two
hours i've been already watching for an
hour and a half
and we thought we were watching a 30
minute show and didn't even notice
two hour episodes dude tlc is like las
vegas like
they hold you there you know in vegas
they like don't have lights or windows
they like hold you hostage there and
kind of like
hide the fact that you've been hostage
on their network for two hours and even
the commercials are interesting because
they show all their other weird shows
that they have until
there's lots of navaj yeah oh yeah i
like self-promotion little people
giant people you're just laughing at all
this so you don't
we didn't even skip the commercials we
really watched the whole two hours
right but um so 90 day fiance this show
the whole premise is so insane and i and
i
and i stress that i don't even know how
it's legal
because first it usually starts with
them overseas
well they have attorneys so it is legal
whatever it is i don't know
yeah they probably have some select
attorneys making sure that they're not
getting deported
but it starts overseas usually and then
they're bringing them over on some kind
of visa
and they have 90 days to decide if they
want to get married
because they have to decide the visa
expires in 90 days right so they have to
decide am i going to marry you
and immigrate or do i not like you
and i'm leaving and the people
well first of all the people that would
subject themselves to this are already
[ __ ] in the head right it's really
weird i don't know
they're apparently somehow in love they
met somehow that's how you usually start
i mean like who
no i mean first of all who would invite
tlc cameras
into the relationship during this
difficult time it's insane okay first of
all
second of all the way they select
couples is like incredible because
they'll
only they will specifically find
the people that and you look at them and
you say
there is no way that person cares about
the other person yeah because like my
favorite couple is this guy david and
annie
this guy david is a 45 year old he's
overweight
he's broke he has no prospect no
prospects in life
and the girl is like 20 24 right 24.
something like that and like and this is
the recurring message there's no
way that this other person cares so it's
like it's
so it's so
scant it's like so juicy
i am only now realizing that i love
reality television because
at first you react and you're like oh
this is garbage who watches this [ __ ]
but when you put on tlc all of a sudden
you're like
this i cannot turn off
i don't know last night yeah
last night the episode that we watched
which we're gonna show some clips of
it got really depressing i don't know
that i can keep watching it it's amazing
i wasn't depressed i loved every goddamn
second of it
i was getting like actually nervous for
them and
you guys gotta see this well for me i
was like [ __ ] you thought you got
marriage problems
tried dating david
thai massage this blew me out of my
chair
i said when i saw this i turned to
illinois says every
moment of my life however difficult has
been
has been worth it to watch this one
moment on tlc
i've lived the full life i said after i
saw this one clip
and i was watching this live in the
middle of a two-hour episode i was blown
away
so this guy david and this is his thai
fiance they're moving he's so
broke he can't even afford to
get his own place so they're mooching
off his best friend and staying in their
house so in this clip his best friend is
like well what are you gonna do for me
that you guys are staying at our house
and i'm telling you guys
wow i love this i have to leave my
country i have to
leave my family for i go to american
studying life with nothing no money no
job
but i believe in david make mistake i
believe in him
so beautiful i love this
tonight we're having drinks with chris
and nikki before they head back to
america
[Music]
when annie and i get to america we will
be living with chris and nikki it
makes sense because i don't have a car i
don't have an apartment i don't have a
house i don't even have a u.s bank
account
or whatever
[Laughter]
why does he specify u.s bank account
because he lives in thailand oh okay
at least he's uh charming young and
