what up beautiful bastards
welcome to another episode of the h3
podcast
it sounds so wrong
coming out of my house
it was like my dad said it hello
beautiful bastards
here with philip defranco i made that uh
intro in honor of him
uh this episode is sponsored by quip
stitch fix min man crates
and omaha steaks thank you to them more
about that later
next week's guest is vsauce please leave
questions for him on the subreddit
today's guest
because i've already introduced him but
i'm just i wrote this out i require
actually two introductions okay yeah
good
dan mentioned that to me
he got them out just
uh today's guest a man who needs no
little introduction host of the philip
defranco show incidentally also his name
yes that's how original i am he's a
newsman entertainer youtuber
extraordinaire and og youtuber in
addition to being extraordinary i like i
i like that we still use the term og
rather than just like how is this guy
still on this [ __ ] site there's like
five people i still know from the
beginning and right like there's like
smosh the gmm guys
the fine bro is very few right so do
when you think oh gee it's not an age
thing it's just how long you've been on
the i mean the age kind of just goes
with it yeah i mean when we started
there was a guy by the name of oh i
think there were numbers after but it
was like geriatric that was his name and
he was like this old dude that just
shared life stories and he was like the
number one subscribe guy back in the day
really before before it was really
understood what the that's not the
youtube that i know no how old is he uh
he had to be in his 80s
i think that he did pass away
yeah because i mean this was i mean
we're talking about we hope wait did you
laugh
i don't know why
because we're it's like he's a great guy
yeah how can he but i love that he's a
great guy he told great stories he died
i love that geriatric yeah well he
clearly had no illusions about it i mean
his name was i loved it but i loved it i
think him being the number one person on
the side at that time showed really i
think what we've all learned like anyone
can do it like the
the bar is very low obviously like the
equipment's getting better though
everything's becoming more professional
but ultimately it ultimately comes down
to connection stories things like that
and that was infant stage do you still
think that youtube is that same way in
what way today like that anyone can pick
up a camera and make it on youtube as
far as the quality yes i think i think
that i mean if you can grab a phone
what's crazy is you can grab a phone
from like three years ago and have like
decent enough quality audio quality um
and throw it out there as far as people
finding it that's a hard hard hustle
that i don't even know how you do
but it's one of the reasons why like we
we don't do this in every every single
one but we have like a segment on the
show today and awesome we share people's
shorts we share uh people's like
channels that are maybe under 100 000
sometimes over where they where they do
stuff obviously we also keep the
trailers and stuff like that
uh but yeah it's hard like if i had to
start today i don't know how i would do
it it's without a connection it's hard i
mean it was hard even when we started it
took us like a year to get a thousand
subscribers well but then but then you
guys would have like a breakout video
and then it kind of goes from there
there was you had yeah we had a few
breakouts we had several breakouts okay
i would say like several big formative
moments in our growth on youtube one of
the biggest ones probably has to be the
vape nation video though that actually i
don't consider really one of a formative
growth i think the first formative
growth was we had ed a takedown dispute
with uh full screen over a prank
invasion video that was the first time
we were like featured on reddit can i
tell you something yeah i contacted uh
george i think he's the reason why he
reached out to us maybe yeah because i
was like you i don't care if you're on
the right side of this you can't [ __ ]
do this like that's crazy it does like
you can say like we have the we have the
moral no they just [ __ ] stop yeah it
was so petty and ridiculous yeah and i
don't think it was him i think it just
wasn't you just you just you just said
oh
well
sorry
i don't think that it was personal i
think they had something on a piece of
paper yeah when when you end up in these
business meetings what happens a lot of
the time uh and you you forget the
people you forget the community and you
have to always respect that first um but
yeah so there was that but for me
personally i would say would be the vape
nation videos just because or a video
because
i'd really only ever seen your responses
to something right
after something or like what someone did
and that was like oh this is awesome
this is like a whole different thing
that i didn't know it's going to be um
but yeah i don't know
so just in terms of channel growth vape
nation
didn't result in that much channel
growth even though it's the most popular
video oh well on our channel it's a
shame that it's the way it is but on
youtube at least when we were coming up
was and it wasn't by design it was just
it happened incidentally but
the um
the dramas is what you know like the the
full screen one people i think that was
the first time
were introduced to this concept that
mcns were were like had that power right
and that they were abusing it right and
so it became like bigger than than us
right uh the next one after that i think
there was the fine bros that was a big
one for us
there was the sofa stuff
man when we were when we were
beefing was so flow and they were like
threatening to sue us and [ __ ] i
remember like we were in new york at the
time i went to a museum and everyone
there was like i've like we got
recognized so many times that was the
first time that happened everyone was
mentioning those cell phones yes right
and so then there was the cs go gambling
one and then the lawsuit one right so
so i think those were the big formative
steps but i mean there's there was
channels like leafy's is here which and
and channels like him that have received
like meteoric growth
for a few months yeah it was just
unbelievable
and
i don't know that the algorithm would
would lend itself to that kind of growth
anymore unless you're jack or logan paul
because because they did they did have
meteoric growth over this past year or
eliza koshy yeah i was like i don't know
if i should say this but uh
can we mention that we have the same
youtube contact like yeah yeah yeah you
know that he also is the main contact
for logan paul i'm not surprised i was
like that is the best thing i was like
you go to ethan yeah
i love to see graham dabbing right on
the haters you know what's funny he has
mentioned to me you many times but
interestingly graham and yes i am
talking to you and i know you know i
know you watch this you have never
mentioned logan paul to me i i got it
out of him yesterday
he mentioned it and it completely
derailed our conversation i was like has
he given you that maverick merch
and he's like no and i've asked and i
was like [ __ ] logan paul
graham's a great guy i appreciate you i
love you graham um
i don't i don't and i like
i certainly don't want to take away the
achievements of logan jake paul because
i mean they're they're on that grind
right but there's no diversity anymore
like a channel like ours
or even leafy is here which is like a
more extreme version right but i don't
see anything that's even a slightest
[ __ ] a bit edgy even less edgy than
ours ever coming up in the atmosphere
the important thing i think to remember
is that everything's the biggest thing
when it is right and then that sounds
like kind of an empty statement um
i remember when fousey was like one of
the biggest things on the site and i
think he and several other people
thought there was nothing that could
ever slow him down or take him down and
you just you just go like i where i go
i've been here for 11 years i i've seen
like huge jumps before and eventually it
stops right and so that's why i think
it's important for people to plan or
grow or at least try and it's just i
guess you're right you don't see that
everyone but i i will say i mean the
pauls do do that like once again it's
it's very easy uh to talk [ __ ] but
there's they've done a lot of things
very wrong some things well you're right
as far as growth there's a diversity of
content there like the music videos
thing whether you think it's cringy or
not but it's crazy how much content they
produce the amount of views that they
get is just unbelievable that's
unbelievable
um whether you like it or not
the fad of the year was the disney
vloggers and we'll probably have a new
fad
yeah and it's always hard cause you
never know what's gonna happen i don't i
don't know i'm so interested to see
what's happening with with v2 or
anything i don't know anytime there's
like more competition i've heard like
the vine 2 stuff i haven't looked into
it yeah but because i i've i never
really embraced the platform i was on it
a little bit but i don't know it's just
any anything new is always exciting
because it just you're gonna get these
new faces
who made v2 who's behind that is it
twitter what's his name it's the same
guy that uh that just made hq trivia
[ __ ] i don't remember oh is that that
crazy mobile app that gets like 200 000
yeah i mean what's crazy is like once
they start integrating integrating
sponsors and stuff it's gonna blow up
even more i have not used it i've only
ever seen you talk about it what is that
what is it it's uh so at
here's your free plug hq trivia uh
it's a it's a it's a daily trivia app
right so uh i think for us on the west
coast it's noon and six o'clock and uh
they have a host there's 12 trivia
questions you get three options for each
one
and if you get to the end you and
whoever else survives split the jackpot
during the weekend they get money yeah
during the weekdays i mean you have to
win more than 20 to get it so that's
also kind of like the little asterisk
right um because you have hundreds of
thousands of people competing but near
the end
you usually end up getting like 10
to 150 winners um and so you can split
it up but that's just fun it's just like
a nice little stupid break no way you
know you know that reminds me of
xbox live back in the day oh yeah you
used to have this crazy trivia yeah yeah
that everyone was bananas about yeah i
remember it back man this must have been
like 10 years ago
but it was pretty revolutionary i guess
they don't do it anymore but shout out
to everyone out there who knows what i'm
talking about all right let's move it on
a little bit here okay
uh congratulations on the baby boy thank
you that is very exciting i'm a second
baby boy how is he he's good uh we were
saying before he's like a person now
which is awesome he's like the first
three months of baby is just like there
i get i mean i still with this one i
didn't experience it with the first one
this one i'm constantly getting spit on
like spit up on and it's just
as a parent you end up just like going
nothing disgusts me anymore yeah like i
can just see anything and it's nothing
you're just immune like shit's on you
you're like especially because he's my
baby so i'm just like whatever like
nothing's but also like the same day
that happens uh you get different
problems with like i have a three and a
half year old as well he coughed
directly into my mouth last night uh i
was reading him his favorite monster
truck and he goes daddy
like i don't think he meant to do it on
purpose what was your reaction just
because it's like you don't want to yell
like because
it's just
just think about that someone this close
to you
just doesn't give a [ __ ] like just
right in your mouth and he was like oh
so i'm gonna be sick i'm gonna be sick
yeah i uh but it's just i don't know
it's it's it's weird man it's like i got
this little purse in my house and i
always hate when i talk about my kids
because it's what every dad has said and
it's like oh here's the most unoriginal
thing i love them like didn't know i
could experience it uh also uh here's
the thing to anyone that sees my
children is like oh it'd be so great
takes a huge amount of time huge amount
of time if you want your life to 100 be
your life do not have children
i love the choice we made but two done
uh i actually today uh
i canceled it because i have no other
opportunities until like february
uh i cancelled my vasectomy for today so
i could be on this podcast no don't say
oh no
no but now but i mean just be careful oh
my god if i have a third baby it's your
fault let's get that vasectomy in there
because i'm just saying i don't want to
put too much on you yeah i just thanks
for sharing that but yeah i thought i
thought you know i just share those
times
yes
wait well there's not like children
behind the curtain i mean it's time for
them to learn what's up to me it's never
too early no but i was like when i say
two and done two and done uh
like there are so many people like i i
mentioned it off hand to this nurse i
have to
every year i update my insurance and so
i get all this blood work and i
mentioned it and she's like do it i had
a
i
i had a whoopsie baby which i didn't
know as a term uh and her kids are 18 17
and three
and i was like
that's a whoopsie yeah i'm like i'm not
doing that cycle that's what you see
daisy but otherwise great
what's the procedure of a vasectomy are
you scared are you nervous about that
doesn't it hurt at all or is that just
like nip your child well i went in there
and he uh he was very handsy i didn't
know i thought i didn't think the the uh
the what's the word uh the checkout
before the uh the operation was as
handsy and pulley and and he's like well
essentially everything you felt today
it'd be similar it'll be like a little
bit different but you'll be good we're
just gonna nip your chode if you're
showing no and they show you about the
twisting and stuff like that and sounds
but you know what actually it made me
okay with it and it's so stupid because
it's a youtube video is i watched uh uh
rhett and link do it on their video and
they brought a dude cameron video sorry
huh what say that again right link got a
vasectomy
oh yeah no it's on their channel why
talk about marketing
i mean talk about vlogging everything oh
yeah
no how do they show that uh well they
they they have like this little i'm
gonna have to ask them about that
they're coming on so yeah oh about their
children oh yeah they did it together
like it was a it was they hold hands it
was a brodio i think so
yeah i uh that's strange you got it
hey i'm shocked
but i'm also a little bit horrified yeah
but i was like uh i mentioned it and my
my buddy who films all our vlog stuff he
was like i can go right i was like no
we don't have that relationship i was
like
while they were filming they
accidentally went too low there's just i
forget on which which guy but there is
now video footage in the world of just
dick and balls of one of those guys
and that's that's that's next level
trust oh my god that's that's in the
archive somewhere yeah yeah that's like
that's like december 1st 2007. b footage
oh my goodness uh but but what but they
made it seem okay so i was like okay
well okay i guess they're doing a good
thing exactly
so it's it's in and out there's no
recovery there's like a they yeah they
say like you can do light lifting and
stuff like that a week later
one of the one of the other reasons
other than the podcast was uh we're
going to utah in like three weeks and i
was like i'm not gonna be stuck in
inside while everyone's having fun
that's yeah
that's it but so i'm sorry to break to
labor this because i'm just generally
intrigued because i you know
i mean someday i'm going to get my child
snipped as well probably
um
what do you think
they have like this picture diagram
thing it's essentially just a little
yeah two cuts they cut like tiny little
little bit of tube out and then they
like got it and then yeah and then i
guess it just
goes into your throat it's just a backup
but then they say don't have sex for
like a certain amount of time and you
have to you have to just go to town on
yourself for a while
they'd say that yeah well that's
actually the terminology they use
go to town on your song yourself so it's
like
so it's like a pool and then you plug it
up so it's continually it just can't get
through there's like there's tension
there well no because then i think you
would explode if there was actually
the flow i think the way they say it is
it just the body absorbs it i think
that's what it is
yeah it's very the body absorbs it
that's something i should have probably
researched it more
i mean in a way the less you know the
better but that i think that speaks to
how much i don't want to have a third
child
seriously you can just yeah we got this
right we're good okay
i've heard a lot about male
contraceptives that are coming out like
men can take a pill and apparently be
really i mean it's something that's been
in development
the thing is i wonder like what it does
