sponsored by squarespace honey and quip
we have got an incredible flippant
episode to unback for you today
okay from first of all we have later
coming in the boys jack and eric
first of all already the best episode
doesn't get better than that until now
we've got on the phone today
kyle the cougar champion you guys may
recall him from a recent video we did he
was featured in a tlc the learning
channel
a documentary about strange addictions
he's a 30 year old dude who slam dunks
on 90 year olds but he dates exclusively
older women
and he basically wrote to us after we
made the video talking about him saying
like
they they misportrayed him he wanted to
clarify a couple of things
i have a couple of things i want to
clarify with him too
but he's an interesting guy right i mean
who who who of us have lived that life
you know what i mean
nobody to actually slay someone with
your penis is kind of like
the ultimate honor as a man it's like i
[ __ ] i killed her with my dick
i wonder what he has to say about that
i'll ask if that's an accurate portrayal
of what he does in the bedroom
um so he's lined up we're gonna get on
the phone with kyle and then jack and
eric are gonna hop right in and
it's the may the force be with you memes
happy star wars day
in a way the new star wars are fun but
they've also kind of ruined
the specialness of star wars
it used to be may the may the fourth be
with you and it's like this beautiful
perfect franchise that everybody loves
and now it's all like that one was okay
this one was fine it's like there's
nothing special there's han solo origin
movie coming out in like a week it's
like
you know it'll probably get a 70. and
then all of a sudden
because we all wrote off the prequels
we're all like well it's still perfect
because george came back and he's a
little old
i don't know
i see what you mean yeah
i have fun watching them just live it
you know just live things you know ian
the intern is um an adamant defender of
the prequels he loves them whoa
interesting yeah yeah i like this
argument with him a few times ian i'd
like to bring you on and possibly could
you prepare a dissertation and we can
kind of like challenge your thesis like
a doctorate's degree
he's out walking shredder but when he
gets back i'll uh i'll see if he's
he probably had something prepared he
was pretty passionate about it he has
interesting theories in
he's a free thinker and under a
big kanye
yeah
all right but enough of the [ __ ]
by the way next week we're taking a week
off
we were trying to think i want to take a
vacation yeah but then we're like oh
let's go to hawaii did we talk about
this already was this somewhere else
i don't think you guys talked about it
i was like i want to go to hawaii oh i
want to go to europe i want to go to
mexico and then i'm like hold on a
[ __ ] second
these aren't vacations these are always
miserable works with so much headache
like you gotta find a flight and the
airport going to airports is worse than
any day of work you've ever done
unpacking right and then by the time you
get five days but you're work because
like the last two days you're worrying
because you're like oh i gotta pack my
[ __ ] up and go to the airport yeah every
time we go to israel we do that every
year it's not vacation let's be frank
it's pretty flippin far from vacation so
what i had this brilliant idea no one's
ever thought of it before
i was like you know what we're gonna do
i'm gonna turn off my phone
i'm not gonna look at social media i'm
not gonna do anything i'm just gonna
chill in my house
i'm gonna just relax
that's a [ __ ] vacation you remember
when you were kids summer vacation that
was a vacation
it was such a vacation that you used to
be like i'm ready to go back to school
yeah that's a vacation when you're like
i'm bored
i got when we decided to do that i all
of a sudden got so excited i can't wait
like that sounds amazing yeah i'm
relieved i was like relieved i just like
the idea of not using my phone right
nothing no emails no
anything
i've been feeling more and more
about how actually toxic
all the social media stuff going on and
all the like i mean how the frequent
checking of the phone and
like either looking for like news or
reddit post or twitter or instagram
something to satisfy
you're always searching for something
like interesting like where is it and
you've just you get less and less
reward and more and more time on and it
really feels like an addiction it's
become so depressing yeah it is
it's funny remember we used to make fun
of those videos
social media but that guy makes it more
they
the way that they do it that i don't
like like prince
where he's like look up from your phone
it's more about
he doesn't really approach it from a way
that
that's like this is an addiction and
let's use this in moderation it's like
look up
and don't look down look up on your
phone i don't know the way they do it's
annoying yeah i'm just a guy talking so
the way that i do it when i feel it it's
real
no i'm an [ __ ] he was right
he was ahead of the game
but i feel like now more than ever
people are starting to realize like man
this [ __ ] is kind of like an actual
problem all of a sudden yeah
yeah our intern ian he said he'd erased
all of his social media and he has a
little brother who says he uses
instagram even more and it's like a real
problem
interesting the kids who are younger
than us have like new problems yeah
because i grew up with the internet
but now these kids who are coming up now
were born with social media right yeah
and that is a whole new twisted
mind [ __ ] to grow up with
i don't know it's really lately it's
just depressing me like
instagram used to be my favorite me too
and now i'm like every time i open it i
get depressed i don't know why
facebook's been dead to me for a long
time but i still facebook was my first
social media but i still after all this
time i don't use it i still reflexively
go
type f in the browser go to facebook i
don't look at it for very long maybe
like
30 seconds
but i i hate being on facebook but i
still after all this time
it's to go to that weird habit reddit
started to get really bad for me
like i'll all sit in bed and waste an
hour just scrolling reddit and and in my
mind i'm like i don't want to be doing
this i could be doing anything else but
this but
spend an hour so so it used to be like
the j i i enjoyed it and i was in the
moment but now i'm wanting to be doing
something else but so you still do it
yeah it's weird it's so bad it's a weird
thing
it sounds like everyone is feeling it
too like especially lately yeah
what are they doing
because they know they're doing [ __ ] to
like manipulate you for sure you know
since facebook bought instagram i've
been reading stuff about how
they'll specifically under report likes
on your posts so that you will think
that it's underperforming and you'll
keep checking it my god out of
insecurity like how twisted how sick can
you be
when did they buy instagram they did it
secretly it happened like i don't know a
year ago
but there was longer than that how was
it yeah it was
but that was that was so smart of them
because that's why i hate instagram now
because it used to be my favorite one
they're getting more manipulative with
the stories the stories keep you on yeah
the i don't know and now they started
like the like thing
and they started switching the order
it's no longer chronological yeah i hate
that and so it's really all about
manipulating you
at any cost
no ethical consideration exactly
just to spend as much time on it as
possible
well anyway let's talk to kyle the
grandma [ __ ] i wonder what's his
social media like
well i'm really looking forward to that
vacation i'm gonna really just try to
unplug and what i'm gonna try i'm
looking in the chat right now and a lot
of people are saying they feel exactly
the same yeah i don't know there's
something in the air where just suddenly
we've gotten really this should be like
a national thing where everyone takes a
week off of everything damn that'd be
that'd be killer
next week
that'd be really cool next week guys do
it let's all do it together seriously
like leave the calls on if there's an
emergency people can call you sure but
no text no anything yeah
i'm really looking forward to it and and
one thing i want to focus on is like
just doing things that are i know are
good for me during that time like
i'm not going to work i'm going to enjoy
myself i'm going to play video games and
stuff but i'm not going to like drink
i'm not going to order pizza i'm not
going to what i want to do is focus on
like exercising every morning because
usually i make excuses like oh i don't
have time i have too much [ __ ] yeah
right gotta work i'm i'm busy browsing
reddit for an hour every morning so what
i want to try to do is like take care of
stuff around the house
get in the habit of exercising every
morning eating healthy and just having
like a holistic experience of like
wellness
i love that idea
so we'll see where we're at so yeah i'm
looking forward to that
um
so no podcast next week um
but hey
you know what
okay let's get back on track
um so kyle the cougar champ
a lot of you probably know who he is a
lot of you probably don't so i'm gonna
play a little clip here to bring you
guys all up to speed who who those who
are and not familiar with your boy the
great my name is kyle i'm 31 i live in
pittsburgh and i'm addicted to dating
older women
where's the [ __ ] mouse button much
older women
couldn't find it
all right like 60 70 80 year old older
women
i love everything about older women i
love the smell i love the feel
i love the
mentality have something to say no i
just i love that it says i love the
smell yeah i love the smell it's like i
want to actually ask them what do they
smell like
what is what is how do they smell like
what is the smell
because when i think of older women i
think like like musky closet like closet
of old yeah like a stinky house that
i guess he likes that maybe like you
smell of old socks i don't know
i love dentures women you know you
seriously
ladies i promise you telling your man
that you have dentures will not turn
them off it'll put a smile on his face
he'll put a smile on his pants
okay i want to know who wrote that line
for him
hold on the dentures
dentures will
put a smile in your pants
so anyway this guy he's really
enthusiastic and actually what we found
out after we made this video is that
while he's dating a 91 year old
currently or i don't know if she's in
one of the videos at least but he we
later discovered he makes porn he's a
pornographer
and he uh
he [ __ ] old ladies on camera i don't
know if that's his primary business but
i have so many questions for him
so with that being said let's let's
bring him out man kyle uh let's grab him
kyle the cougar champion are you there
hey it's good to be here man i'm kind of
under the weather i have a cold but um
yeah good to be here you sound great man
don't worry about it but
uh first of all let me just say what a
honor and thrill it is to be in the
presence of the one and only cougar
champion is that some is that a title
you've given yourself or was that
anointed by others
that was something um when i decided i
was going to do porn i had to pick a
name and that's just the name i came up
with there's a hell of an echo while i'm
talking to you oh maybe it's because it
is so loud oh here we go in our room
yeah let me fix that dan he's got uh
feedback
can you hear me dan
yeah you know what here let me uh it's
kind of loud in there yeah yeah a little
bit louder
all right kyle go ahead try that now
okay is that better i can hear you
that's much better okay okay great
so um
you had this great well first of all
what is it actually you're dating a 91
year old right
okay um at the time that video was
shooting they they portrayed it or they
wrote it as a part and her and i were
never dating we were you know we were
having saturdays
um but we were never together i rarely
ever get involved on you know
monogamy exclusivity with anyone that's
very rare for me
so
i guess well did you were you having sex
with the 91 year old
oh yeah the later in the video the my
transition video yeah we were [ __ ]
for a while and you know what i'm
talking about because you saw the um my
my twitter page trigger champion the
point i was all of that oh was that with
her i i honestly had to i couldn't hang
for that long dude i'm sorry there was a
video she had some tats around her
nipples i was like damn this lady's
[ __ ]
really seen some [ __ ] oh no that's
that's someone different like you're
talking about shirley the one that
wasn't the um that was in the strange
addiction that was
actually no well let me ask you this
when you're when you're slamming on a on
a 91 year old are you more do you have
to be more gentle because i know you you
have quite a bit of range you'll go
anywhere from like 70 to 100 i don't
know where you draw the line but like
are you more gentle when you when you
slam dunk on older ladies
i would say no you know the video that
you posted um in the piece you get on me
where it showed me
there's like 91. yeah
okay we've done porn together with her i
never went easy i never took these i
are you ever concerned about damaging
the goods i mean what wrong thrust could
be it could be a
could be the last one
well actually as of recently yes i am
because i've sent two women to the
hospital
literally no oh
you broke [ __ ] dude tell me about
that situation
okay so with this one lady and she
claimed that she hadn't had sex and say
like 15 years she was still married so
we were we went out a couple of times my
second time with this hotel we're
drinking and whatnot
um we got down like i did that one move
we put our legs like way back we felt
like our knees
when we got to the hospital the doctors
looked up inside her and they say there
was a tear in the back of her [ __ ]
looked like a smiley face so they had to
stitch her up we couldn't do anything
for like six weeks how did that make you
feel did you feel bad or accomplished
a little bit of both actually
has anyone ever died while while you've
been in a relationship with them
yes actually marge died at 94. um connie
was on the website she passed away last
year um linda's passed away damn um
when someone passes away like are you do
you go to the funeral huh
um i've actually one time i got a phone
call from my grandson the way that was
91 of you showed the video of me and
heart kissing her grandson called me up
and was just like you know and i just
want to say thanks for you showing her a
good time glad
um does it
how do you feel like when when they pass
away and is that like a like what's the
what's the emotion that you experience
because you you got to know when you get
when you get with these ladies that
that's a strong possibility right that
they
they're
they're on an expiry
there's been date than one that happened
only two of them really hit me i mean
the one in the video where i was kissing
margin and i felt bad when she died but
i actually felt bad for not feeling as
bad as i thought
the one that really got to me the one
that really got to me was connie um
is the one from the video
sorry connie's the one from the video
right the one that was too young for you
damn wow
well uh
damn doug tell me about
she was a lawful man
together
she was just incredible
so when you mentioned that dentures put
a smile on your pants like was that
something that that you offered to the
camera or was that something that the
producers helped you dream up
as much as i hate to admit it that was
just total ad love
and
it's i love how you say that line of
like i guarantee you all men love your
dentures do you think that all men want
to [ __ ] old ladies or
i think um i think
once you experience a gum job
definitely standard is that what it's
all about what's your experience yeah
yeah once you give a gun job so if
that's a new standard so describe a gum
job to me i mean
it's like it's getting a blow job but
like there's no there's no chance of
