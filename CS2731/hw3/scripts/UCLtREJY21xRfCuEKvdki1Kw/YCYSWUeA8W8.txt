[Music]
welcome everybody to another episode of
the h3 podcast live
that's right we are back and we are
streaming
on youtube welcome everybody
we thought it'd be fun
to come over to youtube and give it a
shot and see what it feels like because
we've never actually live streamed the
show on youtube we know the content
lives here so i thought it would be a
fun experience to see how the experience
differs just mix it up a little bit keep
you on your toes
today's episode is sponsored by hymns
blue apron and express vpn
so ela you are looking it's an extremely
good today's stream
on your computer
today's episode by the way is it working
are we live we're live but i think
you're watching the stream on your
laptop
i just entered a hellscape that i never
want to go back to
what happened
that was the sound of hell was it okay
if you go to hell that's why you're
pretty much
that is eternal damage
it's really different between the two
because on twitch you have 30 minutes to
just [ __ ] around while you stream
because we take it off we cut it and put
it on youtube here you live stream and
the vod just wherever it lives there
shall be buried
there's no take backs here so it's a
little more stressful i'm a little more
on edge
you know
there's no take backs there's no
starting over like if i slip a couple
racial slurs on twitch it can be like
hey let's maybe cut the slurs ethan
not that that happens it's happened so
many times people don't know because we
cut it
i'm actually a huge i'm hugely racist
but
we have good editors
oh there's so much to get to today i'm
actually really i'm super excited about
today's show we have a ton of new stuff
we're trying including our first ever
live performance musical
we have completely pimped out the back
room we have chaos chaos which is a
really wonderful i would say indie rock
i feel like that's a good uh yeah
description they're incredible i can't
wait for you guys to hear them they're
going to be playing at the bottom of the
show we are going to talk about my
social media detox talking about logan
paul getting a
vasectomy
from chris dalia on twitter he straight
up snipped his tubes and i know you guys
don't like me talking about logan paul
because i do talk about him a lot
but give me a [ __ ] break
it's the he's humiliated himself so hard
how am i not supposed to he gave him a
prostate exam and he snipped his tubes
all in one move i dare you to find an
ass doctor that can do that [ __ ]
finger in and i'm telling you
crystal is an incredible surgeon
um what else
that's about it let's get right there
flip into it so you guys probably know
that i was
we we were taking a week break we
where we weren't using social media for
a full week seven days pretty much
well it was a big a stay vacation and i
had just got this feeling that i was
wasting
so much [ __ ] time
on all these social medias
it was the first thing i would do you
know in the morning
when you catch yourself
so bad
when you catch yourself going for that
phone like your eyes open and like even
before your first thought or impulse to
pee enters your head the phone is the
first impulse that's sick yeah the first
thing i'll do instagram
right and i'm not even active i barely
post on instagram yeah but i'll scroll
down every morning for like an hour
everybody listening probably knows about
this impulse that we all have for me
it's facebook i never use it but i've
been using that website for so freaking
long it was my first social media that
i'll when i open a browser i will
inflexively without thinking start
typing facebook
and it's so [ __ ] up and these days
i'll still do it just from like muscle
memory but i'll close it immediately
because i don't want that [ __ ] it's
insane um
so i st and not only the time wasting
but also i feel like
it was making me unhappy because you're
always thinking about all these other
people you're worrying about all these
other people what they're doing yeah
you're not everyone else is having so
much fun right and they look so good
making amazing
good [ __ ] yeah
it's like everything else looks so good
and then you sort of feel this sadness
yeah
and and you're not living in the
physical world
your head is in you're just consumed by
all this [ __ ] but you don't even
think about what's in front of you
people are in front of you every you
know the physical world and i have this
feeling too that spending so much time
on social media actually impairs my
thoughts i feel like i don't think as
clearly or as freely
because it literally just
is a is a distraction
when you're on social media you're not
thinking about [ __ ]
so it's almost like you know in brave
new world they give you these caps so
you can't think
yeah that's kind of what twitter is in a
weird way
you know what i mean twitter instagram
they're all
i don't know because i used to love
instagram but now instagram is just as
depressing as all the other
facebook bought it right they ruined
everything so let me tell you about how
my week was um
so
all throughout the week first of all i
was
i had to erase
youtube and twitter and instagram
off my phone first of all because
you just catch yourself
aimlessly clicking open the tab
and you look at it for a second before
you realize like oh [ __ ] i'm not
supposed to be doing this but that's too
much yeah so it was really a beautiful
thing when i erased it off my phone i
would go to look for it
out of memory and then i'd be like
that's right it's not there
so i feel like that step was super
important first of all
um
but the thing first of all that i
realized was like
how much free time you have
like i'll wake up in the morning
and i'll
i'll wake up at 8 00 am and i'll without
thinking about it literally waste two
[ __ ] hours
on my phone
on reddit reddit is a bad one i didn't
visit reddit at all either read it or
twitter all these guys
yeah
yeah you so i'll wake up at 8 a.m and i
grab my phone and i'm like
i'll go to like a news site and see the
headlines and i'm like well i can't [ __ ]
around on a news page for two hours
so then i'm just stuck with
myself so i ended up doing all this [ __ ]
like i fixed
some exercise machine
think about [ __ ] put on put on tv watch
a show which is something it's so crazy
i like i'm like i don't have time to
watch my favorite show i'm so [ __ ]
busy
meanwhile you're lit you are wasting two
hours every morning so i put on a show
you know
or i'll put on a video game by the way i
beat god of war it was fantastic when's
the last time i beat a video game yeah
fantastic
ela hated that
i'm like i never played a game all of a
sudden it's like i'm alone in the house
there's no one to talk to ethan cannot
get up he cannot help he can't walk
shredder is paralyzed it's like being
alone
let me play my game woman
i hate it but okay all right well that's
that's a conversation for another time i
loved that game so much i recommend
everyone play god of war
it was a ton of fun the storytelling was
breathtaking and if you have a
significant other they'll love it
they will they'll love that they'll love
it i guess the fact that almost means
that you love me that we have a good
relationship right
yeah because if you hated me you'd be
like play your game shut the [ __ ] up
right
no i hate being like alone and then i'm
like so
lonely
sad dude
um
what the [ __ ] was i saying
so
oh
uh god i lost my train of thought from
the god of war what were you talking
about the uh uh
a television show and i would really
enjoy watching a documentary or a movie
or a show that i like and you know
classically when we were kids tv
was thought to be the biggest time
waster of all time
and i'm thinking they're thinking like
this is not a bad activity because to
consume tele well
to consume media in that way you have to
be at home you have to be in a physical
location you have to have the time set
aside to sit there if it's two or three
hours or whatever
you have to be there and you have to
have that time allotted for it yeah
and you're taking in a creative work of
something or somebody there's some value
there right somebody poured a lot of
soul and energy into creating that yeah
now if you compare that to social media
okay
social media has taken time wasting
procrastination to
levels never before seen
because you have in your pocket the
ability to waste time anywhere
any [ __ ] where you are you can blow
an hour no problem and here's the part
that really gets you and there's nothing
of value there
nothing
a television show is a beautiful
work of art
the blood sweat tears and create a
vision of hundreds of people
social media is nothing
are you telling me that logan paul is
not putting out creative art when he's
on twitter tweeting
well there's some debate there's some
debates we had there i'm being
hyperbolic of course you must carve out
a space for logan paul with everything
you talk about um but
like there's nothing of value lost if
you're off twitter for a week
you lose nothing
it's just you know what i mean
that's that's 10 hours of your life
in the physical
plane of existence
so the first two days were hard i was
kind of anxious and the thing is you
feel out of the loop you know
the the really hard one for me was not
going on reddit but that one was really
important to to not do
and you feel like you're missing out on
stuff like apparently
kanye and justin roiland were tweeting
at each other and we were gone yeah we
got updates
we got updates in a group chat about
that one
but like
the yeah the worst was ready because i
get my news from there but i just went
on like a news website
and got it there and you that takes like
five to ten minutes right you you really
you feel like you're missing so much but
you're not if there's a big headline you
hear about it on the radio you hear
about it everybody from france yeah like
people used to no man is an island
you're not you're not disconnected if
you're not on reddit there's people that
don't use reddit believe it or not
i actually don't really
you know from right what i'll check the
subreddit sometimes
but
are you [ __ ] crazy i love reddit so
much it's a problem but again it turns
into all the other social medias i go to
reddit
and i start scrolling and what happens
is you're getting a dopamine kick like
when you do a drug a reward system that
like that on all social media and it's
harder and harder to get that
satisfaction of like oh i love this post
that's just what i was looking for and
i'll go to reddit and i'll scroll for
pages and pages until i find something
i'm like that was you know what i mean
i skimmed that [ __ ] so hard now
anyway i'm now that i'm back
i kind of begrudgingly reinstalled all
the apps on my phone i didn't want to
because i felt just like mm-hmm it's so
blissful
but it's kind of weird for us because
it's also kind of work yeah to
to tweet and post and stuff like that
like i have to refresh and
yeah just to be present on yeah it is
important
i think what i'm going to try doing
as much as possible is just
doing the post
and then getting out
i mean no you know everyone's
i just got to get out man no offense to
anyone who's making bomb-ass tweets out
there
i just need to get out
i don't think it's healthy what we're
doing to ourselves
and then this brought me to another
question that i had for myself i'm
thinking we used to goof on this guy
prince yep
who made this video like uh look up from
your phone is super dramatic and corny
and i used to be like you know this guy
he's talking [ __ ] on phones like
shut up just don't use your phone and i
used to blast this guy and say he's such
a nerd
and i was like wait
am i like what's the difference between
me now because i'm i'm saying that i
don't think social media is good for me
it really took us like right it took us
like a couple of days we were like wait
were we making fun of him and now we're
like the victims i need to reassess that
because i still feel like the
correlation is not exact yeah i don't
know if i'm in denial
you know what i mean well let's watch
the video because let me refresh some of
you guys memory this is what we're
talking about here let me pull this up
where the f flipping heck here it is
down at itself
did you know the average person spends
four years of his life looking down at
his cell phone
[Music]
it's like where'd you get that i don't
know i wrote about it like all right man
all right i'm just gonna let it play i'm
gonna let you guys watch this it's hard
for me not like i agree with him kind of
i think now but let's watch the video
but it's the way it does they like them
music did you know that the average
person spends four years
this video came out like four years ago
i mean people were only using social
media heavily for like four years
it wasn't as bad as it is today when he
made the video so was he profit yeah was
he ahead of his time right
no this guy's just kind of clone i will
these touch screens can make us
like this is the sh see what he's doing
is like
well
what he's doing is like
when so i don't believe that
i think what i'm talking about is like
somebody on a toilet taking a [ __ ] but
on twitter when we go to dinner or
anyone today goes to dinner do you not
open your phone
but is that a problem between
relationships like she's there like
seriously dude i just want to live my
life i guess i guess that's that's a
problem that he taught like the problems
with the relationship the problem is
everybody everybody's doing it you don't
have a problem no everybody's doing it
right it's the problem you and yourself
he was speaking the problem with his
video i'm not i just got to flood a
plate for you guys yeah but let me just
say this
i think the problem with his video is
that he's speaking to this like
these enlightened few
who are like i see the problem
i have a flip phone
i only use nokias from 1993. i'm
enlightened like unlike all my plebeian
scumbag friends who use iphones [ __ ]
peasant [ __ ]
i'm on a higher plane of existence it's
funny because we used to kind of be like
that for a while like we didn't have a
smartphone when everyone else did
remember for for the longest time our
plane of existence why do you think our
videos were better
[Laughter]
but eventually you got to get that
smartphone
i think it's coming from that place of
like authority of like
we know
we are enlightened
and we see the problem with the world
they don't they are the problem it's
like it's like the vegans who
give vegans bad rap because they're like
preachy about it yeah
you need to look up like we were at we
were actually at a restaurant this week
which rather outside sitting
and a lady came to me and she was like
you're eating here and i'm like yeah
i remember that
and she was like you know you shouldn't
like there's no difference between what
you're eating and and like she pointed
at trader yeah and it's like you know
maybe you're making a good point but
like why i don't know
leave me alone the reluctance of being
like that's fine point but at the same
time do you do this to everybody you see
with the dog who's eating it and i'm
gonna approach a conversation with you
and like i'm trying to have a lunch
right now which i'm trying to live my
life can you [ __ ] move on please
i but the thing that you understand is
that she's on a higher plane of
enlightenment okay like you can't
possibly understand the vast intellect
that her and this guy they're looking
down from like mount olympus and you can
possibly understand
did you know that
that people waste four years of their
life on their phones either
by the time someone's seven years old
they've wasted six years of their life
on their phone
i think he said do the math
not four hours he said four years
