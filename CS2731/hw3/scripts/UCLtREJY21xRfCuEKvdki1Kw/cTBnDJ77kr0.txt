technically that would be true some
would say
and spiritually also true
she's my best friend
she's my business partner and she's my
better half
bone
and she's bow in the house she's in the
house it sounded like that he's my best
friend it's my helper my son bo
um
we thought it'd be interesting look
we've we interview all these these uh
interesting prolific characters well
we've got one right here
that we all want to know more about gila
klein's one of the most interesting
people on the internet so we thought hey
i thought let's let's put her in the
seat
ela's not like hey let's interview me
that was my idea
well anyway she's really come out of her
shell lately
and what a big pimp
she's going back to the show she's back
in the show i've been nervous the whole
week about this
it's it it is stressful and i appreciate
you coming out because you are a
naturally very shy person
i don't know why it's nervous to think
of me as the guest like
because usually i'm like the second
you're chilling on the sideline i'm
chilling well you do you have
there was this one great moment and curb
your enthusiasm that i think you really
identified what was it larry said i
identify with everything on curb
but
um he was talking about how when he has
something during the week like a meeting
or a doctor or whatever it ruins the
whole week for him because he knows that
he has to think about that one thing
that he has to do right
like that yeah i relate to that but i
think you relate more
that's why i love it you're the best
well let's start from the top here i
want to talk about some current events
with you all right
now everybody's probably aware of all
this business happening first harvey
weinstein
this guy he looks like shrek if i'm
being honest like like a real version of
shrek he looks pretty scary yeah he's a
and now like nobody cared about harvey
weinstein because he's just some
soulless movie executive and they're
like oh he raped a bunch of people no
surprise but now it came out that louis
ck
was someone that i know you cared deeply
about
has been jerking off
this is this thing he's been jerking off
in front of of uh girls
it's so weird so how do you feel about
all that
i i felt really sad
like yesterday especially when the whole
story like officially came out
i don't know it's just sad
uh
for some reason with someone like harvey
weinstein i don't care as much yeah
it's it's sad in a different way just
said that it happens yeah
but with louie i kind of feel like he
died yesterday kind of feel like
i'm not going to see him anymore like
damn that's true in a way i'm sure
it's just weird what's he going to write
up she's going to write a shtick about
how oh should girls might be my dick huh
he can't do that and his jokes are
always kind of like that like
everyone was talking about how he has a
lot of jokes so like
men are so gross how
women
how do women even get close to men
because they're like the number one
threat but obviously when he says it's
funny right
but now it's gonna be weird
does it surprise you the these things
coming out because it's like a land it's
like a waterfall a landfall
i wasn't surprised at first
i feel like every woman
in a way goes through something of that
sort which is crazy but i think almost
all women that i met
and we talk about it are like not
surprised
but it's it's been so many stories all
of a sudden at once that i am becoming
surprised and then with louie i was
surprised i didn't see that oh louie it
was like not louie like anyone but louie
but he
he did he did write like his statement
about it right which was pretty good i
thought and i just feel bad for him now
do you want to read it i have it
available i mean it's kind of long but
essentially he was like
it's kind of long people can read it but
is you can tell he's really
hurting now from
understanding maybe what he's done maybe
before he didn't understand
he said in his apology he justified it
by saying well i asked girls first if i
could show them my dick yeah but he
acknowledges like the situation is much
more complicated than that so even if
you say yes at the moment
as the lady even if she said yes at the
moment i think the situation is so
surreal you're like with one of your
idols right and you're thinking at the
moment this is weird but i don't know
what to do so you say yes
but later not even expecting him to
necessarily even you think he's kidding
or something yeah but later you can
think about it and be like that was
really [ __ ] up so right
i think the way he did it specifically
because
it's it's one thing to go on a date and
be like hey i've got a weird thing can i
i want to jerk off in front of you but
this was like
he just got off stage
and they were coming about to do a set
or something like in a professional
environment it's when
weird is
do you think that he was going to get
away with it after doing this for so
long and it's so weird and brazen like
how do you think he could but uh harvey
weinstein this is a weird timing right
now
and like kevin spacey is now that one
shocked me too
i the way i see it is like these guys
like
that's it they're done you're not gonna
see anything with these guys anymore
maybe for like 20 years maybe in 20
years you can come back and be like
remember when i was a gross
guy who
jerked in front of people right big
laughter lots of applause he's so brave
it's crazy man yeah
well
rest in peace louie
it was fun while it lasted
i i just it's it's just a shitty
situation i feel bad for both sides
obviously it did something disgusting
that he shouldn't have done
but
you know like
the fact that he put out a good
statement i'm not saying that
that's it we can forgive him sure but it
made me feel bad for him too you know i
feel bad for everyone
it's important because when you look at
how kevin spacey for example responded
that was that was lame he's like sorry i
was drunk and anyway i'm gay
are you like okay yeah gays do that yeah
yeah that totally explains that we all
we all play around with 14 year olds
when we're drunk don't we yeah but it's
isn't it kind of
that was one of the weirdest apologies
ever yeah my god dude
um but louis he really seems to be
grappling with
this new image of himself because he's
not he's different now
his life his image his career it's all
undergone an immediate paradigm shift
yeah
and he's grappling with that and he had
so many things coming out and it's all
cancelled now yeah a movie
that this company put in five million in
that movie for him and they're like
they're apparently not a big company so
it was a big
investment for them that's awful and you
had a netflix special planned that's
going to be cancelled
a bunch of stuff i saw this meme on
reddit that was written as like a
perfect louis ck joke that he would say
if it was about someone else
he was like um
it's a shame that the greatest
comedian of our generation is going down
in his prime but maybe
maybe you should have shown your penis
to a bunch of uh girls backstage without
their consent
yeah
obviously his delivery is much better
yeah but i feel like he could deliver
that joke very well mm-hmm anyway let's
get off this [ __ ]
yikes
what okay let's start from the top here
in terms of of uh
who you are you're israeli i think most
people know that by now what's it like
growing up in israel like i mean us
americans do we take [ __ ] for granted
um
it's a it's like a very general question
uh
yes
a little bit
about what you said about americans i
feel like since i moved here especially
in california
it's kind of like utopian
society
and um so i can kind of see why there's
like this whole arguments between white
privilege and
people feeling guilty and so they're
trying to like correct things way too
much you know
um
yeah growing up in israel is very
different than here
but it's also kind of the same also kind
of the same yeah
well
is it is it awful in israel i feel like
a lot of people think it's awful there i
think people just riding around in
camels and [ __ ] yeah that's not a thing
right
um
it's kind of like here like you just
watch the same shows on tv the same
movies you go to theaters you have a job
you go to school you drive your car not
not camels
you don't
uh when you finish high school you go to
the army that's different than here
that's a huge difference and then when
you're done with the army then you go to
college so it you kind of like
everything takes a little longer than it
does here interesting
um what are the big differences beyond
that
between israel and the united states
um
i think the mentality of people is very
different
here and there um
and obviously the security situation not
not being under threat here
is
it just causes so much like you know in
uh
as a result of it that it's just so
different like
in israel there's always that threat
over your head
but you you just grow up like that so
you're not thinking about it's just what
it is
so when i'm here i can see
i can see how different it is like what
what threats specifically is it that
your
israelis
think about um
for example growing up like if i wanted
to go out or to go to a mall my dad
would be like don't go there's a lot of
people there
like if you go to a crowded place it's a
it's a
it's a threat it's a dangerous spot
because there could be a suicide bomb
there or
it's like a
what do you call it's an attraction for
a terror attack right
it's when you're in a crowd in israel
you actually think like yeah this is
this could be a little bit risky yeah
for me personally
that's interesting because a lot of
people in the usa
sometimes tend to think like shit's not
safe here because they're afraid of
immigrants or yeah that's pretty well
people with guns or
you know
it's pretty strange although lately the
the all the gun
stuff
is kind of
kind of going in that direction it's
still very far like the usa is huge
israel is tiny yeah
um
so
but in israel yeah there's always like
some kind of
there's always a new type of attack
that's happening
and then that that happens for a while
until israel figures a way to like
prevent it right so when i was growing
up there was a lot of uh suicide bombs
like in cafes and buses and stuff like
that and then
like recently it was a stabbing like
you could just be waiting for a bus and
then someone would just come and stab
you
on the street
and so that's
it's but israel is really crazy they
figure out ways to prevent this stuff
like the stabbing was happening for a
few months
and now it doesn't really happen so much
and i don't even know how they have like
their secret ways
say what you will about the israelis man
but those guys are [ __ ] innovative
yeah
they they're figure [ __ ] out there man
but
people who would like to criticize the
army and israel need to understand that
it's a daily threat that needs something
needs to happen about it's not like we
have a choice
do you do you find it ironic when that
like there's these
when you talk about privilege let's talk
about someone who's going to uc berkeley
paid by their parents 200 000 tuition on
campus protesting israel do you find
that ironic
i do when i lived in israel i used to
criticize israel a lot yeah as an
israeli yeah and the army and a lot of
stuff
but when i kind of when i when we moved
here and i started to go on reddit and
stuff like that and just being more
aware of like the online
criticism that and there's not just
online but it's not just yeah i just
became more aware of like the criticism
here of israel
and in general around the world
and it's really
i i personally think it's so ironic like
it's just like i don't know it's kids
sitting here in like beautiful
california criticizing it like you don't
even know what you're talking about
right
yeah it totally i mean it's it's easy
to reduce it's funny because like you
said when you're in israel you're super
critical yeah of the government you're
like dude you're expanding in the west
bank that's [ __ ] you know the
government is turning off water and gaza
doing weird [ __ ] to control uh and make
land grabs and stuff and that kind of
stuff is like yo what are you guys doing
but when you come to israel and then you
what you hear is people criticizing
national security and saying calling
israel like apartheid that they
shouldn't have fences or that israel
should be
you mean when you come here and you're
here right exactly like less let's say
less specific criticism or more general
like
they build a wall and they and israel
should be a one state with palestinians
and israel all living together they
should reduce the borders and remove the
gate that that to me seems like
super ignorant it is because when i grew
up i couldn't really take a bus i was
afraid of blowing up right and now it
doesn't really happen so the wall did
help
so should we not have a wall can you
explain about the wall for people who
don't know about it
i don't know
how to explain well i guess simply it's
like it was built to prevent this
attacks and
there's still a lot of other ways
there's tunnels and you know yeah
rockets yeah
but when we when elo was a kid
there was no wall around greater israel
that blocked out the west bank and gaza
and it was like for i remember in the
newspaper when you were growing up
there was
almost daily right
not daily but it was happening a lot and
it was terrifying yeah on in cafes
and
um shopping malls and buses
and it was just like a slaughter it was
just a slaughter
and so they're like oh let's build a
[ __ ] wall then and and lo and behold
no more suicide bombs my whole time
there
my whole five years living there there
was like one failed shitty attempt
actually it wasn't even a suicide bomb
someone threw a bomb at a bus from the
outside and it didn't kill anyone
so
i don't know it's like at a certain
point you do you know you ha does it
justify like how do you
how do you think about the gazans who
are on the other side of the wall now
who are like
cut off from family members who have to
go through checkpoints and come to
israel you know it's like
the whole thing is shitty
the whole situation there is shitty
no matter how you look at it
so i don't know
i
