pretty good well lightning
experience
we got super powers over here this is a
[ __ ] experience i don't see joe
rogan's podcast
lighting up
with a reverb and lightning bolts hell
no
feeling good
thank you to quip dollar shave club and
fortnite
for sponsoring this episode of the h3
podcast guys we started late today
because my day
so far has been pretty messed up
oh my god dude what happened
so
having breakfast this morning you know
getting ready for the day
and um i see shredder
on his little bed
next to the breakfast table chewing on
this weird little blue thing
and i'm like what the hell is that
what does what a shredder gotten himself
into
and he's like he's the pickiest eater in
the world he doesn't eat anything but
this little thing of course he'd eat
this
and i pick it up and what i end up
seeing i thought it was like maybe a
piece of detergent or something but what
ended up being was a freaking adderall
pill
that was like
covered in plastic
and he was like munched like halfway
through it
so i'm online looking up like what is
this i'm like it's adderall who
who the hell left adderall on my floor
so i call the vet and the vet says call
poison control poison control's like
well he's a little guy and the amount
that he ate pretty much crosses right
over the line of being toxic
so
they're like you need to take him to the
vet immediately
and induce vomiting and shove charcoal
down his throat and i'm looking at this
sweet little guy by the way shredder
who's
the light of my life
besides ela
you know whoops
and
and i'm like dude this guy's gonna go
through like the craziest day
they're gonna go pump his freaking
stomach so i get in the car because he
he seems fine he just basically ate a
bunch of crack which is what adderall is
so i'm in the car driving on the way to
the vet he seems fine at halfway there
he starts shaking
and like crying
and he's confused he's like panicked and
it's like apparent that the drug had had
started affecting him
and i'm and i'm like crying because i'm
so freaking
scared for my little guy
and ela's out of the country out of the
country with her family it's uh
anyway we get to the vet he's fine they
pump his stomach he's fine he's a sweet
little guy point is sorry i'm late
my little guy almost went though i don't
know if i can handle that
i think that would just break you man
well yeah i was talking to ila about it
and she's like if anything happened to
shredder i swear to god i i couldn't
handle that
she's like i couldn't handle it i know
what i do because she's over there
taking care of her of her father who's
sick right now
anyway he's fine
yeah but who walks around
with an adderall
in their pocket
just free
flying just free flying in the pocket
any small creature that comes across it
the vet said when he puked they found
the the pill was blue and they found all
these little blue specks like a ton of
the drug in his stomach she said it's a
good thing you brought him right away
because he puked it out
and he he i think he would have died
certainly if i didn't catch him eating
it right away he would have died
crazy
so anyway
so that's about that that's why we're
late
i don't know if that was an interesting
story but i'm i was i was
very upset but he's okay now
and i'm also i'm the wizard of
loneliness this week because ela is gone
she's back helping her family
and i am truly the wizard of loneliness
shredder was gone with my parents the
other day and i was just sitting there
damn
cast loneliness on myself
level 99
but anyway i'm here to entertain and
that is what i shall do
next friday is the great and wonderful
bo burnham which we are all super
excited to meet and chat with him and
we're going to talk about his amazing
film that's coming up very excited about
that
but we've got a lot to get to today
we've got the tanacon con
it took me a while to wrap my head
around the tanacon thing this was like
a roller coaster of fraud
the thing about tanacon i've seen a lot
of people talking about it
the thing that kind of surprised me most
about it
i'm not a lawyer i have dealt with a lot
of legal stuff though is that i'm like
damn like they're off being like yeah i
[ __ ] up
but a lot of people aren't acknowledging
that
it seems to be criminal fraud
like straight up like the fbi
might want to say what up to her
in a couple weeks from now
i want to get into that but first let's
break the ice because
i've got a clip that might be the best
thing i've ever seen
i'm just going to pop that up there get
the mood set get the feeling right
man being in the trenches solo is a
[ __ ]
brutal dude
but here we go
no sound oh there's no sound on this
so this is there's no sound on this
right then
i don't know so basically what you're
seeing is there's a
i think they were shoplifting
right they're shoplifting and they try
to escape a police officer he brings her
to the down he brings her down they're
all kind of doing having a little orgy
there at the entrance
kind of just tussling around
so dude escapes from the police he's
running into the storage
the basically the back area where they
store all the sodi pops as you can see
now this video is so perfectly like shot
and set up and the twists and turns in
it he's throwing halls at the officer
the officer has a gun pointed at him
what does he do
he arms himself with a bag of halls
lost and well
i'm getting ahead of myself by the way
these police officer pants are kind of
gucci as [ __ ] they got nice taping down
the leg
it's pretty stylish how did she escape
this is in canada by the way if you need
to know if this was in america they'd be
[ __ ] bleeding dead on the floor in
canada this girl's just wandering around
you know what i mean there's two
officers and she's still wandering
around the store
anyway he's armed oh a little taser
there straight to the floor
did i miss the bat the oh yeah here this
[ __ ] arms himself with
what does it say
spritz
they look like a bag of peanuts
or something here you go
if you stick one step closer man
i'm gonna hit you with this bag of
peanuts
his threats sadly did not avail
as the officer
was was better armed than him sadly
so he's he's pretty much in submission
but nope he got a second one folks
he's got a second one
and his his
his wife is on the loose
and he he points to her and says back
the [ __ ] off [ __ ]
is what he said
now i yeah that that was a that was a
real spill i've wondered if this video
was fake but
that spill is real folks let me tell you
that was oh he's got his he's got his
knee right on his [ __ ] dick bone
there that ain't pretty
so the girl's gotta she's like you know
listen
the cop just need my boyfriend in the
dick he's probably impotent from now on
so she's like i don't have any much use
for this guy so i'm out of here
peace
she tries to sneak out and that's true
love folks
she's like he's [ __ ] i'm out of here
peace
there's the bag of uh spritz that was
thrown at the officer those are
those are evidence now
exhibit
c
dude this guy man
this officer
this is like a real test for him like
how do you stop a meth head
in canada it's a lot harder to to
enforce the law when you don't have a
gun you know if this was america they
would have just executed that guy you'd
be done
this would be a short video kind of sad
because instead of having like a
wonderful
almost three stooge ask video to enjoy
it would just be like
drugged homeless man was shot dead
by florida you know
but instead we've got this wonderful
little and it gets better folks stay
tuned
i love the effort by this officer though
he's like you will not [ __ ] escape me
meanwhile back at the ranch
his uh his wife having decided to
divorce him is looking for an escape
room she goes to the ceiling
desperation my god now this is like dude
how the hell
did they capture this so perfectly
that's what makes me suspicious of it
being fake like you even get the ass
shot in there and the spandex and not
saying that's something that interests
me
just simply stating that
it is quite an opportunistic shot well
where is she where'd she go
let's find out
having a tussle and then suddenly
look who's back
that's right
the girlfriend
she's back
she's back ladies and gentlemen
and aren't we so glad that the canadian
police force in this very moment aren't
armed and we can enjoy
this video
the way she pops back up too is just so
beautiful she dude they must be drugged
out of their mind because she just was
like
shrugs it off like it's nothing let's
get in let's get a let's get a slow
definitely let's go to quarter speed on
this one shall we
so as you can see she's crawling around
the attic space trying to look for an
out
and um
maybe maybe she had second doubts maybe
she said you know what i do love
uh
oh you think she she was trying to do
like an aerial assault
yeah she's trying to help out but
not quite
not quite
there's tennis balls rolling all over
the place
man she was just unharmed what whatever
they're on i'll have one please
christ i could use a little
invincibility in my life i could barely
go up my stairs in the evening
but be that as it may she's not wearing
shoes either which i think is
interesting to point out oh no she is
well she's missing one shoe
she is missing one shoe which is
definitely worth pointing out
i wonder if she's heading on over to the
peanut bags to try to defend her
boyfriend
stuck up on the ammo
stack up on ammo she's like listen
i listen i don't know the guy
i didn't do anything man
yeah
okay and then then then the real
the real mf show up and and put an end
to this rodeo but wasn't that a thrill
wasn't that a thrill ladies and
gentlemen
truly a gift from canada
and i just really want to reflect one
more time on and enjoy the fact that
they are armed with tasers and not
live maybe they are i don't know but
they didn't shoot them so cheers to that
yeah what a thrill that's a beautiful
thing man
it's like do you see what i'm saying
though it's almost so perfectly arranged
right
that that i'm very i am so much
suspicious but the way they eat [ __ ] you
really can't fake that right like i mean
like how do you fake that that's
that's a real spell
how do you fake that holy [ __ ] she can't
she she's she takes back to school
shopping sales
very seriously
that face when uh
that face when school paper is 50 off
me once when school supplies are 50 off
you know
let's see that again
really can't get enough one more for
posterity this is totally me
when i see that am pm has a special on
school supplies
this is me
they're watching that all week and it
still cracks me up
well cheers to them you know what nobody
was hurt nobody was murdered it was a
beautiful oh it's just every once in a
while you get a video that's just so
so perfect
all right well now that we now got that
out of the way
we should move on
to the tanacon
now i know a lot of you guys probably
been following the tanacon thing i think
a lot of people have talked about it by
now so
i don't want to get too much into the
the nitty-gritty honestly what i was
trying to do because i was going through
all this information last night
and and the and the preceding week
was just to understand like what the
hell happened
so i kind of have things bullet pointed
i've got video clips i got pictures
and
and i think
there's there's a lot of interesting
stuff in here but most importantly
well let's start from the beginning okay
let's start here
i this is a riveting story by the way
this whole thing is just absolutely
fascinating and i haven't said
fascinating in a while and trust me when
i say that i mean
fascinating fascinating do that up quick
so she so tana was pissed that vidcon
hadn't given her featured creator badge
in previous years
so she wasn't having that
so she decided to start her own
convention that was inclusive for
everyone that's what she kept pressing
is that it was inclusive
for everybody she saw these vip passes
that said featured creators on them
it's like what every person there is a
featured creator featured [ __ ]
creator actually oh it actually said
[ __ ] i believe that
the actual official name is featured
[ __ ] create
that is so [ __ ] cool
um but it's like dude yeah let's be real
she sold 5 000 tickets and they are all
featured creators let's be real there's
only one featured creator at tanacon
it's tana
she wasn't there apparently
um so tana decides to throw a con to
rival vidcon with like 30 to 45 days to
plan it all right so here here's the
original invite from
the production company called good times
which a lot of good info about these
boys but let's start with this welcome
creators
we are so thrilled for you to be part of
the first ever tanacon good times is a
family that celebrates the online
community we are so honored to be
hosting this event we truly believe that
each of you here is equipped
are equipped with so many talents and
passions to lead a revolution tone it
down doug
you're you're charging 65 for a vip
ticket it's not a revolution
through the social media world that
fosters a vibrant inclusive and
world-changing environment
i hate this whole sentiment of like
everybody's a featured [ __ ] creator
you're all youtube superstars there it's
actually really exploitive because you
know every kid these days wants more
than anything to be a youtuber
at my con
everybody's a featured [ __ ] creator
for 65
this event is pioneering the change that
we are community wish to see in this
industry oh yeah we definitely need more
more tanacons
we strive to make this a community where
everybody feels seen heard understood
and most importantly included
don't they understand it in a world
where everybody's included it's like
you don't exist tana
when everybody's like equal and everyone
has the same talents and appeal it's
like you don't exist
it's so disingenuous
everyone is a featured [ __ ] creator
so with that being said [ __ ] vidcon
[ __ ] the current ceo
is this voice working for you is it
cringy
i mean it's no more cringier than her
voice that's
[ __ ] everyone
who created vidcon
and if you want to know why tanacon
became a thing and that's why
all the love
all right
this is a great genesis of like a great
mission statement it's so phony dude
it's the phoniest [ __ ] ever you're all
featured creators
i gotta tell you i
you guys probably know so we don't
really post videos on h3 anymore i just
i'm so like
well there's a lot of reasons why we're
but
one of the big reasons just like man i
just i really just can't watch
everything on youtube it's just
i don't know man it's all gotten so
tana it's like all tana
