all right
all right try this a third time one more
time
[Applause]
welcome to pod save america i'm john
favreau i'm dan piper
later in the pod we'll talk to stephanie
sriac of emily's list about the success
of female candidates in this election
cycle and what's at stake
for women in november we're also going
to talk about the results of this week's
primaries in arizona oklahoma and
florida
the dl democrats cut with mitch
mcconnell to confirm another batch of
trump's judges
the announcement that the white house
council is leaving and where it fits
into a week where trump is
freaking out on multiple fronts which is
basically
every week um on pod save the world
this week tommy tries to figure out what
the hell president trump was talking
about when he live-tweeted a racist
conspiracy theory about south
south africa that he saw in tucker
carlson's fox news show
bedtime he never thought he'd have to do
a pod save the world episode on that
when he started the pod
uh the tweet claimed that white south
african farmers are being murdered and
their land is getting seized by the
state and so tommy
in a comment so tommy an economist
africa bureau chief john mcdermott
figure out what's true what's false and
why the tweet was cheered by white
nationalist groups all over the world
man that's dark um
it's a fascinating episode though uh and
make sure to check out this week's keep
it uh where ira kara and lewis explore
among other stories
how social media reacted to the death of
john mccain this past weekend
and actually before we start dan um we
haven't heard from you on this topic yet
do you have
you have any thoughts on mccain's legacy
that you want to share having
been on the 08 campaign and run against
him
yeah look i think you guys had a really
smart nuanced discussion with us about
love its peace about
how the political world reacted to
mccain was exactly right i just wanted
to say a couple things about it which is
first and foremost twitter like there
are all kinds of bad forms of twitter
i'm not entirely sure what the good
forms are maybe it's like
during live events you care about like
the oscars the mmas or sports events but
in general there is no twitter worse
than
political figure passes away twitter
yeah which is where
everyone no one can take a break and
just say
we're everyone thinks this is the moment
they have to offer their hot take
because the moment for the most
engagement on that hot take will pass if
they don't do it right there
so like yelling about john mccain's
legacy in the moments after he died
seems completely not constructive to me
and
it's just it's a toxic conversation and
then there's also
because twitter is inherently a platform
of self-promotion
that it is it makes it a terrible fit
for remembering
other people so people's takes are john
mc honor john mccain
by doing the exact thing i would
otherwise be asking you to do
and the thing about john mccain is like
any
he is a human and a politician and so he
was flawed in both ways he made mistakes
and he was a pro like he was not a
political hero he did things so he was
an american hero
and he did think but he did very
political things which makes him not
that different than every other
politician which is
he was a maverick at one point and then
when he wanted the republican nomination
he
ran far to the right and holding him up
as the perfect avatar
for what we wanted our politics today or
an
enemy of everything we care about in our
politics i think is an impossible
standard for anyone to meet
and it's also a terrible way of looking
at john mccain who was one of our more
human
politicians in the sense that he kind of
threw himself out there and
was sometimes admitted when he was wrong
sometimes
uh lost his temper was sort of human
and it just i just found twitter and the
political discussion to be so depressing
over the weekend because it's just like
a person passed away and
who you know had flaws like everyone
else and we either
ignored those flaws for the purpose of
holding them up as an ideal of a
politics that probably never existed or
or highlighted those flaws for the
purpose of making a political point that
we probably did that you didn't need
john mccain's depth to make
yeah are you trying to say that social
media doesn't adequately capture
all the subtleties and nuance of the
human existence
it's actually unfair to even so yes i am
saying that
twitter in particular is terrible about
this but it's even more than that
because
like twitter is just a mirror of our
larger political conversation in this
country these days because for sure
twitter twitter determine it's not that
everyone is terrible but twitter
influences and drives what politicians
say it drives with the media covers and
so we're in this
uh this never-ending loop of ugliness
that is at its worst when we need it
when we should be our most human
well um if i die dan i want you to go
find my worst tweets
and just ratio the out of them
that's what i want
um okay we had another set of primaries
on tuesday in florida oklahoma and
arizona
so let's start there uh in the race to
replace
jeff flake in the united states senate
the democratic candidate
uh congresswoman kirsten cinema won her
primary she's going to face fellow
congresswoman martha mcsally
who survived an ugly primary against two
of the most revolting human beings in
politics
i feel confident in saying that joe
arpaio the disgraced sheriff who's
responsible for the torture of
immigrants and prisoners
and conspiracy theorist kelly ward who
suggested that the mccain family
announcement that the senator was
stopping medical treatment
was designed to hurt her campaign um
dan mcsally is who the republican
establishment wanted
but uh ward and arpaio received a
combined
47 of the republican vote um what does
that tell us does that tell us anything
uh it tells us the republicans have real
problems if not political problems just
general
problems with their voters because
there's a real chance that if
ward or ohio had run they would have
beaten
martha mcsally yeah and that
and that is notable if if you if a kelly
ward
or a joe arpaio can be competitive in
your party your
your party is pretty diseased to be
honest
yeah how formidable is a a candidate is
mcsally do you think
she's the best candidate they had to
offer for that race she she did a good
job she
navigated the sort of the currents
of be of sorry again she navigated the
currents
of being a republican in the trump era
pretty well which is she managed to
keep uh states with
enough of trump's voters to win without
supplicating herself in the way that
as we'll discuss ron desantis did to win
the primary and so look she
this i think this race is a toss-up uh
democrats have had
high hopes on arizona for a long time
and they continue
to do uh to come up short and
so like this is this is race for control
of the senate right here there is no
path
to uh taking the senate without
democrats winning this arizona state
this is going to be a tough race
yeah and uh kirsten cinema makes a bit
of history as the first openly bisexual
senate nominee
she was also homeless for three years of
her life um
fascinating personal story uh you can
check out our interview with her
from april 26th we had her on the pod
then um
arizona also has the chance to elect its
first latino governor in more than
40 years david garcia a veteran and
education professor who's called for
medicare for all and wants to hike
teacher pay after the strikes in arizona
that have made the current republican
governor doug ducey
fairly unpopular and vulnerable in this
race uh he was
one of the more popular governors in the
country before the teachers strike
and now uh democrats have you know i
guess the governor's races
it's a very contested tight race there
right
yeah i mean we have we have we
absolutely have a shot i think we have
the right nominee to have that shot it's
it's it's gonna be tough arizona is a
tough state but this is a year in which
democrats have a real shot because of
the enthusiasm advantage and so
if the if we do the organizing and the
working
and we get the volunteers then we have a
real we have a shot at it and
winning some of the most odious
immigration policies in this country the
things that were the forbearer for what
trump and stephen miller are doing
the model of the trump immigration
policy started in arizona so if you
ever needed an idea of why it is so
important to have a governorship look at
arizona uh let's talk about oklahoma
where there's a fair amount of good news
out of one of the most conservative
states in the country voters booted out
six of the 10 republican candidates in
runoffs who voted against pay raises for
teachers
who went on strike there earlier this
year altogether 12
republican incumbents lost their seats
democrats also have a chance to take the
governorship
outgoing republican mary fallon is the
most unpopular governor in the country
with an impressively awful approval
rating of
19 that you have to try
really hard to get 19 approval um and
foreign
in oklahoma you're a republican oklahoma
you got 19
approval um so we have former attorney
general
drew edmondson on the democratic side
he's already won statewide three times
so that's really good
he's now facing republican kevin stitt a
very trumpy businessman who was also
against the teacher pay raises
whose state republicans worry was their
weakest primary candidate so the
republicans did not get the candidate
they wanted in this primary
um dan what's going on in deep deep deep
red
oklahoma i think you are seeing
the power of
populist activism to transcend party
lines
where if you everything else in life is
viewed through this partisan filter of
either your forward or against it you're
a republican or a democrat but these
teacher protests
in these deep red states have had real
impact and
if democrats can find ways to align
themselves
with the teachers
workers of all races who are fighting
for a fairer economy for better wages
you can completely upend the political
dynamics in these red states and i think
there's
real lessons to be learned here in all
of the red states that democrats have to
win in for governors races and senate
races
that there is a there is a real chance
for
not nativism and racism wrapped in the
cloth of populism but true
economic populism that transcends race
in
all backgrounds yeah well i was going to
say i mean despite the fact that trump
is
unbelievably popular in oklahoma in a
state like oklahoma
i don't see oklahoma is in a laboratory
for
trumpism what's happened in oklahoma is
was a laboratory for ryanism for paul
ryan's view of the world which is mary
fallon
she basically passed this huge tax cut
that crippled the state's finances
there are now four-day school weeks in
oklahoma because there's no funding left
um there's not enough qualified teachers
by far there's decaying textbooks
the rural hospitals have been forced to
close in the state
waiting lists for the community help for
elderly and the disabled
are as long as 10 years long there's
actually a driving limit on
state troops to uh ration fuel
so oklahoma and this happened in kansas
as well
like these are examples of what happens
when you
cut taxes cut government services and
let everyone fend for themselves
and even in these very red states when
people see that basic services
aren't around anymore they can't count
on government they can't count on their
own community
they're going to start becoming much
more populous and i think the question
for democrats
is like how do we want to direct that
populist anger and
trump is trump has decided that he wants
to direct it by fanning
you know racial resentment and
resentment against immigrants
and what we have to say is you know this
is sort of our economic
progressive platform to actually make
sure that there's a government that's
improving your life
that's right that's exactly right um all
right let's go let's get to the most
exciting race of the night
the governor's race in florida where 39
year old tallahassee mayor andrew gillum
who was badly outspent and behind in the
polls for most of the race
won the primary and now has the chance
to make history as the state's first
african-american
governor gillum is running on a platform
that includes a 15
minimum wage medicare for all the repeal
of the
stand your ground laws in florida a
whole bunch of other positions
um dan how much did you know about
gillum before this race
and and what do you think of him as a
candidate i
i had read a lot about him and people i
knew and respected in politics have been
talking about him for for a while now as
someone as a rising star
who is incredibly talented and i hadn't
looked incredibly carefully
at this race i people i had whose
opinions and respect in part who were
without a doubt fans of gillum but just
had believed pretty uh
steadily that gwen graham who was the
daughter former congresswoman daughter
of long time
florida senator bob graham was going to
win
the election and and but the thing
sorry i've been sleep deprived this
morning not making sense um
grandma's gonna win so i sort of just
took that at at face value but in the
last few weeks
i've been hearing more and more from
people who were who had been supporting
gillum that there was momentum on the
ground it was just a question of whether
that was going to
get him over the hump at the end but he
clearly was the candidate with momentum
at the end of the race
so yeah you mentioned former
congresswoman gwen graham um she was the
front-runner for most of the race
per nbc news she spent eight million
dollars on
television uh the other two candidates
in the race
also outspent gillum on television he
only spent
589 thousand dollars on television
um how did he win what does that tell us
about
communication and media strategy in 2018
i'm so glad you asked this question this
is a hobby course of mine
i know if you want to win well this
would be my advice to any candidate
if someone comes to you and your
political consultant your
guru whoever else and lays out the
budget for your campaign and they have
you spending
more money on television than digital
then you have hired the wrong person you
should particularly in a democratic
primary you should be
having you should be spending more money
but just think about it this way
and when was the last time you watched a
television ad
i when it's uh when it's been on my
phone or in my twitter feed because it's
some political thing
because it's a political one that's it
right like that it's already gone viral
and some people will like they're like
well dan you
watch sports all the time you must watch
the tv ads during sports i don't even do
that even with the like the live events
are the last times
the people are truly held captive to tv
and that but even then
most a lot of people are they're doing
other things they are
looking at their phone they're looking
at their tablet whatever else and not
streaming services that don't have ads
yeah it's just
it is the problem this is the thing that
scares me
the most about running against trump in
2020 is that the model of campaigns that
democrats have been running for a very
long time
is based on outdated views of how people
communicate
so we look at we are inc direct mail
tv ads and phone calls so let me try
this question again when was the last
time you paid attention to something in
your mailbox
you answered a call from an unknown
number or you watch a television ad
and and i think the candidates who have
had the most success are the ones who've
been willing to update that model and
oftentimes you up in the model out of
