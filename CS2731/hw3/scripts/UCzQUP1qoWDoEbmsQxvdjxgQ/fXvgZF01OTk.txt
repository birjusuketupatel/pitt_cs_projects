five four
three two one the first man to smoke
marijuana never really smoked and he
inhaled it
he was a chinese man he was a very great
man and whenever he lit the the
the plant it wasn't to get high but he
would start to get high
and every time he got high a blue bird
would come to him
and tell him to conquer his neighboring
neighborhoods
and he listened to those to the bird and
that's exactly what he did and he became
a great emperor
in china and at that point in the story
pablo escobar looks at his doctor and he
goes have you ever been to disneyland
and the doctor goes no pablo i haven't
he gross
very clean very organized
whoa that's it but it's the truth the
first guy that ever got high was the
chinese dude that burnt the plant
because he liked the smell of the plant
it gave him a soothing but after days of
doing it
it packed up in his body and he started
hallucinating he saw a bluebird
a blue bird came to him and told him
that he had to conquer the neighborhoods
within the region what a crazy bird
he got high and a bird started talking
to him what are you gonna do you know
i don't know if this is true but this is
one of the things that uh
the pot aficionados always used to say
is that you know when a
priest walks down the aisle and they
have that that thing that they swing
and there's burning incense inside of it
that used to be weed
that's what they used to do in what
dimension
i don't know at one point i believe it
was weak
then it became that [ __ ] that batman
shot at the green hornet it was like
pedophile smoke you
you wake up your shirts bomb backwards
and [ __ ] your pants are missing
[Laughter]
well what did what is it now what kind
of incense is it now it's like this blue
smoke
i i go in there to church every once in
a while you have to go for the full
effect one like the five in the
afternoon on saturday
and the early morning and sunday they
don't break out the incense
they don't start breaking out the
[ __ ] maluki [ __ ] uh
and the guy comes out and one guy comes
out their own water jesus
and then the other guy it's so weird how
somebody made a great point on twitter
the other day they said
you me mitch hedberg there's five of us
that delivered newspapers
there's five comedians the delivered
newspapers you
hedberg did it yeah you delivered them
in a car to other places
i was an [ __ ] that took a route but
not the route in my neighborhood
to routing the neighborhood over so i
had to beat the kids there before they'd
get there and steal the papers
i would deliver them right to the doors
and oh you did too yeah yeah
and then you collected yeah i collected
from only a handful of people
most people were on like a monthly
subscription plan they they were
switching over
but the people that you'd have to
collect from you had like this envelope
like a tan envelope and you had to like
mark off
like you know when they owed things i
barely remember it because it was only a
couple of clients
and after a while i kind of got away
from doing them i said i don't want to
do these people that have because it's
too hard to collect it's annoying like i
don't want to i don't want to have to go
that was my specialty i didn't like it i
must have been that was
when i first got to the catholic school
and my mom gave me an option that i had
to go up there and work in the
afternoons and i'm like i got to figure
something out
i just don't want to go up there anymore
and my friend said i'm giving up my
newspaper up but he didn't give up the
one in my neighborhood
he gave up the one in the next city over
the next town over in that city
i could still walk everything so i'd
have to leave school and run over there
because i'm not the dude would steal my
papers
and sell them as their own on the
[ __ ] street corners
so i'd have to get them put the
circulars in put them in the thing and
then throw them on people's balcony and
then on fridays and saturdays
i have to go back with a ring after
dinner
and collect how you doing mr rogan i'm
here to pick up 75 cents and they give
you like 1.50 that was your tip
right and you got like 22 cents a week
for delivering the paper
did you collect from everybody i
collected from everybody i was there
sufficient what years were these
this has to be 73
74 75 yeah so i guess when i started
doing it is when i started driving
which had been like 83
i probably started 83 i probably started
when i was 17.
no that was 85 85 probably then that's
when i probably started doing it yeah
you're too old to be collected i
wouldn't pay you either
well it wasn't even that it was just
annoying like what you wanted to do
was go to the depot pick up the papers
chuck them into the people's driveways
and that's it and then there's a few
people that wanted it inside the door
so you'd have to get out of your car
open up their screen door put it in
there
and then leave and the idea was that
those people everybody would say those
people would tip you better those two
they'll tell you about it like okay and
so we would
only have like a few of those and
i think after the first couple of years
they stopped doing those kind of
collections or
i definitely stopped doing them but it
was an awesome job
when you're like a young comic or you
know even before i was
a comic when i was fighting it was just
uh i didn't have to do anything
where someone was telling me what to do
i could get in my car
i could listen to whatever i wanted to i
listened to charles lockwidera
he had the the morning the big mattress
on uh i think it was bcn i'm pretty sure
wbcn in boston this is awesome radio
show
i'd listen to that chuck newspapers out
windows i do that for like three hours
every day
you know it was the best job ever
because then i would make enough money
or i could pay my bills
but i still had all the time in the
world you stand up
all the time in the world train all the
time in the world do anything
but it definitely [ __ ] me up because
you're not supposed to be getting up
that early every day
like that can't be good for you you know
if you
you listen to people that know things
about sleep
like getting up at 4 30 in the morning
or five in the morning every day
and not being responsible that was the
beginning
to me that was the beginning of the new
joe rogan emerald podcast
that was the first podcast i listened to
that i agreed with a lot
but i also had a couple mitigating
factors
because i believe that everybody's
body's a lot different i know i could
rock and roll i could throw down on
seven straight
but it's got to be seven straight no no
no get up the p
two times because once you're 50 it
could be up and down
see once you turn 50 48 everything
changes papa
so if you see you're there at night i'm
drinking completely with water
that has to come out throughout the
night and you will be up all [ __ ]
night on the hour every hour there's no
rem sleep
yeah there's no rem sleep so you have to
come
once you get old you have to come uh
control your thyroid dog i've been a
specialist on sleep
since day one that was one of the most
interesting podcasts
you had on i bought the book and
everything and he made some great points
in there
i didn't i wasn't raised on an app joe
roger
my mom didn't raise me under that once
we came from cuba
my dad died there was no nap i went
where she went
right so my day consisted of eight to
three in the morning she had a manager's
room in the back of the bar with a cot
and if i got tired at one go back there
and take a nap but
i gotta stay here till three mommy got
to work wow
so my sleep was always horrific
then when i was like five or six
in school then i went to normal sleep i
went to catholic grammar school normal
sleep
everything was normal but my mom had a
bad thing that she did
my mom had an issue that a lot of
parents don't do when they work nights
it was she did it from the heart because
i have a friend who does it
wake me up at three in the morning joe
rogan joe rogan
get up i brought you black ink and pasta
which one julie from umbertos
and i brought you a newspaper are you
[ __ ] kidding me can you imagine if i
woke you up every night or two when
you're 26 years old joe
at 3 30 in the morning and you know i'm
doing it from my heart
and seven out of 10 times you're going
to get up and eat the scruggily or the
or the marinara sandwich i brought you
from leo's because they worked in the
city
so i remember if you bartend in new york
city on the way home what are you gonna
do you're gonna stop no you stop and get
two slices of [ __ ] the best pizza
there is in manhattan so my mom would
wake me up every night at 3 30 in the
morning
with a cuban sandwich
that killed me over the years that would
make me get up every night at 3.
there's still nights that i'll be
sleeping i'll get a good night's sleep
but i'll look at the clock and it's 3
a.m on the [ __ ] dot
because it's in my but like last night i
slept good
i [ __ ] up my sleep was bad after i
read the book for a while
that's how deep it got into my head so
when i went back to weight watchers i
realized i couldn't eat any more [ __ ]
edibles
because they wouldn't they would make me
hungry at night
i would [ __ ] go off the charts with
points so i stopped eating edibles and
joe rogan my sleep pattern changed
bad like my body did not
know how to go to fall asleep by itself
i went through a month of
[ __ ] two hours of sleep jesus
doing a bunch of [ __ ] and then three
more hours in the app did you try
anything did you try like melatonin or
anything like that
i did cocaine for 30 years melatonin
that i could eat 20 turkeys they could
all suck my dick
i drink them all together the tea the
vine
leave me alone please leave me the [ __ ]
alone all right
go [ __ ] yourself i got something that's
gabba gabba
the tea and the tryptopian put together
and they still don't find i buy it on
amazon
not bad so what i learned to do was
rotate it
so now i'm back on the animals i found
about an expired bag of cheaper shoes
like from the dave chapel tour when i
went out with dave jesus
i found the bag with about 24 oh my god
i slice them in half you take one of
those
