four
three two one boom and we're live
12 rules for life so without reading
this
so what you're saying is
there's only 12 things you need to know
in life right that's it yeah well
yeah this um this interview that you
just did
with this woman uh kathy newman was that
in the uk it was channel 4
uk um i just went i i felt bad but i was
also laughing i went to her twitter page
to read like and in with each one of her
tweets no matter what she says
someone writes underneath it so what
you're saying is and then some ridicul
but
by the way the your fans
were mocking her but politely
non-aggressively there were i didn't
read any rude
things like there was no there was there
was no insults or
there were well maybe a few insults but
there's no swears it was
just playful mocking of the interview
that she did with you because
the interview was ridiculous it was a
ridiculous interview and i listened to
it
or watched it several times i was like
this is so strange
like her determination to turn it into a
conflict
to it's one of the issues that i have
with television shows
yeah because they have a very limited
amount of time and they're trying to
make things as salacious as possible
they want to have these
sound bites these click bait sound bites
and she just went into it incredibly
confrontational not trying to find your
actual perspective
but trying to force you to defend a non
non-realistic perspective yes well i was
the i was the hypothetical villain of
her imagination essentially
well what happened what was interesting
too the way it it
played itself out because i met her in
the green room beforehand you know she
was being made up and then they put a
little bit of powder on me and
we had a friendly kind of interchange
and then we went and sat in front of the
cameras and for a couple of minutes
you know before before the show got
rolling and we had a pretty pleasant
back and forth and then as soon as the
cameras went on she was a completely
different person
and i thought oh i see
what's going on yeah yeah well so so
that kind of alerted
me to well the fact that there was
something rotten in the state of denmark
let's say
yeah but you know this is also why
youtube is going to kill tv
because television by its nature all of
these narrow broadcast
technologies they re they rely on
forcing the story
right because it has to happen now it
has to happen in like often in five
minutes because
they only broadcast five minutes of that
interview
they did put the whole thing up on
youtube to their credit
it it it hasn't ceased to amaze me yet
i think that they thought that the
interview went fine
that's the scuttlebutt i've got from
sort of behind the scenes because i've
you know i know some people who know
what's going on at channel four and
they're shell-shocked by the response
you know and and then of course there is
the counter response the guardian the
next day
published a paper or published an
article saying that
you know the head of channel 4 had to
call in police security because of
threats
you know well first of all you can call
the police in about anything
and they never did detail out exactly
what the threats were
you know but then about 20 newspapers
picked that up and went for the
well kathy newman is now being harassed
by an army of online trolls for doing
nothing but doing her job
which well i and then there was a
backlash against that in the press
and so it's been a well
well someone took an audit of the the
actual
interchanges that yep between fans and
her and there was way more negative ones
coming your way
yes that were seriously negative yeah
that's right seriously negative
violent harassing just rude
there were way more yeah and no one
picked up on that at all it was all
the narrative was she's a victim even
though
she was highly aggressive on in this but
she's a funny victim it's not like she's
not successful yeah you know it's like
at some point you think you should have
to hand in your victim card
i think like when you go to an ivy
league university it's like right then
and there you go
yeah because you don't get to be
oppressor and oppressed at the same time
that's just too much well one of the
things that you pointed out was when you
were talking about
competition for very lucrative jobs and
you were saying
look what you've done like you you must
have had to work here
and she proudly was saying how how hard
she had to work
yeah to get there i'm like well yes of
course no one's going to hand this to
you
no this is why and this is why you were
saying you are opposed to
equality of outcome i can't imagine
anything we could possibly strive for in
our society that would make it into hell
faster than equality of outcome like the
historical
the historical evidence for the
pathology of that root is so strong
it's like you have to be
historically ignorant beyond belief or
malevolent or
resentful beyond comprehension in order
to think that that's a good idea
i argue for that i agree with you but i
think that even if you came into this
with no knowledge of history but a
complete understanding of human beings
you would say well that doesn't make any
sense and one of the best quotes that
i've ever read about it is that if you
have real true freedom
you're never going to have equality of
outcome because with real true freedom
you have the freedom to not engage
well look if you look at a guy like jeff
bezos for instance that amazon guy is
worth more money than anybody ever
right that guy works all day yeah i mean
he's a maniac oh he's
acquiring all these different companies
and and everything he's doing
is designed to succeed i mean he's just
well that's what gates just said
too in a recent interview and i know
some guys that are you know they're
in approximately the same universe as
those two and
they just work all the time that's all
the time and they don't just work they
work so
efficiently and so effectively and make
use of every second in ways you can't
even imagine unless you're in that sort
of position
so and you know doing that doesn't mean
that you will succeed but
not doing it certainly means that you
will fail well you s
well not doing it certainly means you
will never achieve that level of success
and that's what we're talking about
we're talking about a quality of outcome
i don't want that i don't want to be
that guy i don't want to work like that
i don't want to do what he's doing and i
should have the freedom to not do that
yeah as he should have the freedom to do
that if we're going to play this game
called capitalism which we're all
agreeing is probably at least in
as far as the models that we have right
now is the best one that we have if
we're all going to play this game
if someone decides to be the michael
jordan of capitalism you can't stop them
you can't say no no no you're playing
this game too well you're playing this
team too hard you're too obsessed with
this game
you're going to have that yeah you can
stop them you can try to stop people
from winning crookedly
which is what you should do and yes you
know there's a couple of things that are
really worth delving into with regards
to that too because
there's this sort of marxist notion that
all this inequality is generated as a
consequence
of capitalism and that's actually
technically false
because if you look at there's a there
seems to be something like a law of
nature that's
described by this statistical model
called the pareto distribution
and it basically suggests that in any
creative domain
there's going to be a small number of
people will will do almost all of the
output but it doesn't just apply to
human beings
it implies it applies to the heights of
trees in the amazon rainforest
it applies to the size of cities and it
applies to the mass of stars
which is something like the more you
have the more you get
it's something you can imagine how that
would work with a star as it gets bigger
and bigger and its gravitational mass
increases
it's going to attract more and more
matter and then as the city grows well
more and more people are excited to move
there because of all the opportunities
and so
some cities start to grow tremendously
and others and others don't
but this this this
uh phenomena where a small number of
people end up controlling a tremendous
proportion of the resource
is not only limited to money and it
doesn't only occur in capitalist
societies
it occurs everywhere it's like a natural
law so you see the same thing with
number of
points scored by a you know a
spectacular sports figure
there's always a tiny proportion of
people who are way way
the head way ahead on the curve or
people who make records or people who
sell paintings or people who compose
music
or people who sell music online it's all
the same it's
it's the one percent gets 80 percent and
so
well first we can't blame that on
capitalism and second we should note
that it actually does constitute a
problem which is what the left-wingers
are always jumping up and down about
right like too much inequality
starts to destabilize your society and
it isn't obvious how to shovel
money from the top end maybe the one
tenth of one percent who have almost all
the money
down to the people who have almost
nothing in a way that's effective
so that they don't get thrown out of the
game completely and so that the whole
society doesn't
destabilize we don't exactly know how to
do that it is a problem because
inequality does exist and it does tend
to magnify across time
and then there's another problem too
which we haven't figured out is
imagine that in order to make everyone
rich
you have to tolerate a certain amount of
inequality that seems obvious
we don't know how many units of
inequality you need to tolerate per unit
of wealth generated
but the answer is definitely not zero
it's definitely not zero
so yeah so it goes back to this equality
of outcome yeah
yeah and this this thing has
perplexed me since i've met you and
since
uh you were involved in this original
debate over gender pronouns
and there was an article that was
written recently i forget the exact
title of it
i think it was something along the lines
of why can't people hear what jordan
peterson is saying
yeah you are misrepresented more than
anyone i know
in a weird way you are villainized in a
weird way
where um i can't believe that these
people are honestly
looking at your opinions and coming up
with these conclusions
i i can't help but feel like what is
happening
is people are consciously deciding
to ignore reality and paint you as this
archetypal figure of oppressive white
male
patriarchy ignorance
fill in the blank with all the the rest
of the descriptives that you'd like to
use but
they've decided to paint you in this way
like
as as a target because
they need a target to sort of reinforce
this idea
that transgender people are being
victimized and women are being
victimized and
well even deeper that the right
narrative is the way that we should view
the world is
victim versus oppressor because that's
the basic post-modern neo-marxist
template it's the right way to view the
world is that
it's a power it's a power ground it's a
what it's a
it's a battleground of power interests
competing constantly
the ones that win are oppressors the
ones that lose are oppressed that's the
way you look at the world
and i think that that's wrong that's a
bad way of looking at the world
psychologically sociologically
politically economically ideologically
you name it now it ends in nothing but
catastrophe
i mean first of all because it puts your
group identity as something that's
paramount
and i mean that's just not well that for
that isn't what we do in the west
let's say we put your individual
identity paramount
and then well that's just that's just
for starters fundamentally and then i
guess the other reason that people are
on my case to some degree is because i
have made a strong case
which i think is fully documented by the
scientific literature that there are
intrinsic differences say between men
and women and i think the evidence in
that
this is the thing that staggered me is
that no
serious scientists have debated that for
like four decades
it's that argument was done by the time
i went to graduate school everyone knew
that
human beings were not a blank slate that
biological forces
not parameterized the way that we
thought and and felt and acted and
and and valued everyone knew that the
fact that this has become somehow
debatable again is just
especially because it's being done by
legislative fiat they're forcing it
to me as a scientist it's just it's just
well and in the states too
with tight with title ix for example
because title ix is sort of predicated
on that viewpoint
what is title now oh title ix was
originally just a piece of legislation
that
um mandated that female sports teams
were funded to the same degree that male
sports teams were funded
in american universities but it's been
expanded out so that if there's any
differences
in any areas whatsoever between the
genders then the universities are being
taken to court
and like 200 i mean last i looked about
200 of them were up
and and they can have their funding
revoked if they violate the title ix
provisions
so it's become like a vicious weapon for
social justice warrior
equality of outcome types so it's not
just about
sports no it's got way way beyond that
yeah it's it's it's become an equality
of outcome
issue fundamentally there was an article
that i sent you
um one of them was uh from i think uh
like i thought i got it off of digg.com
but it was um
jordan peterson is having his moment and
we should ignore him and i send this to
you and there was one
probably the last part of that might be
true
[Laughter]
but one of the things in the article was
citing this study that showed very
little difference
oh god it's a pathetic study yeah well i
said it to you because i was like this
this is not right well the thing is like
most things
it's complicated yes you know so are men
and women more
similar or more different well it
depends on how you define the terms
first but they're more similar well why
well they're the same species
so we could start with that like but
the question is what are the differences
and how do they manifest themselves and
are those manifestations important so
here's an example if you took
a random woman out of the population and
a random man and you had to bet on who
was more temperamentally aggressive
if you bet on the man you'd be right 60
percent of the time
but you'd be wrong 40 of the time and
that that's not a walloping difference
right 60 40. it's not 90
10 like so there's quite there's a lot
of overlap between men and women in
terms of their levels of aggression
and you think well they're more the same
yeah
except so then let's say no no let's
play a slightly different game
let's pick the in a hundred most
aggressive person
from the random population well they're
all men
and that's why all the people in prison
are men so even though
on average men and women most well yeah
it's 90
90 90 to 95 right so and often if the
women are in prison it's because they
got tangled up with a really bad guy
you know so so one of the problems is is
that
differences at the extreme are where the
differences really start to manifest
themselves
and so you can have a small difference
at the level of the average
but out at the extremes it starts to
make a massive difference
so let's say to be a google engineer
which is hard right
because you not only have to be an
engineer but you have to be a very good
engineer
say well you have to be interested in
things rather than people
that's that's a huge difference in
