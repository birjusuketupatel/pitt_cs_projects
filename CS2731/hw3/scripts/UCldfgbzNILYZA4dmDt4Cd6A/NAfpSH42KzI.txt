hello everybody i'm very excited for the
conversation that i'm about to have
right now
i'm talking to lawyer journalist author
and co-founder of the intercept glenn
greenwald
glenn thanks so much for joining me man
i really appreciate it
it's great to be here i haven't been
called a lawyer at least not first in a
really long time so that's a little
hurtful
um but i'm so excited to be back on
secular talk it's been i think two years
that i've been waiting for an invitation
to come back that i'm going to overlook
that
in my excitement and happiness well i
really appreciate
you coming on and um you know i
i would literally talk to you for like
three or four hours if i could but
let's focus on the really big news that
just happened
um so i'm not i don't know much about
brazilian politics i know pretty much
what i've read in the intercept and
that's it
um i consider you somewhat of an expert
on brazilian politics i mean you live in
brazil
and i always see you tweeting about it
um
it kind of hit me like a ton of bricks
yesterday with the election
uh apparently a guy who some people
are describing as a fascist got elected
so what i want to do is talk to you
about
number one do you really consider him a
fascist and number two
how did we get to this point
so just to put things in context about
why
this whole discussion matters there are
two reasons one is that brazil is
actually the fifth most populous country
on the planet the world's fourth largest
democracy
the seventh largest economy it's the
biggest country
in all latin america and it has major
oil reserves so it has incredible
geopolitical significance and also it's
just a huge and influential country both
regionally and globally
and politics is just generally global
these days and so
very little that happens is confined to
the borders of any one country
i personally use the term fascist very
sparingly
i don't for example use it for donald
trump even though i think he has some
fascist tendencies or
parts of his mentality are inclined
toward a kind of fascist ethos
in terms of his ideology and what he can
what he has done and what he is able to
do
i would be very reluctant to apply that
word to him but i
most certainly apply it to jair
bolsonaro and i think that who's now the
president-elect
of that very large and influential
country i was just describing
and i think part of the problem has been
that the western media is able to
understand especially the american media
other countries especially complicated
ones that they don't spend much time
focusing on like brazil
through a very self-absorbed lens and so
this idea that bolsonaro is brazil's
trump or the trump of the tropics
two cliches that have become popularized
over the past several months to try and
understand him are wildly inaccurate
he's much more like
say the philippines president rodrigo
duterte and probably even more extreme
than him i think the best
model current model would be the
egyptian dictator general [ __ ]
he comes out of this kind of lineage
that trump a marine le pen
nigel farage other like modern alt-right
leaders don't come from
which is the 1960s and 1970s cold war
the idea that you
commit atrocities in the name of
fighting communism that's still
bolsonaro's
view of the world that that's the number
one threat to brazil and he was part of
a military dictatorship that lasted
until 1985 he views that military
dictatorship which
summarily executed critics detained
dissidents closed media outlets used
torture systematically was supported by
the us
in the uk as the superior model of
government
to democracy and has said that
repeatedly that he wants to bring brazil
back
to that period that really dark period
in its recent history of the military
dictatorship
would you say that uh brazilian
institutions are strong enough
to withstand like a total authoritarian
takeover
and i want to refer to a few quotes
of bolsonaro he said in 1993
quote i am in favor of a dictatorship um
when he was asked in 1999 if you were
the president of the republic today
would you close the national congress he
responded there's no doubt about it i do
a coup on the same day
the congress doesn't work and i'm sure
at least 90 percent of the population
would throw a party would applaud
because it does not work
congress today is good for nothing
brother it just votes for what the
president wants
if he is the person who decides who
rules who trumps the congress then let's
have a coup quickly
and go straight to dictatorship so i
guess my question is how much of this
looking back at it do you think that
that's a little bit hyperbolic and that
he'll actually do that
or do you think it's possible that the
brazilian institutions
withstand an authoritarian takeover and
that bolsonaro
even though he'll likely be horrendous
he won't actually become
a dictator so and then just to be clear
that
those series of comments that you read
he's been saying the same thing
you know even throughout the campaign
the last speech that he gave before the
vote on sunday
which he delivered by cell phone because
he was almost fatally stabbed the month
before and so hasn't been able to travel
was one in which he vowed to cleanse the
country of what he called the red
bandits by which he means the brazilian
left and said that
brazil will have a cleansing unlike any
scene in its history and that the only
choice is for
those who refuse to submit to his rule
will be prison death or
exile so he's been very consistent in
his ideology through the years
the question that you asked i think is
the most important one and the one that
everyone here in brazil is asking and
it's the main reason why i really reject
and resist this
comparison to trump because even if you
want to believe that trump deep in his
heart
is like cecilia duterte or bolsonaro or
whatever
the reality is is that american
democracy is 230 years old there's all
kinds of very powerful and established
institutions that have been
much more vibrant than probably ever
before and pushing back against him
whether it be
the media the judiciary that has
repeatedly declared acts of his
unconstitutional and probably most
importantly and impressively of all
citizen protest
in brazil that's the opposite um brazil
is a
democracy that's only 33 years old so
it's
i don't know what how old you are but
it's 30 years yeah
very close to my age too so um you know
it's a very young democracy
um uh roughly half of the public was
actually born into
a military dictatorship and a lot of the
people of wells norris generation
were part of it and so not only are
brazilian institutions very young and
therefore very fragile we don't have
generation upon generation upon
generation being
inculcated with democratic values people
are
remembering 40 years ago and they're
saying i wasn't a dissident i wasn't
tortured i wasn't killed it seems like
that would be better
on top of everything else you have a
convergence of extremely grave crises
an economic crisis that has that
originated from the 2008 financial
collapse and has caused brazil's worst
recession
in history 13 million people unemployed
you have a massive
corruption scandal where almost every
leading party
and members of the billionaire class
have been hauled off to prison or
indicted not for kind of isolated
corruption like i'll give you a hundred
thousand dollars a view for this bill
but systemic corruption you know i have
15 million dollars in a swiss bank
account
because i caused these contracts to go
to these oligarchs
so you have a complete collapse in the
faith of
the institutions to to handle the
economy
and it's destroyed people's economic
future and the
credibility and legitimacy of the
institution because of the corruption
scandal and then you also have a massive
epidemic of violent crime sixty thousand
sixty thousand people
a year or last year were murdered in
brazil and just to give you a statistic
if you're a rio de janeiro city police
officer the chances that you're likely
to die tomorrow
are higher than the chances were that a
u.s soldier would be killed at the peak
of the violence in the iraq war so when
you have a convergence of
crises along those lines those
institutions become decimated
because they're plagued with all kinds
of dysfunction and corruption
the public has completely turned their
backs on them
and so the only institution that has any
kind of popularity which is very
dangerous and actually in the u.s you
see this
starting to happen as well is the
military that's the only institution
that people really trust
for a while the military was kind of
embarrassed by bolsonaro because they
were trying to
shed the stain of the military
dictatorship and be rehabilitated as a
force that defends the constitution and
democracy
but this year the top level of the
military and all of the lower ranks more
or less consolidated in unison behind
him
and so they're really the only
institution the only faction
that has the power to impose limits on
his worst nightmare scenarios
and whether they are sufficiently
instilled with
the idea that their patriotic duty is to
defend the constitution and democracy
still
or whether they've kind of been
converted with a lot of the rest of the
population into the idea that
brazil's society problems are so grave
that you need
military order and rule which is what
led to the first military coup in 1964
remains to be seen nobody knows how the
military with their posture will be and
for now baltimore has a massive
democratic mandate he has
a huge part of the population behind him
his
party or his movement aligned with his
ideology took over
major parts of congress state houses
politics all up and down
the political spectrum so he doesn't
really need at the moment
to abandon the pillars of democracy to
institute a lot of his more extremist
visions because he has so much popular
support for it
because the population has just turned
its back on the ruling class largely
for good reason so let's talk a little
bit about uh
the amazon i've read in the wake of his
victory
that he plans to basically do a lot of
privatization
and basically open up the amazon to
western developers is that true
and how devastating would that be for
say the climate it's absolutely true
bolsonaro did something really shrewd
which is
aside from the military obviously a
faction that wields a lot of power in
brazil is the plutocratic class
and they've always been extremely wary
of bolsonaro because he's kind of like a
donald trump figure but even more on the
fringes of
um the mainstream and so
what he did was about six months ago he
said look i don't know anything about
economic and industrial policy i'm a
captain in the army
i know about public security i know how
to keep on order
i know about foreign policy and i know
about social issues
because i'm a man of god on my third
marriage
with um kids with each of my
increasingly younger wives
so that's what he said he knows he said
i don't know anything about economic or
industrial policy
so he hired an economic guru he said he
would empower to be kind of a super
minister of the economy named paulo
gettys
and paul getty's is this kind of
caricature
from what was called the university of
chicago school or the chicago boys that
privatized all of south america
during the cold war that sold off all
the national resources of chile under
pinochet who
bolsonaro explicitly admires and
the markets ever since have loved
bolsonaro every time a new poll comes
out
showing they were showing bolsonaro
increasing his lead this brazilian stock
market would explode the brazilian real
would get stronger
and in the wake of its victory even like
the cbc the state-owned
um and run media outlet in canada was
running headlines multiple ones saying
things like
well bolsonaro is a homophobic racist
misogynist and many believe he's a
fascist
but what opportunities does this open up
for canadian investors or canadian
mining and logging interests
so one apollo paulo gettys is sort of
like the wet dream
of international capital and the
plutocratic class
he wants to privatize everything and
brazil has
an immense amount of natural resources
and state-owned industries that have
funded
the minimal social programs that they
have and they're going to have a
privatized party a privatization party
where they're going to strip everything
out of the public treasury and sell it
off
to china to u.s oligarchs to
germans to anybody who essentially wants
to buy it there's going to be massive
graft as part of it
and you're absolutely right one of the
main natural resources of
brazil on which climate stability
depends globally is the amazon there has
for a long time brazil was one of the
stalwart protectors of the environment
of its environment of the amazon
but there's been rapid deforestation in
the amazon and that absolutely is going
to accelerate and just today they
announced
that they were going falsenaro announced
that he was going to consolidate the
ministry of
the economy the ministry of agriculture
and the ministry of environment
all into one super ministry which paolo
gettys is going to run
so they're putting the entire industrial
and economic policy under his authority
and he's as much of an extremist as
bolsonaro just not quite as shocking
because he's a
university of chicago trained economist
and therefore has these kind of
mainstream credentials but that's why
fascism is really the right word because
you have the three pillars of it
kind of militaristic law order
evangelical religious fanaticism
and this appeal to patriotism as part of
it in this unified nation
and then the merger of corporate and
industrial
policy with this political agenda it's
kind of the classic
case of academic fascism what you study
in graduate programs that fascism means
but also fascism and it's more
colloquial ethos
okay so i have a lot to say about that
that's uh
all right let's talk a little bit about
um
bolsonaro's opponent haddad and then
also let's touch on the former president
in brazil
lula now i'm going to tell you my
understanding of it which is
unquestionably
incorrect and then you can you know
correct everything for me
now i can knock back you for all of your
errors that's right yes
please i'm more than willing to take the
mockery
all right so my understanding is that
lula so he was the head of the workers
party he was president of brazil
and my understanding is that he was
relatively social democratic
am i good so far
you mean you're trying to place the
workers party on a kind of familiar
ideological spectrum
yes so let me let me just then interject
there because it's a really important
part of whatever you're going to ask
um and i think it's a really important
thing to recognize so the workers party
was created as a real left-wing party
lula himself came from extreme poverty
he was illiterate until he was
10. he was a labor leader he lost a
finger working in a factory because of
terrible labor conditions
so he was kind of the real deal as far
as being a radical left-wing
labor activist he led strikes he went to
prison for a short time under the
military dictatorship
he ran for president three times in that
carnation and lost three times
so in 2002 he said
i'm going to kind of do what bill
clinton did i'm going to remake the
workers party as a more moderate
business friendly party
he hired he chose as his vice
presidential running mate a very kind of
establishment-friendly pro-banker
uh long-time financier to reassure
international capital markets and
brazil's financial class
that pt the workers party was going to
be a business-friendly party
um and then he wrote this famous letter
