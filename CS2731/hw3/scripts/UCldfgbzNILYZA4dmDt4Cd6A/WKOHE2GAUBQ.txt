hello everybody what up you know how
sometimes when we start I go
welcome to the tango it's any because I
don't even like like that song or know
any other lyrics other than welcome to
the jungle annex and we got fun in games
I think I was just about to say that's
the next line that I know we've got fun
and games yeah but I don't even know
that's like I don't even know it well I
don't even like it but I just it just
like comes in my head every time we
start yeah I was on so I drove back to
New York this past weekend I think on
Thursday and we're going upstate and
it's a time where like you lose all the
radio stations that you like and I don't
like serious anything like that so I
discovered in the Mazda if you hit like
you could hit the Scan button and it
scans till it finds us it like a station
that's good and working mm-hmm and it
plays it for about like I don't know
second or two and you could stop it if
you want or that goes to the next
station that please so I was like
scanning through and all these like old
ass songs we were on and I'm like I
would occasionally stop it on some old
like that on a t-shirt and one of them
was like nausea Osbourne song and
there's like one of his famous ones is
like something about mother or something
like that yeah I think so oh so I was
like listening to the song and I wanted
to like it just cuz it was like a good
connection and sometimes it's like hard
to find a radio station when you're
driving do like the middle of
Cleveland's here like if I change his
[ __ ] ain't gonna find some [ __ ] for a
minute yeah so I was like listening to
it and then I like saw that it was Ozzy
Osbourne and I was like this song's not
that good yeah and I was sort of mad
just because like Ozzy Osbourne's a god
but it's so that Schilling she like that
is so generational man yeah I wonder too
like what song was it I was in the car
with my mom recently and um I forget the
it was like some 1980s hair band rock
[ __ ] that was all my history like that
almost like his is gonna bother me that
I'm not gonna be able to remember it
but it was like it sounded funny to me
it's not even that I didn't like it I
mean I didn't like it but it's also that
on top of just not liking it like it
almost sounded like they were trying to
be a parody of what they thought a
hairband would sound like type [ __ ]
what's a hairband like that you know
you've never seen those pictures of
dudes with the [ __ ] oh it's crazy
[ __ ] yeah awfully long yeah like that
like it was like it in like the 1980s
they had bands like that and they all it
was just a different time like one of
the stations was like when I used to do
road trips with my dad and my brother
and sister down to Florida um he would
have these old cassettes of like sixties
music or some [ __ ] and so I knew like
all like Dion and like old school like
old school [ __ ] um and so one of the
stations had the old school bangers and
they were playing it and the lyrics to
one of the songs was literally like
she's like she was 17 she was my prom
queen like I was like it was on some
listening to the lyrics it was like this
this shit's a little weird and then like
the radio duct like DJ guy came on after
and was just like all right that was
Johnny playing these in the wing told me
if this [ __ ] was mainstream media like
or like today's this dude would be like
brought up on charges for like OD
pedophile [ __ ] yeah they did a list
recently I forget where the list was on
some website of like songs that wouldn't
fly today and like you know it was [ __ ]
like that like singing about [ __ ] 17
year old or whatever the case it was bad
it was like the dude was like yeah she
looks so good and she's 17 and I can't
wait and I'm like yeah yeah this song
doesn't seem right but I was saying
along to a jammin cruisin well yeah cuz
the you can make something sound good
that and the lyrics could be bad like
there was an old commercial of like a
Swedish family or something not Swedish
some some foreign ass family sits in a
car and they don't speak English
and on the radio is a song that sounds
like a pop song but in their exact I
wanna [ __ ] you in the ass and then they
just keep repeating like that that was
the
it was a commercial people is probably
saw on YouTube now people could look it
up but like the family gets in there's
like a little boy and a little girl
probably like didn't bleep the whole
commercial out in their teens if they
have the uncensored version on uh online
I never saw it like on actual TV I've
only seen it online yeah and like the
family's like smiling and they like the
mother starts like bobbing her head like
yes but music is weird in general man
and don't I mean what in 30 years we'll
look back at the music we listen to
today like that [ __ ] sounded stupid and
then in another 30 years from then we'll
look at the [ __ ] from thirty years
before that and go that should sound
stupid
it's just yeah it's one of those things
that just doesn't you know stand the
test of time yeah I mean because it
changes so much mm-hmm it's hard to it
same thing with comedy it's just
changing so much speaking of music just
so weird it's weird hole in the music
thing that like I don't know any [ __ ]
Spanish at all I don't speak the
language but I could like like test
besito and like other Spanish songs that
I've heard India are like I could say
the verses like this okay and if you go
to dr and spike spain you they play some
Justin Bieber song and a person who you
can't communicate sheet with they put
that song on and they're like rapping 50
cent I'm an app just I'm like oh
speaking of that I you know I had the
same reaction not with that song use
name that's a newer one yeah but back
when one of my best friends was Jose we
would listen to remember in high school
yeah of course it's [ __ ] put kid's
head to the [ __ ] car
yeah you turned out to be a little
[ __ ] up dude didn't he but he he would
always play that song pobre Diablo yeah
that was a banger to know that [ __ ] was
hot and that it looked like back when
that she played if you had Spanish
people in the car and like you hadn't
said a word yet you hadn't said [ __ ]
we'd all sing the hook on yeah and you
sing the hook they'll be like oh you
know Spanish I can [ __ ] it and then not
really cuz anybody listening now when I
speaks but just tried to sing it they'd
be like if they translated it they'd be
like you just said you wanted a ferret
to be in your grandma's ass
like once the mute like when I sing
along to some songs and they're in like
tits in the background a little band
we've said this before when we've done
it with karaoke like in the car I'll be
singing along I'm like I sort of hit
that no I'm sorry and then like I don't
know the station will clink out or like
someone will change it oh yeah your
Bluetooth to come on and it'd be quiet
we sound terrible oh [ __ ]
well that's the thing we've spoken
others before but when it comes to
karaoke when you sing a karaoke song but
they put on the actual song behind you
you're gonna think you sound good cuz
that's not really you it's half you half
whoever the [ __ ] the actual singer is
but then like you said if they cut it
off you're like and that happens to
everybody unless they're like a legit
singer then they're gonna be singing
along and you know be like oh [ __ ] I
sound stupid but speaking of music did
you see how [ __ ] Kanye West has been
losing his mind I mean he's always going
apeshit on Twitter I mean he's already
kind of or he's always been like a
little out there but yeah he I feel like
I mean he doesn't have rules to his life
and it's just like all of a sudden he's
like a little kid and we'll just be like
I'm gonna tweet 20 million things in a
row and the [ __ ] scorpion it really is
trumpian that's the Trump [ __ ] it's just
like I'm just gonna [ __ ] have a
verbal diarrhea on Twitter well I guess
not verbal cuz it's on Twitter but he's
just like he you say more to Trump no
one can say anything to him to like you
know you'd be rational or like hey like
that's not I mean like Twitter's
whatever you could do whatever with it
but it's just like hey that's not how
Twitter works and that's the thing that
annoys me just like Trump Trump thinks
like I'm a genius like I have a very
high IQ like you know he doesn't have a
high IQ that says I have a very high IQ
somebody who doesn't have a high IQ and
you know Kanye says the same [ __ ] like
I'm a genius and a lot of people our age
are like ya know he's a genius
and then but then he does [ __ ] like this
and it's like you want to look at them
and be like are you so sure about that
whole genius thing clearly doesn't know
like what he's doing like he's tweeting
support for all these conservative you
know and pull and I honestly I would
honestly bet that he
even he didn't even necessarily really
know that the people he was tweeting
props to actually were conservative I
think he just heard whoever was say a
few things was like I like that and then
they you know we tweet support and then
it's like he doesn't realize that year
that's a kid that's a conservative
right-wing thing and you don't
understand that this comes with like a
wagonload of other beliefs yeah so it's
just like he's just and it's so funny to
see how people come to him yeah but but
people look at his [ __ ] and look up to
him and idolize him and they're gonna
start thinking like that [ __ ] crazy
lady or something like that you know
like I don't know about that because he
because a lot of it like everybody feels
like everybody had the reaction that I
would have expected everybody to have in
that all the Republicans now instantly
love Kanye West and yeah all the all the
Democrats are like yeah he's overrated
like everybody thought he was amazing
it's really not all that amazing so I
feel like everybody's reaction has been
kind of predictable but he's just it
pisses me off so much because he gets so
much attention for his tweets and so
much you know like just like publicity
off his [ __ ] where it's like anything he
does is gonna get you know blown up so
it's like he puts out these fashion
things he says he's like like a designer
and fashionable and he's like the
coulding he put out or like he's I don't
know if he's joking or not but the
picture of like the easy slides did you
see those ones blue I don't think he's
joke I'm looking things I don't think
he's joking I think it was one flip-flop
sideways that looked like a [ __ ] like
hospital shoe it was dirty and like it
and like the [ __ ] people put underneath
it was amazing you like a glass slipper
of some girl's foot that was like
disgusting and then someone put like
like a display case that was just clear
like people were hilarious boy I don't
get how like what would get him so mad
and would people don't understand is
like if he puts a tweet out don't like
his [ __ ] don't retweet it let him get
like four likes and then he'll be like
wait what the [ __ ] is what just happened
you know like no that guy
you can't deter that guy because he I
think he's I think he's a little off I
think I'm dead I'm phrasing it as nicely
as I could phrase it but he's you don't
think he got two likes on all of those
tweets he'd he'd go nuts and be like
what the [ __ ] just happened
you know like yeah but that was off that
he's like Trump and that that would make
him double down even more like all you
were wrong in this [ __ ] is great and
he's done it before I remember I just
watched a clip of like him on like Jimmy
Kimmel and he was like ranting about how
nobody would give him a fashion line or
some [ __ ] or nobody yeah like sounds
something like that and and everybody
was like feeding into his narcissism
like oh yeah oh yeah you are genius
oh obviously you are like you know you
should have been given this and it just
goes to show you he's well he's a
lunatic he's just in his own world and
like I said anyone who tries to tell him
like hey that sleeper is a little
[ __ ] like [ __ ] as ugly as [ __ ] that
[ __ ] won't sell they'd be like now I'll
get it to sell I'm a genius like
everyone's telling him is it like he
could have he could have it he literally
could have had like it looked like that
flip-flop he'd like put it in some dog
[ __ ] and like you're gonna sell it with
dog [ __ ] and someone's still gonna pay
thousands he could do anything he could
sell some underwears with actual [ __ ] in
it and like people would buy it
it'd be like that has to do Kanye's [ __ ]
on the way well that that's the thing is
like I that's what annoys me more than
Kanye himself is the people who keep
insisting that there's a there they're
like no no seriously like you don't get
because this happened a bunch of times
before this happened like he wore
Confederate flag and like posted a
picture I like Instagram or some [ __ ]
and I was like wow that's pretty [ __ ]
stupid and then people were like nah nah
nah nah see you don't get it what he's
trying to do is and it's like yeah they
start making reasons yeah exactly and
they that this [ __ ] happens all the
[ __ ] time when it's somebody who's
really famous and like really powerful
and has hit a certain level of celebrity
there becomes a you can't say [ __ ] to
them even when you're a hundred percent
right this happened with Charlie Sheen
to Charlie Sheen just [ __ ] going on
binges and [ __ ] and usually got like HIV
and [ __ ] and like if you critique him
it's everybody's like nah but that's
Charlie Sheen yeah like so [ __ ]
I don't care if he could be Charlie
Sheen and wrong about some [ __ ] yep you
know just like Kanye West can be Kanye
West but he turned he's he does really
act like Trump that's not there was some
other [ __ ] he did oh we had a meeting
with Trump right didn't he take a
meeting with Trump back when recently or
no back his day back when Trump I think
was on the campaign trail mm-hmm yeah he
like went to Trump Tower and met Trump
and then everybody started [ __ ] on
Kanye and I think he kind of back
pedaled a little bit and I was like I've
been having problems recently and I need
to go away for a little bit and like he
did and then he came back and now he's
being even dumber than ever I mean he
just looks out for himself and it's the
same way that truck like Trump has never
done anything like for someone like to
benefit you know like I think it
benefits him he's never done anything
like even his charities and all this
[ __ ] yeah JT yeah Connie what the [ __ ]
is Kanye done like oh you could you say
you put out sneakers and clothing line
but like you're selling it for forty
thousand that like you selling it for a
thousand dollars for a t-shirt some [ __ ]
that like oh that's another one he put a
t-shirt up a picture of a t-shirt that
was like it had I don't know picture of
him and his tour dates or some [ __ ] but
it was on some like $5 gilded t-shirt
like some regular ass [ __ ] and like he's
gonna sell it for $500 like so that's
why I don't know if he's joking or not
yeah he's not Chuck what who will pay
like $500 for some t-shirt that you
could get wherever like in Chinatown or
something he's just mind-boggling so I
don't I mean he's a lunatic
he gets me mad people feed into his [ __ ]
it's just like don't like his [ __ ] don't
retweet his [ __ ] make him get one
[ __ ] like and he'll be tight and then
he'll like keep going crazy and then
they'll eventually jump off a bridge or
some [ __ ] so do you think he's on he's
on like he's doing you think there's a
chance he's doing some like Andy Kaufman
type routine yeah but I
I think Andy Kaufman mighta actually
there might have been something wrong
with him like Connie is he knows what
he's doing okay I don't teach achill
with him well I don't know oh I don't
know if there was something wrong with
Andy Kaufman but I do think there's
something wrong with Kanye just in the
sense that he's off like I don't think
he's all there and I think to be fair I
think that that's partly what made him
blow up in the first place like Dave
Chappelle tells a story about when he
first met Kanye Kanye performed on one
of his shows and on the ship back on the
Chappelle show and like he said Kanye
took a phone call and I think he said
that the phone call it was somebody else
famoust who was talking to Kanye I don't
remember who that person was but he said
he heard khat he overheard Kanye say on
the phone yeah man let me call you call
you back I'm doing Dave Chappelle show
because my life is dope and I do dope
[ __ ] and then he hung up the phone and
it's like well yeah there is an aspect
of that and again same is Trump where
you elbow your way into the room because
you're so [ __ ] persistent that you
don't even understand that there's
another thing that is the opposite of
persistent like you don't understand
that like laziness and giving up is even
an option because all you do when you
get out of bed in the morning is have
this insatiable narcissistic desire
doing confidence not it's not just
confidence is one thing confidence as
kind of a positive connotation but what
I'm saying is it's this thing where
you're so narcissistic and you're such
an empty vessel that but you just all
you know how to do is just go out there
and get your name out there more and do
whatever the [ __ ] you can do in order to
get out there in the public spotlight I
mean listen again to bring Trump back
into this I know we continue to bring
him back into this but I just did a
story about how he he called in the
1980s he called Forbes and pretended to
be his own publicist yeah he it was
Donald Trump but he was like no this is
John Baron or some [ __ ] and sometimes he
called and say he's John Smith or
whatever and then he'd say he's worth
you know whatever 100 not a hundred
billion dollars what was it it was
something billion though some five
billion
yeah but right Sam billion it was only
worth like five million and the guy said
he's he was like oh I didn't believe him
I didn't put him down for five billion I
put him down for 1 billion
the reality is Corrin they figured out
at the time when you did that phone call
he was worth 5 million ok but all these
people are suckers because why don't you
call him out on his [ __ ] back then
record the [ __ ] put it in Forbes like
this guy's a wounded to show that Gators
an audio of like him being a [ __ ]
loser that gets back to the original
point which is guys like Kanye guys like
Trump they don't allow you to deny them
their pathological and it literally
might I know Trump as a pathologic a
pathological liar I don't know that
about Kanye but I do know he's also
pathological and that Trump a lie and it
looks like he almost makes himself
believe his own lies and he repeats it
over and over and over and he's got that
thing he's got that thing about him
where even though he's objectively full
of [ __ ] and you can prove it it he it
looks like he thinks he's telling the
truth you know he's got that thing on of
him that's like truthiness like yeah I'm
going to be a straight-shooter even
though he's not straight shooting and
guys like that it's hard like he they
don't get denied I told you this already
because I watched that great Netflix
