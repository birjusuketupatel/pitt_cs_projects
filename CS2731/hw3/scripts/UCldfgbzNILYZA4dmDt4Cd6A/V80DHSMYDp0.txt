so kanye west had an utterly bizarre
meeting with donald trump in the white
house
now i wanted to show you guys just like
a short
two-minute clip and then you know
discuss it and give you like the best
two minutes of their
roughly 20 minute meeting but when i was
prepping the show and i was checking
everything out and i was editing it down
the reality is i couldn't i couldn't
make that 20 minute clip
a two minute clip there was just too
much in there
that i wanted to share with you that i
have to share with you
so uh basically i chop this down as much
as humanly possible
and what i mean by that is i took out
like
if kanye or trump repeated themselves a
few times
on uh different issues i i chopped out
that and i chopped out things that
you know are are irrelevant but even
doing that
the 20-minute clip is down to i don't
know it's still over 10 minutes it's
still like 12 minutes or maybe even more
than that
but i feel like it's important to watch
every second of this
uh i know you have probably already seen
like little two-minute clips from this
entire um
discussion in the oval office but you
really got to see this whole thing
because goodness gracious is this
something
so without further ado here's kanye west
and donald trump in the oval office with
a bunch of reporters around them
chatting and i'm gonna have a lot to say
about this
really the reason why they imprisoned
him is because he started doing
positive for the community he started
showing that he actually had
power that he wasn't just one of a
monolithic voice but he could
wrap people around so there's theories
that there's infinite amounts of
universe and there's alternate universe
so it's very important for me to get
hoover out because in an alternate
universe i am him
and i have to go and get him free
because he was doing
positive inside of chicago just like how
i'm moving back to chicago and it's not
just about
you know getting on stage and being an
entertainer and having a monolithic
voice that's for
forced to be a specific party you know
people expect that if you're black you
have to be democrat
i have a i've i've have conversations
that basically
said that welfare is the reason why a
lot of black
so the peop lose the jobs and they say
we'll give you more money for having
more kids
in your home and then we got rid of the
mental health
institutes in the 80s and the 90s and
the prison rates
just shot up and now you have chiraq
what people call shot rack which is
actually
our murder rate is going down by 20
percent every uh just talked to the
superintendent
met with michael sacks that's ron rom's
uh right hand man
so uh i think it's the bravery
that helps you beat this game called
life you know they tried to scare me
to not wear this hat my own friends but
this hat
it gives me it gives me power in a way
you know
my dad and my mom separated
so i didn't have a lot of male energy in
my home
and also uh i'm married to a family that
um
you know not a lot of male energy going
on it's beautiful though
but there's times where you know it's
something about
you know i love hillary i love everyone
right
but the campaign i'm with her just
didn't make me feel as a guy
that didn't get to see my dad all the
time like a guy
that could play catch with his son it
was something about when i put this hat
on
it made me feel like superman you made a
superman that was that's my favorite
superhero
and you made a superman cape for me also
as a guy that looks up to you looks up
to raffler and looks up to
american industry guys non-political
no [ __ ] put the beep on it however
you want to do it five seconds delay and
just goes in
and gets it done right now you gave me
the heart to go to adidas because at
adidas
when i went in in 2015 we were a 14
billion dollar company
losing 2 billion a year now we have a 38
billion dollar
market cap it's called the yeezy effect
and i went to casper we had a meeting in
chicago
and i said you have to bring
manufacturing on shore
not even sure into the core it's not
about the borders the core of adidas
and chicago is the core of middle
america we have to make middle america
strong
so i had the balls because i had enough
balls to put on this hat
i mean this adidas thing made me a
billionaire and i could have lost 200
million dollars
walking away from that deal but even
with that i knew
it was more important for me to take the
chance of walking away from that deal
than to have no fathers in chicago with
no homes
and when we do have prison reformation
for no because it's
uh uh it's habilitation not
rehabilitation because we didn't have
the abilities in the first place
we never had anyone that taught us we
didn't teach us exactly we had no one to
tout us
right so um uh it's more important than
any specific deal any anything
that we bring jobs into america and that
we
provide a transition with mental health
and the american
education curriculum that a gym is
worked on
larry hoover also has a curriculum that
he's worked on we have montessori
curriculums that we worked on weworks
has a beautiful curriculum the waldolf
um establishment has a curriculum uh we
have meditation
there's a lot of things affecting our
mental health that makes us do crazy
things that puts us back into that trap
door called the 13th amendment
i did say abolish with the hat on
because why would you keep something
around that's a trapdoor
if you're building a floor the
constitution is the base of our of our
industry right of of our cu
of our country of our company would you
build a trapdoor that if you mess up and
you accidentally something happens you
fall
and you end up next to the unit bomber
you end up you got to remove
all that trapdoor out of the
relationship the four gentlemen that
wrote the 13th amendment
um and i think the way the universe
works it's perfect we don't have 13
floors do we
we need to talk to people uh i was
diagnosed with bipolar disorder
i was connected with a neuropsychology
that works with the athletes in the nba
and the nfl
and he he looked at my brain it's equal
on three parts i'm gonna go ahead
drop some bombs for you 98 percentile iq
test
i had a 75 percentile of all human
beings but it was counting
eight numbers backwards after his
repeating so i'm gonna work on that one
the other one's 98 tesla
freud you know so um
he said that i actually wasn't
bipolar i had sleep deprivation which
could cause dementia
10 to 20 years from now where i wouldn't
even remember my son's name
so all this power that i get and i'm
taking my son to the sox game and all
that
i wouldn't be able to remember his name
from a misdiagnosis
and what we need is we can empower the
pharmaceuticals
and and make more money that's one thing
i've never stepped into a situation
where i didn't make
people more money so we can empower
pharmaceuticals we can empower our
industries we can empower our factories
we can bring not only adidas on shore we
can bring
foxconn to set up a factory and i think
minnesota 53
000 wisconsin then wisconsin they have 4
000 jobs people making 53
000 a year and one of the things we got
to set
is ford to have the highest design the
dopest cars the most amazing i don't
really say dope i don't say negative
words and try to flip them we just say
positive lovely
divine universal words so the
flyest freshest most amazing car and
what we want to start with
is uh i i i brought up i brought a gift
with me right here
um this right here
is the iplane one
it's a hydrogen powered uh airplane
and this is what our president should be
flying in look at this jerk
work on this playing with but you know
what i don't like about
it's not that i don't like what i what i
need saturday night live to improve on
or what i need the liberals to improve
on is
if he don't look good we don't look good
this is our president he has to be the
freshest
the flyers the flyest planes the best
factories
and we have to make our core be
empowered we have to bring
jobs into america because our best
export
is entertainment ideas but when we make
everything in china and not in america
then we're cheating on our country and
we're putting people in positions
to have to do illegal things to end up
in a cheapest factory ever
the uh the prison system
i'll tell you what that was pretty
impressive
that was quite something that was quite
simple
[Music]
really very interesting please so you
you had said of
president bush that he doesn't care
about black people and you've heard some
people say that about this president
how do you respond to that what do you
make of that
i think we need to care about
all people and i believe that
when i went on to nbc i was very
emotional and i was programmed to think
from a
victimized mentality a welfare
mentality i think that with with blacks
and african americans
we really get caught up in the idea of
racism
over the idea of industry we say if
people don't have
land they settle for brands we want
uh polo sporting obama again we want a
brand
more than we want land because we
haven't known how it feels
to actually have our own land and have
ownership of our own blocks
so when you don't have ownership then
it's all about how something looks
it's about the patina it's not about the
soil it's not about the core
so we focus more on just somebody
wearing something to someone disrespect
me so i gotta i gotta shoot him
or the idea of someone being racist you
know we talk about
uh police uh uh murders which we
definitely have to
discuss and we have to uh bring nobility
to the to the police officers and make
them because police officers are just
like us
but this is this whole hate building
right and that's a major thing about
racial
tension and we also as black people we
have to take a responsibility for what
we're doing
we kill each other more than uh
police officers and that's not saying
that the police officer
is not a issue because they are in a
place a position of power
uh but sometimes their emplacement of
law enforcement they need to be law
power it's force
versus power when you have you shouldn't
have to force people to do that
so a lot of times the police officer is
sitting there they're being forced to do
this and forced to do that block and
then they force somebody into something
enforcing something we
have to release the love throughout the
entire
country and give opportunities a lot of
times
it's just the overall lack of
reparations
that we at any given point we say oh
this is racist this is racist this is
racist this is racist
so we don't have a reparation but we
have the 13th amendment we got to open
up
the whole conversation so and uh that's
a move one of the moves that i love that
liberals tried to do
the liberal will try to control a black
person through the concept of racism
because they know that we are very proud
emotional people
so when i said i like trump to like
someone that's liberal they'll say
oh but he's racist you think racism
could control me
oh that don't stop me that's an
invisible wall
but you don't think you're rejoicing you
have one question we're gonna go to
another question
okay i answered your question i don't
answer questions in simple
sound bites you you are tasting a fine
wine it has multiple notes to it
you better play 4d chess with me like
it's minority report
because it ain't that simple it's
complex mr president
i'm from chicago sometimes so i would
like to know what you would like to ask
president trump
to do for chicago you're here to talk
about crime in chicago
the thing that um that the head of the
police
and um mike sachs met with me last night
at the soho house about
was we feel that stop and frisk uh
does not help the relationships in the
city and everyone that knew i was coming
here
said ask about stop and frisk that's
that's
that's uh the number one thing that
we're uh having this conversation about
like
sometimes people say this kid has add
this kid has a cd he don't have add
school is boring it was boring it's not
as exciting as this
we have to make it more exciting we have
to mix curriculums you play basketball
while you're doing math you you learn
about music
while you meditate in the morning we
have to instate mental health
and art programs uh back into the uh
back to the city so those are uh and
also
larry hoover is an example of a man that
was turning his life around
as soon as he tried to turn his life
around they hit him with six life
sentences
so i believe he's wit you say don't tear
down the statues
larry hoover is a living statue what
about gun violence with all the debate
about second amendment going on
the problem is illegal guns illegal guns
is the problem
not not not legal guns we have the right
to bear arms
president trump said that he favors
stomp and frisk are you going to be
discussing that do you think he can
change
we're gonna discuss i didn't mean to put
you on blast like that bro but
it's definitely uh come here yeah
mr president would you like him to speak
at one of your rallies he can speak for
me anytime he wants
great he's a smart cookie smart he gets
it
trump is on his hero's journey right now
and
he might not have expected to have a
crazy [ __ ] like kanye west run
up
and uh support but best believe
we are going to make america great now
the thing is my another thing is black
people have an issue with the word
again and i believe my feeling from that
is because
i'm going to throw i'm go all the way
stigma with it because time is a myth
all we have is now all we have is today
so the word again this doesn't
hurt us because of the idea of racism
and slavery the
different things it it it hurts us
because we need to focus on who we are
now today i i believe so i actually
brought some hats in that have a bit of
a transition i'm not
that trying to put you up through your
spot a little bit i made a hat uh that
says make america great
just that but i would love to see at the
super bowl
trump wearing the make america great hat
colin making wearing the make of america
great and showing that
we can bend a bit on this side we can
bend a bit on this side
and we can learn how to be malleable in
the infinite universe that we are and
the loving beings that we are
that we don't have to stick to all
traditions and we aren't aside we are
one unit we are one country we are one
moment in history and time we might have
been here before but right now
we're here together in our greatest
value that people have are other people
and we need to stop working on red and
blue it's like a gang again
uh honestly from our standpoint this was
just set up to be a lunch
and two people that i like and i guess
they like me
and we're gonna have lunch we're gonna
talk you said you said i guess you know
i love you
i know but i don't want to take i don't
want to put you in that spot
i'm standing in that spot i love this
guy right here let me give this guy
a hug right here i love this guy right
here
yeah amen that's really nice
and that's from the heart i didn't want
to put you in that position
that's from the heart special guy
i keep thinking what if
i told you in the year i don't know pick
a year
2011 that in the future
there will be a president donald trump
the guy who was you know the celebrity
apprentice guy
