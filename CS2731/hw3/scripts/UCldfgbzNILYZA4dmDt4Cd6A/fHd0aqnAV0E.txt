hello everybody what's up
how y'all doing welcome to another show
dude i was uh i was excited for today
because
and i was texting you about this like
two or three days ago yeah i really
wanted to talk about
mgk versus eminem yeah and and
usually like i would say the rap game
now
is just totally not my realm like i'm
i'm just like
there's a radio station out by me 104.3
shout out like they were like new
sort of recently and they just played
bangers but it was bangers from like
1999's type of [ __ ] like 2000.
so it's not the rock station that we
have here where it's q1043. you're
talking about a totally different q104
yeah probably okay because if they're
playing 90 [ __ ] that's not the cue 104
that we have around here here q104
is like a straight rock classic rock
[ __ ]
and i know you're not that's not our
[ __ ] classic
i mean occasionally we could get down on
some smashing pumpkins or like
you know like something like classic
rock classic rock is like [ __ ]
rolling stones pink floyd that gold's
[ __ ]
don't get me wrong some of those some of
those like i appreciate music if they
make a banger
yeah i'm gonna for me it's a single song
like they could there could be a single
song from one of them where i'm like oh
this is kind of hot
but it's never like the genre itself is
way behind in my mind
because that's not so for me and this is
a good way to start this conversation
too
about um the the beef the rappy
so for me it goes like r b is probably
number one on my list of [ __ ] i like
and then i'd say it's a tie between rap
and pop
you know what i mean so it's like that
that's how i'd rank it and then
everything is kind of significantly
then i probably get like 90s alternative
rock is right underneath that
and then underneath that is like
everything's tied because i don't
i just can't appreciate all everything
because it wasn't the generation i grew
up with and all that stuff
so so i've been out of the rap game too
like i haven't been
following it a lot well to pre what's it
to preface it to preface this
um there's too many [ __ ] rappers now
like the reason i don't follow this [ __ ]
is because one i'm
i'm not interested all i want to do is
just put on like the radio
and hear some [ __ ] i don't care about
beef i don't care about
nicki minaj versus cardi b i don't care
about any of the [ __ ] because i got
enough [ __ ] in my life
that i don't care about little dick face
fighting little [ __ ] vagina face
there could actually be a rapper at some
point in the future named little dick
face
well yeah there definitely is somebody
out there right now like yo they just
shouted me out
like little dick face i'm right here
so that's so i hate all that beef [ __ ] i
hate all the like
fighting because these guys are
millionaires there's real [ __ ]
problems there's real [ __ ] going on and
that [ __ ]
is just annoying it's like some
kardashian [ __ ] for me so i have so
i have a different perspective god
finish what you're gonna say no no so i
was gonna get into the beef but what's
what's your take on it you're like
no so i have a different perspective so
like i'm not even
i wouldn't even describe myself as a big
music guy like i think i'm not even a
big music guy it never
i mean it speaks to me a little bit i
disagree with that i think
i think you like music because we used
to have times where we would put [ __ ] on
in the car and really just [ __ ] jam
the [ __ ] out
that's true but number one that's the
only time i ever like every time i've
ever really jammed out to music i think
you were probably there
whether it's us doing karaoke or just
chilling
in in the car or whatever like yeah so i
guess it's what qualifies it because i
would say i'm sort of the same
but i've never i've been to one concert
in my life it's not like i'm actively
pursuing going to concerts yeah so
i i would say then on the scale wherever
you are
on that appreciation of music scale i
think i'm a little bit below you
because i like i'm not even big on
like i will now actively choose if i'm
driving i have siriusxm in the car when
i'm driving i'll
throw on like pga tour radio or some
talk [ __ ]
and that takes precedence over music now
like i'd say maybe
20 of the rides i'll throw on some music
so that's and i'm not the type of person
i know people who like need to listen to
music every day
right now i could easily go three or
four days five days without listening to
any music
and it's just not it was never the thing
that that speaks to me like it doesn't
speak to me but
you know you're right that maybe i'm
overstating it because yeah if i'm
if i'm in the right mood and all that
and then i get hit with the right song
at the right time sure but i think
that's anybody really
yeah you're working out and you need
some music or some [ __ ] but especially
when it comes to rap
i've been really not paying that much
attention to rap
you know we're the era of jadakiss
fabulous
um eminem when he started g-unit around
that
yeah yeah so that we were we had master
p
we had juvenile dmx yeah yeah lil wayne
old school
old school little wayne yeah boys yeah
like we knew
lil wayne [ __ ] before lil wayne was
little wayne when nobody else knew him
when he was before he had a tattoo
wrapping the block is hot and [ __ ]
yeah so so yeah
so i have been kind of out of the music
[ __ ] for a while and
now i think it was the beef thing that
actually pulled me back in a little bit
because i needed something other than
just the music
to make me care or pay attention at all
and so
i saw i stumbled across this from um
on twitter i saw the trending topics and
i think one day it was eminem and one
day it said machine gun kelly
now this is how much i've been out of
the music game i didn't even know who
the [ __ ] machine gun kelly was
neither i've heard the name never saw
him i guess i'd heard the name maybe
once or twice but i'd never [ __ ]
saw him you could have showed me him i'd
have been like who the [ __ ] is that i
don't know who the [ __ ] that is
yep so anyway for people who are also in
my boat and they're not music people let
me break down for you what happened
eminem so and this kid machine gun kelly
who's 28 years old and he's a rapper
he's a white rapper
and there's not that many of those
so he and automatically when you think
white rapper everybody just
eminem is a statement yeah yeah yeah so
he tweeted in like 2012
he tweeted um no disrespect to eminem
because he's the goat but
uh his daughter haley's fine as [ __ ]
so eminem saw that and he was pissed
about it but apparently he he didn't
actually see it until like a year after
it but when he saw it he was pissed
about it
but then and eminem i guess is the owner
of shade 45 the sirius xm radio station
so he said to to sway who hosts a show
there
don't allow this kid mgk on because [ __ ]
him because of what he said about
haley my daughter or whatever yeah and
then so
mgk does all these interviews and [ __ ]
and and he makes like a very
like he keeps repeating over and over
that like oh [ __ ] eminem he's my
favorite bapper until he it rapper until
he ban me from shade 45
yeah like he just keeps bringing it up
over and over this this got resurfaced
because
eminem randomly dropped a cd and that's
the next part of it
okay is eminem randomly dropped a a cd
a cd it's not cd it's an album cd we're
from the 90s son that's
old as [ __ ] we're so old but best we saw
best buy
start selling singles and cds and then
just recently they said they're not
selling cds anymore
we saw the whole life cycle of [ __ ]
cds
like we saw something we used to make
them and then [ __ ] die
we used to make cds you could burn it on
to the ship
yeah cause kazam and napster and kazam
and naps are exactly
on top of the [ __ ] and limewire
remember limewire
all that [ __ ] so anyway uh he he
he dr eminem dropped a new album and
said in it
like mentioned mgk or whatever so mgk
goes
and like i guess disses him or whatever
so mgk goes
bet and it's almost like people were
pointing this out it's almost like
he had already made that [ __ ] and he was
just waiting for an opportunity
to tell this [ __ ] was years later it was
like 12 years later or some [ __ ]
exactly so it i mean no not 12 years or
2012
and now it's 2018 so do the whole time
so six years later
but it is a while that's a long time oh
yeah so anyway machine gun kelly does an
uh a whole eminem song and when i say a
song
like he did a diss track like a diss
track i've never even heard before
because usually diss tracks don't have
a [ __ ] chorus like this [ __ ] had a
hook this is part of my argument
as to i'll tell you who i side with me
okay
so so i saw that [ __ ] trending i i guess
i i looked it up and i was like oh [ __ ]
because it was it's well known you don't
need to know that much about rap to know
that there's a general rule for
everybody in the rap game
which is don't go at eminem because he's
gonna [ __ ] you up
because he's known as like one of the
best battle rappers of all time like
yeah and i think a lot of that comes
from obviously eight mile
you know and it's like not just that
because you know he he
buried [ __ ] ja rule he buried benzino
he buried like a bunch of people
and like they were the game was talking
about this the game was like when i was
beefing with 50
i may i went out of my way to not
mention eminem because
i knew everybody knows in the rap game
don't mess with the white boy
leave the white boy alone leave the
white boy along he's gonna [ __ ] you up
so so anyway this kid
goes after eminem and coming to find out
yeah he's he's
famous but he's not that famous machine
gun kelly no
yeah he's not that famous no so
everybody's like yo
what are you doing like you can't like
that's crazy why'd you do that
anyway cut to i listened to his [ __ ]
i was expecting to be like this [ __ ] is
buns i was like
i mean because he's got some valid
points like so he to your point he makes
more of a song which
in a battle if you're going at somebody
you you just either do a freestyle
or you drop some track that is like
doesn't have catchy beats to it or some
[ __ ] like that
so he came out with a song that was sort
of catchy hell yeah it was catchy it was
super catchy
it was catchy so my problem with it was
it was a little long
i think he went a little long with it
and
you don't make a song you don't make a
catchy song when you're trying to get it
somewhere oh so you didn't like that i
thought you're gonna say you like that
about it no i mean i like the song i
like i liked it but as a strategy you
didn't like
that no because i see that more as like
he's going against what we what
he wants people to think you know like
so he wants people to think i'm not
doing this for the attention i'm not
doing this because it's eminem and i
need to get famous
so basically he comes out with a song
and you know
is now promoting that as like this is my
song that i'm gonna sing at concerts and
[ __ ] like that
and basically says in the song yeah i am
broke
and i don't have as much money as with
like as you but
i'm still gonna come at you you know so
it's like i wasn't a fan of that like
out
if he's gonna come at eminem just hit
him with some [ __ ] say it once and
that's it don't start
singing it at concerts don't start you
know bumping that [ __ ]
because that's not well yeah that's
risky that's risky like oh i'm gonna do
it at a concert
like because it's backfiring on him i
just saw right just saw too that he got
booted off stage when he tried to do it
at a concert
and also he did some grimy [ __ ] where he
he's opening for fallout boy so people
in the audience are fall out boy
fans and then what he did is he he was
wearing a hoodie
he took off his hoodie turned around and
told his boy to take a picture of him in
the audience and he told the audience
put your middle fingers up
and when he took off his hoodie the
audience didn't even see but he had the
picture of the of eminem's
response to him the kill shot album [ __ ]
picture it on him
going like this and everyone the
audience giving the [ __ ] you too
but he didn't even tell the audience
like the audience didn't even know he
was wearing that shirt
so he made it seem like these are all my
fans and they're all with me but it's
like son those are fall out boy fans
yeah yeah so so anyway now let me get
into
i want to give the lines that i liked
okay
so we'll start with machine gun kelly
because again i was expecting it to be
kind of whack but i listened to it i was
like damn he did have some like really
good
lines in there yeah so the the first
really great line it started out cheesy
as [ __ ] i thought because he starts out
with um
uh somebody get him some clippers his
[ __ ] beard's weird
like yeah you talk about like it's not
even
like that's child that's petty it
doesn't even in a rap battle and i know
you get
extra leeway like you can be petty in a
d in a diss track but that's so petty
that it was like
yeah don't lead with that [ __ ] true um
but the the first really good line was i
know you can't stand yourself
trying to be the old you so bad you
stand yourself
so hit him with this eminem song stan
like he's saying
you're standing yourself because you're
trying to be the old you so i was like
that's a good line but also another
point is
people don't think he wrote that [ __ ]
people think
he had writers for that really yeah
that's like something going around i
don't know
when eminem mentioned that that he was
talking about
drake that he was getting a drake when
he said that oh no i heard that he had
like two writers for this
for his like rap [ __ ] well that's funny
because it's not even
like i was going to say i was going to
make this point about machine gun kelly
there's some people probably listening
like who the [ __ ] is machine gun
well i didn't know i thought this [ __ ]
was interesting that's why i'm talking
about it no it is
it is and that's why i looked into it
also but
yeah so i thought that the writing
wasn't even that good it was almost
too straightforward like there are some
good lines in there but it's almost too
straightforward
but that's what got eminem his claim to
fame because you remember when like
mariah carey tried to call
him out on this [ __ ] i do remember
like because they had sex and supposedly
he came real quick but eminem's a
wordsmith son like he knows how to
like eminem will always wrap some [ __ ]
and then he'll hit you with like
there's like two or three meanings to
the [ __ ] he said which is what makes it
so clever
whereas machine gun kelly there's not a
hint of that it's just all
yeah like your beard is weird yeah and
then okay another good line he said
yeah yeah i'll acknowledge you're the
goat but i'm the gunner [ __ ] i got you
in the scope
so it's like okay you're the goat you're
the greatest of all time but i'm a
hunter
and i got you in my scope it's like
that's a good line i like that line
um yeah but you're still throwing the
dude a compliment like it's okay so
that's another thing i was gonna do
people were getting adam over that and
saying like oh yo you can't compliment
him at the same time
that you're doing a diss track but i
don't actually agree with that because
you ha he's acknowledging listen i'm
coming at one of the greatest rappers of
all time
so you can't pretend like you're not
doing that because if he pretended like
he wasn't doing that people would have
been like
yo why are you not even acknowledging
you're going to eminem
that's true that's a good point yeah so
he he he was like okay i'm going to give
you your props where you deserve it but
i'm going to come after you where i
think you're wrong
so i think that was a good idea but
you're right that eminem flipped that
back on him
yeah he flipped that right back on him
and almost was like
he said in his song did you just diss me
on perplexed
you know but he's like yeah you gave me
a compliment or whatever and then
like compliment me on the next something
like that yeah yeah
