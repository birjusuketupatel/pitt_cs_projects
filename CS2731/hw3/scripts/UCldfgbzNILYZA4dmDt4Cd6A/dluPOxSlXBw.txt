hello everybody what's up um
me and corin almost uh well it wasn't it
wasn't really corn it was it was me uh
my skype was not acting right
and um it was being a pain in the ass my
[ __ ] is never act all right
yeah um so i think it like automatically
updated which is a little weird like
wouldn't do you expect them to like ask
you or some [ __ ]
yeah there's probably a point of no
return where i've gotten so many
messages on my laptops it's just like do
you want to update do you want to update
install this install this that after
like 40 [ __ ] times saying no it's
probably just like [ __ ] you [ __ ] you
we're doing this [ __ ] with or without
you so that's what happened i logged on
and my skype like didn't work at first
and then i restarted the computer and
clicked the skype and it looked like it
updated and i was like what the [ __ ] is
this but i nearly had a heart attack
because the call recorder that we that
we use for this didn't pop up usually i
set it so that whenever i log into skype
that automatically pops up that call
recorder and when it updated it didn't
pop up and i was like oh [ __ ] but
knowing me i don't know how to fix that
[ __ ] so what's the first thing i do i'ma
restart it so restarted it came back on
it wasn't working i was like oh no and i
was like all right just restarted it one
more time
i restarted i restarted it again and
then it didn't work but then i called i
was like let me call him anyway and see
if anything happened so i called you and
then boom it popped up with the call
recorder thing and it was like it was
like have to update yada yada and i was
like okay so now i gotta update this
[ __ ] too
clicked on the update for that the
update for that was over in like 30
seconds it was just like boom boom done
that's the best one [ __ ] just works it
did hit me with a password though oh and
i was like no
but then i got it on the second one and
it was i was like thank god i got on the
second one but then updated and now now
it's working seemingly working like it's
supposed to it's a good feeling when
when [ __ ] just updates like when you
push update and it just does what it's
supposed to do yeah and then maybe it
hits you with one like hey
you want to restart your computer like
you're like can i do it in an hour or
two yeah i actually hate that one
because i always feel like
like [ __ ] you don't know what
i'm in the middle of right now like
that's why sometimes it blesses you it's
like you want to do it later tonight oh
okay you're right with the yeah it gives
you the option yeah sometimes i need you
with the automatic and you're like
[Music]
that one's bad yeah i feel like pcs are
worse than with that than mac max is
like nice to you
yeah it's not now
but pcs are like you're just boom starts
doing it i've had updates
on a computer
that i needed for the show
that had mad clips on it that i was
going to do for the show and it they can
it starts updating like five minutes
before the show
and i'm like [ __ ]
so you were like when this is done it's
gonna reset like you were nervous that
this [ __ ] get lost so like i go to turn
on the computer that has all the clips
for the show that day needing it for the
live show
and then when i go to turn the computer
on it's doing updates oh it's going slow
and i got five minutes until i'm on air
and i'm like [ __ ]
that's happened before you know what
pisses me off
when you're working on mad [ __ ] and then
you'll get like an error message or not
responding and your computer will freeze
and then your laptop will hit you with
like a do you want to report this to
like mac or windows yeah and it like is
that about like do you think there's
like you can actually rep like because i
think one time i might have hit like
yeah [ __ ] it i'm gonna report this [ __ ]
then didn't do [ __ ] does it didn't do
anything yeah i get i i think i clicked
that once too and nothing happened it's
like if your internet frozen is all
[ __ ] up how is it going to report
your error message if you're if you have
no internet yeah
yeah
like who the [ __ ] are you reporting it
to anyway it's not like there's some
dude sitting you know
in like india who's like how can i help
you
that doesn't happen
you heard about facebook's um new policy
thing they were trying to do no no what
happened
so supposedly you can
upload your
like selfies and your nudes to facebook
oh i did hear about that oh my god that
was so funny
they're like
what for everything else there's [ __ ]
algorithms that like they're like oh we
use algorithms to figure [ __ ] out
because algorithm algorithms is the only
way to deal with like so much of this
stuff because we got so many people on
facebook and then for nudes they're like
we can we can look at that if you want
like what happened to algorithms dude i
thought you were into algorithms what
happened
they're like they'll put a water stamp
on it or something like that to make
sure that no one can upload it again
yeah but they just need a creepy ass
dude named ted sitting in [ __ ]
washington state beating off to look at
your pictures first
you're like oh my news will be safer if
i show them to ted only oh man i don't
know how they thought of that and
someone was like
that'll work that's a good idea
that'll work you can market that well
people really like that and then did you
see the amazon thing the amazon thing
was
uh it's a new uh service where they drop
your package off inside the house for
you
i
my mind just went very dirty when you
said they dropped your package off
well they let they okay so they
will open your door they have a key for
your place open your door and put the
package inside
so in other words you're giving amazon
access to your [ __ ] house
i'm
i don't know in a weird way i'm sort of
okay with that oh no [ __ ] that man in a
weird way a giant multinational
corporation access to your house so they
can just go in there
i feel like you have to trust every
[ __ ] delivery thing associated with
them is totally legit
that's true
but i feel like if they somehow
like signed up to be a delivery driver
and has all all their background
information
now now i'm second guessing
because they could text their boy and
just be like yo i got the key to this
person's house even if even if they do
it like with the drones or some [ __ ] i
don't want some weird ass machine
logging data about my place into the
it's just not no just no
and the onion was mocking this and they
did an article
um and the title was popular new uh
amazon
um feature comes to your house and just
kills you
[Laughter]
it's true
yeah they get away with whatever they
want yo man i gotta bring it up right up
front no more [ __ ] around louisike
you gotta tell me what you think about
all this
because for everybody who doesn't know
coryn is the biggest louis c.k fan i
mean i love louis c.k but you you were
the number you were talking about him
before anybody was talking about him and
you went you saw him how many times you
see him live once twice so he came to
um the college i went to suny cortland
back when i was
i think so i transferred there so i was
a junior so my junior year he came there
um before he was even bigger that was
sort of before he blew up or like right
around like yeah lucky louie or some
[ __ ] on hbo
which i hadn't even watched but i just
heard i was like oh [ __ ] it's something
to do i think it was a friday night or
something like that um
and uh
he was like making jokes like he made a
joke about like hitler and like the
holocaust and all this stuff and i was
like all right he's he's like taking
he's on chances yeah yeah yeah but he
was he was like funny and then i started
following a little bit more um
i i saw him at radio city music hall
he was funny um
i've i've watched like
looking back on it
he's a funny dude because he he like he
just thinks differently you know he put
like
he would think outside the box and put
himself in situation like he'd be in a
regular situation but think about it
differently well i always found that
whenever he was talking about a topic it
would be like
i i would go oh that's that's ob that
you're right like you that's a good
point and it made me laugh like i always
feel like he would say something and it
would just clarify something for me and
i'm like yeah that's true that's true he
has a lot of jokes like that
but it's very easy to see looking back
now like
all the topics he spoke about stuff
stuff like some of the stuff that you
cringed on like when he spoke on
you'd be like ooh
why would he go there you know and now
it's like okay like what for example i'm
curious gave you the cringe
i mean
like one of his biggest jokes was like
bag of dicks you know like suck on a bag
of dicks or something like that which is
like funny yeah it was funny
um
he did a lot of like
like masturbation jokes you know he'd
take the microphone and like turn it
over or whatever like that and like but
so you're saying you think that was like
subconscious like him kind of almost
like letting his kinks seep out while
he's on stage that he's got the these
kinds of weird sexual issues or no yeah
i think so and and now they have people
like
the name of his new movie was like i
love you daddy it's just like you know
like i don't know apparently that's
about like
his daughters or whatever the rumors i
thought were always dressed in there or
something
yeah i don't know man he's it like
like you look back on these things and
even his tv show louis you know i would
watch it and
like when i first watched it jerking off
when you turned it on
he's on screen just beating off
i would watch it and i thought to myself
like this show is weird like you know
like it's it's strange and it's dark and
yeah i never watched his cartoon and i
never watched his tv show
on fx i never yeah never watched it all
i know all i've seen of him that i
really like is his stand-up
and i've i've seen almost all of his
stand-ups like his big ones and i liked
him all right yeah i've never seen his
other stuff
yeah so his other stuff is different
distinctly different you're saying it's
not like his stand up because yeah but
it's weird because that you you listen
to people and you read stories
and people critiquing the show and stuff
and they're like that's you know it's
it's he's on a different level it's very
the show's great it's brilliant and
you watch it and you're like
it's it's just weird you know and like
now looking at it it's like
that was weird okay and like
when you thought back like that it was
weird you'd have other other people
experts telling you like no he's a
genius and he just thinks differently
and you're like no it's weird well yeah
when someone it's funny how when
somebody blows up that does happen like
somebody will blow up and you know all
of a sudden everything they do is
categorized as like genius right yeah oh
my god you're so amazing it's like well
no that i don't think that thing was
amazing particularly but overall you
know again i only know his standups
that's my limited kind of experience
with louis c.k but i always thought he
was brilliant and kind of an outside of
the box thinker
um
but yeah the uh
you i'm it's interesting that you think
the like his uh his jokes
in some way like kind of let his kink
slip out where he because he did talk a
lot about weird stuff from time to time
um
[Music]
but yeah so when i first read i did you
read the article or no did you have the
general idea yeah i read it okay so
like
to me the art the article seemed pretty
clear that like or at least it heavily
implied
that he would at it like he asked these
girls if he could beat off and then he
just started beating off like he didn't
wait for a response
um
so it's i actually saw some people
defending him and their
basically their defenses
i think assumed that the women had said
yes
but i don't know why where they're
getting that from because the article
seemed to me to indicate that they were
definitely like no but then another
point that people make is the power
dynamic when he was doing it when he
worked on the chris rock show or
something
and like there was somebody who was a
staffer who was working like underneath
him
who he asked if he could beat off in
front of him and then he was working on
this other thing where patricia arquette
and david arquette were like the
directors or producers or some [ __ ] or
creators of something
and
he has somebody who worked underneath
him and then they that person was like
no and then went to patricia arquette
and david arquette and told them and so
you know when people asked them like hey
is did
did is this true what like the rumors
and they're like yeah he did like ask
some
random person who was working under him
if he could beat off in front of him but
it's weird the different um
like and then there's one where he just
did it on the phone yeah like he was
like lowering the shades they said yeah
the phone one is i think super unethical
but that's not illegal though the one
where he did it where he's doing it to
the he's asking and it's somebody who
works underneath him you can't do that
but that again is not illegal the one
where he just asked and then they didn't
say yeah and he started doing it isn't
that like borderline illegal if that's
exactly how it unfolded because they
were apparently two comics right they
worked with that were working with him
at some fast like colorado or something
or whatever and the bar was closed but
they wanted to drink and louis made it
seem like casually like hey
you know come on hey we'll just have
some drinks in my room and he invited
both of them and they said that they got
the vibe of like it's professional thing
and it's just we're gonna go have some
drinks and there's two of them and one
of him and then he just asks like
but i don't get i mean like i would
never question someone you know making
the allegations i
highly believe it happened
but even if like me
if i'm in the room with like someone i
idolize like if i'm in the room with
i don't know
kobe bryant yeah like yeah like kristaps
porzingis or kobe bryant and like
he's like
yeah you want to come up to my room
after after the game man and just chill
be like [ __ ] yeah man you got like
whatever we'll play video games and he's
like yo you mind if i jerk off in front
of you i'd be like
what the [ __ ] like i don't care if he's
kobe bryant i don't care if he's the
[ __ ] pope or like what
you just
i'd leave the room or like i'd be like
this guy is sick yeah i would too the
only cat the only point i've heard to
counter that is basically people saying
like number one you they literally could
have been in shock when it was happening
so you don't know what to do but then
also the second thing is when it's when
he's your colleague and he's more
powerful than you
it and he
knows more people in their social circle
it's almost like you're afraid of
retribution or revenge and what he can
do if you don't just kind of grit your
teeth and bear the awkwardness of that
moment
but if you but if you but i know i agree
with you i would leave too like it's not
a question if somebody starts beating
off
but even that argument like
the [ __ ]
two stories would just outweigh each
other they'd be like all right louis ck
you tell your story and it's like they
came back to my room and they were just
being weird and they were asking me to
beat off and then it's like all right
you tell your story and it's like he
pulled out his dick and asked us to
start master you'd be like you seem like
you're telling the truth yeah i don't
you know that's the other thing about
this is
what a weird [ __ ] kink man and that's
that i spoke about that when the when it
first leaked i did a sep you know
separate video just talking about it on
uh my channel and
you know it it took me this long i'm
[ __ ] 29 years old it took me this
long until i realized that oh hold on
i get it apparently there are some
people who exist
that
apparently the whole thing that gets
louis ck off
is when it looks like somebody's
uncomfortable and not a willing
participant like that's what gets him
hard is like when somebody
is looking like whoa what's going on
here i'm not happy with this i'm not
comfortable with this like that whole
vibe is the thing that makes him horny
which is a creepy [ __ ] thought yeah
you know
which in a way you describing that right
now is almost like
his comedy in a sense that awkwardness
and that weirdness was getting him off
in a way you know
