so ed schultz is a former msnbc host
and he spoke to somebody from the
washington free beacon
and he dropped a bomb
on the media world listen to what he
said
there was more
oversight and more
direction
given to me on content at msnbc
than there ever has been here at rt
and
i think that it's very sad
that that story is not getting out
i think it's
uh
many times i was told what to lead with
on msnbc
many times i was told what i was not
going to do and i've got a story that
had i not been involved in it i would
have never believed it
uh and
phil griffin who i consider a friend to
this day was
was a watchdog far more than anything i
am
exposed to here at rt america did he
tell you what to say did he tell you an
angle to take
often
in fact
when bernie sanders was announcing that
he was going to be a candidate
for the nomination of the democratic
party in burlington vermont
i was the only cable host between fox
msnbc and cnn that was there live to
cover it now there were live cameras
there
but we had coordinated with the sanders
campaign that at five o'clock he was
going to make his announcement and we
were going to cover this on the ed show
i go to bernie sanders house that
afternoon an interview in the backyard
about a 15-minute interview the
grandkids are running around it's a big
day for the sanders family he's going to
announce that he's running for president
we're going to carry it live later on in
the day and we're going to run this
one-on-one tape with bernie
three thousand people are there on lake
champaign
it's five minutes to air and i get a
phone call from phil griffin
you're not covering this
i said phil
bernie sanders is announcing he's
running for president he's going to be a
president i don't care you're not
covering this
and it got rather contentious
i well uh
now you're asking me for opinion i'm
giving you a fact right now about what
happened
and other people who were there with me
will attest the fact and back me up that
this is what happened we were told that
we had to cover something down in texas
that was totally meaningless
uh in another press conference in
baltimore which was in already been in
the news for a few days
we're covering bernie sanders live we're
coordinated with his campaign
and i'm told five minutes before you're
not covering bernie sanders now let me
give you the opinion
i think the clintons were connected to
andy lack connected at the hip
i think that they didn't want anybody in
their prime time or any anywhere in
their lineup supporting bernie sanders
i think that they were in the tank for
hillary clinton and i think it was
managed and 45 days later i was out at
msnbc
[ __ ]
listen that's even more conspiratorial
in real life than i could have possibly
conceived of in my own imagination
i knew it was bad i knew that uh
generally speaking corporate media was
biased against bernie sanders
i think
anybody with a functioning brain who
follows this stuff could have figured
that that out
but what ed schultz is talking about is
a legit anti-bernie sanders conspiracy
theory
and
he was at the network which was
considered
the biggest
wing liberal network
so that is just
wow the details of that story are
absolutely mind-blowing
and then you know a lot of people have
pointed out hold on now you guys showed
trump's empty podium
you would show trump's empty podium more
than you would show bernie sanders
giving a speech bernie would actually be
out there giving a speech they wouldn't
cover that they would rather show
trump's empty podium and then speculate
non-stop about whatever [ __ ] they're
speculating about that day
so you know
there are a bunch of different ways to
look at that phenomenon and go well
something's
something's wrong here
but i i i don't think occam's razor
would have pointed to oh well obviously
it's just an overt
blatant in your face brazen conspiracy
theory where there you have some bigwigs
some corporate executives going
we will not cover bernie sanders and try
to
try to defeat him by
uh not shining any light on him
but that's exactly what happened
and the and again we're talking here
about
msnbc the network that's supposed to be
the so-called left network and imagine
how bad it was i mean fox news forget it
they try to laugh bernie out of the room
and call him a communist and then you
have cnn which was probably even worse
than msnbc
and here you have a guy who was one of
the top hosts at msnbc and he's telling
you his personal experience i mean
listen it's one thing if they tried to
like it would still be [ __ ] up and bad
and unacceptable if they tried to like
you know
massage away the coverage
when
things had already been happening and
they'd already been on the campaign
trail for a few months but we're talking
about
as bernie is launching his campaign
they were like no you're not going to
cover that you're not going to cover
you know a senator a senator who's
launching a run for president
that is nothing but a conspiracy that is
a giant conspiracy and again i know i
bring this up too much but i bring it up
because it's totally relevant and
pertinent to what's going on in the
world today
noam chomsky manufacturing consent the
whole idea of that book is
you get
you get a vision of the world that's
more reflective of elites and people in
power from corporate media than you do
from even state media
so everybody's got this idea of like oh
state media that's they're obviously
totally beholden to whichever government
is funding them
and that's a logical thing to think yeah
you're going to do the bidding of
whoever's funding you in this case it's
you have uh respective state governments
around the world whether it's qatar
whether it's the uk or whether it's
russia and they're funding state agent
state media and then you go oh dismiss
them because they're obviously going to
do propaganda for whatever state is
funding them well noam chomsky says
actually if you look at the facts and if
you look at any of the research done on
this
it proves that corporate media
is actually more beholden to elites and
the establishment than state media is to
governments
and here you have a great example of it
because you don't even need a formal
conspiracy
when
interests converge
so the same thing that's good for people
in the military industrial complex and
on wall street is the same thing that's
good for the billionaires who happen to
run the six media corporations that give
you all of your information and the last
thing any of them want is bernie sanders
getting elected increasing their tax
rate and giving everybody health care
that's the last thing that they want
and ed schultz is saying it goes even
deeper than that you had
they were buddy buddy with the clintons
and they're doing the bidding of the
clintons
and listen how
i don't know how anybody can hear this
story and go yeah i don't think that's
true
when we already know what happened at
the dnc for example
when we already know that they did
everything in their power and they bent
over backwards in order to try to
suppress bernie sanders and rigged the
primary in favor hillary clinton
changing voting times trying to hide
debates
you know all of that the the wikileaks
information that we got the emails that
we got donna brazile giving questions in
advance to hillary clinton
i mean
and the funny thing is what do
democratic loyalists do today they're
not outraged that the fact that the
[ __ ] dnc
rigged the primary against the person
who's actually left wing they're
outraged at the fact that uh you know
you discuss it and they're outraged that
oh how did we get this was it russia
that gave us this information
god damn it russia why do you give us
more facts about what
are what's happening in circles of power
in our country
i mean that's seriously the conversation
that goes on right now people act like
instead of talking about the substance
of the emails and the leaks they talk
about how outrageous and egregious it is
that we learn that information and oh my
god let's talk about
the crime of releasing the information
as opposed to what the actual
information is
that's the same trick that the
republicans did with edward snowden
where they were like oh my god can you
believe he gave us information it's
illegal that he gave us that information
yeah but the information was that the
government's [ __ ] spying on everybody
that's the bigger crime
what he's doing is he's exposing how the
government is acting in an illegal
unconstitutional way and instead of
keeping your eye on the ball and going
wow the government's being [ __ ] up
you're going oh edward snowden he did
something illegal yes he did something
illegal that he should have done
he he was exposing the crimes of the
government
and the same thing with the the
wikileaks information
people are like i can't believe that's
so [ __ ] up they gave us that
information and cost hillary the
election you should be ranting against
the fact that they rigged the [ __ ]
primary against bernie sanders
and now you know the media too rigged
against bernie sanders now
this isn't the first time that we've
heard you know
uh murmurs of stuff like this about
msnbc
because
jankuger of the young turks
he
was on msnbc for a brief amount of time
his ratings were better in that time
slot than anybody else ever in that time
slot but they tried to basically demote
him and put him on the weekend and offer
him double the money as kind of like
hush money
so that they could point to him and say
oh see we have one real strong left
winger on the show
on our on our network
so obviously
we are the lefty network so what if we
do corporate propaganda 90 of the time
at least we have this one guy on the
weekend see
and uh
what he did is he turned down the money
he turned down the weekend slot because
he said this is [ __ ] you're
basically demoting me when i had the
best ratings ever in the time slot you
put me in and then he goes on in this
clip here to explain
what happened behind the scenes
i got pulled in and they told me
hey listen uh we were just or it was
actually one specific person the head of
msnbc he said i was just in washington
and people in washington tell me that
they're concerned about your tone
i was like whoa
what
you know
despite all the things that i've said
about the mainstream media i still
viewed that as kind of like theoretical
like a real person are they really going
to say that i was like and i'm naively
thinking what does he mean did he talk
to his friend bob in washington
why would you say people are in
washington if you meant oh yeah i was
talking to my buddy down to shop about
you it just happened to be that he was a
person in washington you wouldn't frame
it that way right but i'm still thinking
that and then he gives me the second
part of the speech hey listen jank
outsiders are cool
and they wear i think he might have said
something like they wear leather jackets
they ride bikes i think i'm an outsider
i don't ride bike but i have a terrible
leather jacket anyway
he said i'd love to be an outsider
outsiders are cool but we're not we're
insiders
we are the establishment
and i just kind of sat back i was like
wow
this is it this is the speech
there it is
there it is
so you have the ed schultz example
you have the jankyuger example
and then also let's not forget
coincidentally
uh ed schultz got fired
not just you know around the time that
this was happening with bernie
but
also when he kept repeatedly hammering
the democratic president
because the democratic president
was pushing for tpp
ed schultz is an old school union guy
and he was 100 percent against tpp he
would expose on a regular basis how
terrible it would be for working people
and then there's only so much msnbc
executives can take
if you keep [ __ ] on the corporate
democratic president with his terrible
trade deal and you keep wanting to cover
the actual left winger in the race
and give him favorable coverage at that
you can ed schultz was bucking the
narrative too much
and was threatening people with money
and power too much so they had to let
him go and by the way i have a
soft spot for ed schultz because
um i had criticized him
on the issue of libya or what libya
syria's one of those he was for
intervention in either libya or syria
and i criticized him and then somebody
on twitter sent him
um the segment of me criticizing him and
he was like okay let's talk about it
i'll come on this guy's show and so when
i had only been doing secular talk
full-time for maybe a year
year and a half or whatever it was
ed schultz came on my show and we talked
about that issue
so he seemed particularly open to having
these conversations especially compared
to
you know other
other people in his position so i have a
soft spot uh for ed schultz for that
reason but then also when you see he was
one of the only voices railing against
tpp
and you know
really uh not
shying away from a fight and if he
thought that democrats were being
you know too corporate he would
immediately lash out now again i have
disagreements with him on some foreign
policy stuff but i'm under no illusions
i don't think that i had that
disagreement with him because he's you
know he's paid off or something no ed
schultz was one of the few people who
who
was in a position like this at a
mainstream network where he's proven
himself over and over and this is
another example of it here he's telling
you exactly when on
uh with bernie sanders and how they
suppressed him
we know what he did with tpp we know
what happened with jank uger because
jank was going after the democrats and
obama on a regular basis he was one of
the whole thing on msnbc was supposed to
be rah-rah democrats and you know ooh
bad republicans so if jank did a
thousand segments [ __ ] on the tea
party they'd be like okay great that's
cool
but the second he started saying well
hold on now um the democrats are also
bought by wall street and big pharma in
the military-industrial complex and
they're basically a center-right party
that's when they would be woo pump the
brakes there fella and he also tells a
story about how
uh when it came to mubarak
in egypt he was on air at msnbc
and
he basically obama spoke out of both
sides of his mouth
he would say oh you know we're with the
protesters but we're also with mubarak
and jank was openly talking on msnbc
about how what he just said to you makes
absolutely no sense
he's trying to have it both ways
because he wants the u.s to keep
supporting you know an ally of ours a
puppet dictator of ours
uh but then he also wants to appear like
he's with the people and
viva la reve revolucion and so he's
saying oh yeah the protesters are also
right
so if you call out the hypocrisy in the
contradiction of a corporate democratic
president if you rail against tpp if you
talk about how the democrats are corrupt
if you support bernie sanders
you're done
and remember phil donahue also got fired
he had the best ratings at msnbc he got
fired because he was against the iraq
war
so i just need everybody to understand
what what really is going on
at msnbc this is what's really going on
at msnbc they're not a left-wing network
they're not a progressive network
they're not a populist network they're
not a democratic socialist network
what they are is a partisan democratic
loyalist hack network
and their whole function is as a left
gatekeeper
so they say to you hey listen this is as
far as you can go and no further left
so the furthest you could go is like
chris hayes and even he's tempting fate
because he recently did a segment
calling out the israeli government for
massacring innocent peaceful palestinian
protesters and journalists so he's on
