this year tyt's been making a lot of
moves now you can too
now how you're going to do that you want
to launch a new business that sounds fun
you're going to change careers jesus
lord mercy you're going to need a
website for all that
lucky for you squarespace also making
moves you're going to go to
squarespace.com tyt
you're going to get 10 off your first
purchase and you're going to get to
build
anything you want on that website with a
unique domain
what are you crazy go do it now go
welcome to tyt interviews we're going to
do a
unique one today we are going to have
someone else from the tyt network on
to discuss one issue in particular and
that
is russia
so if you remember you're watching this
live everybody else it'll go up for you
soon and you'll get to watch it
uh for yourself as well but that's
this is when you would be watching it
because you're not watching live okay
anyway
we go to kyle kalinski from secular talk
and he's going to join us on this issue
um i
i brought kyle on because he's a
reasonable dude i fancy myself a
reasonable dude
and uh we ostensibly have a disagreement
on russia
i think it's a big deal uh i'm going to
characterize his position as not a big
deal
but luckily he's here and can speak for
himself and what we're going to try to
do first is find points of agreement
which i suspect will be plentiful and
then boil down to our disagreement on
russia
and then figure out why we uh each have
the position that we do
so uh kyle first can i get you to agree
that that was an excellent super bowl
um yes although i do have to add the
caveat that
i'm one of about 17 guys in america that
doesn't care at all about football
okay uh i think that i rest my case and
i will see all of you guys later
all right score one for me as we move
forward all right no seriously
uh and and i want to be clear this is
just a discussion so
um now i will say that i think that
russia
is a quote unquote big deal because um
i believe that trump did far worse than
helping the russians meddle in our
elections i believe that he did
money laundering and i think uh that he
owes the russians
and and is paying them back and i think
it is
a wildly dangerous situation for our
democracy
okay so what part of that if any do you
agree with
uh and what part do you disagree with so
i agree that uh trump probably did money
laundering
um i think he did money laundering
not just with russia i'm convinced he
did it
with other actors as well i think he's
colluded with other governments perhaps
in an even more
clear way than he's colluded with the
russian government if he's indeed
colluded with the russian government at
all
um you know when we talk about this
issue of russiagate i think there's
it's actually a very complicated issue
because there's many different moving
parts to it
so the first question is and you just
touched on it what is trump guilty of
um i would say that he's probably guilty
of money laundering
uh i think he's guilty of collusion with
turkey saudi arabia and israel
and um i also think he's guilty of uh
other financial crimes with uh there's
evidence he's done it with the mafia
he's
there's evidence he's done it with big
banks and
and wall street firms so generally
speaking i'd say i support
what robert mueller is doing but i
support what robert mueller is doing
because i think he can basically take
out one by one trump's cabinet
on crimes like that so for example what
he's already done with flynn what he's
already done with manafort
like i support that stuff and there's a
a lot of evidence
of the guilt of various actors in uh
trump's administration
but i just think that the idea of trump
being
putin's puppet or trump doing treason is
basically a liberal pipe dream that's
equivalent to
democratic benghazi because you're never
going to get trump on treason you're
never going to get trump on being
putin's puppet
nor do i actually think he is those
things so i think that's the crux of our
disagreement
all right so um now let me agree back
with you first on a couple of issues
um i think that it is curious that we
don't talk about
donald trump's collusion with saudi
arabia turkey and some of the other
countries that you mentioned
now i get why because there is no
allegations that saudi arabia
mess with the vote on the other hand
donald trump has very clear financial
interest in saudi arabia
and seems to have changed our policy
to suit saudi arabia which is deeply
problematic
and an argument could be made for israel
and certainly turkey as well
so um does the media care less about
that
because saudi arabia turkey israel etc
are essentially our allies
and and it's uncomfortable to talk about
that
and are they demagoguing russia because
it's easier yes
so i agree with you on that um and is
the democratic party
using russia meddling in the elections
as an excuse for their loss to donald
trump
yes i agree with you on that no question
about that
now and i think there was a lot of
different factors involved
now but if you think that donald trump
has done the money laundering as i do
and apparently
you do to some extent isn't that kind of
a big deal
uh to oh sure should paraphrase biden
no abs i think it is i think all all the
financial stuff that you can get him on
of course it's a big deal
it's a big deal in the same way that you
know people like us went after hillary
clinton for the clinton foundation
and the fact that she took a tremendous
amount of money from saudi arabia
and all these very repressive
governments and then she did their
bidding
and helped them through policy you know
by the same token
when you look at what trump's done just
to give people a specific exchange
because i'm not sure that they know
i'm not sure people know a lot about the
saudi arabia thing or the turkey thing
or the israel thing because again the
media doesn't discuss it
but you know in those instances like
trump registered
eight new businesses in saudi arabia
when he was on the campaign trail
he also took 270 thousand dollars
from top saudi officials for them to
stay at his hotel
not because they actually needed to
spend 270 000
that was a bribe and they were paid back
because trump gave them a 350 billion
dollar weapons deal
and then by the way they took those
weapons and turned around and they're
literally committing a genocide in yemen
right now and i don't use that word
lightly i think that's the right word to
use
for what saudi arabia is doing in yemen
with the weapons that we gave them
so i think there's a clear connection
there and i would love it if
if mueller gets him on anything i think
it'd be great
um but i think the thing that frustrates
me
is um they're focusing on the flimsier
case
the case of russia and the reason why
they're doing that is because
there there are hawkish goals here and
these are the same hawkish goals
that have been in place for a very long
time i'm going to use the dirty word
here but the deep state
has always been standoffish against
russia we've expanded nato towards their
border
when we promised that we wouldn't do
that and now
because we're so obsessed with trump's
connection with russia
you find a lot of overtly hawkish
rhetoric coming from
democrats and i know that they view it
as like they're resisting trump and
they're being strong
on trump but the reality is when you
have rachel maddow for example
arguing that if trump removes
nato troops from russia's border that
somehow proves
that putin has the peepee tape and
therefore he's putin's puppet and
therefore
donald trump should keep nato troops on
put
on russia's border i don't agree with
that and in fact i think that's
rachel maddow being like very neocon
hawkish
and flirting with world war iii because
of how she's choosing to resist trump
on the russia issue so if they wanted to
resist trump just on the financial
crimes angle
we wouldn't even be having this
conversation because i'm totally on
board with that
in fact i think i'm even stronger on
that issue because i could point out
the thousand ways he's done the corrupt
deals and he's done the collusion with
other foreign governments i mean to give
the example of turkey
michael flynn took 500 000 from the
turkish government
then michael flynn pushes the u.s
government to not arm the kurds who were
fighting isis
so that's direct money from the turkish
government and then we did something
directly to benefit the turkish
government there's your collusion right
there
that's been proven but nobody talks
about it nobody cares
because that's not the real concern of
the people who are yelping about this
the real concern is let's move to the
right on foreign policy and let's be
hawkish
and escalate with russia so
let alone flynn's deal where they were
planning to
kidnap someone from america and
deliver him to erdogan which is just
insanity
now look people will say and rightfully
so that's flynn
we don't have any evidence nor do i even
suspect that trump authorized that
now trump does have business dealings in
turkey so
i wouldn't put it past them and be happy
to do that investigation but there isn't
very much evidence of that
but there's overwhelming evidence
against flynn and hence the
plea deal that he took now on the
hawkishness
look i don't want to be hawkish towards
russia um i also don't want to be naive
towards russia i don't think that they
have our best interests
sometimes i see progressives who are
like oh my god no
putin and russia could be our allies
putin is basically a dictator and if
you're a progressive you should have no
interest in defending
vladimir putin who has been against
democracy in russia
let alone ukraine and other places so
this whole thing of like
no poor putin has been uh
you know put upon by the west i'm not
buying that
i'm not interested in dictators anywhere
including russia
um but just because i don't want to be
hawkish towards
russia doesn't mean that we should not
investigate
things that trump might have done with
russia i think that i could have the
position of
no i don't wish to go to war with russia
and i also don't wish to let them get
away with whatever deal that they have
with our president that makes sense
absolutely if that was where it ended
again we wouldn't be having this
conversation but
i think the problem is the consequences
not just
from the position that you're taking
right now
but the effects that this has had on the
broader political
scene so you know just to give a few
examples
democrats are now in favor of arming
rebels in ukraine and those rebels are
very unsavory characters including
there's been some reporting on how there
are neo-nazi
rebels in ukraine who are anti-russia
and so
the idea is well you arm them and you
have a standoff over the crimea thing
so that's not again you can be
like i wouldn't say i'm anywhere near
pro-putin he of course i agree with you
he's an authoritarian menace
but he's a threat to his own people and
i don't think
and then the people of ukraine and the
people of
georgia and potentially people of
estonia
okay so then this gets into a bigger
issue then what exactly should our
policies be towards russia on that front
and you know i've tried to make clear to
my audience all along every time i talk
about this issue
where i stand on those policy issues so
you know for example the exxon deal
i'm against the exxon deal i think if
trump ends up approving that yes that
sign of
corruption and cutting a deal but i'm
for the sanctions over crimea
tentatively because again you have to
take into account nato's history of
expanding towards russia's border
which they view as aggression but i'm
not in favor of for example
the uh sanctions the new round of
sanctions over the
uh so-called election meddling because
number one the intelligence agencies
presented zero evidence for that and
these are the same people who said
that uh saddam did 9 11 and so we need
to do the iraq war
and number two they we're acting like
there are no consequences we keep
escalating with them and keep hitting
them with
sanctions on top of sanctions on top of
sanctions arming rebels that are on
their border
and then we expect like oh that he's
just gonna like fall back in his place
no he's a nuclear-armed power
and this is why this is a dangerous game
that we're playing
yeah so i look if you say to me
um i don't want to get into a dangerous
game with russia and
arming unsavory characters in ukraine
i'm going to agree with you
mainly because whenever we go to arm
unsavory characters
we don't have a great track record on
that i remember
a guy we armed back in afghanistan that
was fighting the russians at the time
his name was osama bin laden
oops right right so i'm
against that kind of interventionism on
the other hand
estonia is now whether it was right to
do in the first place or not
is part of nato so if russia goes into
estonia
it's incredibly important that we
protect estonia otherwise our treaties
don't mean anything
so so then you would potentially do
world war three to protect you
then i told you you lose me on that
world war three is really hyperbolic
super hyperbolic so like whenever like
sometimes some
folks on the left you like get into a
situation
of what should we do about russia
sanctions not sanctions et cetera
boom world war iii card right so so
you can do things about his incursion
into georgia
ukraine and estonia short of launching
nukes
well right but again if we're if we're
what we're doing right now is we have a
nato buildup on his border
and that's like if russian troops
all of a sudden were right on the border
of mexico every single politician in the
u.s would say
get the guns ready it's time to fight
back but for some reason when we put
nato troops directly on his border
that's viewed as like oh my god if
you're against that you're a putin
puppet
and that's no no i don't think you're a
putin person i don't think anybody's a
putin puppet
in that regard but um but and if you say
hey maybe we should
have estonia latvia et cetera withdraw
from nato that's a
interesting argument but
but it's a different thing to not defend
estonia if they are part of nato
well let me just say i'm i'll just go on
the record now and say i
i would not uh send u.s
troops to fight to protect estonia and
you could say that means i'm weak on
russia or whatever the case is
sorry but i don't think yes potentially
risking i'm not saying it would lead to
world war iii but if we get into some
sort of a hot war
over estonia i don't think it's worth it
to send you know
men and women from kentucky who never
heard of estonia until three and a half
minutes ago to maybe fight and die to
protect them
um so and again this all goes really
back to the issue of nato and
uh who's really at fault here like again
i said i'm tentatively for the
sanctions on over the crimea thing and
the reason i say that is because
we lied to russia when the soviet union
was broken up we said listen we're not
going to move an inch towards your
border and then we kept moving towards
their border that's a provocative action
that's an aggressive action
and that's not something we would
tolerate from them look at what happened
when they put
missiles in cuba and pointed them at us
we said oh [ __ ]
we're going to war so the fact that we
have them in that position right now
again i'm just trying to get people to
see this from both sides and that
doesn't mean that putin's a good guy
he's a menace against his own people
but i don't think he's a threat in the
same way uh that people are being
