i'm here with the political vigilante
graham elwood and ron pacone hi fellas
hello howdy howdy uh you know what's fun
is to watch a live
political vigilante show are there any
live political vigilante shows coming up
graham you know jimmy i'm glad you asked
uh seattle august 9th and then i'm doing
stand-up comedy august 11th
in seattle in seattle where can people
find tickets you know go just go to
grahamelwood.com for all your ticket
needs
april 9th and 11th everybody check it
out and see you next time i'm saying
august
august 9th and 11th so you know jim
acosta has had a hard time with the
trump uh
you know i don't know if you know jim
acosta's he's a nbc reporter and he got
barred from recovering stuff from the
trump people and so there's been a real
contentious everybody's making a big
deal out of
how trump talks to the press and he's
mean to them and he's getting people
angry at the press
well uh i'm pretty angry at the press
too
so uh they all make a big deal out of
that that trump says bad things and says
mean things about chuck todd and jim
acosta and whoever
but they never bring up the fact that
the government wants to persecute
a truth-telling journalist named julian
assange
so if they really cared about the press
they'd be sticking up for julian assange
but they don't
they only care because trump's calling
them meet names
so they don't really care about freedom
of the press they only care about their
paycheck
they if they cared about freedom of the
press they'd be screaming at the top of
their lungs for julian assange and
they're not
so that's how you know the press is full
of
right they'd say trump voters vote
against their own interests what are the
what are
national reporters doing by going along
with the against julian assange
talk about cutting your own throat
voting against your own interests
so jim acosta tweeted this out it's a
video i'm gonna play it for you he was
at a trump rally
and people don't like him they don't
like nbc news
guess what they well i'll play this for
you
it says just a sample of the sad scene
we faced at the trump rally in tampa
i'm very worried that the hostility
whipped up by trump and some of his
conservative media
will result in somebody getting hurt
we should not treat that's what he's
worried about
we should we should not treat our fellow
americans this way the press is not the
enemy
the press is the enemy
that's why i have a show that's why the
young turks exist
because the press is some enemy
because the press
is been bought by the criminals the
press is supposed to be investigating
that's why that's why raytheon and
boeing
advertise on chuck todd's meet the press
so here is the video
that jim acosta tweeted out about with
this
trump crowd and they hate him let's
watch
[Music]
[Applause]
so you see that guy's t-shirt
the media
not a fan of the media um
so this guy's screaming stop lying he's
screaming at them stop
lying
[Music]
so may i don't know maybe some of these
people want dayton with a nuclear power
like russia and they don't want world
war iii that their
children are gonna have to fight in and
maybe that's why they're mad at the
media because the media keeps pushing
for world war iii with the
with russia because they want trump to
be more bellicose and hawkish with
russia they want him to bomb
they want to bomb syria they want him to
get involved so isis
can take over syria they want uh trump
to be
uh go ahead graham everyone's going oh
he got bamboozled by north korea their
nuke program is back up and running they
want us to be at war
it's like i don't like trump but you
know what i don't like
more the end of the human race because
of a nuclear holocaust that's just
that's my crazy left-wing hippie
nonsense and the news has been pushing
it and so maybe these people are upset
at that i don't know what they're upset
right
[Music]
oh
so they hate him and he tweets that out
that that's really really shakes some
people up
look at what animals the trump
supporters are trump's really whipping
them up
to get to be hating on the media it
doesn't take any whipping up
jim acosta just so you know from a lefty
progressive
it doesn't take any whipping up to get
people to hate your guts
because you guys suck that's why we went
to iraq that's why we went to libya
that's why we were in syria that's why
we dropped 26 000 bombs on syria that's
why there still isn't
clean water in flint that's why you guys
want to have more war
in syria and more war with russia
22 vets a day commit suicide because
these keep pushing the war
machine that's right
and they suck so hard they prove trump
right that's exactly
right that's how bad they suck they suck
so bad i get to have a show
that's how bad they suck and now people
come to our shows our live shows and
fill theaters all across the country
because people are desperate for the
truth
and they're not getting from you jim
acosta and they know it
when you lie about syria you lie about
gas attacks
you lie about dayton with with russia
you lied about iraq
libya whatever whatever it takes you
tell people they can't have medicare for
all
and and then you make it look like it's
just trump supporters
that are sick and tired of the media
another lie
this is him gaslighting people again his
own
readers are viewers he's gaslighting
them which is another form of lying
because you're making it look like it's
just trump supporters and this is trump
look how
ugly these people are they hate the
press
well i remember back during the
primaries in 2016
when a room full of bernie sanders
supporters said this about cnn
[Applause]
oh my god i'm afraid someone's gonna get
hurt
jim acosta i'm afraid someone's gonna
get hurt because there's a bunch of
bernie bros
saying cnn sucks and it stayed in a
gymnasium
are they deplorable are they are they
deplorable i don't know
but the camera's not close enough to see
them flip anybody off but
if it was you would see it it's a good
thing jim acosta wasn't there or
somebody might have thrown an invisible
chair at him
[Music]
those violent burn bros all hopped up on
avocado toast not buying homes
just looking to take a swing at a
journalist it's also jimmy
it's you mentioned all the all of the
lies they told us there's also the lies
of omission
there's also these all of the things
they don't cover they don't climate
change they don't cover they don't cover
climate change
they don't they don't chris hayes just
by the way chris hayes just admitted
that on twitter the other day
because it doesn't give him ratings
numbers and it's not he had a
certain name for it but go ahead yeah
they don't give him ratings
which is just that offends me that
offends me he said there's no incentive
for us to do it the incentives aren't
good that's what he said
i want him to i want him to go
door-to-door in flint
and say that to everybody yeah the
incentives aren't good to cover this i'm
sorry no
it just won't get ratings you talk about
you you're not having clean water go to
the people in
in texas and florida and puerto rico and
the virgin islands that are still
rebuilding from the what five
or seven hurricanes i lost track that
happened last hurricane season
go tell the people uh that's not a good
incentive to cover climate change that's
ruining their life no
no when there was floods in in uh in
manhattan
a couple years ago houston houston don't
don't talk about that don't talk about
the the five-year drought we just had in
in southern california right
don't talk about any of that don't cover
the dnc lawsuit don't cover that
don't cover what was in the dnc emails
certainly don't do that
no just cover it just cover the hacking
part yeah and then don't be screaming at
the top of your lungs
that uh julian assange has been
basically in solitary confinement and
they're tr they're about to get them out
of the ecuadorian embassy yeah
that could happen to you jim acosta jim
acosta does not care
in fact he's one of the worst anyway uh
here's another
here's some more video here's some more
people who don't like the establishment
news jim
here's some people in new york city are
they bernie bros are they trump
supporters
maybe they're just americans jim
listen to this very
peaceful protest uh people are extremely
upset though
and as they have gone on through the
night the anger the level of of
uh of voices has only gotten louder and
they pick people up
along the way and as you can hear
did you hear him chanting cnn right
on tv
[Music]
seems like people are now uh it seems
like people see through me
sorry you know i used to work for the
cia i wonder why people don't like cnn
oh i'm uh here's my eight-figure lies
uh that i get paid to spew maybe you
guys should just what
now they don't now they just blatantly
hire people who work for the cia
do you know that like nbc msnbc they
just hire at form
they're they're viewed they're an
intelligence expert right they're
intelligent
they're not infiltrating the news
they're helping the news
it's their news what are they
infiltrating so jim it's not so jim
acosta
uh uh i i know you're bushes in a knot
over a bunch of trump supporters yelling
at you that you suck
because you know why you suck
why don't you go lie to the people about
the syrian war some more why don't you
go lie to the people about the iraq war
or the libyan war why don't you go lie
more about war
why don't you go ask more people how are
you going to pay for medicare for all
while we spend trillions of dollars on
bombs why don't you go do that
why don't you make it seem like you
exist to hold the powers that be
accountable
and then when they say hey turn your
cameras off during this press conference
you say
yes sir but we'll tweet about it later
why don't you do that some more
how good why don't you forget to bring
up the fact that tigerswan was hired
to go after uh dakota access pipeline
protesters
that's right where was that where was
that you want to know how bad
nbc news is jim i'm going to show you
right now
here's gaslighting by msnbc news
about russia here's something the
intercept put together about how crazy
msnbc is you're ready here we go
and here's the question is the new
president going to take those troops out
in russia russian russia russia russian
russia russia russia of whether or not
russia had help
whether they had confederates inside the
trump campaign when they launched this
attack
but every day and every day i lead my
show and i think i'm going to be talking
about something else
but every day over the course of the
news cycle a new piece of it falls in
place
we're about to find out if the new
president of our country is going to do
what russia wants
if the presidency is effectively a
russian op
right if the american presidency right
now is the product of collusion
between the russian intelligence
services and an american campaign
i mean that is so profoundly big
this is not part of american politics
this is not
you know partisan warfare between
republicans and democrats
this is international warfare against
our country
so when you guys do when your news
organization
does warmongering crap like that they're
gonna tell you you suck when you show up
in li
in person just like they did on the
streets of new york just like they did
in santa monica california they're gonna
tell you you suck
did bernie bros tell you you suck trump
supporters tell you suck
african-americans tell you you suck
people on the street in new york tell
you you suck
and guess who else is gonna tell you
suck no noam chomsky is gonna
tell you you suck right now
because watch did you see what we just
showed you what rachel maddow does on a
nightly basis
here's what he says about the coverage
of russia and how important it is
to our real life it takes a huge
issue of interference in
our pristine elections did the russians
interfere in our elections
an issue of overwhelming concern in the
media
i mean in most of the world
that's almost a joke first of all if
you're interested
it's a joke what rachel maddow just did
you see how her hair is
it's a joke it's a joke to him it's a
joke to the rest of the world it's only
here in the u.s media
that's why you suck jim acosta
that's why msnbc sucks that's why you
suck that's why the establishment media
sucks that's why we have a show
gym that's why we fill theaters jim
because you suck msnbc
sucks the new york times the washington
post they're all pro-war and people see
through it and you gaslight your
own viewers
here's what else chomsky said about the
russian coverage if concerned with
our elections and uh how they
uh operate and how they relate to what
would happen in democratic society
taking a look at russian hacking is
absolutely the wrong place to look
so if you want to know what's really
affecting people's lives our elections
the russia hacking's the last place to
look and that's all that
news media is doing and guess what the
people see through it
less than one percent of americans
believe russia is a major problem jim
so your cons constant 24 7 propaganda
about russia
people see through it so when you show
up in person people tell you you suck
just like a room full of bernie
supporters did a room full of trump
supporters and
regular people in new york city
tell you you suck on the
regular when you actually meet real
people you're surprised they
hate you
yes jim acosta's surprise regular people
 hate the media do you see how
they don't buy your jim
get used to it because people you suck
and you're gonna suck for a long time
longer
and i know this because you're all owned
by the people you're supposed to be
investigating
you bought paid for tool
that's what the news media is bought and
paid for tools
ed schultz got fired from your news
organization jim
because he wanted to cover bernie
sanders and he got
fired for that he was told to go cover
trump
and prop him up
and he wouldn't play ball so he got
fired you know who didn't
get fired you you know who else didn't
get fired chris hayes
rachel maddow the good for nothing
lawrence o'donnell
those guys play ball they go right along
because they like millions of dollars
and that's why people hate your
guts jim
and they're gonna let you know in public
i encourage them to let you know
anything else it's just preposterous to
me that they they're so
bewildered i remember when when the poll
came out about 10 years or so ago
with uh the daily show with jon stewart
and all these media people were like
young people are getting their news from
the daily show they were
and they had this angle of like all
these kids today it was like no your
news is such
 they gotta go to a comedian yep
to get the truth to get the truth
the only place to get the truth was the
daily show there you go
and now places like this because cnn is
so full of they're all
fox they're all they're all i showed
every i showed fox seeing that oh here
well here's fox
here's how fox gas lights their own
people so there's a medicare study
done and they figured out that it would
save trillions of dollars
so what does fox and friends do they do
a poll of their own viewers
and they say bernie is bernie sanders
medicare for all bill estimated to cost
32.6 trillion
new studies says would the benefits
