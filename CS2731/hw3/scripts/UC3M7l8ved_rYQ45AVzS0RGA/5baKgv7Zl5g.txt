welcome stephanie kelton thanks for
being here
thank you for having me all right so
i i know what trickle down economics is
right so that's what what um
what ronald reagan brought us to in the
united states which was if you give
more money to the richest people in the
country they'll spend so much it will
trick it'll trickle down sir may i have
a trickle
just a little it sounds horrible and it
is and that's why we're
uh but before that we were doing um
a version of keynesian economics if i'm
correct so you can correct me that's why
you're here but that's like demand side
it's like what fdr did
he put money in the pockets of workers
and so then they went out and spent it
and i was always told that was a demand
economy how am i doing so far
you're doing well oh okay so now
there is housing grade okay so now there
is a new theory
um coming along and it's called modern
monetary theory
and uh it's it really
it shifts it turns your head upside down
on how
people have normally come to think about
economics
because people still even though we're
not on the gold standard
people still think like we are and we
still act like we are
so if you can explain what i'm talking
about
how about that yes so i mean there is
there definitely is a big divide in
terms of the way
different economists approach you know
how government can be influential in the
economy
um you talked about trickle-down
economics this is you
said trace back to ronald reagan that is
for sure correct
so the idea being that the tax cuts go
mostly to the so-called job creators
so you have to skew the benefits to the
people that we most revere
the people who will go out and do the
big spending into the economy hire
workers and give that big boost
keynesians tend to be i think associated
more with
big government spending but you could be
a keynesian and also be in favor of tax
cuts but you would want to see tax cuts
that are skewed like you said to the
people who
you could put more money in their
pockets and they'll go out and spend and
a tax cut would be just
fine thing to do if you were putting
more money in the hands of the pockets
of the people who are the real job
creators and in our economy the real job
creators
are the american consumers because
that's where most of the demand comes
from
i said it it's you it's me
it's regular old people who make less
than
a million dollars a year and spend
virtually everything they get so if you
give
an extra um you know bit of money to
those folks
they're going to turn around and spend
virtually all of it back into the
economy
creating demand for the goods and
services that our businesses produce
they get swamped with customers
their revenues go up their profits go up
and lo and behold they decide i better
hire some more people
i need to invest some more because i'm
swamped with demand for my stuff
so that's a pretty keynesian way to do
it it's just i think we've come to
believe
um over time that republicans are always
the party that favors tax cuts and
democrats are always the party that
favors more government spending
and mmt kind of comes in and says
actually both would work
provided that um you're spending on
things that will materially
boost economic activity they're not
boondoggle projects you're doing
good types of spending into the economy
providing things that people actually
value and that will lead to some job
creation and if you want to do some tax
cuts as well that's okay
too but make sure the tax cuts go where
they'll do the most good in the economy
and that means to the people
who will turn around and spend virtually
everything and not turn around and pad
their 401ks
buy more real estate buy more shares of
stock and the like
so what modern modern tier
what modern monetary theory i think
hinges on or the kind of
way people are need to start thinking
about this in a different different way
is that the budget of your house is much
different than the budget of a
government that prints prints its own
currency
right and so go can you explain the
difference
yeah so that's why the federal
government could afford to do both
to spend more into the economy and also
provide some additional tax cuts if it
wants to
sort of create more jobs and see more
activity
because unlike a household it can spend
more
and take in less at the same time and
still end up all right
whereas if you and i went around doing
that time after time oh i'm going to
take fewer hours this week
i'm not going to work as much i'm going
to let my hours fall and my income will
go down and oh by the way i'm going to
spend more as well
we'd run into real problems but because
the federal government
isn't like a household it isn't like a
city like detroit it's not like puerto
rico
it's not like the state of kansas the
federal government is where the money
comes from so because you know and
everybody
actually deep down in their core they
know this
everyone knows that the that congress
has the power of the purse we use the
term the power of the purse
and somehow we just sort of don't
connect the dots and come to fully
appreciate what that means
which is that they can never run out of
money and we can
so people don't really uh understand
it's hard for me to wrap my mind around
it too
that since the government the united
states government prints our own
currency
that's why we can deficit spend when we
go into a recession
unlike countries like greece right so
greece right now
and is in trouble because when their
economy tanks
they can't spend deficit spend to boost
the economy
because they don't print their own money
they're on the euro so when
they want to deficit spend they actually
have to borrow the money
that they actually have to pay back
whereas the united states just prints
the money
now that's going to blow a lot of
people's minds right
so yeah it does tend to blow a lot of
people's minds and not only does greece
have to go out
and borrow the euro which is a foreign
currency
effectively for the country of greece
now but they have to borrow the euro on
the terms that are set
by capital markets right so the the
bond vigilantes that people sometimes
worry about those people who
finance the greek government when they
need to borrow can demand
higher and higher interest rates and say
listen your greece
i don't know if you're going to be able
to pay me back or not so if i'm going to
lend you money
i need six seven eight percent i mean
this is what happened
in in the uh debt crisis during the debt
crisis right and interest rates are
going up double digits
and and in the us on the other hand the
us
is spending its own currency into the
economy
taxing some of it back and then
voluntarily
choosing to swap out some of the money
it's spent into the economy
for these treasury bonds and we label
that borrowing
and we say somehow you know this is
going to be a problem no
the government doesn't even have to do
that it's borrowing its own currency
back and it can set the terms
at which it borrows in other words we
have our own central bank
so we could have the federal reserve say
we're not going to let the government
borrow at rates in excess of two percent
ever we did that historically we had
something in the
1950s and 40s called the treasury fed
accord
and we just instructed the central bank
to serve the people
we said your job is to maintain interest
rates
at certain low rates so that governments
were able to
borrow the money not drive up interest
rates and so forth so
completely different game for the united
states compared to greece so
let me just so a lot of people think
that oh my god we have this 21 trillion
dollar deficit
and that we're gonna we have to pay that
back with our taxes but that's not
really true
right no it's not it's not true at all
like i'm sitting at my husband's desk he
happens to have a
post-it note pad here so can i like
let's just say that i'm the government
and i'm going to spend
two two dollars two billion whatever we
want to call these i'm just put these
into the economy so
here they go i'm handing them to you
you're the economy now you have these
two i spent them in
but i'm going to take one back from you
and i'm going to call that a tax so i
collected this one back it's gone
but you still have this one okay so i'm
running a deficit i put two
in i take one out it's my deficit but
you're sitting
holding this and this is your surplus
now
this is the money i spent into the
economy and didn't
tax back okay this is your dollar but
now
i'm going to borrow this dollar from you
so i'm going to get a different color
paper
called a treasury bond and i'm going to
take this from you
and i'm going to give you this so now
you have blue instead of
orange that's me borrowing from you okay
but the
the money to buy the treasury bond came
from
the government spending the money to buy
this came from the fact that i gave you
this so i'm providing both the money
that you use to pay your taxes and the
money you use
to buy bonds from me so
yes yes i i'm i'm
you know i'm the more i listen to you
the more i'm following this
here there's one more thing i want to
add so
the point is that we since we print our
own money
that deficits don't really necessarily
matter
and that the only thing you really have
to be careful of
is that you don't print too much money
because then
let's say that the economy is already
humming at like a peak exp
if you put more money in then that'll
make inflation happen
right and so that's what you need to be
careful of so let me
show here's ellen greenspan you you
actually
like to show this video clip during your
talk so i got it and i'm gonna play it
here
and you can explain it to people what
he's saying so he's being
uh questioned by paul ryan
and paul ryan is trying to get him to
admit that uh
social security is a bad idea and that
we should have private savings for
social security instead of this public
idea
and so uh he's gonna say he he's trying
to get
uh greenspan to admit that yes social
security could run out of money and
that's why we have to do it this way but
he doesn't actually go along with paul
ryan and i'm gonna play it right now for
our people here we go let's watch this
so having personal retirement accounts
is another way of
making a future retiree benefits more
secure for their retirement
and also do you believe that personal
retirement accounts
as a component to a system of solvency
does help improve
solvency because when you have a
personal retirement account policy it's
accompanied with a benefit offset
with that feature in place do you
believe the personal retirement accounts
can help us achieve solvency for the
system and make those future retiree
benefits more secure
well i wouldn't say that the
pay-as-you-go benefits are insecure in
the sense that
there's nothing to prevent the federal
government from creating as much money
as it wants and paying it to somebody
the question is
okay so i'm going to stop it there okay
so he says so greenspan says no
there's really no danger of pay as you
go meaning social security right that's
what you mean there's no danger of it
running out of money because
the united states government can print
as much money as it wants and then give
it to anybody it was
he just said that which kind of blows
paul ryan out of the room right
uh yeah i think it drained all of the
color out of paul ryan's face as soon as
he said it
yes it was a great moment so then he
goes on
so so that's alan greenstein and
admitting
kind of your economic theory he's kind
of admitting
what you and other people are are
pushing now modern
monetary theory or you're working on i
don't say pushing
but you're working on now um so he's
kind of admitting that the basis of what
your modern monetary theory is
is actually correct so so a couple of
things it's
so he knows it's not a theory he was the
chairman of the federal reserve
and the guy knows where the money comes
from right so he knows it's a reality
and not only that
he this guy follows iran this is a true
believer libertarian
you know i mean this this is a guy who
would very much
like that not to be the case in a sense
that there were
real hard constraints on government's
ability to do more
for the economy and so in a way it
drives him crazy that this is the case
but he's under oath
and to his credit he gives an honest
answer
so okay so that's fat tax you're right
he does know how it works
so now he's going to go and
and so now he's going to go on and ex
and
explain more and i don't know a
thing what he's talking about but i'm
sure you will and you can tell us what
he means
so here's what he says next after that
how do you set up a system which assures
that the real assets
are created which those benefits
are employed to purchase so
it's not a question of security it's a
question of the structure
of a financial system which assures that
the real resources
are created for retirement as distinct
from the cash the cash itself
is nice to have but
it's got to be in the context of the
real resources
being created at the time
those benefits are paid so that you can
purchase
real resources with the benefits which
of course
are cash so i don't know what he's
talking about can you tell me what he
means
but it seems to still upset paul ryan so
that's got to be good so what is he
saying
that was crystal clear jimmy i have no
idea
but i think that was the biggest word
salad yeah
yeah so but so here's what he said so
let's go back
the first thing he does is take the
affordability question
off the table right he says there's
absolutely nothing to prevent the
federal government
from caring for every future retiree the
disabled and their dependents
as promised in full on time for the rest
of
eternity nothing to stop us from doing
that so we've completely put that aside
then he goes on to make what is the
really important point on the point that
i wish we were debating
instead of what we always end up
debating the really important point he's
raising is this
greenspan knows demographics are
changing in this country
baby boomers are moving into retirement
leaving behind
fewer and fewer people to produce the
stuff that all of us will continue to
buy so boomers will retire
they won't make stuff but they'll still
want to buy stuff and greenspan
says the question is how do you set up a
system which assures
that the real assets the real stuff is
getting produced in the economy are
available
how do we make sure that we're going to
have a productive enough economy
in 5 10 20 30 years so that when those
checks go out people can spend that
money into the economy without
