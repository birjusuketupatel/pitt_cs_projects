big super huge story yesterday in the
mainstream media about russia and
wikileaks and turns out everybody had
their head up their ass as usual this is
how this always
this is it's
it's almost embarrassing for me to even
bri
ron this is how it goes all the time big
headline we got him russia and trump bam
and then oh
trump jr met with a russian lawyer to
get stuff
oh guess what the dossier has all the
oh guess what was the last one uh oh
wikileaks
wikileaks uh
sent an email to trump jr they had a
secret
they had a secret um yeah with exchange
there was no no no that's this one but
the one before was they had it for was
the twitter thing they had the twitter
thing they had a secret exchange of
information you mean they direct message
each other on twitter
so there was that one and that turned
out to be again
nothing
and then this one yesterday and that but
they all ran with so
yeah this time they don't just have egg
on their face they have an entire omelet
yes not just any omelette but one that
was featured on man versus food like
they really matter
so in june a couple of uh
top cnn reporters got fired from for a
miss uh
reported story about trump and russia
remember that yes
uh just last week brian ross got
suspended for four weeks
for dropping another fake story or the
or was a week before last so within the
last two weeks
abc reporter got suspended for a month
for doing this exact thing and now here
we are the next week cnn doing the exact
again oh my god we got him you remember
we remember we showed joy reid remember
her oh remember joy reid
we showed her reading they got it
so now there's this
and the way glenn greenwald describes it
in the intercept is the uspd yesterday
suffered its most humiliating debacle in
ages
and now re refuses all transparency over
what happened so that's it that's so he
goes in to talk we're going to talk a
little bit about but let's show you the
news report so here's the news report
hello everyone i'm kate baldwin more
emails more problems for donald trump jr
and the russia investigation cnn has
exclusive new details about a message
sent in the final stretch of the 2016
campaign offering access to hacked
wikileaks documents a previously
undisclosed effort to reach donald trump
himself his son and his inner circle
just weeks before the election this
comes of course on top of other new
evidence other new evidence of
follow-ups to the famous trump tower
meeting between don jr and a russian
lawyer follow-ups
that he had promised when he had
promised there weren't any let's get
over to cnn's senior congressional
correspondent monterrazu mano there's a
lot that you have gotten in the past
in the past day plus lay out your new
reporting today on this effort to give
trump access to wikileaks documents can
you lay out your reporting that you
actually didn't fact check and you
actually didn't see the email that
you're about to report on can you get
relayed
lay us on your incorrect facts about the
reporting you actually didn't see the
email
here we go
well kate this email on september 4th
2016 was sent to donald trump then
candidate donald trump donald trump jr
and others in the trump organization
including donald trump jr's personal
secretary and in this personal assistant
i should say and in this email uh it
actually has a decryption code and a
link to a web address where purportedly
they could have received the hacked
wikileaks documents included in this it
says that they could also receive
the hacked
clinton colin powell
emails the former boy this boy this guy
has a hard time talking
no kidding huh well can i put on a quick
side note uh that i think's worth
mentioning as of right now unless
something changes yesterday because
brian stelter the quote-unquote watchdog
over at cnn uh
there this uh reporter is not gonna face
any consequences no according to cnn
they followed due process because they
had these two random protected sources
so
so if you hear if you listen to what
he's saying what he's trying to say and
he's saying it's so garbled this guy is
for a reporter this guy can't
communicate where the crap
could he put more us in there uh there
was a uh the four on the fourth uh the
fourth of uh september uh they had a uh
uh
i know i'm exaggerating to make a joke
but is am i overreacting to how horrible
this guy is explaining the story it was
pretty clear there was correspondence
when they said there wasn't
correspondence and the correspondence
might be the corresponds to looking for
the correspondence
aren't you with a link
let's listen to a little bit more
secretary of state whose own emails were
hacked and were released 10 days later
by a russian front group now the
timeline is important here because on
september 4th that was after a month now
the timeline is important here
the timeline is important here because
we're getting it wrong
that's why it's important that's awesome
and by the way this guy they they have
all these
all the money in the world all the
assistants you know who helps us do our
research here me
and ron and steph
okay that's it right so if one of us
aren't they he has a system they have a
newsroom
they have a newsroom
of people and and nobody nobody said hey
did you see the email
and when he said no they go well why
don't we wait till we see the email and
we can double check the date on it
no look let's just go with it you
haven't seen the email
no but your source has yes why couldn't
your source show you the email
right so nobody fact double check this
so here we're protecting them so look at
this so look at this so
uh
july 22nd wikileaks post hack emails
september 4th email sent to trump trump
jr
offering key for hacked wikileaks that
did not happen
there was an email so just so you
understand what happened
the day wikileaks dumped the emails they
also sent a someone
sent an email to the trump campaigns
saying hey
check out all these uh these documents
and here's an encryption key
and it was sent so it was sent by a guy
no one knows
no one knows who this guy is
and so why is that important so if it
was sent on that day
that's a full 10 days before wikileaks
re dumped all that stuff so that would
mean they were working
giving information before they really
all this stuff and so when people then
make the leap they go well if wikileaks
was working with the trump campaign
well wikileaks we know it was working
with russia so drop it
by the way news organizations get to
communicate with whoever they want to
communicate with just is that just so
that's clear okay
news organizations get to send emails to
russia
they get to send emails to the president
they get to send emails to other news
organizations they get to send emails to
anybody they want people running for
president people probably send emails to
them they can send emails for people
running for president
so
uh
and then anyway so let's keep going
you know what jimmy i just wanted to say
so cnn's cnn's exclusive is just
nothing there is no exclusive here to
see everybody just a lot of
uh made-up facts yes
well they got it wrong well you know
they got the date wrong on the email
they didn't they didn't look at the
email themselves and then they ran and
published it
so they didn't double check it they got
it wrong
you know especially after they just
fired
some top reporters for getting something
wrong already this past summer
and then how abc just had to suspend
brian ross and uh and then that's that's
you know how about
rachel maddow we got trump's we've got
his tax returns
we've got the dossier
it's just one false thing after another
and and so and so now
cnn doing their best
to make trump's fake news things stick
you got to be better
than the president you got to be better
than the other people you got to
actually look at the email you're
reporting on
can i tell you that what uh manu raju's
uh correction statement was well here it
is this is okay i'm going to show you in
a second okay was hacked and after their
own
emails became leaked and it was a month
before clinton campaign chairman john
podesta's emails were leaked by
wikileaks and it was also a couple weeks
before wikileaks was corresponding with
donald trump jr on twitter via direct
messages now the person who sent this
email someone by the name of mike
erickson we don't know who this
individual is and the congressional
investigators themselves don't know who
this person is either
so i don't know who sent this email the
con congressional investigators have no
idea who's that know who this is or
and you don't even know what the date is
of it a
you got the date wrong you don't know
who the guy is but you're definitely
sure that what's in the email is a
hundred percent factual isn't that weird
it's weird that he doesn't have any time
to figure out who his source is
no access well that's what gran what
glenn greenwald's saying in his piece
today is that they're not revealing who
these people are who gave them false
information right
so we're who is this who's well let's
keep going a little bit
uh but mike erickson sent this email to
donald trump jr
saying that they could access these
documents and donald trump jr was asked
about this kate at the house
intelligence committee's classified
hearing yesterday earlier this week and
when he said he did no recollection of
this email exchange now the attorney for
donald trump jr just put out a statement
responding to our our latest report
say saying this we understand that the
media reported 12 hours prior to this
email that the dnc emails have been
hacked or leaked we do not we do not
know who mike erickson is we have no
idea who he is we never responded to the
email but interestingly kate on the same
day that donald trump jr received this
email was the first time that he appears
to have tweeted about wikileaks this is
what he tweeted on
okay this is all false they're just
again false and then he tweeted this
that day they'd like to do that when
they when when they do these kind of
stories they go yeah but then he like
this so that's all this stuff that
should be suspicious does we don't know
what effort means does it mean anything
trump jr tweeted about wikileaks that
day
they're trying to fix all these
connections like they're just trying to
be like and that was the first day he
tweeted about wikileaks and then that
was the second day that kevin bacon
tweeted about this like
they're just trying to make all these
connections
so
let's see a little bit more that date
september 4th wikileaks hillary clinton
sent thousands of classified cables mark
c for confidential uh having
including a link there to wikileaks so
julian assange himself has tweeted about
our story also saying it is not clear
what this has to do with wikileaks but i
can tell you kate this appears to follow
a pattern of the way the wikileaks
provides this kind of information uh
giving this decryption key and a website
link whether this happened here we don't
know and we also don't it doesn't appear
that the trump campaign or anybody
contacted the fbi
after they received this email they said
they just didn't act on it and didn't
respond kate
and to be clear don jr says he doesn't
recall seeing this email
yeah he doesn't recall seeing this email
he did said and then his lawyer said he
took no action on it uh so that's where
we stand right now that's we testified
under oath so separately
but i guess all connected these
previously unknown follow-up emails
everything's connected everything's
connected
so here he is so he had to come in
so here he is with his statement
uh
correcting his reporting and again
i watched this before
and
he's uh not a clear speaker i'll put let
me put it this way i'll put it down this
guy's too many ums and oz
uh and you don't understand what he's
saying
so here we go
that we have been reporting uh
throughout the day today about an email
that was sent
to trump campaign to then candidate
trump donald trump jr
and others during the heat of the
campaign season this email uh included a
decryption key and also uh something a
link to where they could act also in uh
a link and uh a uh decryption email
i'm sorry this guy's not claire speaker
i don't know i don't know what he's
talking about what so what do you want
to clear you want to clarify hey the
story we reported earlier that said
there was an email sent on september 4th
it wasn't it was sent out september 14th
which totally blows our story away so
that's all he had to say but he listened
to all this garbage i'm gonna start it
at the top we're actually correcting a
story that we have been reporting uh
throughout the day today about an email
that was sent to the trump campaign to
then candidate trump donald trump jr uh
and others uh during the heat of the
campaign season this email uh included a
decryption during the heat of the
campaign why do you why are you adding
all this extraneous infor during the
heat of the campaign season it certainly
doesn't sound like a correction it
doesn't sound like a correction it
sounds like he's just saying we had a
correction and i'm going to tell you
every single fact in detail that i get
to the correction
it's like start with the correction
and you notice even on the crawl or
anything they don't they're not even
saying correction and i like how glenn
greenwald writes he goes how did cnn end
up aggressively hyping such a
spectacularly false story and look look
at what's happening right now
so let's go back
in key and also uh is something a link
to where they could access some of these
hacked wikileaks documents from the
democratic national committee now we've
been reporting uh that correctly email
came on september 4th that's exactly
right that's what you should say now
we've been incorrectly reporting he
didn't say that
uh that was before uh some of these
documents uh were publicly available but
we have just received obtained a copy of
this email uh and instead you know the
email we've been reporting about that
we've been hyping like just received the
thing we've been hyping like crazy
well another news agency went ahead and
got that email the washington post and
so now we got it from them
that's that's who god that's who broke
that they got the story wrong it was the
washington post broke it that they got
it wrong they had the email so now now
we have the email how come the
washington post could get ahold of that
email and cnn the most trusted name and
news can't get all of that email
this would be what so now he's so no i
saw an ad for cnn that said apples are
apples
yes did you get it no matter if you say
it's a banana it doesn't matter but it's
apple it's still an apple except that
it's a banana
okay
we now learn that this uh this email was
on september 14th so that is 10 days
later than what we originally reported
earlier today and and this is appears to
have changed the understanding ten days
later then ten days later that we
previously reported today what are you
talking about again it's just he
couldn't be more convoluted the way he's
you're trying to explain your miss up
and mishap you're being as
convoluted as possible yes and somebody
behaves that way in a couple situations
hey they're incredibly nervous this
guy's a reporter for cnn i doubt that's
the case b
they're lying
i don't know why he's he's
he certainly doesn't want to say wow we
really screwed up and we were over again
we just we did a horrible thing and uh
he tries to put all these words in
between
well now we originally reported that it
was 10 days earlier but it turns out it
was at this day so that kind of changes
the fundamental misunderstanding of it
but we were understanding that what the
f
i don't know you're a regular person
right you're a
regular person arnold schwarzenegger is
this does this seem crazy to you
yeah okay arnold says he's crazy brian
ross gets suspended for four weeks and
this guy still gets to go back on
television
saying that the watchdog himself is
claiming that he followed due process
this reporter followed due process so
let's get this is the let's
do process let's listen to the rest
the story because initially it seemed
perhaps they were being offered access
to documents that were not yet publicly
available but in this email from an
individual named michael erickson they
do direct the trump campaign to some
publicly available documents hacked
documents from wikileaks as well as from
the former secretary of state so he just
hack document they do direct to trump
came into these hacked documents hacked
hack doc they do have the hack document
