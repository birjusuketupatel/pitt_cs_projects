what's that guy's name Steven clue bang
Steve include better Eric Cartman
fantastic buddy
orange Jimmy I think another appropriate
name is Steven no-neck because he
doesn't have a neck I would be that
angry too if my neck wasn't fully
developed hey he's just a working-class
guy trying to survive alright he's just
he's working hard
he made footage I watched Mike's video I
guess I don't know if you watch this
video or this but what he called him
what did you call him well let me put of
his neck but it also he wait wait you
made fun of what his neck and he doesn't
have a neck how could you put the neck
black of the neck but he looks like a
real-life version of Eric Cartman from
South Park does he not exactly like and
he acts like him too a needle yes yes
and the Democrats respect his authority
that's how that works
you were respect my authority but you
when you made fun of his neck I almost
pissed myself at home
because I just drink a lot of water but
also it's fun to see it's fun to see a
progressive guy make fun of someone's
physicality I love it
but he does not have a neck I'm
not kidding he does it if they tried to
kill him during the French Revolution he
would have lived they'd give him a
haircut Jimmy they would have said we
can't kill that guy oh the King turtle
so let me get these jokes ready
I like that Nancy Pelosi doesn't care
about things that happen in the past cuz
they have no impact on the future just
look at the Iraq war I can these jokes
are sad some of these jokes are sad I'm
come ready I'm already almost drunk and
I've been trying to get drunk all

you need to say down with the
billionaire's we can't stand the rich a
lot of people want to be rich so is it
the right message that there were
Democrats are going with it's so effing
wrong I like I like how the host acts
really upset that he said effing well

with the billionaires we can't stand the
rich a lot of people want to be rich so
is it the right message that there were
Democrats are going with it's so F and
wrong whoa
[Applause]
I am so bleeping upset whoa
mister with you said a letter from the
alphabet hey watch your P's and Q's
buddy with the FE all right here we go
here's this guy I talked to Schumer I've
talked to whiten I've talked to Pelosi
and I said if you use the term bill
again I'm done why because because I'm
 one of them
that's why look at me god damn it I paid
for sex what do you think I'm one of
those guys it's hilarious that it's
aspirational I didn't start with
anything just penalize everyone that's
done well we all want to do well and we
should be the party of doing well we
should be a party of business and
leadership we should be the party of do
well and if you can't do well you're
deported we should be the party of doing
well we should be a party of business
does this guy know that there's a
Republican Party
there's already a party of
business chick ma jaws they're
already it's called a Republican party
why else would you that's so now we're
supposed to have two parties that are
pro-business
they already are right so both the
reason why half the country is poor or
low-income is because both political
parties represent management's that's
why and it's about time we had a party
that represents workers again lazy
gentlemen
I was gonna say that we do have two
parties we have a conservative party
right and fascist party yeah yes it had
been when Justine earlier sorry about
well DeWitt
[Music]
I'm Stetson but my joke what was it it
was something like that it probably
won't work now my joke was there's a you
know the Conservative Party is in
disarray in America and the Republicans
are up too that's more of a pity
applause than a real applause but I
appreciate it Jimmy can I ask you is
this Steven effin clue back never his
name is right is he like the poster
child for the rich and the wealthy good
all we need to do is all be a well doer
party he's creeping me out am I supposed
to be on board with him I think he has a
son named Franklin that I used to read
about as a kid anyone else
couple people who's that it's a
millennial thing
I totally turtle the turtle all right
here we go back to this jagoff thready
business leadership and it is very very
disturbing when I hear the billionaire
billionaire word and I told them to stop
it knock it off I told I warned him
knock it off just like Hillary Clinton
told Wall Street cut it out everyone
wants to do really well and this is the
world of - guys like me make it get it
possible for other people to do well by
rigging the tax system over you
it's at exporting all of their jobs to
poor people and for desperate situations
what's your problem
okay thank you yes thank you
aspirations then are you worried that
the Democratic Party is going too far to
the left
ladies and gentlemen I give you an MSNBC
host
still can't find room for Chomsky but
this gets it that amazing
we can't bring out Chomsky's there a
billionaire a like you bring out
instead got it done ok so here we go the
Democratic Party's moving too far the
Democrats aren't far enough to the right
they only compromise and shift it to the
right on living wages education tax cuts
the environment health care and war but
they haven't used a Republican talking
point against the Democrats in 48 hours
so I guess there's good ok
so much so it drives me nuts by the way
say the Democratic Party is too far the
left is like saying Kevin Spacey is too
apologetic I'm tired I come by I know I
already hit that joke earlier but it's
still solid so it would make me quit the
party and I've made it very clear I'll
cut your money off
[Applause]
yeah I'll cut your money off in like a
good trust-fund teenager they
listen yeah it's the Democrats listen
you know what Bernie Sanders says I'll
go to the people you I will raise a
billion dollars twenty seven dollars at
a time
and you know why Bernie pick 27 because
that's his social security number
[Applause]
he's old it's funny it's okay he's old
does he have more to say this guy and
others will do the same we've had enough
we've had enough I've had enough of this
 where I have a billion dollars and
I can't tell the government what
to do I have had enough of this
I will move somewhere where I can tell
it I will go to Barbados and buy that
 government and stick it right in
your face I am a CEO and I am tired of
nobody in politics looking out for my
interests Ron stop being funnier than me
I was CEO looking for a party that
fighting looks out for my interests you
already did that joke
let's see if there's any more brands and
what is that friend because right now
there is an opportunity it Democrats
lose for example in the state of
Virginia if that isn't a wake-up call
that the Democratic leadership needs to
get together and say we've got to find a
middle ground but these are the
Democrats continue to go far to the left
you've got that whole group in the
center that are just aren't going to go
the way Elizabeth Warren or Bernie
Sanders and then you're gonna fracture
the party even more it's fractured so
it's only it's only that she's 100%
 wrong that's not a big deal
because the people the farthest to the
left one on election night last week
ladies and gentlemen right Mike yes did
we in the predict socialist of America
won seats across the country yep
[Applause]
really so the corporate Democrats and
wasn't a big route for the corporate
Democrats it was actually the
far left won that election they got a
guy in Philadelphia who sued the cops
and it's a black lives matter lawyer he
saw the DA so it's just weird how they
talk about the brand watch this I took a
fractured it's broken
we need a new brand it needs we need a
new brand that's what she's hey you know
what the problem is as a Democratic
brand it's not like you guys invented
the world's greatest candy bar and you
name it cancer
you're the Democrats you guys are
to the core you don't represent
anybody except the same people the other
party represents they have a branding
problem like they have a branding
problem
do you think that's a branding problem
the Democrats have Mike well you know if
you listen to someone like Tom Perez
then they do stand for something they
stand for hope and values when we put
open the belly we win that's my Tom
Perez I don't know
yes that's very good you got to put our
values on the ballot put our values on
the ballot if you don't have the hand
gesture then you're not fully capturing
Tom Perez or Hillary Clinton needs to be
simple keep it simple tax reform keep it
simple infrastructure no bumps in the
road what more do we have to say I don't
know maybe you could say like
universal health care Medicare for all
free college a living wage fight for
fifteen car checks strong unions you
could say the hell Jimmy if we do all of
that though then this guy won't be able
to buy another private jet or have their
mansion so maybe we're being too hard on
them you know
I've with you they need to have a new
brand created a new brand create
electronic party in worse shape than
Republicans they're both insane yeah
that's the one thing he's right about
[Music]
that's the one thing he's right about
and then this woman who I follows she
said this about him he it he's just
another greedy bloated parasite sucking
the life out of the planet while he
while using his ill-gotten gains to
further rig the system against the rest
of us we should tax him and all his
cronies at a full hundred percent yeah
so so uh so this so she responded to him
and then guess what jagoff kubacheck or
whatever his name is he
responded to her
he says creating 20,000 jobs taking care
of people putting many kids through
college you must be a birdie person who
wants everything for free get a job and
add to the GD GDP it's okay to make
money you realize when you grow up
everyone wants to do well so I responded
to him and I said when you say free
stuff do you mean health care and
education not trillion-dollar Wall
Street bailouts and billion-dollar oil
subsidies
because I'm not talking about giving
away free stuff as Bernie says wrong
Google I am just suggesting your text I
was good used for valuable public
services instead of wasting billions on
Wall Street oil wars and corporate
subsidies because it's the billionaires
who are getting the free stuff and let's
find out Mike did you figure out that
guy clue Beck what he actually does for
a living he runs this from Wikipedia
Diamond Resorts International and
Diamond results as a national is a
timeshare that people use when they go
on vacation so when he says he creates
20,000 jobs he means that there wouldn't
be those jobs if he didn't invent going
on vacation because that guy it's what
he say about it invent timeshares no one
would go on a vacation and then there
will be done there would be people still
go on vacation and they would
still be 20,000 jobs
you dick face and you know it
you didn't create that job people
wanting to go on vacation
created those jobs you stood up to fill
a need that was in the economy that's
how the economy works you don't create a
job a need is in the economy you
screw up to fill that need it could have
been you or some other dumb
to fill that need okay some other guy
maybe the other guy here that's color
that wicks up to his ear bill do
dough and by the way their subject you
want to say something yeah I just want
to say how much I love this audience
because I heard somebody shout out
effing timeshare
and here's what his company really does
Diamond Resorts was compelled to settle
with the state of Arizona for $800,000
in December of 2016 just freakin last
December the state has received hundreds
of consumer complaints against Diamond
Resorts consumers complain that diamond
use deceptive sales practices and made
numerous aural misrepresentations and
false statements during timeshare sales
presentations
[Applause]
a timeshare company being shady does
seem really out of character I'm with
you so it turns out he's full of
and he's a scammer like all of them and
here's someone else I follow Cheryl
alter says a trans woman beat the guy
who introduced the bathroom bill a gun
victims boyfriend beat a delegate with
an a-grade from the NRA a civil rights
lawyer who sued the police department
just became the top prosecutor to
Philadelphia something's happening here
folks
right Mike wouldn't you say well what
would be your assessment of this last
collection my assessment would be that
the people voted for the farthest left
candidate they could find what is your
assessment my assessment is that if you
don't give anybody a reason to vote then
they're not gonna come out and support
you so the Democratic Party they try to
appeal to these so-called moderates but
the problem is that in doing that
they're just making sure that their
actual base recives stay home and they
don't get that so they think move
further to the right so if we've learned
anything or we should take away anything
from this last couple of elections it's
that you have to be progressive and give
voters a reason to come out it's that
simple
so good point Mike so when they say it's
the worst income inequality in 100 years
they say hey look we're stuck so that's
all the Democrats have to offer
Jimmy is that Stephen clue Beck the next
live Jimmy door show is December 4th
that's a Monday night December 4th in
Burbank California at the flappers
comedy club linked for tickets right
there see at December 4th
