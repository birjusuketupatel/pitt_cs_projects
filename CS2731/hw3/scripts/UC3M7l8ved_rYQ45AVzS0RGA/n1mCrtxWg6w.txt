new Pentagon data America has spent 250
million dollars a day a day on war every
single day for the last 16 years I like
this guy by the way Shirota yeah he's
great I love it
and how many how many people are stuck
how many kids are starving to death in
Nairobi in there in Yemen right now
right there because they're all Meli
malnutrition because they've been there
in internment camps and that people
don't care and they're starving to death
like 90,000 kids what if we took that
250 million dollars a day and like every
fifth day we took that 250 and Mike
spent on helping people instead of
 killing people wouldn't that be
weird what do you think would happen
then what if we took 250 million dollars
and like trying to help people in Syria
or Lebanon or Libya or Iraq or
Yemen we took children and tried to help
them and said I've just every 15 the
other days we'll try to blow them up but
every fifth day we take a quarter of a
billion dollars and we try to help
people I bet you have better effect is
that amazing what if we took that money
and tried to help people with it do you
imagine what kind of a world we could
have but they never think that way
because they are only thinking about the
next quarters profits and that's where
we're left it we're left in a corporate
state of the world this is what we're
living in a corporate world that only
looks towards the next quarter profits
which is why they voted for the eighty
billion dollars extra in that Pentagon
budget which is why stuff like this is
happening because they only care about
the next quarter that's what this is you
can't make more money this is a bad way
to create jobs this is the most
inefficient way to create jobs in the
world
is military spending it creates jobs but
middle but it's the worst way right so
we can't wait way more jobs by spending
that other ways and maybe we would
figure that out if we had a ten year
bonus structure instead of a four month
bonus structure I'm sorry to say and I
would I would actually I would gladly
give up daddy's home - and bad moms
Christmas if they used those budgets to
actually help help people yeah I paid
for that
well I wouldn't care if I ever saw I
didn't actually see either one of them
but a hundred and thirty kids a day died
in Yemen all right I just did a story on
this for political vigilante a hundred
thirty children a day are dying in Yemen
because of the starvation crisis because
of the blockade that the blockade so so
we're supporting that we're supporting
so there's an organization Save the
Children there and they are running out
of supplies and new supplies cannot get
to them to help these kids we're doing
that every day 130 kids are dying and
then they're predicting a fifty thousand
just children just children in Yemen are
dying also 250 million dollars I wonder
I don't know you know there's a there's
a homeless encampment in downtown Los
Angeles
there's a Skid Row just one of
these days I wonder if that could one of
that days wouldn't fix that whole
problem how many billions of dollars you
think it would take to fix the homeless
problem in America maybe a couple
billion tops I don't know I'm not I'm
not a math surgeon but going but I don't
even think it would be 1 billion I think
it's just it's crazy yeah I don't use it
for that any crazier I get off the I get
off the 101 at Alvarado to go the two
and Ike all of a sudden there's a
homeless encampment there underneath
that bridge there didn't used to be
they've been moving the modern downtown
because they're building high rent
apartments downtown now if you've not
noticed right there gentrifying downtown
and they're moving Skid Row farther and
farther and farther now it ended up and
Alvarado when the 101 right so
there it is and here it is this is what
so this is how all empires fail this is
how all empires fail and there's and
they're doing it on steroids and you
know what's going to go up with it the
 Democrats that just going along
eat Barack Obama Nancy Pelosi Chuck
Schumer Elizabeth Warren yeah and ll
 Franken they're all going thank
you very much they're all going along
with it don't you know what they're
going along they're going along with
this this is where could look at this
this is all the American bases around
Iran this is their military bases look
at that this is could you imagine if
that was a Rance military bases around
 America could you imagine this
this is why are they putting their
country right in the middle of all our
military bases I don't get why they're
doing that but this is what we're living
in and here's the original but and by
the way why do we do this and we invent
we because what Orwell said perpetual
war for perpetual peace we got to keep
the war machine
what Eisenhower said is absolutely true
beware the undue influence of the
military-industrial complex because this
is what it leads to here we are
Iran oh I'm sorry Iran a country that is
not threatening to us never attacked us
ever you know what we did we overthrew
the democratically elected government in
the 50s and then we backed their strong
arm the Shah okay and then they
got rid of them and that's why they hate
us because we back that oppressive
 and look at what we've done
since then here we are and you're
telling me that somehow they hate us for
our freedom that's why they hate us they
hate us for our freedom do they hit us
for freedom I don't know but you're
bumming me out you know Jimmy I said
damnit show the steps thing I stood on
my neighbor's front yard with a
machine gun in a rocket launcher and I'm
sitting there cleaning it and stacking
it up full of weapons and the guy starts
 freaking out so he must be a
terrorist terrorist I blew him the
up and you know what I mean that's my
right and by the way why Jimmy is there
not a widespread revolt against because
when we had all rights but revolt
against the financial sector yeah sorry
it got we had it right it got crushed by
Democratic mayor's who unleashed their
union cops to correct the heads of
peaceful protesters that's what happened
the biggest reason I think is because
the media the propaganda machine that is
here is stronger than anything the
 Soviet Union ever had I mean
this C s NB C I mean MSNBC C CNN it's
all in it all trumpets this it all does
not uncover this Eddy what's your theory
about homelessness
do you remember what we're talking about
well my dear about more and more people
becoming homeless to me was talking
about the homeless getting pushed push
rents are going up all over people in
New York now they're living in the Bronx
they can't even live in the Bronx pretty
soon it's going to be you know there's
gonna be like where like people are
gonna be one-upping each other on where
they're homeless like there's there's
gonna be there's gonna be like oh really
you're homeless under the bridge well
I've got us
right next to the water that's
absolutely it's gonna get like that
there's gonna be wine tastings you know
that's that's it you're homeless on the
east side I'm homeless in Santa Monica I
go on the promenade I barely have to ask
that's not far away that's not far away
so Jim Chomsky said trying to get my
kids into a good rehab ok Noam Chomsky
said any dictator would admire the
uniformity and obedience of the US media
and you know why because we're talking
about Yemen I didn't have time to put
together a story for tonight's show I
wanted to and the story wanted to put
together was about how CBS just did a 60
minute story about Yemen and what they
failed to mention was our involvement in
the Yemen conflict they made it all seem
like it was Saudi Arabia and we were the
good guys trying to help those people
they didn't mention that we them
over in fact Adam Johnson from fair he
is 60 minutes does a 13 minute report on
Yemen doesn't mention the United States
UK military support have you thought of
you bombing once or at any involvement
in off so that's what's happening right
that's why you're here
that's why I have a show because the
media isn't telling you the truth even
when they cover something like Yemen
they leave all this out they leave
all this out and they leave
out the fact that we're doing it we're
in bed with reality Arabia why are we in
bed with Saudi Arabia bombing fishing
villages in the poorest country in the
world met 50,000 kids are gonna die
within 30 days if we don't stop it why
are we doing that cuz of the petrol
dollar and then that's what another
thing that never gets mentioned by the
way it's coming to an end the petro
dollar is coming to an end we'll do a
story about that soon too and then
what's gonna happen to the
United States when the petro dollar ends
I don't know what happens when your
house that was worth to have a million
dollars there's no longer worth a
million dollars worth $200,000 and you
thought you're gonna be able to retire
mmm what happens when you have a million
dollar house and you want to retire on
it and you want to sell it to the
Millennials and they don't have any
 money to buy your goddamn house
what do you think about that what
happens when that happens because that's
what's happening
right now okay so the males all
hopped up on avocado toast
that's why I got five a goddamn house I
don't know about that but we don't have
any money I can borrow
[Laughter]
Ron works for this show the show is Ron
doesn't get paid right Ron Ron gets paid
but he's paid by the donations of this
show ha ha ha and thank God for you
Jimmy as a comedian because the
comedian's next door are all doing
material right now about how funny cargo
pants are this is Osama bin Laden and we
used to call the anti-soviet warrior
that's what they used to call him right
so this is the international pee
newspaper the independent anti-soviet
war puts his army on the road to peace
he's this is a moderate rebel ok so you
know that by the way
and here's from the Guardian David
Petraeus bright idea give terrorists
weapons to beat terrorists so we've been
doing this for a while we've been arming
the people we claim to be spending seven
hundred billion dollars a year in defeat
we're supposed to be defeating al Qaeda
and Isis we're actually arming them and
training them and giving them a pat on
the head I'm not kidding here is a wiki
leaks revealed al Qaeda is on our side
in Syria what we're fighting with al
Qaeda in Syria yes and this video will
be demonetized okay here we go
and here's Tulsi Gabbard she asked that
we stop doing that
there under US law it is illegal for you
or me or any American to provide any
type of assistance to al Qaeda Isis or
other terrorist groups if we broke this
law we'd be thrown in jail yet the US
government's been violating this law for
years directly and indirectly supporting
allies and partners of groups like al
Qaeda and Isis with money weapons
intelligence and other support in their
fight to overthrow the Syrian government
a recent New York Times article confirm
that rebel groups supported by the u.s.
quote have entered into battlefield
alliances with the affiliate of al Qaeda
in Syria formerly known as on the surra
The Wall Street Journal reports that
rebel groups are quote doubling down on
their alliance with al Qaeda this
alliance has rendered the phrase
moderate rebels meaningless we must stop
this madness
we must stop our
terrorists I'm introducing the stop
arming terrorist act today to prohibit
taxpayer dollars from being used to
support terrorists it's not - well I bet
Jake paper was all over that huh
they do it all Jake taper I love that
Jake taper they decided they listened to
her speech and they went let's go any
more billion dollars better guy and
that's that is a woman I would love to
see be president right there yeah there
you go
that's an Iraq war vet that's a
progressive right she has not taken me
she doesn't take super PAC money and
she's a goddamn surfer like me she's is
she awesome well she's from Hilo Hawaii
with Mahalo
it's a beautiful place and so here is
rate homeless district here's a guy for
the life here's a guy for the Washington
Post and he responds to her by saying I
don't think Tulsi is a traitor
but I agree her enthusiastic
whitewashing of Assad's atrocities is
horrendous so she actually goes to Syria
and Iraq war veteran I guarantee you
that guy has not been to Syria I
guarantee you this puke who works for
the war mongering paper who
disparages a truth-teller who puts her
 chin out to help the
world is not has never been a strike
here there is not a white man named Josh
that has ever done anything period and I
want I would like to ask Josh how many
of his friends didn't come back from
Iraq like tulsi gap tulsi gabbard has
friends that she served with that did
not come back from a regime
change war which is why she's like why
the are we going to Assad so Josh
kindly go yourself with your blue
time
yeah there's 22 vets a day to kill
themself because the corporate
promo of like you and go
yourself one more time yes thank
you dreams
laughs funny video
that's so datings weird cargo pants of
too many pockets you know blacks and
whites or difference because of pigment
[Laughter]
well I really because Scandinavians are
white and they're cold and that's why
they don't have that we don't have the
pigment it okay I like the banal
truth-telling comedian that's that bit
the banal do you like it but no but now
I like this I said this this pitch paper
has pushed every war including Iraq and
shame people who oppose it his boss's
boss is the world's richest predatory
capless that's all I could manage on
Twitter and I'm very proud at 196 likes
it's very nice that's a very aggressive
tweet to get that what he likes people
like a lot of you like oh I don't know I
don't want to be associated that that's
 but they did it here's Joe style
tell you the truth about the war she'll
tell you in case you didn't know the
United States funds and arms terrorist
groups like Al Qaeda and Isis when it
needs them to disrupt a country just so
you know so that's that's why I voted
for her because she except she's not
 her own she tells you Street
John Oliver didn't like her though John
Oliver didn't like her because he's a
corporate who can't tell
the truth if it goes against his boss's
wishes
well his boss is a big supporter to his
boss is a big support of the Clintons
that's why John Oliver did that right
when he heard she was starting to get
traction Jill Stein and her donations
well yeah and then he did that her
donations went down BAM so he added like
she's a good know just as a shallow
point he is a thumb with glasses and if
you didn't have an English accent nobody
would watch him at all nobody must be
smart and funny it is it is jonah
tickets it's that you're not
funny a you might be a little funny I'll
give him that
but I don't say it out but here's so
here's what Jake Tapper Jake Tapper
everybody Jake Tapper from CNN I want to
tell you about a very cool auction that
a bunch of us are running to try to help
wounded post 9/11 veterans
Ben Stiller and Cher and George Clooney
and I have solicited some items to go on
ebay from November
fourth through November 14th and all of
the proceeds go to a charity called
homes for our troops they provide
mortgage free specially designed homes
to the most wounded troops from Iraq and
Afghanistan so here are just some of the
amazing items so that's nice that Jake
Tapper did that and all those
celebrities did that that's a nice thing
here's what I said i retweeted his video
about this and I said a cooler way would
be to tell Americans that the truth
about these never-ending Wars
so we don't have any more wounded vets
that would help why'd you do that Jake
well it's nice that you get to act like
a big shot and you're helping people and
you are helping people and I don't want
to disparage helping people helping
people is good but if all those people
it aim at George Clooney and whoever
Cher and whoever else is doing that
would decide instead to do that to do
that and do a press conference where
Jake Tapper came out said these wars are
 and they're only here
to enrich a handful of other and
these guys come home legless and I gotta
do like this and I'm sick
and tired of it maybe we'd have an end
with these wars he'd be off the
air the next day Jake Tapper will never
do that for a while though Jake cares
about veterans he doesn't care about him
more than he cares about his own
career absolutely because if he did he
would say that and he would be
 on RT like ed Schultz and Larry
 King and everybody else who ever
told the truth on corporate media that's
where they end up they end up there are
on YouTube like I do
all right so this guy and is
 trying to help I'm glad he's
trying to help them but please have some
real balls and tell the truth about the
 war and quit pushing McCarthyism
you clubs
okay you know there's also something
weird about the most disabled like you
get in if you're the most disabled Yeah
right most disabled they get oh we'll
help you then this guy's just a head
let's give him two houses yeah yeah this
guy has post-traumatic stress disorder
he can't sleep through the night
him and this guy's just a hologram and
he has two mansions built by Bence
and this guy is a stellar layout of big
yeah put me in some shitty movie is he
here sorry
so Jeremy Scahill we're not CNN and by
the way that eBay thing should just be
called white guilt by the way I'm with
you right because that's all these
benefits of oh so it made me if
Jake Tapper got cher and Ben Stiller and
whoever the hell else you got to come on
do a press conference like I said and
tell the truth about these words what
you and I know are right and
they're only there to enrich a handful
of people maybe if he did that like this
guy here here it's Jeremy Scahill and he
tells the truth on CNN Jeremy I think
there is awareness of what's been going
on in Syria but for some reason maybe
people are desensitized but what is your
view of the coverage well first of all
let's look at this in the big picture
Donald Trump has given greater latitude
to the military to conduct strikes with
almost no regard for civilians just in
the March in the month of March Bryan US
and Allied forces have killed more than
a thousand civilians in Iraq and Syria
according to the nonpartisan independent
