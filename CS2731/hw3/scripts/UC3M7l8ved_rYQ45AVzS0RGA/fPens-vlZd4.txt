so there's a lot of happening over
the Supreme Court people are losing
their again again Donald Trump
steals people's critical thinking skills
Kamala Harris tweeted this about it she
said the fight over the Supreme Court
vacancy is going to require each and
every one of us talking with our friends
families and neighbors about the
importance of the court and the lasting
impact as decisions can have on our
fundamental rights I'm ready to fight
are you really she's ready to fight I
guess she's gonna I guess that's why she
didn't prosecute Steve minuchin because
she was so ready to fight it and then
Peter douche I love Peter douche he
tweeted out what are the odds the
Democratic leadership will effective
enough to stop Trump's Supreme Court
pick and if it says zero or zero point
zero
[Laughter]
[Applause]
this is what the Democrats do they'll
talk all this big resistance game on
Twitter and all that and they won't
do anything I remember Dianne
Feinstein right during the confirmation
of Mike Pompeo her Twitter feed all caps
resist we don't support torture we don't
know mr. Trump no she voted for
Mike Pompeo who's a goddamn torturer
shut the up Kamala Harris you let
Steve minutiae take my house in
California go your neoliberal
they wait till the Republicans
get in power and then they resist and
they say there's nothing we could do
they had control of everything and
that's when they do goddamn nothing
gram I agree with you please don't try
to get bigger responses from the crowd
than I can I thought I'd appreciate both
my family's here and it's embarrassing
I have work that john cusack is in the
crowds over
Jonnie Jonnie the COO Janek you chuckle
assume he says this Chuck Schumer warned
Senate Democrats fight Brett Kavanaugh
or pay the price from the base double
seeking I guess what they say to him red
state Democrats tells you were to kiss
my ass either Supreme Court vote
Democrats resistance and so he's not
gonna whip the votes so what that means
is he's not going to make Joe mentioned
vote in solidarity against it he's not
gonna make kills to gerbic where all the
people heidi heitkamp
or or claire mccaskill it's not gonna
he's not gonna whip their vote meaning
you have to vote the way i say on this
he's not gonna do that
why because chuck in the shoe is a
 tool and he's a liar and he's an
enemy of you
he's also received the most money of any
politician in either party from Goldman
Sachs
that's right boo hey wait Goldman Sachs
is out there helping people you guys
so people are again scapegoating
progressives and other people for the
Supreme Court
here's an amberlynn Tam Berlin you know
what that is she's famous right you know
she's an actress I know she's got a blue
check don't tell me she's not important
she says liberals who wouldn't vote for
Hillary :
with this new Supreme Court justice
being appointed by this administration
we could see the end of many things you
thought you were protecting and making
such a choice
the irony stings the nightmare belongs
to the right but Allah also to you this
I love how she says this nightmare
belongs to the right but also to you
it's not as bad as the nightmare of
actually setting foot in Pennsylvania in
Michigan is it dude imagine having to
 meet actual people what a
nightmare
you know we can see the end of many
things you thought you were protecting
when you chose a Wall Street puppet
during an anti-establishment title we
could see the end of many things you
thought were you protecting when your
president put journalists in jail became
a war criminal and left a DNC bankrupt
but you know Susan Sarandon am i right
and then look at this I feel a series of
Rage tweets coming on trying to control
myself must not act Susan Sarandon and
then Debra Messing um why not and Kathy
Griffin this is so juicy that's known as
the world shittiest three-way ladies and
gentlemen
[Applause]
and here's Conan O'Brien sidekick Andy
Richter you didn't vote for the
Democratic candidate because they
weren't progressive enough for you you
didn't vote for the Democratic candidate
because you thought it made no
difference
you didn't vote for the Democratic
candidate because you thought it was
safe too please don't do that again and
I said it's nothing more than voter
shaming it's blaming the powerless
tri-blend the powerful who propped up
Trump you know the Clinton campaign and
the media who created him or call out
the corrupt system that cheated the guy
who actually inspired voters
and then I tweeted this a time ago
here's a profile of minorities who voted
twice for Obama and were so let down
that half didn't bother to vote on the
other half voted but not for Clinton try
getting out of your neoliberal bubble
populated by millionaires and listen to
voters
and I think that made a difference
because Andy Richter who I think is a
decent guy actually tweeted this I said
I need to apologize for this tweet I was
bummed by the Kennedy announcement and I
said something snotty and unhelpful that
rightly angered a lot of people with
whom I overwhelmingly agree I deleted it
and I'm sorry for picking a fight with
boy you were bummed by he was bummed by
the Kennedy announcement really I was
bummed when my President Obama gave a
 to Wall Street and then
took two to seven that's what
 bum me I was bummed when Obama
opened the Arctic to drilling twice
that's what bummed me out
I was bummed out when Barack Obama
repealed habeas corpus that's a
bum me out
I don't know I'm funny I was bummed at
being one of the 5.2 million people that
had his house foreclosed on because
Obama bailed out the banks I was
bummed at that my house would be worth
1.5 million dollars right now I was
bummed out at that I was bummed out at
the war in Yemen I'm bummed out today at
the 120 kids that die every day
as a result of the war in Yemen that
Obama started
gram is the last time I'm going to tell
you
[Applause]
so then somebody that somebody tweeted
at Andy Richter after he apologized said
and you did not need to apologize at all
jimmy dore knew how important the
supreme court was going to be but turned
on the democratic party for the
independent Bernie
then went Bernie lost he continued to
berate the only hope we real Americans
had to stave off fascism and Republican
rule
I am very powerful and what I
tell those people is you're right I
didn't swing the election and if you're
not nicer to me I'll goddamn do it again
until things get shitty enough you're
ready to actually let a progressive win
the Democratic primary or become
president then I'm gonna keep
throwing these things there's another
guy since the Supreme Court of the news
not one of these mealy-mouthed pieces of
 have had anything useful to say
about it Jake you jerk I'll kolinsky
Jimmy door they were all complicit and
cynical enough to get us air now they're
too cowardly to admit they use bad
strategy in 2016 you know we use bad
strategy
maybe Hillary Clinton when she told her
 minions and the press to prop up
Donald Trump with the Pied Pipers here
that's maybe who had bad strategy
maybe campaigning in Texas in Arizona
instead of Michigan in Wisconsin was bad
 strategy maybe picking a vice
president who was the to the right of
Attila the Hun instead of Elizabeth
Warren or Bernie Sanders
which would have guaranteed you the
 presidency maybe that was bad
strategy
and don't ever forget the responsibility
to win elections rest with the candidate
the paid campaign staff and the party
when they lose the fault is theirs it's
understandable I guess why they are
desperate to frantically blame others
for their own failings but it's amazing
how many go along and my favorite of all
of these was this guy Jason Carney he
goes hey it's all our faults I mean all
we wanted was a people centric candidate
that had a fair shake and actually
changing the country for everyone
someone who realized there are massive
inequities across the board where do I
go to get punished now if you want to
blame somebody here's here's a skirt it
does beg the question how is it that
these Russian operatives knew to focus
on purple states like Michigan and
Wisconsin and your campaign didn't
obviously Putin knows America better
than John Podesta
and then if you want to see the voter
shaming to end all voter shaming here is
nearer tandon you know who she is right
she says actually it was the Communists
not aligning with the centrist that is
how Hitler got to pop or her and then
the Communists were the first to be
politically assassinated holy
they're attended literally blaming the
victim of Hitler's violence for Hitler
that is awesome
what's that that totally doesn't that
doesn't make sense so here is area I
have a few of these I here is near a
tendon on why Jesus Christ was crucified
because Judas voted for Jill Stein
that's why no it's true it's true
bro true yeah here's what Harris dear
attendant explaining the civil war you
want to hear that Graham I do
the Socialists just wouldn't get on
board with Lincoln because he wasn't
progressive enough
here's nerrit and n' by the way you
should look out for narrow tannins new
book the paid for history of the world
see oh here's near Tannen hometown she
explains the Revolutionary War she says
if the fringes would have gotten on
board with King George the third we
would have never a joke anyway I
[Applause]
screwed it up but it's still kind of
funny
[Laughter]
here's nerrit and anon baseball if the
Yankees don't go all the way this year
it's because the Bernie bro stayed home
on game day so I think the real reason
that we have shitty Supreme Court maybe
Chuck Schumer is gonna tell us right
here talk about every blue-collar
Democrat we will lose in Western PA we
will pick up to three moderate
Republicans and suburbs of Philadelphia
and you can repeat that in Ojai
Wisconsin hey how'd that work out for
you Chuckie the shoe
[Applause]
ladies ladies do this all I know is what
I do this all year is panties hit the
floor
[Applause]
if you want to know the real problem
here is Dylan Ratigan to tell Dylan
Ratigan if you don't know him he used to
have a show on MSNBC and one time he
told the truth about the banks and so
now they don't let him do his new show
anymore and now he has to do news
reports from the dentist office
[Applause]
the Democrats the Democrats want you to
believe that their party is of course
wonderful and fabulous and wants to help
to save the world all the rest of us and
they want you to believe that the only
problem with the American political
system is the Republicans and more
importantly the corruption of the
American political system and the
Republicans by the Russians this of
course would be the most horrible thing
that could come from the current
political situation because if we allow
the Democratic Party to convince anybody
ridiculously they even convince
themselves that the primary issue of the
American political process is Donald
Trump of the Republicans that validates
their capacity to sustain themselves in
a disgusting and corrupt fashion the
reality is the only reason we have
Donald Trump as our president and these
horrendous Republicans is because of the
unadulterated failure and corruption in
the Democratic Party think about how bad
how unappealing how offensive Barack
Obama and ultimately Hillary Clinton had
to be to the American population in
order for them to even remotely begin to
choose someone like Donald Trump as a
better alternative think about how bad
people have to view the level of
corruption in the Democratic Party to
think of Donald Trump as a remotely
preferable alternative Donald Trump is
terrible the Republicans are offensive
beyond comprehension but the solution is
not the Democrats the solution is a
final terminal bypass of these to
utterly corrupt political parties
we got we you guys really want a third
party right
[Music]
yeah what the right it's time right
you guys want Bernie to start it right
I don't that's why I want him on the
goddamn showing and but here you want to
know who to get mad at about the Supreme
Court Democrats regret not fighting
harder for Obama Supreme Court for
really
you think you mean fighting harder you
mean like fighting at all because you
talk I do anything maybe maybe maybe you
should have nominated a more uninspiring
 choice more of a centrist thrill
the road dick and nobody wanted to fight
for but it'd be if you would have
nominated the if maybe Cornel West or
somebody like that maybe people would
have why is it the right wing gets to
have cretins like Antonin Scalia and
while we get is nothing we can
nothing we get Merrick Garland's we get
centrists I want some I want Medea
Benjamin on the Supreme Court
I want Cornel West on the Supreme Court
I want to be in the Supreme Court
I would that place up
I'd be asking a lot of questions
I'm gonna take judge Thomas's time he's
gaming it to me
so here is here's the Huffington Post
article it says we should have shut down
the Senate said senator Brian Shaw a
Democrat said Tuesday we made a
calculation that we were going to win in
2016 an election and confirm a nominee
it didn't work out so I don't know when
I read that doesn't it make you
more even angrier at the Democrats
listen to make you even angry at those
 who try to shame progressives
for not supporting hey
why don't you support the people who
don't fight for the they're
supposed to fight for why don't
you vote for them harder
here's another one hindsight is
twenty-twenty said senator Maron Martin
Heinrich a Democrat from New Mexico I
think I would have liked us to take an
even harder line didn't take you didn't
even take a line
you took the squiggly parentheses
nothing they did nothing could do
nothing they got back nothing and then
they act like boy we should have done
part of nothing well we should have did
nothing harder yeah instead of a hundred
percent of nothing we should have
probably done about nine percent of
nothing that would have really helped it
turn the tables the issue was
frankly with Garlin himself he was too
moderate and too boring for some and he
didn't excite progressives there are
options to pick someone that the base
would have been mobilized to support
because of who they were and who they
were how they were what they represented
for the courts that Heidi has a
co-director of the progressive group
credo action garland felt like a pick to
play chess with Republicans that didn't
work because they don't play
respectability in civility obviously
this man is qualified so we're not going
to block him the Democrats were hoping
Chris Kane who worked in Obama's White
House for six years and played a central
role in getting his judicial nominee
confirmed said there's no question
Democrats could have done more to push
Garland's nomination
even if they had limited options in the
minority yeah then why does it anybody
ever say that in public and why
is that I have to search around
Huffington Post to find these guys no
one ever hears this ever ever why
does it Andy Richter it hey Andy if
you're really sorry
what are you tweet at the
Democratic Party why don't you get
pissed off at them if you're really
sorry why don't you hold the
