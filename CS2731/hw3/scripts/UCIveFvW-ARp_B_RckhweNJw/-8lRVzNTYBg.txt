g morgan junior what's the wine of the
day we got t-vine mix blacks
is it t or is it wine next blacks is it
t or t
vine see this is why people think you're
affected uh
question of the day it was special so
we'll be talking later about today's
leftist hate mob i know
that every time we use the word mob the
hajj ones get jumping
see uh
do you think the heads of dnc the media
are just blatantly encouraging
endorsing mob rule now or are you still
like in the woods boom
bertie's man camp is it really any
equivalency at this point genuinely
i want to know uh what are we that later
you guys have been pretty safe though
yeah yeah everywhere you go what's funny
is you know if i get recognized
it's like either people really like me
or hate me with you guys sometimes it's
just a novelty because you're like oh
two black twins
tacos and i remember the one guy was a
real fan he was like oh man mentioned
specific and then a girl was just like
oh i know you
yeah it's always that uh expression yeah
the cream pie twins
no no no no no double maintenance sounds
censored right off the bat but the guy
was a big fan i remember what he
referenced
okay listen leading the news um
president trump's meeting with kanye
west
didn't exactly go as planned uh
this comes from the hill possibly the
best quote ever that we've had in this
show
the rap star launched into a monologue
touching on mental health the prison
system
and improving life for african-americans
in inner cities you need it really was a
breakdown
if you watch the monologue it's a shame
too the two have actually been really
excited about the
white house sleepover for some time now
la
la la wait till i see kanye tonight
i had a dream of a sleepover with donald
watch netflix maybe eat some tacos
he told me he was gonna be so dope
though me
grabbing entrance by the truth i wish
everybody chill man i ain't one of the
clintons i ain't have nobody killed man
i pissed pelosi off of funsies make
america great in our onesies
i don't know what happened there exactly
it seems like you know what if that's
what it seems like it makes sense that
they
they they went off the rails in a pod
right i love how when when they were
inviting him over to like they're gonna
talk about manufacturing resurgence
violence
and prisons and i'm like you through
manufacturing resurgence yeah
and not talk about violence in prison
exactly really kanye knows a lot about
manufacturing i want popcorn with your
white popcorn
yeah just passionate every time
last name corn first name pop cut okay
was that good my toronto friends
[Laughter]
gosh drake buttersoft from toronto was
he the sprite guy that you used to
in the movie yeah yeah yeah oh my god
the whitest way to know him was that the
sprite guy hey was that the guy selling
the soda pop
all right another trump news alec
baldwin claims that ever since he's
played trump black people
love me his direct quote here's another
direction he says i think it's because
they're most afraid of trump
i'm not going to paint every
african-american person with the same
brush and then he does
but a significant number of them are
sitting there going this is going to be
bad for black folks
um funny enough i like baldwin for his
voicemails i don't give a damn that
you're 12 years old whether you're a
child
whether your mother is a thoughtless
pain in the ass who doesn't care about
what you do as far as i'm concerned
you have humiliated me for the last time
of this phone
i you know what's funny is he blames the
daughters
for homage i mean that's really not fair
i get the daughters of pain in the ass
but yeah
and your mom's a why do you gotta
throw that in there
you know apparently rating a 12 year old
since playing trump black people love
him hodge twins
i don't think so i think it's just
because he's cooning
wait how does a white guy do this wait
what yeah he's the first man he's just
it's amazing white people are cooling
for black folks now
i got bad news yeah black people
don't like you man they're not big fans
of
reruns of 30 rock that's not that's not
yeah a lot of people don't like donald
trump because these are
because they're racist black people are
racist
they don't like your white ass knees but
you get but you guys did say you did
tell me that that
some black people are afraid of trump
you thought nah
they just they just don't understand
them they don't understand he's missing
i don't think they really care about him
or politics no it's the economy right
i mean would you say that's true like if
they're doing well they're going to be
like i don't care wait a while
wait a while oh come on it really it
really depends on how
um cnn proceeds everything and that's
what also yeah
okay the sources are bad it's not their
fault i didn't really think that black
people were watching cnn
yeah that's who's watching the black
folks mama used to watch it all the time
really yeah she'll watch that andy
griffith will come on
and then she look at red fox and then
re-wrap it in son yeah
that's when you guys leave just like
every stereotype possibly
i'm watching jefferson's then you leave
and she goes
here's another what about uh how local
government works for you the houston
city council actually found a new
loophole to prevent a sex
robot brothel from dangerous so let me
explain this too because the story might
seem a little tough
the city council actually expanded its
definition of an arcade device
okay which are already barred from
operating within 1500 feet of churches
schools daycares parks residential
neighborhoods
so let me clarify this they're actually
they're classifying creepy sex
robots as arcade machines now because
those
are apparently easier to regulate oh man
you can crack down those which makes
sense actually given when you consider
what some people do with the uh with
their
well hey there you go hey come on get
out of come on
every day at least twice i've been sex
with eight machines
i want to go play that's the last time
that's the last time
those things look so you said that last
time that's the last time we let him
have sex with our arcade machine
did you guys ever play the hot shot like
the basketball hot shot deal in the
arcades but get those games i want to
play the game he was yeah exactly
my time apparently was misplaced i was
really good at that i should have been
good at the other games also is it odd
that uh
i have a walther on the desk but use a
2x4 with nails no because i'm not the
liability i don't want to lose them as a
sponsor
oh speaking of city councils things
doing that they're doing weird stuff uh
detroit now
is there areas of detroit being
designated as no spanking zones
this comes from detroit yeah they passed
a resolution to discourage corporal
punishment
that makes sense by creating hit free
zones in at least 10
public areas with signs that actually
specify that so
good to see detroit on on track towards
solutions yeah
hey how about not disciplining your
children
no shooting stones on the right track
was it yeah it's no shooting zones
that would be great right yeah that's
what i would have came up with but i
don't know here's
here how about this detroit no spain if
you have a dad take it as a win
let's go with that let's not get picky
at this point all right detroit like
maybe he has a couple too many comes
home starts swat that's fine
he's you're lucky to have him in your
life
we need more consequences not less
consequences in these situations beat
tan their hide you guys got weapons
lord you are so uncomfortable around
black people what did i say
you guys got whoopings right didn't
y'all get weapons
he starts talking like steve harvey i
wouldn't call them weapons that was his
beatings
straight lashes see i wasn't trying to
say that
but you did daddy give us lashes
yeah yeah oh yeah did they got the belt
make you go get your own switch oh the
switch
every time i try to defend you from
gerald's sort of assuming something that
stereotype that's right
you fulfill it i remember one day these
little kids was throwing rocks at cars
and we hit this guy's car nut it was a
white man
he was pissed he goes
and talks to my daddy i'm running away
from daddy for like days he finally got
us
oh my god he said i'm going to kill you
boy two states away
he beat us back he beat us real bad i
blacked out man woke up he was still
hitting me
i learned a valuable lesson though don't
throw rocks at cars no don't throw rocks
at a white man's car
no don't get caught throwing rocks at
cars thank you a real lesson
yeah god you know what i did the exact
same thing
except it was a pudding packs well
that's funny i used to love them lobbed
them from
atop the bridge yeah one time a bus
driver got out and kicked my friend's
ass
he stopped his route he just stopped he
came out
before a song there's a french canadian
[Music]
i understand
true story that's awesome uh hey by the
way did everyone know that it was
national coming out day oh
today my day if you've been if you've
been anywhere is this
that that makes sense i'm engaged to a
woman
now it makes sense what's the emphasis
he's queer as folk as ron paul puts it
yeah i'm coming out i'm transracial
i'm going about a white man crept in the
nigga's body
so how does that even happen well rachel
she paved the way for a lot of stuff
she did trendsetters did you watch that
the documentary that rachel dolezal
documented oh man i got to catch that
one
one beer by the way my eyes are up here
they're looking at the camera
like dustin hoffman and hook with the
clocks they're like
i can't handle it so national coming out
there was trending everywhere and
celebrate of course facebook unveiled a
new
coming out feature coming out feature i
think was a came out fishing
it was hard to read from the headlines
so let me read exactly this comes from
mdc
for the lgbtq community facebook is a
way for you to come out
oh good visibility is so important
because it changes hearts and minds
about being lgbtq
when friends and family see us living
our true selves so actually here's a
look at uh one of the coming out
features they're uh their emojis
okay which makes sense but facebook went
a step further in an ill-advised spirit
of balanced
uh unfortunately simultaneously
unveiling the drag them behind a truck
feature which was not received very
well oh dear god yeah that was um by the
way just for
you know we obviously we use a joke
because you know why not but uh
it's only happened a handful of times
gave you being dried behind a truck
when people talk about hangings
lynchings those those happened all the
time yeah right
yeah the gays behind the truck it was
like twice it was like at a m in one
other time
and the one it was just a gay guy roller
it was a fish tailing accident
how did this turn into a hate crime i
didn't know she was lesbian
i wouldn't have done it just trying to
have fun that was it was it was an
accident now the
it happened the other time it was pretty
homophobic they knew what they were
doing yeah
there were no rollerblades involved
a time to kill you she's that that movie
is rough
you're seeing free carly what freak time
to kill
they're with me you're not with me i
just literally picked up on the one
thing where you could have an excuse to
do a black voice with black people in
the studio was that black boys yeah
yeah that's what happened it was like
fruit
freaking i was doing it like a mob
chance yeah yeah yeah
this is why black people don't become
republican some because of the idea is
because people like you
hey listen hodge twins i'm so glad to
see some black twins tell the truth for
once
we're gonna go have a beer after this
and you're not invited i mean that in a
good way you can't not unless you want
them vomiting in the kitchen so you're
gonna have a 40 that's what you want to
say
no i said a beer i don't think you'd be
capable of a 40
yeah i don't think so neither 40s are
banned you know why they were used as
weapons
what did you know that's not yeah girthy
yeah we were trying to get a 40 at one
point
this was in missouri anyways and these
the the clerk said no they're banned
because people would take them
drink them and then break them and stab
the next guy for the rest of his 40.
blame the black people that's the black
people started that right
oh second i didn't mention d c no hold
on they copy paste that
that's what we call projecting because i
didn't say black anything
i did you did you did yeah it's him only
black people drink forties because there
was an ad once with billy dee williams
you guys need to you know what are you
you're caught in chaffed billy dee
williams what's happening
coat 45 does it every time
you see those commercials you just did
it again i did chris rock what
not rocco what's his name now he's just
picking random black guys little black
billy williams chris rock uh martin
luther king i don't know
it was like a movie no looking like i
like denzel washington
he's a good actor isn't he boys
i'm uncomfortable for you you i think
you doth protest too
finally and then we have another story
to get to before we get to the leftist
mob and uh this never happens news five
girls falsely accused a man of a
sexual assault boy really just because i
didn't like him never yeah what
yeah the actual story the boy's parents
say he was forced to endure the loss of
his liberty and other damages
