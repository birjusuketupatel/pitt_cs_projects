jared everybody he's here
so hold on a second before i move on oh
damn it some of you have seen my binder
but don't ruin it for the people behind
you
this is our first time doing a change my
mind live broadcast
anyone know the topic of tonight it's a
new topic we've never done this before
can we unravel this and show it to the
crowd before we get on the table
all right let's get out and show it to
the crowd of course anyone is welcome it
is
[Applause]
cheers people socialism is evil
what do you have to say about you guys
thank you so much
this is not the show we planned on doing
we anyone here see the smu show last
week
how ridiculous was anyone want a show
like that yeah
well we couldn't because your uh your
campus officers
actually wouldn't show up so hold on a
second there's one who did show up today
there's one who showed up let's give it
up for officers still uh sillerson
one who showed up and uh there are some
private security details out here who
are off-duty officers and just so you
know the same lieutenant who told them
that noah would show up because there
was no credible threat told these
off-duty officers you can't carry on
campus
well he called someone above the
lieutenant's head and he said what that
guy what's he do
you carry and i quote you carry your
 gun
[Applause]
and a lot of them are amongst you who
you do not know um
so thank you so much there was a mix-up
obviously we couldn't get out here and
do the show that we want to do it's
going to be kick-ass we wanted to do
this whole like smu
but instead we loaded all of our misfits
into a bus
and shipped them across country against
their will gross violation of labor laws
we said we can't do the big comedy show
we'll come back and do it but we can do
one hell of a change my mind cause all
we need is a table some coffee and some
good conversation are we right
right huh
thank you guys and one guy just yelled
and weed what was that and a pin
all right first off i can't see while
i'm in here is there anyone out there
who disagrees and would like to change
my mind on the idea that's the premise
that socialism is evil
okay now by the way okay we see one
person all right let's uh let's bring
one person in to start
hold on one second hold on no no no hold
on hold on hold on
we got to pick one person there's two
hands going up are you an actual
are you okay one second here one second
one second all right and this is why
this is why we had to downscale this but
by the way i appreciate
we actually have the ability to see any
leftist organization in the country
and how many people show up and just so
you know every time there's an antifa
protest
unless they're stabbing ben shapiro with
an axe pick uh every time there's an
antifa protest or occupy and they post
something
we can actually say that on average
about eight percent of people who claim
they'll be attending attend
whereas here this is the last minute
there was a cancellation we said hey
guys we're gonna be in the quad
and i think it's actually two to three
times the number of people who said they
were coming so you guys actually show up
and i know that's hard because many of
you have jobs so um
so that's we're gonna be talking about
tonight for those who don't know this
isn't a comedy show
i know some people were saying well why
don't you come here and do a lecture be
like having alice cooper play
jazz piano at carnegie hall i don't do
lectures it's not fun
but with this the goal here is not to by
the way just to argue it's not ad
hominem it's the opposite of cable news
if someone disagrees with me i want to
sit down and we use a credit method to
rationalize their position now i know a
lot of you won't be able to see me or
hear me so i wouldn't blame you if you
walk out like i said this was last
minute planned we appreciate every one
of you who is here
but i would love to sit down with
someone who disagrees with me and
everyone here by the way i know how high
energy you are
but make sure you give respect to anyone
who sits down and disagrees and give
them the chance to make their argument
so hopefully we can be productive not
get jared uh who do we want who do we
want to grab who's grabbing who
people keep saying messenger bag so mr
messenger bag hold on one second come on
out one second come here come toward me
we're gonna have someone pat you down
real quick
got one person who can pat him down not
gay jared there you go
i fulfilled my legal obligations
all right listen what's your name sarah
ian ian in brass balls come sit down
appreciate it give me your out of the
hand
[Music]
a round of a hand i don't even know what
that means all right
what was that actually by the way
by the way because i know many of you
here are still reeling from your
rejections from northwestern
um oh
don't insult or ban up come on that's
asking a sparrow not to sing
urbana champagne as we call it the gates
of hell
you're like detroit without the balls to
follow through all right
we're kidding but depaul actually has
rescinded their decision and we will be
going to depaul
sometime next semester and i'm kidding
urbana's the best city in america all
right
so i believe hopefully people can hear
me we're just going to sit down and and
go through this
point by point to see where we find
common ground uh it's the first time
we've ever broadcast it live a lot of
people say well we think maybe you edit
it
or hand pick opponents hey can not can
someone actually grab some water here
and give him a closed bottle so that you
know he doesn't uh
accuse us of opponents it is a really
nice moment they ordered mine like
four weeks wait you ordered one yeah
what that means you're a fan you can't
come up here no
no no i still have thoughts no you still
have thoughts no get out of here we have
to have someone else who disagrees
you can't be a fan who here actually
disagrees with me i appreciate it i
appreciate it brother
afterwards not evil though it's not it
is evil you this guy seems to be really
eager or this guy in the orange
all right
okay well let's bring up the guy in the
orange sorry
i know i know but listen we didn't plan
on this we have no idea we usually just
show up and do it and people want us
to get out what's your name sir alex
alex are you holding up did you go here
uh no i go to urbana high school oh alex
we got we can't do
hold on a second hold on a second if i
if i do this with a high school student
next thing that's going to happen is
they're going to laura ingram me and say
that i mocked someone who's not of age
are you 18 your parents have to give you
permission i can't i can't actually film
you i appreciate it alex i'm sorry
this guy come on let's bring this guy up
here i'm so sorry this is the process
we don't want to break the law
because we only have one officer who
showed up because that's all you need
for a crowd like this
all right what is your name sir yousef
yousef nice to meet you steven
so i believe let me explain my position
i believe that socialism
is fundamentally uh evil and i have this
here we usually don't reference this but
it's sources in case someone wants to
look at them afterward but
i don't think i won't use it it's not
fair for me to use them so i believe
socialism
is evil you disagree i would love to
hear you change my mind okay well what's
your position on the minimum wage
hold on a second uh is this your this is
you're changing my mind i want to make
sure yes i want to get started okay my
position the minimum wage yeah
uh you know what uh i'm not a fan so you
think there shouldn't be any minimum
wage at all
not a fan okay are you against illegal
immigration and legal immigration from
poor third world countries
at the scale that we've been having it
so far oh yeah
am i against illegal immigration the
answer what was that
but we're gonna do everything we can
like we said this is last minute because
uh
we're not necessarily friendly here uh
i'm again no i mean
they don't consider us friendly so like
i said we appreciate you supporting us
of course i'm against illegal
immigration but
again socialism i believe the idea of
socialism let's do this before we go on
okay
cause this is something and that's i
think this is important this is
something we often see from both the
right and the left
see we started with the premise where i
made a statement socialism is evil
right and you've moved on to different
questions different topics so i'd like
to first before we move on if you
if if it's okay let's define socialism
okay
how do you define socialism so i know
that we're agreeing on
on that premise socialism is a system in
which the state
redistributes wealth uh from what it
would be under a pure capitalist system
okay i think we agree on that okay and
then i think it's important
but don't give up this is just an actual
discussion i might be wrong here
um and what it what do you think i mean
by evil or what would we both agree
the definition of evil is harmful to
society
not necessarily to society i believe
morally reprehensible it's immoral okay
so so as we both agreed socialism is
basically a collective a governmental
control
of the distribution or product means of
distribution or production
and when i say evil i mean i believe
that that is immoral
so can we both agree with that i don't
agree that it's evil no no but we agree
you agree that's what i'm saying that's
my position yes okay so what part of my
position
do you disagree with again the goal here
is to change my mind not score points
well i'm trying to convince you that
your own objectives if you're a
conservative
cannot be achieved under capitalism okay
and so i'll give you an example of that
yeah um you have a lot of republicans
like paul ryan who are obstructing
donald trump
well hold on hold on
you cannot deny that he is a big
capitalist and he has lots of capitalist
donors that would like nothing more than
to increase their profits i think you
can agree with that
and people like that have been opposing
immigration reform for decades
because they believe that mass
immigration will lower the wages of the
working class
and increase their profits now i would
say a lot of what you just said is
correct
okay and that many uh conservatives
republicans believe
that mass immigration from countries
like say mexico
from quote-unquote third world countries
could lower the wages yeah i do believe
that a lot of republicans believe that
okay so i would agree with you on that
so if you impose a minimum wage you're
not going to have this mass immigration
coming in because the companies that are
taking these illegal immigrants and
taking these low-wage immigrants if they
had to pay them 15
an hour we wouldn't have mass
immigration like we're having right now
yeah i don't necessarily know that i
agree with that premise so let me kind
of go um
because first off before i would like to
take that hold it
what example we point to before we go on
because i know a lot of times i disagree
of a successful socialist country
well there are different kinds of
socialism i think you're thinking of the
soviet union in venezuela when you say
these are unsuccessful countries
but you also have sweden you have norway
you have finland you have denmark of
germany
these are countries that have robust
economies and high levels of
socialization
right uh what's their minimum wage
i don't have the numbers off the top of
my head what if i told you that they
have no minimum wage
there are plenty of countries at a high
minimum wage australia has a high
minimum wage i know but we didn't talk
about them we talked about
successful socialist economies now first
off i think it's interesting
this is important because we need to
find the premise first off we're away
from the premise which is the moral
argument
i believe socialism is immoral the
redistribution of something that you
have not earned
i believe is fundamentally immoral i
believe that's theft are you an anarchy
hold on a second hold on a second
then we'll go in so now we moved on from
that to the pragmatic and no i'm not an
anarchist
um and then you brought up some
successful examples in denmark norway
sweden i believe first off these aren't
socialist countries now the reason we
would point to countries like say
venezuela or cuba
for the same reason bernie sanders did
for decades is because they're true
examples of socialism
uh the danish prime minister said bernie
stop referring to us as a socialist
economy we're a free market economy
they don't have a minimum wage as we
know it they only allow collective
bargaining between unions
higher skilled unions and those who
their employers
so these are countries by the way if you
want to get into their immigration laws
the only way to make it work if you
refer to those countries i mean i guess
i would have to ask it sounds almost as
though you're making an argument are you
uh
are you a nationalist i would say i'm an
economic nationalist
you are an economic nationalist okay so
there goes you part ways with a lot of
probably your your more left-leaning
brethren
i never said i was a liberal okay so
you're a conservative socialist
they're they're hard to come back
so no minimum wage there but again this
doesn't change the idea let's get to the
fundamental premise yeah before we move
on to the pragmatic and i'd be happy to
but i believe that socialism the ism
that we both agreed upon
the collective means seizing of
distribution production
um is immoral well i mean the argument
is absurd because if you say that it's
immoral then you also have to say that
government funding of police is a moral
government funding of the military is
immoral anything the government does is
immoral and that's ridiculous because
you have to have some state that's going
to
socialize certain things and so the
question is not do we have socialization
it's how much
sure um i would disagree with that now
would you would you know where i
disagree with that
guess what i'm going to say i assume
you're going to try to argue that
government funding of the military and
police is not socialism
why would i say that uh well because if
you don't argue that then you're going
to have to give some ground
on socialism no absolutely i think
you're right if i if i have to concede
that
police force as he's saying police force
military
roads is socialism the same as health
care
education and i'm assuming that's why
you're referring to denmark and sweden
they're not socialist economies but they
have more of a social safety net
that's kind of what you're talking about
right yeah they're social democracies
they're well they're they're market
economies with
higher emphasis on a social safety net
that's how they describe that's what a
social democracy is
so so okay we agree on the term let's go
with social democracy i just want to
make sure we don't get confused like
democratic socialism so that changes
anything
but um we just talked about this uh
conceding that ground i don't believe
that the military
and the police force would be the same
as
socialized healthcare school why not
sorry because we only have one
microphone we had to do a late set up i
appreciate you working with me
well i mean why not why not was your
question our definition was so why not
yeah
okay so make sure you don't um why not
because there's a difference between a
public good
and a commodity can you explain to me
the difference between public goods and
a commodity
well in economics a public good is uh a
good that is i believe non-excludable
and non-rivalrous
so exactly so that would include things
like
the police the military you'd be
hard-pressed to even find hardcore
libertarians to say that we don't need
those
so there's a big difference there's a
fundamental difference between that
and something like healthcare or school
it's still or it goes to
