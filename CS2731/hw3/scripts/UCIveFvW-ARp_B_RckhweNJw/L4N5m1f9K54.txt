something that's really been uh pivotal
to this team
jacob thank you for being on the show
sir thanks for having me on
i well i'm very glad to have you on
you're an intimidating character so i
hope this goes well and i get on your
good side
um for those who haven't yet read the
book yet to be determined
yes to be determined and usually it
doesn't bode well for me
um for those who haven't yet read the
book uh meaning people not in a lot of
crowded company and i highly recommend
it can you can can you help them
understand define what extreme ownership
means
yeah so extreme ownership is the
attitude
it's the mindset that you're not going
to blame anyone else or anything else
when something goes wrong you're
actually going to take
ownership of whatever that problem is
and you're going to get that problem
fixed
and i know it sounds relatively simple
but it's actually pretty hard for people
to do
so why do you think it is hard for
people to do like what would be some
prime examples of that for people you
know
not the navy seal crowd more so the
stay-at-home crowd
well one of the hardest things about
taking ownership
when things go wrong is you have an ego
and you don't want to admit that
something is your fault and what you'd
rather do
as a human being is just blame other
people or blame the circumstances or
blame the market
or blame anything else yeah and when
when all you do is sit around and blame
other people and other things then guess
what that problem doesn't go away
it just usually gets worse right so
that's the that's the idea of extreme
ownership there's something going wrong
i'm going to take ownership it's my
responsibility i'm gonna get it fixed
and even the truth is and i think you
talk about this in the book sometimes it
is somebody else's fault but it doesn't
help you because you can't control them
and you talk about ego quite a bit and
funny thing is i i actually came to know
you
through some interviews about brazilian
jiu jitsu i don't know how i stumbled
across you but you were talking about
sort of combat arts
versus some of the uh i guess shall we
say less effective martial arts but it
was very respectful but i could read
between the lines
um you talk quite a bit about ego when
you discuss the combat sports side and
we've had
joe rogan on daniel cormier just last
week
tim kennedy they talk a lot about how
ego clouds it destroys can you
define that a little more clearly for
people who may not know when you're
talking about ego and how to avoid that
specifically
yeah well the problem with ego is if
you've got a big ego
and and i'm not talking about having no
ego because if you have ego if you're
daniel cormier
you got to think that you're going to be
the champion you've got to think you
have to believe that you can make it
happen
but you have to counter that with some
level of humility
where you say you know what i'm not the
best in the world i'm the the person
that i'm gonna be fighting
is gonna be awesome and i've gotta be at
my best game so what does that
mean that means i have to train hard
that
i means to do everything in my power to
be ready for this fight if people lack
humility
then they say oh i don't need to train
hard because i'll be able to i'll be
able to beat this guy anyways and then
guess what they get beat
yeah it happens all the time we had
george champion the show and he talked
about how he was terrified before every
fight and daniel cormier said that in
his mind
he was going through excuses right
before miocic of why he should lose that
fight you know
he's 255 pounds i'm really a
middleweight he said that he was very
candid on the show
which is something else that i noticed
with really successful people having
been blessed enough to interview people
at the top of their field
once they get there they tend to be
candid you have the exceptions to the
rule
but they tend to be transparent because
i don't know that they have a lot of
time
not to be um let me ask you this how do
you differentiate then this is a tough
question we've talked about this on the
program
how to differentiate between ego and a
realistic assessment of your abilities
particularly if you have abilities that
are greater than average
well i'll tell you right now most people
that are that end up in a position where
they're greater than average
they're not sitting around saying oh i'm
the bra i'm the greatest in the world
they're like daniel cormier saying you
know what i could i could lose this
fight they're like george st
pierre paranoid and scared before every
fight the guys that think they're just
gonna win every single fight
they're they're they're the ones that
end up getting caught earlier in their
career and even somebody that comes
across
as having a massive ego like like conor
mcgregor
if you watch how conor mcgregor uh
actually trains yeah he's training
like he wants to be the best he knows
he's got weaknesses
in his game and he steps up to cover
those weaknesses yeah there's a
difference between
selling fights and you know your
lifestyle uh
let me ask you this where do you think
the line is between you kind of
mentioned like george st
pierre fear almost a little bit of
paranoia where's the line especially as
someone who's in the military
and obviously you're afraid when you're
going into a firefight and you could die
where's the line between fear paranoia
and using it so it's productive
so there's there's definitely a
difference between fear and respect
and i i wasn't afraid of the enemy but i
respected the enemy and i realized that
they could do some things that could
surprise us and catch us off guard
and that's something you have to deal
with if you don't respect the enemy
which i guess you know if you're not
afraid of the enemy at all if you don't
if you just think you can dominate the
enemy
well then you start cutting quarters you
don't train as hard you don't prepare as
much when you do that you're going to
lose
yeah you see that with almost every
great fighter right the tail end of
their career isn't usually their age
you look at guys like mike tyson the
tail end of their careers usually they
just they get complacent
um i think a lot of people miss it they
think oh he got old and you look at me
like well actually
he was 35 he was 35 at this point not
mike tyson specifically but it happens a
lot and they just get to you know get to
a point it's i think it was jeff danaher
who said
it's hard to get out of bed at six in
the morning when you're getting out of
silk sheets
i'm like oh okay that that sort of
crystallizes that perfectly
um now the same thing happens to
businesses too you know businesses that
you know because we work with businesses
all the time and
as the business grows and they start to
feel like oh
we're going to crush the competition the
competition can't touch us and then the
next thing you know there's someone
that's younger some business than some
company that's smaller and they're
younger and they're hungrier
and they're working their tails off yeah
if you're sitting on the top of the hill
you don't think you need to work anymore
next thing you know you're getting eaten
yeah it's it's a good point it's
happened right now with late night you
know great example you've seen these
late night wars and people become so
complacent just take their audience for
granted
and then all of a sudden it fractures
and uh we draft in right behind them we
have no business doing it but
we're doing okay and i think that's
actually a big difference between a job
in the military and employees who often
might read this book in the civilian
workforce is um the ability
to ignore something if it's not on your
item list right you see that a lot if
it's not my job description well
it's not my fault whereas in special
forces in the military if you do that
you
you could die and i know you talk about
primarily leading by example
and taking active ownership and
consequences with action so how do you
balance
leading by example what you're talking
about taking extreme ownership
um being assertive with hierarchy and
respecting leadership because the two
are both they're both important
yeah they're both important and for one
thing you know when people talk about
the military and you think oh
well i was in the seal team so every
seal is just we're gonna take ownership
of everything and and
they're going to they're never going to
say that's not my job and that's
actually wrong
it's wrong across every group of human
beings in the world
they're all human beings first and
foremost and there's people that are
you know in the seal teams in special
operations in the military in general
there's a bell curve and there's some
people at the high end of the bell curve
that work really hard and are really
gifted
and they go out and kick ass and there's
some people at the bottom of the bell
curve and
they're trying to skate by and see what
they can get away with and then there's
a bunch of people in the middle
in various various degrees that that
fall out somewhere on that spectrum
so even in the military it's not like oh
you just do what i tell you that's what
you need to do is just do what i tell
you
um there's there's just they're people
and so whether you're in the military or
whether you're in the civilian sector
you've got to as a leader you've got to
recognize that you're going to have some
people that are going to be going really
hard and it's great to have
those people but there's also going to
be some people that are going to have to
drag along a little bit
and obviously there's some people that
you have to drag along so much that you
can't drag them along anymore and
they're starting to drag you backwards
and when that happens in the civilian
sector that means you know you're
probably going to have to
get rid of them in the military it means
you're going to have to get rid of them
this is actor of course as a leader
you've done everything you can to try
and coach them and try and mentor them
and try and get them up to speed
so you know leadership is leadership
regardless of where you are whether
you're in the military working with an
elite group or whether you're in the
civilian sector
it's leadership principles stay the same
yeah that's a good point and um
i think that's actually a really
important point i had a friend who was
in the marines and obviously some
friends
were in the uh the army rangers and they
said yeah you know it's it's not exactly
what you think it does we're not a
monolith and one of them actually told
me who was a i think a former
navy seat from a long time ago and he
said back then he said we didn't spend
much time on hand i can't hand combat
everyone thinks i can kill you five ways
to sunday he said
i learned taekwondo with a 50 pound
backpack he's like i didn't learn how to
fight i learned how to shoot
and i appreciate it again that kander
was oh okay and then afterwards it
became a brazilian jitsu black belt
after the military
um early on in the book you detail um
a story from iraq in which friendly fire
occurred
tough story to read about for people who
end up reading the book highly recommend
it again it's called
extreme ownership i think it's available
everywhere books are sold and probably
audiobook
uh i don't know if we can get andrew
clavin to do an audio book on that that
would be
it would be soothing it would it would
just smooth over the rough parts but as
i did i did the i did the audiobook
myself and late baby we did the
audiobook so
i i assume that you did but the really
intense parts andrew clavin has a voice
that's just
it would make it sound soothing enemy
fire and you're like oh wow this isn't
so it doesn't sound half bad
so this was a friendly friendly fire
incident and as a commander in charge
you did something that a lot of people
wouldn't
um you came forward and took full
responsibility
for the situation which to me was very
striking why'd you do that jacko
well it was it was a tough thing it was
a tough thing to come to as a tough
thought in my head and as i talked about
in the book
as i was trying to you know this
horrible situation took place there was
all kinds of people to blame whether
they were
some of my guys some of the soldiers
marines we were working with whether it
was the iraqi soldiers we were working
with we were all working together
and there was plenty of mistakes that
were made and it was definitely
a situation where i could have pointed
the finger at at many different people
and many different
mistakes that were made and as i went
through this because you know my
commanding officer they're doing an
investigation they're trying to figure
out who they're going to blame
right and as as i'm sitting there trying
to figure out who i'm going to blame and
who i'm going to tell my boss oh
you know is this guy's fault i i
couldn't
figure out i couldn't figure out who i
should be blaming for this and there's a
reason why i couldn't figure out who to
blame
because as i sat there and grilled over
in my mind i realized that there was
one person and one person only to blame
and that person was me i was the
commander
i'm over all in charge of the mission
and
if something isn't done right that's my
fault it's my responsibility
and that's what i did i went in before
my commanding officer and before my
troops and said
hey guys this was my fault and and
here's the important part
or the other important part is this is
my fault and this is what i'm going to
do to fix it
so a lot of people once they read the
book they say well if i take if i take
ownership of something then it just
disappears but and that's not true
either but if you say
yeah that was my fault and then everyone
was like oh okay great it was his fault
now we can move on
no actually that doesn't fix the problem
right you have to actually take
ownership of the problem then you have
to take ownership of figuring out what
the solution is
then you have to take ownership of
implementing the solution so the problem
doesn't occur again
so it's it's not as easy as taking
extreme ownership but the first step
is definitely a challenging one and
again goes back to ego
for me i had been in for you know 15 or
16 years at the time
and you know i had a good reputation as
a seal and i've done a good job
and i've been to combat and all of a
sudden i'm saying hey this horrible
thing happened which
in my opinion a fracture side a friendly
fire incident is about the worst thing
you can have happen
and for me it was a real blow to my ego
to step up and say hey this was my fault
i'm not going to blame anyone else but
at the same
and there's one piece of it where in
in in a leader's mind they think oh well
if i take the blame for this everyone's
going to look down on me and they're
going to lose respect for me right
but the the opposite is actually true
when a leader says hey look
here's what i did wrong these are the
mistakes i made and this is what i'm
going to do to fix it
people actually gain respect for you
because they really realize that you're
not going to shirk your responsibilities
well i think maybe that brings us back
to a point you were talking about before
were there some people who might need a
little bit of of prodding along dragging
along
and there are some people who you just
can't drag necessarily anymore so i
think at that point the people who can
be
developed they'll respect you more but
like you said the people who might just
have to be let go regardless
it may fall on deaf ears and that's a
skill in leadership that you also have
to be able to determine you know the
people whose minds you can change the
people who you can lead and
