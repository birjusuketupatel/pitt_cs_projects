they wanna you wanna hug you wanna hurt
yourself i'm not a republican
i'm republican and uncle sam hog
time for another edition of change my
mind where we sit down for hopefully
productive conversations on
controversial topics and uh hear from
you in the comments section
now sometimes it's hard to find voices
of opposition willing to engage in
conversations so
this week we reserved a booth at the
texas state democratic convention
and that sets the stage for this
edition's premise america is superior to
all of the countries
changed my mind we also saw some
familiar faces
who became friends and they might
surprise you hey danielle how are you
good to see you good to see you danielle
i don't i don't look as as polished as
you i'll give you that right away i've
already had my chance at your table
i'm going to give others a chance i
appreciate it glad to see you danielle
now
for this topic this isn't just lip
service i genuinely believe the united
states to be the greatest country on
earth
what you're about to see are three
people who tried to change my mind what
was your name
marilyn mays marilyn mays stephen
crowder nice to meet you nice to meet
you stephen so
i just i just want to make sure that
just to recap here i said i believe the
united states is still the greatest
country in the world superior to all
other
countries in my opinion you're welcome
to change my mind and you said
last week maybe but this week an
all-time low what do you mean
this week last last week and even this
week we're at all time low
okay you know i'm just so
exhausted over these children these
toddlers being taken
yeah and i need you to help me
understand
why we would take babies and
toddlers because in the work i do
it looks to me like since the russians
won't give us babies
they're going to take the little
children that just came here and adopt
them out
since the who won't give us babies
russians you know the deal fell through
in trump towers
that's what you think it was about
that's a joke yeah all right well it
matters before we get
because you're obviously aware of
trump's exec trump's executive order now
i am okay so now they're not going to be
separated they're going to be detained
together so is that progress
as of this morning they still are well
yeah it takes a while but
are you happier about that i was i was
really happy about it
and then when i saw the loopholes the
loophole that right after
you know that that last paragraph at the
very end
not paragraph the last phrase at the
very end and i went same stuff different
day
yeah and then melania's jacket
yeah well let me ask you though so this
has been a week that obviously you
disagree with some you know the obama
and clinton policies the flora's
consent policy so your problem isn't
with trump it's with the clintons and
obama's but
um let me ask you this does that change
do you disagree
with the premise that the united states
is the greatest country in the world
that it's superior to all other
countries
or is it just that you're a little worn
down from the newsweek
i think we're falling in stature i think
that i mean we we've been following i've
been upset since g7 okay
i've been falling apart since g7 because
how would we do our allies like that
this man is just
dismantling america the respected we
have
i can remember last year and the year
before born on cruises
and pete just being having them
apologize
for this country i've never had to
apologize for my country
i'm a veteran i don't understand thank
you for your service
and you know it's like i'm up here
having apologize for what
because people say for trump how so
because he's a humiliation he's an
embarrassment he don't know the king's
english
okay he cannot hold a decent
conversation
i don't believe he went to wharton
school of business i think somebody else
took his test
he is ignorant because you know a lot of
people would send folks to take their
tests back in the day
yeah i had a guy who actually he would
do that when he would weigh in for
wrestling practice he had a twin brother
and they would wait he would his brother
would weigh in but let me ask you i get
that you're not a fan of donald trump
and there are a lot of things that i'm
not a fan of is either but
i probably support more policies of his
than you do but not all of them
um but again i want to go back to the
premise today is the united states is
the greatest country in the world
uh what do you apologize people for how
do you believe we're inferior to other
countries or what country do you believe
is better than the united states
i feel like like
great britain and france and canada
i feel like those countries are making
us
i mean are taking the high road and i
feel like
everything i believed in is slipping
away from me
and i've just been distraught these past
two weeks but everything i believed in
when i first fell apart is the night
when i realized about eight o'clock that
evening that trump was gonna win
and i thought okay i'm gonna work with
him you know because he's my
commander-in-chief i'm gonna try to get
with him
i appreciate that but then he just kept
being more and more ignorant man stop
you from
yes really quickly so i don't want to
interrupt but i want to make sure that
we this keeps falling off if you see it
i know this is you don't want to see
what's under here no jawline
um so you mentioned canada britain and
france so you believe they're better
than the united states let me ask you
this you said everything you believe in
is disappearing
uh you're a veteran um did you serve to
protect freedom of speech
i did so what about the fact that those
countries don't have freedom of speech
only the united states does but you know
what
that's not what i see right now you know
you only you only get caught up in what
you see
no no no no no it doesn't matter what
you see as far as when i was there well
no but
we haven't constantly constitutionally
enshrined here in canada
the uk france people are jailed for
speech for offensive things
or fined that doesn't happen in the
united states we have a constitutional
right to freedom of speech they
don't so wouldn't you say that the
united states
certainly as a veteran if you're serving
to protect freedom of speech is superior
to those countries
if only because we're the only country
with freedom of speech but it
why i'm so distraught it looks like
we're getting ready to lose
it i mean anyway he's playing footsie
with with uh
with with kim and putin and you know
applauding kim for wiping out three
generals the day before he came and
you know his people sit up you know when
i see that i get nervous because it
looks like
if nobody puts that dude in check we're
going to lose
everything and it's just i'm just sad
well i understand that you're sad and
i'm sorry
i don't want to see anyone sad that
you're feeling this way but i'm hearing
a lot of how you feel but i don't think
that's really objective reality freedom
of speech is
actually not being eroded here like it
is no not
unless the left unless the democrats
would have their way they support hate
speech laws
republicans are the ones who've defended
against it on campus they're the ones
banning points of view
because they're because they're
connected well you might need to read
some
might need to put some conservative
sites in your bookmarks so you can read
both sides because
i'm an ardent defender of freedom of
speech and as a matter of fact i've had
people try to silence me
people here who for i feel like we've
had a good conversation people
here at this very er this very
convention who threatened to firebomb me
slash my tires
just for me speaking out no because
they're liberals
i'm a liberal i would never do that to
you well then take it up with them
i would never do that to you well thank
you very much see we're more closer
friends than me and then no
yeah i mean i mean i feel like everybody
has a right to say what they want to say
but it's like when you start being
offensive and hurting people
you know that's when i started getting
nervous but but it's still protected
that's why that's why just not in the
country as you mentioned
and so it's like it's like everything i
believed in is slipping but does that
would you say that this is some progress
in our conversation it seems to me i'm
not suggesting all that you're ignorant
i'm canadian so i'm very aware
no but the point is you suggested these
other countries it doesn't seem like you
were totally aware that they don't have
freedom of speech i wasn't
so does that change your opinion no
you'd want to live in a you think a
country with no freedom of speech is
superior to the united states
see that would be just where we disagree
i think they're inferior with no freedom
of speech
i just think that we have a pig for
president and he's making us look bad
all over the world he's ignorant
and i just wish that he would
you know i know he is who he is and he
deserves to be who he is
but it just is so everything that i
thought of that a president ought to be
he's not and he's so rude and crude
around the edges and he's
well i'll tell you what i say this
respectfully because i still respect him
as a president
but for me i mean i felt that way about
president barack obama i felt as though
he didn't think he was born in wherever
that was trump lied about did you
what was that no i don't think he was
born in kenya no no no no no
i just think he was a terrible president
but i respect the office and i think i
respect that you feel that way
to king's english and he knew the law
this dude don't know nothing
i mean he's i don't even think he's a
good businessman yeah bankruptcy
we have record low unemployment record
high job participation
we're doing very well what a wages
they're growing really well we have the
highest
as a matter of fact do you are you
surprised to learn that the united
states has the highest wages in the
world
average income not surprised about that
okay so that's a good thing
about that and that's a very good thing
and i'm happy about that but
my thing is okay trump you didn't marry
american
trump you didn't um um you've got
all those immigrants working for you
most of the people that work for trump
yeah but there's a difference between
legal and illegal immigrants but i know
it but what about americans
i mean you you so pro-american let's
let's see
americans with most of these jobs and i
know it's all these jobs that americans
don't want to do
i know that i get that but it's just
that
i'm just i appreciate you taking that
i'm sorry to see you sad i
was can i give you one piece of advice
don't play so much so much
credence in one man you know i mean
you're you're responsible for your own
happiness it's not the state it's not
the government
do you have a family just destroyed
everything but you have a family
i love my folks you have a good family
yes focus on your family and focus on
your health
i do think even though i didn't like
barack obama i did notice a lot of
people right were so miserable and i
thought everything was over listen
it's one man we have safeguards in this
country
it's one man in the freedom caucus but
my point is you can still choose to be
happy i don't hate you
i don't hate you and i'm a conservative
republican i'm very happy to meet
somebody like you
and some of my good friends are
republicans you know and we agree to
disagree
it's just that this was a bad two weeks
yeah i can understand how it would be
rough for you
you know babies you know the work i do i
represent children as their guardian
and i see what it does when you move a
child and i know the parents are at
fault for bringing them here
and i know that people don't want to
clinton for signing the policy and obama
then for doubling back and not enforcing
it
exactly and so i realized that if
you've got to pay to play in the world
and sometimes you've got to invest money
in these other countries to keep them at
home
and i know that that's a problem okay
that's the first thing i learned in
political sciences sometimes you got to
pay to play
and if you're not willing to invest in
keeping those folk at home
and that's another monster because if we
get off into that our soldiers get
killed and it's another big ole miss
so i'm just saying oh i'm sorry well
thank you for taking
who want to you want to hug you want a
hug
and uncle sam hog well thank you so much
for taking this speak well
me that's okay hey listen i get it there
are a lot of republicans who are jerks
but i appreciate you taking the time
you're a good republican
i'm conservative libertarian
conservative okay
yeah so if you see someone trying to
firebomb this booth tell them to stop
i'm gonna tell them don't do it because
you're a reasonable man
thank you very much i appreciate it i
don't believe you've lied about anything
i try not to is a liar well i think
that's politics
politicians in general i know but not
every other word come on man
help me with that i pray for you i can't
even pray for him
i appreciate that i pray for him every
day you know what i pray for him and i
pray for barack obama as well i think we
share a lot of common ground
i don't want him to be like me i pray
for him to be who he is
but he's just so destructive in my eyes
and i realized that we were we were
raised under different circumstances
you know we come from a different world
but i just
okay i guess you could be more like jeb
bush
that's all i'm saying i don't think jeb
bush wishes he could be more like jeb
bush he's such a wiener
but all right well thank you i mean my
republican didn't win
okay and i but that's not why i'm upset
you know right
my republican didn't win well thank you
i don't want to keep you all down we
have to keep the chair for other people
but thank you so much for taking the
time
thank you for being a good conservative
thank you very much thank you for being
so pleasant and respectful i appreciate
it
thank you is this yours is this ours
this is ours
okay it's ours thank you apologies thank
you sir god bless you
bye bye
that was great
[Music]
what was your name by the way dianne i'm
stephen hi stephen
you are democrat i am not no i'm not
i'm i'm a canadian american dual citizen
conservative
libertarian to be specific yeah
this country has just gone down the
drain
how so well look what's happening donald
trump is the most
despicable i don't even have words or
adjectives
to describe this man and to see what
he's done and knowing what i came from
and how i saw my country deteriorate
under corrupt african rule which it did
unfortunately i mean there's no getting
away from it oh no i understand leaving
in their droves
it's still terrible today with their
their laws and farmers
what they're doing to the farmers and
you know i see it's not in so much of
farmers it's
just the whole infrastructure of the
country has disintegrated and my family
all live there
sure i've lived here for 20 years and
i've had
reasonable opportunities you know my
daughter's been able to go to college
which she would have done in south
africa anyhow
um
i cannot begin to tell you
how angry i am
with white spanish
republicans who are are not even looking
at the other side of the slate and are
now
that's why i'm here learning what this
man is doing
condoning it i mean who tears children
apart well
first off do you disagree with the
fundamental fundamental premise that the
united states
is the best country in the world you
don't disagree with that i i disagree
with the jesus okay so what examples of
countries would you say are superior to
the united states i guess to start
before we get to how much you dislike
trump and i understand that
korea they've gotten south korea south
korea they've got an incredible standard
of education
