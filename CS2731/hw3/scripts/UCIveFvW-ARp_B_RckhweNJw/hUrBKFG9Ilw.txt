they talk about trans people intersex
people that used to be referred to as
hermaphrodites which is a phrase that
that we don't
prefer anymore we find it to be very
triggering and offensive because of the
one that has been used historically
okay but it's always like that medically
i don't like the n-word right like
there's a certain
well not kind of like the n-word wasn't
hermaphrodite a medical term
welcome to another installment of there
are only two genders change
my mind unedited conversations with uh
people on the street usually we do this
on campus but during summer break that's
kind of hard to do
so before we start because this is a
long one i wanted to show you how this
conversation ends up
with our second person who who claimed
to be intersex
and got a little hostile and the reason
for this
is because of the length of these
conversations if you ever
feel like we're talking around in
circles or getting off in the details
you'll see that they come back later on
and they matter that's key when having a
conversation
and finding common ground so this is
about the end point
well no no no no no no no no the
biological makeup of a brain is not
societal the biological makeup of a
brain is right that's what i'm saying
right so what i'm saying the brain that
you call the male brain or the female
brain
you did not me i'm saying is closer to
that brain that that you were referring
to as a male brain
you referred to it that way so i want to
make sure i'm correct that you believe
there is a male brain generally
and a female brain generally when i'm
explaining my answer when i'm giving you
my answer
okay my answer is what you are referring
to as a male brain
is more i didn't you did that's why it's
important you brought this up male brain
and female brain i'm trying to
understand what you brought up i didn't
bring up male brain female brain
so that context matters because we are
going to rewind all the way to the
beginning
where you can see that intersex girl
works for this person who approached me
uh transgender male to female danielle
skidmore actually running for austin
city council
in district 9. how are you would you
would you like to to change my mind i'll
try okay
thank you very much i appreciate it
i've heard about your show so i thought
oh great thank you very much yeah right
appreciate it
what's your name danielle danielle
danielle absolutely so
uh stephen um and uh if you're familiar
at all with the show this is just where
we engage in civil discussion dialogue
and issues that are usually pretty
controversial they result in talking
points with a lot of people and
you know i can see full-length
conversations so i believe there are two
genders
okay you're welcome to change my mind
i think that uh i think human biology is
really complicated
and i think that gender identity is
real and intrinsic and i think that
i don't think there's a mindset sorry i
don't think there's a binary for
anything
you can ask are you transgender i am
actually
okay um
this morning and that's okay no that's
funny literally i was walking down the
street and i was like oh my gosh this is
a sign right there
right conversation so um
what what do you believe is is wrong i
guess about my state you said there's
two genders yeah
i think i've come to realize i'm trans
right yeah and uh
that uh why
why we are the way we are like what
makes our
core humanity right is
beautifully complicated so like my son
my son's got a genetic disorder right
he's missing an enzyme
that lets him metabolize two amino acids
right
why that is you have no idea like it
wasn't a biological variation sure right
it doesn't diminish
his humanity right but it is
fundamentally different
you know like why i'm trans to be honest
with you
i don't know right now it took me 37
years
to stop fighting what i knew to be true
from the earliest ages as a child
to work my way through the social stigma
of my reality which was that i know i'm
different
i don't understand why i am i don't know
why
i would you know go and hide in the
bathroom
or my sister's clothes right like when i
was
seven right like yet
it all got wrapped into the expectations
of society
okay so i want to make sure i'm just
kind of unwrapping this uh carefully
um you said the truth of your reality
yeah that you are a woman a transgender
woman
okay um how do you know that's the truth
how do i know that it's true yeah how do
you know that you're a heterosexual i
presume
heterosexual cisgender man okay it's
presumptuous
right no well that's okay that was that
was presumptuous but correct
okay uh well i think this is obviously a
big component to lgbtqai
community that uh preferences sexuality
preferences as far as i'm attracted to
women that's that's a that's a
preference obviously so
uh it's in eight i was born i like women
and uh biological i was born a male
because uh
i have a penis in the hormonal profile
and chromosomes of a male
so that's why i know that it's true to
state that i'm a male that you're
the male because you're you're a male
because like you're ex-wife
i didn't simplify to xy a multitude of
factors i have a male brain
i have a male body everything from bone
density to my hormonal profile
to yes my penis all of these things
pretty clearly
uh would file me in the cabinet under
mail biologically like in the spec
in like the spectrum of biological
variation you're in that big collection
of people that
have all of those things in alignment
yeah depending on the
interactive people right like
two-thirds of one percent is the best
number now right that um
are transgender based on you know what
we know
of that which in texas is like 130 000
adults right
who uh for reasons that are still
unknown are don't have
all of those biological components that
you described
don't align as cleanly as yours do
okay um well you say you know unknown
um again this goes back to you said your
truth that you are a female
you asked me why am i a male i i hope
that i've answered it as clearly as i
can
right so i would return that same
question to you because i think we need
to start with the presupposition there
needs to be the same amount of validity
to our arguments
as far as us rationalizing them you said
the truth
that you are a female you were born a
male
how do you know that's the truth i was
born a transgender woman
okay and how do you know that's the
truth how do i know that's the truth
uh like
in what biological context is it like is
it validated is that the question
yeah how how do you know that you're not
uh simply a man who believes he's a
woman how do you
like why do you so why are you if you're
heterosexual why are you attracted to
women
well there's a lot of biological
mechanisms in there namely to procreate
uh since the beginning of civilization
is attractive
sex attractive
i'm a gay man do you believe that that's
not their intrinsic reality
well again it's a sexual preference and
i think that's very important because
the sexual preference is different from
uh biology right and this is what i find
also pretty
interesting to me is right now they're
teaching that you know obviously you're
born gay
uh but gender is a choice
and that to me i don't i don't i don't i
just don't agree with so which one how
do you know you
you say that you're transgender you were
born a transgender woman right but i
would assume on your birth certificate
it said male
right so at some point you made the
decision to
live the way that you live right now
correct it's something yeah at some
point i made the decision
um it was almost a decade ago to
to unpack all of the guilt and shame i
felt for being different
right and at some point i made the
decision to
to unpeel guilt and shame right about my
truth
and to start trying to reconcile it with
the rest of my life and to reconcile
with a
society that is still
[Music]
pretty hostile to people who are
different so
it was a question of no longer fighting
fighting against myself yeah so and then
even after i did that i spent
another six years desperately trying to
not to not accept that
he accepted the truth and i'm like how
do i reconcile with that i'm an engineer
a civil engineer i'm a parent
congratulations
right like how can i how can i be who i
knew i
am and still function in society so
it took me years and eventually i
realized that i don't have a choice
like you know we look at the news this
morning right and
uh with tony borndane you know taking
his life right
right so 40 percent of
transgender people attempt suicide can i
pause you right there really quickly
just first off i hope that i haven't
been hostile i know you're talking about
you've been hospitalized
even this is a great okay good um
because i know we disagree but i
certainly don't want to be disrespectful
to you personally even if i disagree
with you
yeah i don't know that i don't find that
we disagree actually okay okay well i'm
glad that uh i'm glad that way because
the last thing i want is for you to feel
as though you've been sat down and it's
uh it's been a you know
sandbagging um and and you've brought up
you know anthony bourdain you brought up
the suicide rate i think that's very uh
important you know
it's about 41 it doesn't get better
after
uh hormone replacement therapy or even
actually doing the
full sex reassignment surgery so here we
are right i will
disagree with you okay i uh i think the
data shows
that when people are able to live their
lives as themselves
and are accepted in their community in
their social networks that's their
friends and their family professionally
in their city
when they're not stigmatized when they
don't lose their job when they don't
lose their housing when they aren't
ostracized or demonized right
like our state legislature spent the
best last spring and then called a
special session
essentially to demonize my existence
based on somebody's
you know i i don't honestly sincerely
held religious belief i'm not sure why
but to basically challenge my very
validity as a human being
right then yeah people can be frustrated
and scared and terrified and hopeless
and then kill themselves
but in my community when people are able
to live their lives and are accepted and
able to
you know aren't discriminated right then
their suicide rates fall
dramatically the single best thing you
can do for somebody who's lbgtq of any
sort but especially trans
is recognize their truth and accept
their humanity
well i would disagree with you there um
and first off i think you made a couple
yeah let me explain why you made a
couple of presumptions maybe they're not
uh
trying to uh demonize your very
existence maybe they just disagree with
you maybe it doesn't come from a
christian perspective maybe it comes
from a scientific one
maybe it comes from a perspective of a
medical perspective for example at
johns hopkins oh no that's okay i think
we're okay having a conversation you and
i right now right
yeah we're good we're good thank you
though um and the suicide rate
statistically anecdotally i'm glad to
hear
that that that your your group of
friends do better because one thing i
definitely don't want people
attempting suicide in a 41 percent not
just my friends i mean the data from the
national center for trans equality the
equality texas
hrc it's not it's not like my anecdotal
sort of
group of friends the scientific data
shows that when people are not
discriminated against and
transgender individuals who are able to
live their life whether
they you know just transition socially
or have hormone replacement therapy or
surgery whatever when people are able to
live their lives
their mental health is better
well statistically it's it's an accurate
statistically the suicide rate doesn't
really improve after
i you know sex reassignment therapy but
so maybe that's something we can follow
okay let's assume it's comparable let's
assume it's slightly lower let's let's
go with that i've seen the studies that
you're talking about and it might be
slightly lower it's not dramatically
lower
but i think this is predicated on the
idea and i don't think it's an
ill-founded idea
that because of discrimination because
of societal pressure because of feeling
like an
outsider uh people have more mental
health issues people are more prone to
depression people are more likely to
attempt suicide if they feel ostracized
and isolated
right yeah if they're treated as less
than human i would i would agree
um but the fact is minorities generally
commit suicide or attempt it
far fewer numbers for example white
males are two times more likely than
black men
the transgender attempted suicide rate
is higher than american slaves or jews
in concentration camps
are we to believe that um they have
they've been treated
more poorly in modern america than
american slaves or jews and
you're asking me to joshua you're asking
me to compare trans
of transgender individuals
to uh know the statistics the
statistical reality that nowhere else do
you find that suicide rate outside of
some serious psychiatric disorders
including those who have been enslaved
which might suggest again that this is a
this is a
not a truth as you said um people may
perceive it as a reality but
it may not be um it may not be ideal to
treat it just telling people that
that's the truth that's a reality when
it's in conflict with biology and their
hormones and their
brain and their biological makeup
because it can have catastrophic results
and how many genders are there because
now we're talking about non-binary right
i know
genders are there i don't i think gender
is a continuum
i think part of our so like this is my
take on it right and this is my
own personal opinion and how i've come
out how do you identify just so i make
sure
you sign up as a woman transgender woman
so you say transgender
woman but like you know i'm comfortable
owning the fact that i'm trans
i don't know that any of us has a
responsibility to own
anything about our own individuality
like i don't think
you anybody needs to walk down the
street and say hi i am a heterosexual
man or i
am a homosexual woman right like i
but for me i'm comfortable being visible
right
sure i'm lucky that i get to live in
austin and i get to be visible
and not suffer too many consequences
now the reality is i am a very small
sliver of
the trans population right i weren't
quite a professional right
my murder rate if i were an
african-american transgender gentleman
i'd be 30 times more likely to be
murdered than i am
so african-american men are much more
likely to be murdered than white men too
so a big part of that is right not
necessarily true this is real right and
that's that's
by other black people
race is a component of every all of our
interactions in
society
our gender identity who we are in our
brain from birth
before before we're talking about any
kind of hormonal replacement okay
yeah is varies across all of us
that i like i'm at peace with i honestly
think the science will prove
that fact there was a study that was
presented
this summer in uh i forget the
researchers i think we're belgian or
dutch and it was presented in
spain barcelona like a month ago that
doing imagery studying right so
functional mris
on brains of transgender children before
hrt okay so this is there have been some
studies that have done and the most
famous study was the remedy study what's
the
uh was done with folks who might have
been in transition or post-transition
yeah and this study has been
children who identify you know yeah at a
young age pre-puberty many
