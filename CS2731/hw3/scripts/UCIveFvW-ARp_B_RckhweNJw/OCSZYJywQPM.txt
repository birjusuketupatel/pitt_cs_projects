okay this latest installment of change
my mind
is regarding the abortion issue i'm
pro-life changed my mind so probably the
most contentious that we've
discussed i would say so can certainly
be argued
warning uh this one is is it 45 minutes
it's like 53.
it's 53 minutes so it's very long and i
know that when you're watching this it
can feel very frustrating i know i did
so i i think it's important to lead with
where this conversation
ends up because that will really help
you understand the context of the
conversation
so when would it be okay i guess to put
limitations let's say on abortion
limitations when is it okay because
we've acknowledged
viability is not consistent but you're
okay with it anyway
you're the only one who's valuing the
rights of of one being
over another being the mother over a
child because you're the one who's
actually proactively terminating life
and you're okay with that i'm simply
saying no one
has the right to terminate another life
just like you don't it's a
non-aggression principle
you don't have the right to hurt me i
don't have the right to hurt you i'm
saying
that person doesn't have the right to
hurt that baby
you're saying it does so you're saying
her rights supersede that of the other
life
living growing inside of her so at what
point
is that okay or not okay i guess is
where it comes down to it it's dangerous
to put
any kind of limitations or controls
around that because she in the end is
the one responsible for that and
and though in those circumstances and i
i don't think that
it's entirely fair to judge them without
being in her shoes i'm i'm not sure
people felt about the decision that i
made but
it doesn't but that again that doesn't
change the essence of what is moral what
is a life it's like saying well listen
i'm against
slavery i think it's bad but if someone
else makes that decision
i have no right to judge their right to
choose slavery because at one point that
was considered okay
it doesn't matter what our opinion is if
that's a life and that's why it's the
only question i would say that really
needs to be answered before we have any
other discussion
so the moment of conception that's where
a woman
loses all ability to make any decisions
no no no you act as though i'm
anti-choice that's not true
well how can you be pro-life and
pro-choice sure i support four choices
contraception abstinence motherhood
adoption okay
the only one have a problem with is the
fifth one that's murder
murder yes so you don't even use the
word abortion you just use the word
murder okay killing what is killing
what's defined what's
what is killing what's the definition of
killing killing
would be the cessation of
the forcible cessation of someone else's
life right murder or killing
let's let's let's let's i'm trying to
see if i can kill the tree but i mean
okay killings will relate to a person
would it be the forcible termination of
someone else's
life killing right okay right now
what is murder it's the cessation of
a formed life it's killing with intent
right to simplify it because otherwise
it's man's thought sure
okay so we agree on murder so if that's
a life
how is abortion not murder because
again at different points it's not it's
not it's
not viable let me answer your question
with as much specificity as i can you
said
yes i believe that once that unique
human dna is created that's separate
from the mother separate from the father
to an entirely new person yeah i don't
support uh the forcible termination so
that's my
view to be just just so i'm very
consistent
so let's look at the fetal development
where is it okay for you what point is
it okay
to kill
so why do i think that's important we
don't do a whole lot of editing with the
change my minds that's what people
really like about it
in this case today we're going to
provide a little bit of commentary again
because it's 53 minutes long it'll be
intermittent it'll be brief
um i think it's important for for you to
see this and for you to note
that some people it doesn't matter how
convincing your arguments are
maybe my arguments aren't that
convincing uh it doesn't matter how
civil you are
sometimes you're not going to get
anywhere and often with you know when
you do q and a's whether it's me at
umass or bench appear answering these
these questions and you see like you
know these montages swatted down leftist
super entertaining yes it's super
entertaining but you don't see those
quiet moments afterward where that
person
sometimes they still think they're right
sometimes their mind isn't changed
sometimes you run into someone in this
case i was wondering my gosh the vi we
go through viability you'll see we go
through the idea of
obviously viability outside of the womb
also the idea of sentience
all this is kind of covered today and i
found myself frustrated
and it is hard to identify sometimes
okay is it me
not doing a good job or is this somebody
who
whose heels are so dug in their mind
won't be changed and i think that when
you see this this woman looked at that
chart
looked at a nine month old baby and said
i don't care no abortion laws
and so i i don't know what to say
to that and you realize there is no
changing there is no common ground
there there's no viability doesn't
matter and looking back on this
conversation if you
think it seems like circular logic and
it's frustrating
it's because it doesn't matter she's
okay with avoiding a nine-month-old baby
anyway
yeah that's why you're never going to
pin her down on any specific issue as
you'll see
that like you like you discussed it
you're never going to find a place
to agree upon because she's that's not
her end game but she brings these up as
smoke screens
nice lady but she means well i think
it's about viability why what about rape
and incest
she doesn't care about any of those
things because she looked at the the
graph
of the fetus zygote feed his baby to use
her words and said
nowhere situational ethics completely
and i think it's important because a lot
of people sometimes will send us emails
and say well how do i have this person
who's coming over to thanksgiving a
family member how do i convince them
sometimes you need to sit in the pocket
you need to take as many swings as you
can you need to try and change their
mind
as best as possible and you need to
accept that it won't happen
anyway and it's hard it's a hard pill to
swallow because
obviously if you're someone who cares
about changing minds you're going to
look back at yourself and say gosh
could i have done a better job sometimes
maybe you can
sometimes it's just somebody who says
abortion up to nine months
no laws at all period so with that being
said that context
uh let's watch this video and kind of
take you through the series of arguments
that brought us to that
conclusion
[Music]
what was your name the way jen jen
stephen nice to meet you
all right general here you can hold this
if you want um just
you know you know talking to the yeah
you're talking to the stick
change my favorite part so i'm just
supposed to tell myself
just talk to me yeah we're just having a
conversation so okay jen
i'm stephen i can hold it if you want me
to yeah that's fine yeah i know
sometimes people get a little
a little more formal i don't i don't
bite so all right i appreciate before we
even set up you were
really quick to say okay is you seem
surprised you said is that for real
when you saw the sign i'm pro-life
changed my mind
why what was so surprising about it um
in my experience dealing with um
pro-life either protests
or discussions normally it's not
change my mind normally it's
they show pictures of actual abortions
or trying to
create women or shame them into
decisions that they've made
it's not really about having um you know
a repartee
it's more about kind of either a
religious ideology
or you know their personal ideology and
just kind of trying to force that on you
rather than
trying to have it understand having a
conversation where we can understand
each other
right and where we're coming from and
why we have these different values
right and also because we're across from
the art museum so i didn't know if
it was a experiment like a social
experiment to see
what people thought you thought it just
might be ironic
i just thought i would ask okay no yeah
it is for real so i am pro-life
okay um and uh you know this is this is
a series we've done it on
gun control we've done it on free speech
uh just listening to the other side
uh giving someone who genuinely believes
from the opposite side of the political
cultural spectrum than i do to
to change my mind to convince me and
have a uh
a respectful but critical dialogue of
issues that you know
we all talk about in today's political
realm but often it's just
it's shouted about right so i am open to
having my mind changed and i have an
international relations degree i've
worked for the united nations i've
worked for the state department so i'm
very much about
understanding and coalition building and
sure discussion
i am not about the shouting okay so um
also my daughter is standing right here
she's a wonderful
shiny example honor student i had her
when i was 16
life is very important to me um
but recently i had a different kind of
um experience so as i promised we'll
keep these commentaries really brief but
one thing you'll notice with changing my
mind anytime someone comes up who's
really hardcore against our viewpoint
they have invariably set up some kind of
a victim status almost always
trans disabled i'm literally autistic in
this case someone who
needed an abortion out of a medical
necessity they use it because when they
feel their argument is is on shaky
ground or their position they revert
back to it you'll see
i am married i also
uh during my experience at the state
department
i was a prisoner of war so i have very
severe ptsd
that causes a seizure disorder and i was
on seizure medication
when i found out that i was pregnant and
i don't know if you know this or not but
when fuses
uh are developing it's actually nerve
bundles
that create you know the arm or the leg
or fingers or whatever sure
and seizure medication by design is
created to limit nerve
bundles and certain synapses and certain
processing
because the person with a seizure
disorder means that they're firing too
much or in a way that they shouldn't be
okay so um found out that i was pregnant
went to uh my ob gyn the same one that
delivered my daughter
and um literally
on the sonogram watch my
baby die cardiac cell by cardiac cell by
cardiac cell
not because of anything a choice that i
didn't make not because i wasn't
just not because i was outside of a
marriage
not because and there was nothing that i
could
do i could either continue to at first
it had
seven cardiac cells and then we went
back to another sonogram and it had four
and then it had three and then it had
two so my options were to
literally let the fetus die and begin
rotting inside of me
or to go to a clinic based on texas law
and get it taken care of before i had to
actually
physically experience jesus
right um so to me um
based on the safety of you know my my
safety and and
if i didn't have a that option available
to me um
and the trauma that that would have
caused i think that there are
unique uh situations especially um
you know when a woman's been you know
raped or whatever
that that that's something that should
be available to them
as a decision that that they make okay
can i ask a couple questions sure of
course
so you first came in i know you said
that you're uh you said life was very
important to you but you didn't say
pro-life
so can we i guess establish what that
means first before i kind of want to
unpack
the personal story which i can only
imagine is harrowing i've never been
through that i'm not going to act as
though i can relate to that
uh i'll do my best as we discuss it but
you said life is very important to you
and then went into that story what does
that mean
i fought for uh life my entire life i've
risked my life for other people's lives
that's why i went into international
relations
i worked at the united nations i was
very successful at setting something up
for people that
live in rural areas setting up social
and economic development for them
it's something that i did in my
dedicated my education to it's something
i dedicated my career to it's something
that i was
eventually captured by rebels in west
africa
you know trying to still fight for right
um
so it's not something that i take
lightly at all
um but the option for
a woman especially given the position
that i was in and and when my
obstetrician that
i'm going to hold this a little closer
because of all the ambulances so forgive
me i don't mean to intrude but
we won't be able to hear you that wealth
but but when i um went to my
obstetrician that i when i was pregnant
with my daughter at 16
or 15 actually i had her when i was 16.
um she didn't
say you know what are you doing go
take care of this so you wouldn't
consider so you asked if we were serious
because
you definitely don't consider yourself
pro-life then in that sense
not in that sense okay um
so my next question is you use the word
you said rather than
endure that trauma right uh did you mean
that for
the baby or yourself
i meant it i guess primarily
watching it every time i went in was
was increasingly more traumatic watching
each cardiac cell
die off sure increasingly more traumatic
do you mean for you or traumatic on the
for me and for my husband
okay right um at that point in time
depending on what you believe the
nervous system hadn't really been fully
formed so i don't know how much trauma
the actual
but it was dying nonetheless and there
was nothing that that we could
have done at that point in time based on
the medication that i was taking
it's interesting to me that you you just
use the word dying
why would you use that word because its
cardiac cells were dying
so without those cardiac cells its heart
stopped and then it sure
but you said it was dying not cardiac
cells it
so that would i guess would we agree
that that is that was a life
that it was a potential life now
important to note here this is not a
debate tactic this is actually very
important when discussing an issue to
find out what
what your terms are to define them so
you're both understanding issues
and um notice how she sort of hops she
jumps
from word lilypad to wordlilypad using
her own definitions absolutely that
happens a lot and now it makes sense
because
she doesn't care where life begins
anyway she uses the word dying she uses
the word cell she talks about heartbeat
and then backtracks
because none of it matters we're okay
with abortions up to nine months let's
keep that context
was a potential life for a life it was a
potential life okay can we can you
help me with this uh again being
pro-life differentiating between the
idea the potential of life
versus a life so when you say that as a
potential life
potential for what a potential
to grow into a
baby that could self-sustain
on some level outside of its mother's
womb so you mean potential human
so the potential human is fulfilled into
actual human
i want to make sure that i'm clear here
so we understand the kind of the terms
we're following
the potential human then becomes a human
when it is sustainable outside of the
womb
i think that that i think that that's
true
i think that that until that point it is
an
