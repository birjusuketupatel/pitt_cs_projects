till you die
foreign
that was me uh pointing actually to
bring in uh our third chair right away
matt matt
matt eisemann on the instagram and you
know why i was actually at a doctor's
office
cover of what is it rheumatoid arthritis
today
i'm like the kim kardashian of the
arthritis world three-time cover man i
will let you know
yeah and the lady said oh is that matt
eisenman oh i just
love him he's the so i'm huge
amongst camps
american ninja warrior america george
junior american injury junior is coming
out october 13th on universal kids
kids age 9 to 14 will be taken on the
course that sounds like childhood
quarterback yes you are in fact your
dad's black right i am yeah
yeah what's up dog yeah let's stop that
okay
i have a question yeah is this my first
time actually being in the third chair
do we get to drink the wine of the day
or do we just talk about it
what is this that's you don't like wine
even actually when we did the big smu
show and he came out and he poured it in
the glass he
leaned in and whispered said you better
not drink that this is welches
you're getting an invoice on the show
today sargon of akkad yeah
then we have glenn beck on the show whoa
and of course we're going to be talking
about kavanaugh everything that you
need to know about kavanaugh there's a
the timeline has been going back and
forth i feel like a lot of people have
been
lost they're getting lost in the shuffle
so we're going to try and clarify that
for you first though the question of the
day the left you know they say right now
to believe
all women because of it's basically a
blatant virtue signaled and
being sent out to mothers and daughters
but what about the message it sends to
fathers and sons
when the left declares them guilty until
proven innocent genuinely i i wonder
what ramifications do you see there
comment below
and why is no one talking about that i
think it's again uh
i think i think it's a great statement
to say believe all women
it's just making that leap to then
convict all men yeah it's that idea of
we certainly want these accusers to feel
heard but then it's this due process
idea of
again okay we will hear you we will
believe that this is a credible thing
but it needs to be investigated before
we draw any conclusions
before we end a career wait do you hear
that that's the sound of your tonight
show
appearance being cancelled oh yeah
i don't know what happened here i just
uh voiced the opinion about my friends
down syndrome i mean mcdonald when norm
mcdonald has become controversial
after saying specifically my show will
not be topical
yeah he sits gets get it there's no way
around it because it's 2018
but first leading the news before we get
to kavanaugh uh batman is going to be
showing off his bat tally whacker
in the new comic book wow it comes from
tmz the uncensored version of the member
only
shows up in print editions of dc's new
quote adult black label series
uh this has been all over trending that
should come as no surprise given who's
been
announced to portray batman i should say
the dark
that makes sense is that carlos danger
that's the worst but best free name ever
i actually i couldn't believe like
because i saw the image of batman's
member which first of all he he's
circumcised you don't have to click the
picture
we can read the story without it you
have to approve that no i i have to
admit that you're 18. here's one of the
things that bothers me is when people
don't actually do the research
on these things and start talking about
them i wanted to see batman's member
okay and see what was going on first of
all he's clipped
so uh okay you know this bruce wayne
could be a jewish family they know
they're wealthy
yeah but but i just thought i i thought
what is this idea of taking
these characters who are so distinctly a
part of childhood and
and trying to make this adult black
label series like well so funny we're
going to make this so dark that we're
going to put a penis in it
and we're going to give him an origin
story where his name was bruce neverwizz
also in the news by the way an arizona
man
faked down syndrome just to hire
caregivers
abc news the first victim reported that
she assisted him with diaper changes
oh my gosh baths on 30 occasions the
second and third victim took over all
said that he would become sexually
aroused as he was being
paid suspicions arose by the way when
police arrived at the scene
and noticed the suspect was not
you just lost your tonight show
appearance norman mcdonald said that
it was just rape it was just regular
non-retarded rape someone says he didn't
just say he was trying to claim down
syndrome
yeah i've worked with i work with
special needs people you can see that
yeah that's kind of an eyeball thing
usually by the way they're jacked
yeah down to the guys you're like oh my
god you do what kind of shrugs are you
doing and it's like i don't know and
they're really happy
well look i look i i don't approve of
this but if you're gonna go this far to
get bathed
okay i can see something at the end of
the rainbow there for you but being
somebody who sits around in a diaper
that's dirty all day
well that's it
that's that's the most disturbing part
of this entire thing for me you wanted
to sit around in your own crap until
somebody changed you
this was also a movie with johnny
knoxville remember that where he was the
ringer yeah
and ended up falling in love that's this
is that was also not a good film this is
not a good story so let's move on to the
international front
uh it doesn't get any better chinese
kindergarten welcomed kids back to
school
with a pole dancer that is the way to go
back
this is this is actually here's a video
this is how they greeted the students
coming back to the school
yeah this this is the assembly
look at the confusion on those kids
you're gonna be a dancer
you need is the pole for fire drill
i don't know what they're expecting when
they're getting their kids to love you
long time elementary it seems
okay i'll tell you what that day i
couldn't wait to get to finger painting
if you don't know what i'm saying you
are among the dads upset
and it's recording is he the
kindergarten teacher i don't know
that was incredible please get in
trouble i'm gonna
i'm going back to kindergarten because
there was training there
either they hired a professional that's
not someone who just got up on the pole
yeah let me just oh look
little kids i dance on paul no this is
of someone who's like super flexible
clearly they've been doing the part they
had the outfit yeah they had the out and
they were ready to go look
they stored it in the teachers lounge uh
i don't know about that look
any time we make fun of your culture
this is why okay this is just one more
reason why shut up all cultures are
equal which
uh well i was gonna say what made it
creepier that poll was actually batman's
member
that was so that's why that was for
kindergarten that was really
much easier without having his head
thank you neva wits all right speaking
of cultures we have to turn our eye now
to ion india
all cultures are equal shut up let's
every everybody let's just agree on this
and uh smuggler arrested at delhi
airport for hiding gold in his posterior
from hindustan times which almost sounds
like a fake newspaper but it's real
on detailed baggage examination and
personal search it was discovered that
the accused had hidden
nine gold bars i don't remember hiding
nine goals
bars nine bars inside
his rectum uh in his defense he claimed
he had down syndrome so again at this
point that's where we're
yeah they're not they're not thrilled i
got do you know how much a gold bar
weighs
do you know what kind of rectal strength
this guy would have to have
and size and capacity yeah i'm trying to
say gold
the other thing is i also just realized
this is the origin story
for goldfinger that was his proctologist
that's how he got the nickname
he's like wow by the way he's he's he's
an actual he's
he's a board-certified md who i am
really so that's why i never found
nine gold bars in a patient well it
would have been what did you find in
there
uh nothing uh nothing at all i'm not
super surprised with my fiance and some
of the stories she's told us about what
she's
heard yeah she should lead people's lead
with the nurse
and there's a man who literally comes in
every single year on his birthday with a
new item
i think the last one was a water hose
i'm not sure yeah it was a garden
like this is his events that's records
yeah he just he's like blow out the
candles and happy anniversary all right
we're going to see this story and out
doing with 10 gold bars finally
statistics actually show that british
police arrest
nine people not we have a female i
remember the russian
i don't remember nine people a day nine
people a day
for posting offensive messages comes
from reason in 2016
3 300 people were detained and
questioned for things they said online
in some parts of britain the arrest rate
for offensive speech
has risen by nearly 900 percent in
recent years so it started off just as
arrests for alleged
islamophobia misgendering uh
but then with soccer um
the police got out of hand where it
seems to be another piss-poor
performance for your
men sister we call you queer chester
but i'm sure you only knew that after
all was
a recent scope
250 plus years ago we gave england the
middle finger
yeah this is exactly freedom of speech
but no you you're honest to good
what amazes me though is you're looking
at these platforms like twitter
and how they talk about the censorship
that goes on in china
and yet clearly while it's not being
censored people are being prosecuted for
it and you would think
that these platforms ostensibly these
last bastions of
speech would be would be against this
would be opposed to this idea that
that people posting simple ideas that
that
would be demonstrably acceptable most
anywhere
it is it is remarkable and and what's
crazy to me too is we protect speech
that's liable
we protect speeches exactly now from the
left as long as it's
a target that they don't like but then
actual speech actual expression whether
it's comedy
to the written word to even honestly
your own in the case of kavanaugh she's
a good example move on to that here
the defamation is what they protect they
look well people are free she doesn't
need to protect her innocence which that
actually brings us to uh you know what
the meat segment for today
for those who haven't kept it straight
let's go on to this everything you
needed to know about kavanaugh but we're
afraid to ask
lion edition allegedly
allegedly i think she said i see i see
matt going like oh no
oh boy okay so let me give you some some
some macro context here for people who
don't really remember the story yeah
remember the story it's still ongoing
but by the time we hit friday by the
time we hit thursday it's hard to
remember what happened on monday yeah
that's where we are so still in news
everyone's talking about the
alleged attempted rape accusation from
dr christine ford by the way no longer
going to be calling your doctor
yeah christine for christine it's just
like
christy christie for your dr christie
all right listen by the way hit the
notification bell
join michael if you haven't already you
get the show every single day 99 dollars
annually 69 for students veterans active
military or there will be no more
crowded confronts or change my mind the
choice is yours let me just say this
of course it's possible that the
accusations here
uh could be accurate right and we're not
saying that all accusations of attempted
rape are false
okay does everyone can everyone we're on
the same page
right do we all agree rape is bad bad
bad rape bad hold on
make sure they say bad a little bit they
can't take it out yeah
but if you look at the way the story
pans out i hope we preface it now um
if you look at the timeline you have to
balance the scales of justice between
there an attempted rape some 30 odd
something years ago that someone doesn't
know when it happened or where it
happened and why he possibly stopped
mid-ray possibly drunk and passed out
or is she a lying we're going to
present the evidence to you
and you decide yes by the way i know
you're saying just me no one else in
this room i labeled her a lying
without proof granted she did the same
but with
attempted rape that's the purpose here
rapist let's see what happens
exactly um
it should be a fair fight we'll see
listen i i hope i hope people are
understanding
the point what's so funny is if you
listen to her attorney did you guys
follow this
ford's lawyer she said well my client
doesn't need to she doesn't need to
prove
the innocence of her case here's what's
been interesting to me with this
is look the statute of limitations
clearly has passed yes
there's not going to be a crime so
obviously this is just to judge is this
guy
does he deserve to have a position on
the supreme court or not and what i
thought was really fascinating was
a group of women who knew him at the
school wrote a letter
attesting to his character like 60. and
then and then and then a contrarian
group
wrote a letter saying we experienced
things that make us feel this is
believable and you realize neither of
those things
have any bearing on this it's just
people saying feelings are things there
are no facts
involved here and there unfortunately no
facts to prove this one way or another i
don't even know if this were if this
were actually in front of a court what
it would look like
okay he didn't hold the door for becky
i don't it's just the lawyer came out
and said oh
my client doesn't need to prove the
innocence of her claim no no you accused
him of rape
do you know anything about the justice
system it's not i accuse you of rape my
claim is true until you prove it false
just
watch and justice for all with al pacino
once
so let's look at this and whether this
could be a a pr
or not here are the fundamental problems
with the allegations against kavanaugh
so let me i have some sources here
because they're important i want to make
sure i get this
right christine ford not doctor i will
not say doctor and i won't say doctor
for you either matt iceman
you watch while people fall in the pools
of four foot deep water
you're not saving humanity anytime soon
sounded like my dad apparently now
they're
nine year olds yeah dunk the nine dunk
the four-year-old in there let's see if
he can swim after
being discombobulated by giant foam pads
the hell is that different it wasn't
entertaining enough
hope you have one hell of a liability
waiver matt um
so if ford has he remotely kept the
details of her own story straight and
the only person who can truly bad for
her
is dianne feinstein now i can't say
everything's truthful i don't know but
i do know that um
you had to contact her lawyers damn it
diane you had one job
just say she's not a lying and you
couldn't do that
so let me recap this for you for accused
kavanagh of attempted rape and a letter
to diane feinstein that feinstein didn't
mention till after the hearings
feinstein said two says she can't vouch
for everything whether it's true or not
four doesn't remember exactly when it
happened or where it happened her story
