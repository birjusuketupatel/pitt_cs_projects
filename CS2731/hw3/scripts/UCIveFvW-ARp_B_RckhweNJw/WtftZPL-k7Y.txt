so if you were to intentionally
misgender a trans woman
that could put her at risk of murder you
understand that because people think
because i don't dance i hate to ruin
your polite discourse
thank you thank you for putting that in
this place
fourth installment a real conversation
changed my mind for those who haven't
seen the series this is just a a series
here where we
set up shop reel pick a controversial
topic
and uh allow people to change my mind
sit down unedited you get to see what
happens when a real conversation
transpires not set up to be a debate
just a conversation
we sit up at a campus today is there are
only two genders change my mind you will
see
three different people a full hour of
change my mind today uh
in chronological order and i wanted you
to see specifically
three different approaches three
different tacts from the people
uh who were trying to change my mind
regardless of the fact that we didn't
change ours so
it's important to see that sometimes it
doesn't matter what you do it doesn't
matter how you treat people they are
coming in
i guess we can say cocked and loaded and
after the video you can stick around to
um
see where you can buy the change my mind
shirts and become a part of the champion
army let's go
it's all so magical
to meet you okay so um you know
this is just a series we do or let
people know my point of view there are
two genders go ahead and change my mind
it's the opposite of cable news we're
not going to edit anything out of
context
you said you disagreed i'm open to new
ideas
well i'm i'm wondering
i'm wondering the phrasing of the
question are you arguing that
um there's not more than like men and
women are you arguing there's not a
difference between sex and gender or
yeah i think i think they're two genders
male and female
okay so you're saying that male and
female is a gender not a sex
yes okay so okay
and see that's that's where i would have
to disagree okay
male and male and female is something
that uh would be by breath for example
uh you probably have a penis a male sex
organ
as would i but why would you assume that
yeah
do you but you assumed it though okay i
did i apologize
no you don't listen you don't need
anything i'm not trying to do any gotcha
yeah it's interesting to me that you
assumed that i have a penis
why
[Music]
because you uh seem
uh i don't know man because is it
because of societal construct
yes that's why yes it wasn't because of
my bone structure
or my penis bulge
that male and female is different than
being
a man or a woman okay and the fact that
we have
as a society created man man and the
male gender roles and just says women
gender roles
uh just as we would um anything else the
same way that we would say that
uh i don't know that music is good or
that we have created it to place people
into
roles and so i'm saying that if you were
male or female if you identified more as
a man and the gender roles that go with
being a man
that you have that so you're saying so
you're saying that that
sex and gender are very different yes
okay i understand that's your premise
um so that's based on on kind of modern
gender theory
uh when did that start i i wouldn't know
okay so why let me ask you this before i
guess before we get to the history
why do you accept that premise
uh because it makes uh
it makes the most sense to me i mean uh
the
argument that we've created roles such
as
um being being feminine and we have
associated it with being
female as opposed to being female is
being feminine
sure you unders you understand that
they're inconsistencies there for
example with your presumption of my you
know my penis
um let me ask you this then how many
genders are there
uh i would say if we're um we would say
that there are
two genders being men and uh man and
woman
and then that there would be people that
don't accept either of those
and that would be in a x or
non-identifying
category what's what's the number how
many genders are there i would i can
tell you
isn't that important um
i mean they were the point is that
before you know uh 1948 with simone de
beauvoir and then judith butler
with modern sort of post-modernism
feminism theory
gender and sex were effectively
interchangeable you can even look on
legal documentation depending on the
permit they are legally interchangeable
i mean this is the way it's been with
societies for millennia we've had male
and female
um so when you radically change that
you do have to have a number in in my
opinion and
some kind of an end game it can't just
be we're going to shift the rules based
on how people feel
so i can understand if someone says hey
you're wrong that there's difference
between sex and gender
but the burden of proof at that point
would be on the person asserting that
they're different
to tell me how many genders there are
because we the society right have to
know this
we have to function within certain
parameters um
and i would say that those those
parameters for
gender would be whatever that person
wants those parameters to be if they
identify as a man or a woman
or they don't identify that would be
their prerogative and that
it's not my place or your place to tell
them that
they have to identify with being a man
even if they are male
or they have to identify as a woman even
if they are female
but we but we do that all the time
people want to be things that they
aren't and we say that's not the case
you know this we constantly do that as a
society so i don't understand why it's
i'm really sorry to interrupt your
conversation but i have some logistical
questions for you
my name is laura chad and i work at smu
student activities yes we manage the
outdoor events request process um
are you the sponsor of this activity
it's college republicans actually and
you can speak with uh
darren wherever darren is he spoke with
drew we have a permission so
okay thank you very much so so i'd like
to continue on that thought uh
where were we sorry i forgot uh you were
talking about um
we have uh we do it all the time we do
it all the time so
why why is it a problem to do it if
someone we know biologically is a male
or a female um and that can never be
changed
it can never be changed biologically uh
but someone chooses to say that they're
not
that's a very that's a very modern idea
um
and the question is why do we now have
to subscribe to that and then it gets in
the idea of compulsion of language
compelling language
you know gender pronouns
what's allowed what's hate speech right
it's it's a fundamental
re-transformation of society based on
from what i'm hearing from you unless
i'm mistaken abstract
i haven't heard a number i haven't heard
what defines male or female
only how people feel and i just that's
to me that's not
very convincing or conducive toward a
productive society
okay and i would uh and i would argue
that
um reason we're talking about uh
like like you said when i assumed that
you had a penis when i have no idea if
you have a penis or not
um and saying that people i got a nice
big penis there okay
and so that people when people subscribe
to being
you you would say you see somebody that
uh you would presume to be male
and you asked and you would assume that
they would identify as being a man
sure um as you did yeah yes and uh
and so if um but if you had told me
that you are that you um in fact don't
identify as being a man that you
identify as being a woman
i would believe that would be wrong of
me to try and
uh subscribe you to being a man when you
say you identify as a woman
what if i told you that i believe i am a
bobcat
good for you man but would you accept
that would it be wrong if you did not
accept it
yes really okay well listen i appreciate
your intellectual consistency why would
it be wrong of you
to not accept my identification as a
bobcat
because uh if you id if you
identify as a bobcat man go for it great
for you
i hope you're the best bobcat on the
 earth man
well i appreciate listen i think you're
a nice guy i hope it's been productive
and you you
i believe this has been civil but um you
do see obviously this is very this is a
very emotive
uh argument that you're making right
you're making an argument from a very
emotional
place and i think it's because you're
compassionate it's because you're a good
person but
and i appreciate your intellectual
consistency but the ramifications
of saying that we have to acknowledge
somebody legally who identifies as a
bobcat
you understand would be insurmountable
the ramifications would be all sorts of
new legal identifications that would be
required which don't currently exist
why the conversation i would love it if
you want to sit down afterwards
and i would love to sit down and have
continue this conversation i would
well are you thank you thomas are you
done yeah i appreciate it thomas
thank you madison i'm co-president of
spectrum the lgbt organization on campus
great love to talk to you about this
great thank you madison
my name's stephen okay uh i appreciate
it
uh you sitting down and um what is it
that you disagree with
so um i think you happen to be you're
confused on the idea of
gender versus sex i'm confused okay yeah
okay so
when we say there are only two genders
we often confuse the idea of gender and
sex
shorts is a generalization of xy
chromosomes so we assume that
our you know xy xx you know combination
of chromosomes
um so we assume that you know male and
female comes from your chromosomes right
but uh
that's really just the idea that there's
only two possibilities of sex
right so even within sex itself you know
you can
be born uh intersex which means that
you're born with
sexual characteristics of both what we
would consider male and female
and then you have gender and gender is
more about a mental state based off of
societal
norms so within our western society we
often discuss
gender as being binary meaning that
there's two options sure so boy
girl man woman however in other
societies non-western societies there
are more than
two options okay can i can i ask you a
couple questions there to unpack
um appreciate you taking the time by the
way so what was your your name madison
madison
madison so let's go to the sex concept
before gender i think because
the idea of gender being different from
sex is predicate on the other the idea
that sex is
um binary that's where you mention that
term gender binary so you mentioned
intersex
okay i'm aware of intersex now of course
intersex doesn't necessarily mean that
someone is completely between sexes
usually they have very identifiable
characteristics like a very large
clitoris
or micro penis in that case it also
affects point zero eight
people think this is funny it's just
true less than point zero eight percent
of the population earth they still but
they still exist let me ask you this in
human anatomy class
uh how many fingers are you taught human
beings have uh we're told typically that
people have 10 however there are people
born with 11. but you're taught 10 right
yeah so we don't teach people there are
people born with 11 fingers are people
born with 12 fingers yeah but we don't
completely dismiss that those people
exist just because that they're uncommon
do we
we teach that human beings have 10
fingers
i would wager that everyone here has
been taught yeah human beings have ten
figures of course there are anomalies
that's the same way that we treat
intersex or these as you said you
mentioned chromosomes genetic
abnormalities that are very
a very extreme case so i think what we
need to do is remove this extreme case
with sex just as we would with how many
fingers toes how many kidneys you have
how many
feet you have there's something that's
typical or something that's atypical
then you go to gender this is where
listen i'm open everyone has said sex is
different
from gender and gender is not non-binary
um so i would like allow you to kind of
unpack that for me
yeah so uh in western society at least
so in our country in our society we bel
we tend to think of gender to be on this
binary spectrum of
you don't well not even really a
spectrum just a binary so you have man
woman and that's it those are the only
two options
however gender really is more of a
spectrum so
it's non-binary there are not just two
options okay you have
man woman and then everything that
doesn't fit into just man and woman is
considered non-binary that's an umbrella
term
and that includes a lot of different
categorizations so how many genders are
there
i can't you can't put a number on the
number of genders because everyone uses
different words to classify themselves
i would disagree i'm not that's worth
change my i'm not convinced that anyone
can just use any classification for
themselves for their gender
and certainly not that then we have to
compel society
to address them this way right i'm sure
you can understand that the compelling
of language is an issue so what gender
do you think you are
well i'm a male okay well i think maybe
i think you're a woman
no legally i'm a male oh it says on my
driver's license that i'm a male
okay so that's your sex no it's a yeah
but i'm also a man
that's your sense it says on my carry
certificate that i'm a male gender some
legal documentation
say gender what if i say i don't believe
you it doesn't matter exactly it doesn't
matter if you don't believe me no it
doesn't matter because biologically what
gender do you think i am
i would assume you're a female yeah so
you're making assumptions
yes i identify as non-binary yeah i
don't respectfully it doesn't matter
it does matter now let me ask you this
what would you say if i have
what pronouns you use for me it matters
how i'm socialized in society it matters
my gender expression
it matters the way that i'm allowed to
express myself it matters what bathroom
i use it matters who i'm allowed to live
with it affects every aspect of my life
so you're saying
what pronoun should i use you should use
they them pronouns so you're saying that
what if i don't what if i don't if you
don't i would consider that
disrespectful and that's actually an act
of violence to misgender a trans
it's an act of violence that is an act
of violence to intentionally misgender
someone
here we come to the issue and this is
why i'm out here um you just said that's
an act of violence that means it's an
actionable offense that means it's a
crime
so you believe that for me it's a crime
i said it's an act of violence
that are not considered crimes are acts
of violence okay so you believe it's a
non-aggressive act of violence i think
that
okay when you misgender someone if you
were to misgender a trans woman
yes trans women especially trans women
of color
are the most or have the highest rate of
murder within the lgbt community right
so if you were to intentionally
misgender a trans woman
that could put her at risk of murder you
understand that because people think
because
i don't understand i'm sorry it does
show that you're privileged in the
situation then
yes i believe we're both i think you're
extremely privileged in the situation
that you don't have to experience that
or that you don't have to worry about
that or consider that that you don't
feel like you need to respect people's
pronouns i'm i'm considering this i'm
asking you questions
you said these are the pronouns i need
to use i said what if i don't you so
that's an act of violence yeah i would
say i'm trying
to act to violence against me okay so
that's a crime an act of violence
against you as a crime i would consider
that
i would consider you being disrespecting
