what's an assault rifle uh like
one of them really large guns let me ask
you are you aware of what
the differentiation is between automatic
and semi-automatic no
people either have the right to protect
themselves or they don't and there is no
data to say that stripping people have
the right to self-protection would make
us safer
so for this week's installment i've
changed my mind we decided to revisit
the very topical issue of gun control in
the second amendment
matter of fact we returned to ut dallas
where we conducted our last segment on
this topic to see if anything had
changed
[Music]
now we're going to get to the two fully
unedited interviews in a second that's
the whole purpose of change my mind to
see what real conversations in real time
uh how they unfold but two things that
really struck me first number one
in a day full of conversations it seemed
that none of the even highly educated
students knew
anything about basic proper firearm
classifications or terminology
well i know fully automatic is the one
that is like restricted or an assault
rifle like what
why does someone need that assault rifle
or uh you know an automatic
machine gunner ars the same assault
rifle that was used in the recent
florida shooting
and two everyone wanted to talk about
florida obviously but shockingly not a
single student
not one had ever heard of the far deadly
or sutherland springs shooting
which took place in their own backyard
remember the sutherland spring shooting
that was right here in texas
you know what happened there right does
the name stephen williford mean anything
to you no
do you remember the sutherland springs
shooting
does the name stephen williford mean
anything to you
okay you remember the sutherland springs
i've heard of it
just now with the other girl from me
yeah for me absolutely terrifying how
could they not know of a shooting
with 26 deaths another 20 injured which
occurred only four hours away in which
the shooter was stopped by an nra
certified instructor with an ar15 a
national hero mind you stephen williford
but i repeat myself on with the
conversations okay so what was your name
again muad
mawad yes right um
i've asserted my position i think pretty
hopefully pretty clearly
um changed my mind so what do you think
about australia
1996. what about australia when they uh
buy back yeah i think it's terrible
really
why i think i think a gun ban stripping
citizens of the right to protect
themselves i think that's an immoral act
but i mean what if you look at the
statistics behind that the decline of
you know shootings deaths by gun it's
probably much less than we have per day
here
know what no it didn't it didn't have a
statistical effect on uh on violent
crime or even gun crime
matter of fact it came about the online
articles that
that say yeah otherwise we've written
plenty of them as well over to eladora
with kiter.com
and uh something more fascinating
there's an overall decrease in violent
crime there's an overall decrease often
in gun crime um and in new zealand where
they didn't have a mandatory buyback
you saw the same kind of overall trends
uh
so yeah i think it's i think it's
horrible um i think we both admit
it's a ban okay right yeah yeah so it
was considered a buyback which has been
proposed here
it was a mandatory buyback that's a gun
ban so i guess my question to you would
be
um would you like to do that in the
united states
i would love to to be honest personally
just ban guns honestly like what i mean
i understand there's
it's fun shooting a gun i've been to a
gun range before
there's a nice adrenaline feeling when
you're shooting at a target like you
know and it's just satisfying when you
hit the middle of the target it's
just like any other sport shirt per se
but um i feel like
we would gain so much more as a country
in the long run if you're thinking of a
bigger picture like
less possibilities of psychos killing
people like in las vegas
or just most recently where 17 people
died in a school right
i mean honestly like if i were to give
up my
my favorite hobby playing soccer if that
meant that
hundreds of people wouldn't die i would
gladly do it any day because i love my
country that much
great what do you believe the second
amendment is about
the right to bear on the right to bear
arms to protect yourself and
that's pretty much what i know i'm
really ignorant on this if i'm honest
oh really oh okay okay well listen i
appreciate you sitting down um
i don't mean to be contentious but you
mentioned it as a hobby
so um the first amendment okay right the
right to freedom of speech
do you believe that's absolute do you
believe that you should have the right
to speak freely without
having that be infringed upon by the
government okay and why do you believe
that
uh because just being able to express
your beliefs uh publicly and having that
as
you know a freedom is is essential to
the development of democracy in a
country
but where do you get that from who in
what sense
like what do you mean well where do you
get the the right to the freedom of
speech you said you believe that that is
fundamental you believe that's very
important to a democracy or to like a
constitutional republic
i just i just gave you a hint there in
that uh constitution
yeah yeah okay so so you're right
because you know the freedom of speech
is not
absolute it doesn't exist across many
other countries including free countries
including australia by the way you don't
have the right to free speech in
australia okay
so you believe the right to freedom of
speech is absolute because of the
constitution the first amendment
amendment number two is what the right
to bear arms
okay so did the australians amend their
whatever constitution they have when
they had that buyback
i can't speak to the specifics of all
elements of the australian constitution
okay
now i do know again that uh where i come
from for example in canada you can be
jailed for speech that's offensive or
you can be fined
so we decided to do things differently
from many places in europe
and certainly australia as it relates to
freedom of speech as well as the second
amendment
but i think it's important you just said
you believe freedom of speech is
absolute
why because you accept the premise that
these rights
as recognized by the constitution are
fundamental human rights
so when it comes to the life and of our
citizens yes
do you not believe that we have let's
say any let's like what if
just you know in general like does when
it comes to protecting the lives of
citizens and immigrants and anyone who
lives in america when it comes to that
do you believe that
there should be some flexibility in our
constitution
to protect our people so first off a
couple of
couple of key issues there right you
would have to
uh open it wide and now also nothing is
absolute so your freedom of speech is an
absolute so you would have to be
comfortable with that
secondly it's based on this premise that
we would save lives by
removing the second amendment which i
don't agree with
but let's go with with number one um do
you see
what a problem that is if you just say
well let's hold on a second because we
think we can be safer
let's give up this fundamental right to
protection uh
as recognized in the second amendment
can we acknowledge or maybe find common
ground there that
that'd be a real problem because it's
the same constitution that affords
you and i the right to do what we're
doing right now i mean i understand that
wholeheartedly but if we're thinking of
the bigger picture here where
like i mean i've seen things on social
media where people believe that teachers
should have guns and i mean so do you
just
as a human being do you think that the
amount of shootings that we have
every day in our country would decrease
if we had a buyback
like just thinking you know basic common
sense okay so we've now
i want to make sure that we're clear
here we've hopscotched past the idea of
human rights
it seems like that's not an area you're
super comfortable with because now
you're talking about stripping someone
of their fundamental right to
self-protection is having a gun if it
saves someone else's life
i mean why not why not i mean why not
you know like
take that step as a country take that
step as a country yes
removing someone's right to protect
themselves protect themselves from what
so explain to me since so the second
amendment so you all right um
no no you're gonna do your thing okay so
yeah second amendment you are do you
want me to explain what it is no yeah
sure so the second amendment was
designed to allow citizens to protect
themselves
uh cells both from internal and external
threats that means the right to protect
obviously
in their home property but mainly to
protect themselves from a tyrannical
government
because they fled a trinical government
they fought them off right these were
basically unorganized uh militias
who was a militia it's everyone you and
i are the militia
and the only way to ensure that there
can be a well-regulated militia meaning
a capable militia is that
all citizens have the right law-abiding
citizens
to keep and bear arms that's what it was
designed to do
you're proposing giving the government
the very fail-safe it's designed against
to protect against the tyrannical
government you're saying let's give the
government the authority
to strip people of rights
that's like a feat a feedback loop of
just a violation of human rights on a
scale that i don't think you might know
you personally do you think having the
right to free speech
is more important than having the right
to a gun no
i think you're both people we think
they're both equally important yeah so
you think like
for the development of our country it's
essential to have guns and free speech
and you think they're on the same level
in a scale
i think the right to own and keep
fighting it's more like a right
thing yes for you okay well i mean
why why is it just america that we have
tens of thousands of deaths per year
it's not i mean it is on it if you look
at statistics no we're not even
25. oh really yeah we're not even top 25
when it comes to firearm deaths we're
not even
we are the most armed populist but we're
not even the top country for mass
shootings matter of fact we're behind
norway and france
even though more people here have guns i
don't know i think we've
never heard of these statistics before
honestly i don't know where you get
yours from because
all of the ones that i've seen okay show
that america is always topping that list
okay uh well let's say we're able to
show you statistics afterwards
let's assume that those are correct okay
um it still can get to the question
let's assume
let's assume none of them are correct
what gives
you the right or what gives anyone here
the right
to strip someone of their ability to
protect themselves
so why don't we dissect that a little
what are we protecting ourselves from i
know you mentioned it from
internal and external threats so what
are those threats
tyrannical government okay yeah okay and
then of course the ability to protect
yourself from anyone who wants to do you
harm from evil people who are willing to
commit
uh harm i mean i don't i don't know why
that
that should you know have anything to do
with being able to own an assault rifle
assault rifle or you know an automatic
machine gun or anything like that
okay first off a couple things there um
what do you um
what's an assault rifle uh like
one of them really large guns
okay um yeah there's a lot to unpack
there
no no it's not i'm just going to
automatically yeah i know i mean
you mentioned a few things what kind of
where do you get your news from forgive
me or your sources what do you usually
read
cnn uh cnn twitter
cnn twitter and a lot of professors
probably here probably right
um everything that you have said here
and i said respectfully is incorrect
about the australia buyback the
statistics about that about
uh the second amendment now about
assault rifles and automatic weapons
none of the shootings that you've
discussed that we've discussed here
involved automatic weapons certainly not
florida these are not automatic weapons
automatic weapons are already heavily
regulated they're basically all but
unattainable for the actual
las vegas guy use yeah he's used to
semi-automatic
okay so semi-automatic and switch that
word what about that why do
people need to have this i'm sorry i
didn't know but do you wanna explain
what the difference is because
that's really important don't you think
because you you said here's something
and i
i appreciate you sitting down but you
sat down here
and you were willing to strip people of
their rights you were willing to say
listen it's time to progress as a
country which i'll get to in a second um
will cause countless more muggings
murders rapes of innocent people the
likes of which you've never
you've never even been able to
comprehend and didn't take into account
you were willing to remove the right of
those innocent civilians to protect
themselves
based on completely faulty data and
knowledge of things that simply aren't
so
there's a huge difference between an
automatic weapon that's a machine gun
and a semi-automatic weapon a
semi-automatic weapon
is every handgun pull the trigger once
it goes bang that's a semi-automatic
weapon that's most hunting rifles
that's nearly all handguns that are used
for self-defense so my point is
if if and i say this respect because a
lot of people have sat down so this is
not an insult but almost everything that
you just said is
is incorrect as a premise and you were
using that
or going up based on that knowledge um
to justify the stripping of someone's
ability to protect themselves
that is deeply so wonderful to me so i
obviously went to the extreme of just
banning guns
what if we you know improved our
regulation
or improved our our way of giving people
access to these
guns okay so we've got enough so you
would say now let's not ban
guns so i'm yeah with respect because
you know you got to please everyone
so let's just say we want to you know
just take another step do you think
we're at a
you know a good state where we're at
right now i don't i don't want to let's
just say
with what i just said would you
acknowledge now that okay
just banning guns could have some real
serious ramifications and maybe
you spoke a little too quickly on that
that might not be a good idea i'm sorry
what
so would you agree with that maybe
that's not a good idea to just ban guns
sure okay so what kind of regulations
would you like to see
and why just making it probably more
difficult for
people such as the las vegas shooter the
orlando shooter and
things like that to get access to guns
like that can and cause such
you know huge calamities to our country
um
how would you do it what do you think
i'm asking you
you're supposed to change my mind i mean
i'm just saying like we're not in a good
place where we're at right now with
regards to guns
really and from the statistics that i've
seen i don't know what which ones you
have and i
really love to look at the ones
afterwards and from what i've seen and
what i've been convinced through that
data is that
america is not in a good place with
regards to data from cnn
and twitter and professors is wrong um
uh okay so you've i'm assuming you've
probably never purchased a firearm no i
haven't okay
so if you purchase a firearm right now
they run a background check okay okay
okay you're a criminal if you're a felon
you can't get a gun okay you've
committed violent
misdemeanors you can't get a gun okay
domestic abuser you can't get a gun
legally declared mentally unfit you
can't get a gun get or own
meaning you cannot obtain you cannot
purchase it okay okay okay
so these already exist if you go to
purchase a firearm again all these
