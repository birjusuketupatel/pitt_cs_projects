circa near agree with larry kudlow that medicare and social security should be handed to wall street to privatisation is a good age for sure i'm sure he is for for that now
saturday
were you want to go where i don't know what do you what do you check it out
marrying a question
gosh i think i think it through a problem i think the privatization of so many things actually especially when it comes to people's parents in retirement a lot of our problem has been that so i would i'm going i'm going to educate the other it as an economist who plays
i'm just going to give me the other argument go for i've seen the shard of were money if you put your money in the stock or us vs if you just put it in the bank or whether it will do better in the market like the market one goes like this no you can't watch it every year because the market goes up and down but over the time if you put it in when you were twenty one why bother
tell you retired at sixty five book and he goes like this
we had a force for savings program i'm just the way we had a real for saving five and where you couldn't take it out and somebody else and will affect affected going to be managed elsewhere and there was a guarantees on it i can go for that it's not the crazy great
that bush
where is your uncle george work
yeah it is my he's my gut and to think about the had a there's a lot of us cause is it adds an okay job
if you're getting out
there's a lot of us now much so
how was the rest of the bush family holding up under trump courage to take the high road i think is right i'm not sure either one cares that vote for him
in fact i'm pretty sure they didn't speak and made to stuff
the old man starts sure skated on the us
i've ever talked to him about idled and never again you hear me don't do that
no because there was a conservative it sounds like the same thing you know that al franken was accused of in that just went into the ether
okay except for peace a former president of united states
you know people didn't know that about and there's a whole bunch of women said it's pretty pretty messed up pretty unacceptable and there was a joke that when when it's disgusting and inexcusable
right you are always create of
well i mean there's no upside yeah yeah i'm with you
i'm not sure what al franken did i'll just say that i'm but i'm not talking about happy either one i mean who who is grabbing i'm in a photo op too weird it is weird
and everybody wants a photo a bill maher had you ever even considered i mean a touch of lectures well i guess exact
hands up
why does the and are re get a tax exemption and how do we take it away

they do they would like to say that i don't want a political action committee but i do have that when and otherwise they're saying they're grassroots nonprofit organization but dave use illegal corporate tax loopholes to build out an entire political lobbying way that doesn't get taxed so that that is that the corporate tax loophole but that's also because he knows how to work the system or do other
and then how to use a crisis
but i never let a crisis go to follow the money on the right now we're arming teachers you know yet they somehow turn one channel and sure any other moving ahead in many states somehow they turn that around to to find a way they could so morgan it's moving ahead in the states where they still beat kids with paddles
i mean it's not i don't think it's taking hold certainly it's not there is no agreement with eggs educators and experts about our mean teachers teachers don't want that when they just because a on money on the entering go after him on the taxes or whatever it is but the real thing the real opportunity given like cover cover the world of finance is the company's it's all the companies that
do business with the and people who do business with guns it's the credit card companies that allow the transactions on the cards it's apple tv an amazon and everybody will allows this stuff over there airwaves that washington unfortunately i don't hate and fear and i could be wrong i hope i'm wrong but i think in the meantime there's a huge swath of stuff that can
actually happen but it depends that everybody actually generally not asked to the action relate to your pocketbook right consumers have to wait about two years before we can use our powers citizens to kick somebody's out of office i can make a decision tomorrow if i want to go to a different store if i don't like walmart walmart
they didn't you since they got the business of a to didn't have
but dick's sporting goods dead
i got
i got paddled a couple of times and i now
the story me
only when you do something really bad
delahunt show had a didn't have like males in it or anything
not quite sure what kind of paddling he's talking about when they wish to live on
alyssa
have you worked in the white house would you resign and principal or stay to help minimize the damage trump causes out so i i don't think there's any heroism and serving in this white house anymore i think initially people really did think that john kelly i'm going to serve my country and do this but it's you're not serving the pub
like at this point right you're serving trump and his personal trump interests and that's that's just not yet known whether they are right but the very clear what they are actually are advancing his family and right or else is willing to line his pocket bucks whether it be russian oligarchs or any other dictators and he may or may not want to emulate but there is and i guess i i
i did work in the white house and there is no question that i would ever work in a chunk white house and the sad thing is everybody who walked out has walked out tarnish like it's it's yeah it's a dead end job rigorous fairly close to the sun
would you have
he has a better reputation than sean slice or not you want john early monica lewinsky is doing better bright wise and chong spite started the former why know any good as you can attest anyone who kids in contact with human wood chipper people just
the guy it on he
no do a job that donald trump you shouldn't be wanting to me and i and i do want to go out and i do want to thrown about public public servants who are i was a political appointee there are public servants and the foreign service and military civil servants who keep the dated a function of government running the fact that they are failing demoralize is a massive problem because they're the ones who make sure we don't
things like our social security checks always say is the real problem though is if look you can call all the people who showed up in the beginning and opportunists which they are today they're the new people are believers and fortunately or unfortunately fortunate for trump an unfortunate rebels cartoon villain but but but the opportunity to the degree of thought that they were saving the country from trump those people don't
yeah and so i think there has to there has to be some thought about whether you do want some diversity of thought in the room but you even a kind of people i don't know what can i answer as he has to want the diversity of thought and it really doesn't like what do you get out of serving like that haven't won any i fix anything that's what they're there
claiming these days all over to is that he why that's why there's there's turn over because he he has this he added he likes to see people go out a fight and like this
the guy doesn't look as though she had a kid like why i like to see people go at it if i wanted it is how we know the boardroom i mean this is how he's the host of the apprentice on fire he instigate and he may old boy about selling lemonade on a corner
i don't like it wasn't all there for us to but he had been in the owners think he'd be able to take business savvy and apply that to politics and all his other things and and policy may be so many people have probably even though don't you it is and it's shady business deals that's on a works in real estate it doesn't work and all those your policy how many those voters convinces my question how many those voters that he did can
events
have changed their mind or more importantly that has anybody said since trump was elected you know i was really against him the whole time but these fourteen months he really impressed me i
i to reconsider my vote
that's like one guy is a pagan foreigner are
thank you everybody
told us we send to my watch
my not on h b o dot com
