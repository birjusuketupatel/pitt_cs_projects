welcome to l h b a pipe pass from h b o maintenance real time
okay

that was
computer miss the show itself
air the course
what walked out about for sure
michael moore
the momentum progressive figures like better work or andrew golem and red state demonstrated the democratic party needs to move further left in order to win
of the party does to people are already there the majority of americans take the liberal position on nearly every single issue seventy percent what medicare for all eighty two percent believe when shooting a the same as man
run the whole as climate change everything
where liberal country
and we win by three million votes and we won six the last seven presidential popular votes
republicans the one only wants in thirty years but i will add at which they don't want it like you say something like medicare for all american people who do want that majority i didn't know it was up to seventy but day are absolutely one hundred percent clueless about what things cost you have no idea when they ask what should we cut oh yes let's cut we spend too much what your because they say
you need to cut foreign aid that's part of what and its are young and english i see yeah but the budget i said the pedestrian i interviewed for this he said
why couldn't you just say free college well we did say free community college in the work that and i should know what though that's how we lose elections do what they do see free college yeah but we haven't forgotten how we're going to pay for it he cares

you're going to pay for it
later and and as thing that democrats need to move left is such bullshit i mean as you said michael my fellow misha gander
the people are here with
what we're talking about is the democrats moving to the center to america and
yeah well that a bar there except for all those that want to kill you
well
the thought well it's a large base going to blow bubbles a big stones i know i you know noisy no no that's wrong we don't want to kill that that's what makes us net world
really erosion of all the blood would be like bad
second wait here's the thing when we're back in charge or should i say if i'd like to believe when we're back in charge here
people watching other voted for trump when we get medicare for all where you're going to be covered to when we don't go into the next war we won't send your children off to war either be that's that's you get the benefit from all the things we're going to fix climate change you'll get to live now
going to go
trump promised that he talked about universal health care that's why they talked about know that
and then he handed over the policy to the same old republicans in congress yeah but the reason i won the primary because he was not like all the i swear it's an issue now and he was saying shit let's let's just put out let's just put out the slogan that's getting get the knots voters because we kind of sao republicans do that and they will it and then
caught the car and they didn't have a plant and it's still there and he's not going anywhere
i think democrats be better than actually going to take an exam and i don't want to be better anymore when a when i went

and plan for this accent the point remember what drums healthcare plan was what he was running something terrific
we're going to replace something to that he died on that first six months and then he said i'm going to give you health care that's better
better cheaper and covers every available no regrets from your example i mean i know what i'm saying
that's what people were exactly remarry vote for where they were only thing a big difference is that once we say it were actually smart we're not stupid and we will actually work to try to get people those things will fail at some of it but at least the democrats are going to start aspiring that i don't think in having a here to do it in never going to win
one side plays by route
the other side i don't give up on having serious idea that can be executed agree with that but they do have that just getting into after a your execute well and that's not going on it out you know i'm glad to have no serious idea when it comes to things like how medicare for all that work for failure on etsy you look at bernie's man or know no i agree
made no sense and your idea yeah arts majors is then we don't know math
any get somebody let me guess
few other questions
steve out and given what you now know would you advise david cameron you are an advisor to former prime i was a and i liked him a lot of british conservatives are not crazy conservatives like in this country
one thing that's really worked very hard at that yes
maggie that you would you advise david cameron not to hold to the bricks and yeah i i did actually advise them not to do that
but i had a different view which you probably wouldn't agree with which is that rather than having a referendum which i was certain would be divisive and end up in a mess
better thing to do is just be to say clearly in an election in your platform we think we need to leave the u because we believe in democracy we believe that people that make the decisions in a country should be accountable to the people and the use it on account of bureaucracy that's what we believe so that's what we're standing on rather than leaving this open question when no one really knew what would happen
the end of it if you to put it in your official party program you could have developed a plan and a policy and you wouldn't have this mess that's my job
okay was hoping to be a little more bloody them
i know i'm going and get it okay tom thomas far right media personalities just alex jones and tucker carlson game
are they gaining influence or losing it
to good question
a lot of it has to do with the platforms you've got most of the radio stations this country owned by corporations that have an explicit and over right wing bias you've got a television network created by a billionaire who did this in two other country did this to to other countries before you get our country and and you know last one hundred million dollars a year for the first five years
major investment air america lost seventeen million dollars all you know it was terrible thing
they are willing the conservatives are willing to invest in infrastructure you get his entire teams of people who are just scrubbing wikipedia all day long and behalf of right wing i a ball and and it just goes along the lot of of trip for the others are crazy conservatives are much more interesting when you're crazy they come up with lego england owns comes up with
great little green men things
alex as a performer yeah and were as if you liberals go crazy it sounds like npr i don't know i can do
i think
a couple of things are just to say that you really can't put tucker carlson in the same kind of know that
he's i didn't really a second thing is that again from the other side of the fence people would say we've gotta have days because because the rest of the mass media is so dominated by the other argument it's just the best dance again bullshit the rest of them as many is dominated by effects well that's
right wing infrastructure because there is an affinity that's your opinion
through that whether it's not opinion show it
it's not exactly in light of the article written by this is for you
written by reagan's daughter patty davis how do you imagine that is very few hundred he said she was sexually assaulted okay how do you imagine leader oh i see
how do you imagine the cabin organization would be handled at the accuser work conservative woman rather than a liberal
i think we kind of already saw this happen weren't some rhyme his alleged victims conservative
yeah i think so they were that's my recollection rat
and what happened why it's bad people rallied around the yankees child molester
right now
he was in their party he was he had had a little our next to his name and and oddity we have a democratic senator alabama where it's just shows and anything's possible if your opponent folks children
tell me that he said
we had a night
watch for my not
