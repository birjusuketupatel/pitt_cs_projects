how would link and have handled today's republican party were first well i must say i always hated it when republicans go where the party of lincoln artist change their whole dynamics and it completely slipped station they should be forced to drop that we're the party of like that's not at all the same party right now it is not the same party but i must say yes
listening to you tonight it made me so good after this an acrimonious week to laugh tonight
really important to have that lincoln used to say away whistle off sadness to humor he was able to tell funny stories he i don't see a sense of humor in our current translating i mean so narrowly missing element but i mean they were looking at you when laughing with a
what
what if lincoln we're here today what he would be talking about is how to reconcile these different parts of the country we can't let it be that other people are different from us and we don't care about what they're thinking and feeling we have to remember that a majority of the people want an inclusive country they want immigration they were like medicare they want to education they want mobility they want the law
lack of inequities to be dealt with it and they care about a healthy planet very lucky
yeah
like those things go out and vote you're so right power begets power i spent president trump is not expand that his base it's still in the thirty percent so we don't have to be so upset about this if we can do something about look more people are running for office and now the young people are excited more women than ever before take part in that and get them to the polls get them

jeff should be governed be doing more to ensure that kids facing hunger or able to get access to food oh absolutely
you were government can really
him now i've had been working with on the hunger issue for over thirty years
i've had wonderful success by not going up against the fear though lobbying there
but working with the governor's they seem to be a lot more into the people there were a lot of people are we lot of use governors don't know that there's a billion dollars of federal funding
on their table
programs in place to do while he was hungry kids but if they don't have those programs in place and well it's the same thing with medicaid expansion they've got lots of money on the table from the federal government in obama care the republican governors chose not to use that money the why again liberal tears because it was
costing them anything
what what it feels to me to be like will sort of mergers democrat but it's kind of conservative feeling to go more local will look
more of them and that's what i'd bring up about shoreline environment rather than waiting for those guys i mean you definitely got to do you voted for sure but engage in another way
we have another whole powerful way of engaging in all these issues
personally i don't say i'm going to both for the guardian
you made your vote now i can feel guilty i've made my
engage in a all right i mean all the changes in our society have come when it percolate from the anti slavery moment the women's movement the civil rights movement that progressive moment it's the citizens and let's make it and then the leaders channel with it you were talking before about government forces leaders that we can't be so waiting for the leaders we have to take the responsibility i shall we
are the citizens of

several in the morning and i saw this woman who said something really interesting because it seems to me that passions will looking were looking for people to be passionate about the environment
and she'd made from a really that interesting observation you should punish him is the flame that comes from been some sticks together you can get in there and get into it and chewed up and you know that you have we have plenty of passion right now but it's the wrong kind of passion
it's a passionate an intense hatred well it's the other luxury them
i mean i wish i could be as helpful as you it when you when you look at the rhetoric right now it seems very similar to me to the rhetoric of the eighteen fifties early eighteen sixties in which people are talking about the other part of the country as if it were another country
when people and we will prefer to be run by a foreign agent in rather than we would buy a democrat yeah we're at a point where the discourse has colonel to such an extent that it can lead especially now and again
if the legitimacy of the system continues like you are talking about the popular vote issue in the electoral college presidents elected gerrymander if this continues we could have a real legitimacy crisis in this country where people will actually turn to violence
and you can see it beginning you can see it people wanting to vent this anger in a sense of in the streets or by going up against people in the elevators or and breast or you can see it keeping up with nine targets little tired or equally need to have a constitutional amendment and citizens united we have to overturn that would to
state everything and you do that you triggered the other tribes even greater and greater levels of passion that's the problem well then we have to have the passion that's equal to that
i feel like
bucky fuller and the thing that really makes a lot of sense as far as what we're talking about his shoes when you want to change something
you don't have to go against issues come up with something that makes what you're trying to change obsolete
don't spend all this energy this anger anger you can we can we can shift get involved with how we see you have to talk to each other i mean nothing
lack of communication and when i was saying earlier in solo you thought it was absurd i think when i look at the meter and a certain way because i'm still basically right of center i see and hear things that you may not see in here and when i say that i'm hearing those things it's useful for you to say i hear you as opposed to it's absurd caption what a marriage counselor
what
countries are man
you know what i read an interesting thing i think it was from are sometimes spread glenn greenwald saying that gonna miss nbc they get ratings every segment
okay i'm a minute by minute
no guess they're called the minutes you're going to rock and downs are were minutes you can follow where you lose your boat or right okay so who on m s n b c is ever going to risk their show by saying something that doesn't exactly with what the audience already once in a year and think so that's kind of a hermetically sealed bubble to it's just one with a lot more facts where they usually on the right side of issues
but not the whole time know and sometimes you and this framework for example oh sorry to say about race or gender the right really upsetting a lot of other people in the country you're in this who you not
can wouldn't say that to that base and i can i can be agreeing with them and go oh for fucks sake and turn it off really
everything is like what is a curse you're so right
what a surprise
we're all communicating online and on screens and that's a very different experience when you're talking to someone looking at their eyes and face and body language and where you actually do you have to accommodate them a little bit david jolly are you going to follow other principal conservatives and go democratic and the murder
sorry for you david jelly
so i love that question because i came out in october of last year and said i think democrats take the house
will be safer and a divided
everything we've talked about barack obama talked about a post partisan america but he try to do it through a two party system
i left the party about five weeks ago

between the two parties and i'll tell you the inflection point we're expecting our first child
and among adults

what
always gets a look at
oh gets his own perspective on what i would say is on a shirt among adults we can have the republican on republican side nearly three years ago i stood on the house floor as sitting republican member of congress and called on donald trump to drop out of the presidential race and i have never lost my voice i have never gone silent as all of my republican colleagues have none of their tough because people were
either way your parents are probably republicans yeah it look it's incredibly tough but here's here's what i will tell you i hope our daughter learned to things from our example the first is for three years we thought of sight for something we truly believed that the republicans could answer to better angels but the other less and i hope our daughter learns is this there are fights
that at times wiser men and women walk away from and this is a fight and then you're going to start know somebody else can fight know that dignity the republican party out and i find those two parties are democrats and the traitor and it's not a big
i often read that paul ryan quote where he's got on tape behind closed doors saying good somebody else is know to republican to i think on couldn't pay level mccarthy record these are the new republicans on pollutants payroll or
and rural backer and paul ryan doesn't go oh my god what's go to the f b i he goes okay
doesn't mean i'm living on her saying to tell we know where i mean that's true it it
solid that i had a question for you well i'm is why why don't they use our like like chick flick he's actually one most powerful people on earth
he's a politician right now is retiring want to
who needs a job right and now he's going to have a nice cushy republican job
can i say that have been have a nice job like the look as isn't this more fun being with
when people get mad at me for doing tv as a call your congressman
but here's what i will tell you and this is something we have these academic and intelligent conversations about why why why why why at some point we get to judge little leadership integrity and the moral fiber of our political leaders and we get to say you made a wrong decision and leave and that's where we are right now and
no question
if or when roe v wade is overturned how should progressives respond who were with protection
you know i'm wearing a lot of
saddest things is here
collins talk about that as a non issue when you listen to her very long and tortured delivery of her speech today
to talk about you know i'm not worried about roe v wade and i think there are lots of people who are worried about roe v wade i think she's very wrong on that issue
i don't know i don't know what i don't know what the solution to that is but hopefully to motivate people to get to the polls
can i can i suggest something very big that liberals would actually be better off if bus way disappeared
because then they would actually have to go to the people and ask for democratic majorities and in fact they're all democratic our news in most western can now i nor is he going to get anybody for sure
