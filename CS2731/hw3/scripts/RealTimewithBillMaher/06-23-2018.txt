welcome to h b a passed from h b o maintenance real time with him

what are the democrats being doing
during to attract is affected republicans were fleeing the
catching them in
i my view of this is that you're right
like country is facing an existential threat right now we have to make alliances wherever and so i think we should welcome them i think we have to recognize that accountability is link in a car drove voter
yeah yeah i gotta do
we share this country we gotta start talking making inroads we can just

that democracy is at stake and then them okay
let's see black knight code
is there anything that could happen that would make you say okay we need stricter chromosomes go was
so interesting because it's it's amazing you know everything always goes to in each stricter gun laws in response everything with respect to firearms
i think don't need to be a more holistic look and approach to it because if we took into account the way things were before
morgan laws now than we did before which supposedly was they're doing because we didn't get rid of the assault weapons ban our state there are states that have actually deregulated than lies every the last ten fifteen years
twenty to thirty years ago
plus
or you know i'd say in the nineteen nineties when we had an assault weapons and and that was actually was ended and that was a and in the southeast past adventure of things to and restrictions on get like stand your ground like stand your ground
newton era to to why we're over the world for one reason to statistics on black people spending their ground against white people versus the reverse does not come on world for blog
yeah
also actually i should forfeit no no no no now that rubs it that specific last stand your ground in early because i'm scared i get to shoot you
interpret stand your ground and that's really i would stand that police and first away and then when it's a white person shooting a black person that is forgiven a lot more than the reverse
it that is the case in predicated on routes and brings a disproportionate effect of stay underground railroad been of it to criminal justice issues burner and been there something needs to be done about the but the idea that if somebody who's written in my life i shouldn't have to be forced to retreat to
wall before i decide to defend my life if it written you know yeah i mean that that's just always been a lie i mean people have and standard ran as change so you are inherently against the idea that concept of stand your ground you're just a the way it's been a plot now i think stand your ground is is is basically makes it so that it's easier to kill somebody and i have
to that
we had a role it is one of your life has to be normal world before stand around was that your life had to be rent and would stand around it's like any pain that you perceive as a threat to or
radical that's a slippery slope again that then that's predicated on the objective standard wrote would be the standard is inherently our objective and a self defense will because my understanding of those stand your ground from an objective standard is i have to be i'm not forced to have my back against a wall if my life is threatened to defend him alive
right so i don't think that foreign minister
where i'm standing my ground here
michael pollan do you see a future where the government sponsors care for mental health what would it take to get there
well we have a real mental health crisis in this country one of the reasons people are interested in psychedelic that it is area
with the gun graces i mean that yes we often and debate with the guns years and and well you have the suicide rate is up twenty percent in the last few years in gresham is up eighteen percent since two thousand and five addiction is rampant and and mental health care in this country has very few tools is really broken if you compare mental
health care to any other branch of medicine oncology cardiology infectious disease they've all accomplished important things they reduce suffering the prolong life span you can't say that mental health that's a true come under one hundred years ago the kennedys will about minimizing their dog because that's what they did have one hundred years ago i mean it
as a long time ago at one hundred
i think he means every the last i mean last few decades
have they come up with things that they're depressed and sellers on i remember even something like mike wallace talking about they didn't have ended depressants when he was never the less than that to meant to have no kids today than there were a few days definitely that a boy and honestly they just poor something in the test tube and make it better right
well it's not that easy but they didn't have that option and all know fifty years but the anti depressants we have actually many people don't like taking them though their effectiveness fades over time they're very hard to get off so the and then or suicide and they call suicide yes yet if there's a suicide blamed on lsd that's a huge story ray that is
routine
say that our problems are not a constant i'm not a holiday when i say this but i think that technology has completely up ended mental health in this country and we're going to we all love over we want to order a car i'm going to go to open table and and get a dinner reservation but so many of our kids are now shut ins
devoid of personal interaction and instead creating identities to just go
really disconnection beds at the root of depression and and big up in obsession always own damned phone's well
it actually well that's another expect as another for terrible addiction
okay metal pictures on picture to do than any least a suicide rates have increased an older man rural communities
i mean that it's not universal this is the kind of problem and a majority of gun deaths in the us or suicide in the ass and the research is much clearer on gun control and gun gun ownership rates and suicide than with homicide and you know that the crime rate effects are unclear the suicide rate effects are very clear if there are fewer guns out there people attempt suicide as much and but they don't succeed is often because it's
absolutely not sure that's yes i know that i was actually going to change anything or shut it down if there was a direct correlation between the a number of guns that were available and suicides we would be leading the world into was there are also called the area
also named business and are increasing and the you added you to fewer fewer suicides among black and hispanic people than among white and asian people independent of gun ownership so we have demographic advantages we should have an even bigger advantage over other advanced countries and suicide rates than we do and also we do a most guns but
they're in the hands of fewer people in other words the people who like guns have been any guns there was a guy less we go with five hundred and fifty three gun
that picture of this guy's arsenal oh my god this is what they found in this guy's house
is that many guns
here's a dead
tommy guns
let's be honest i think the discussion but we have to understand something right so i get it right you're not a good person
i'm actually worried about a person like that basically killing a lot of having the ability to easily lot he only has to an announcement
like any aliens finance well are what inspired by one person children are being slaughtered let her die in jail you're attributing iron in your inherently attributing a negative character to firearms out right right yes there's lots in some guy at their at and fire until x lag
but you're not advocating banning callers of limiting people's access to to vehicle you can't take what i mean the number of people are murdered by guns as much higher than the people murdered by arts

letting ever been could blow intentionally yeah but intentional murder is still horrible though for someone to die in a car accident somebody didn't we really can say why this is why we're never no disrespect to either of you were never going to get anywhere on this issue the best we can hope for is a better integration of data because i'm sick and tired
reading a newspaper the following day well there was this warning sign and this agency knew this and this new this where i left him the right hand
i know that at all
also been the last one i want to mate with respect to the using the number of guns up there and you feeling some type of way is i look at guns differently been you
and there was a point in time where i looked at it
there was a time tomorrow with that it probably the same way you did right i had about as an organic progression of firearm ownership as one can have i was against gun and go but i went to the right one time when i shot a gun and that change for me
now i can see i can see a myriad of reasons for why someone would own a firearm whether be recreation sports collecting so forth and so i also want to see that those number of guns of their on my mind doesn't automatically go to oh my god that's horrible and that's bad i totally hear what you're saying i guess one of the same team as you're trying to say that for grasslands live rounds whatever he wants
the ban guns now when saying ban your gang were saying regulate them same people with mental illness and background checks a variety of things about certain types of guns no one is saying you can't have again and i know the entering always wanted to say
for my safety and protection as children and other people you should we should have regulations like background checks every single guy now how would you enforce that
if i was gonna suggest that suggested solution at least have something that's enforceable rate isn't for us as well he had banker channel would you do them a getting do them for right know at that discussions and bells the energy find tell that to me the to me mansion bell support that bell would you support that got an to my question
and that's that
i will enforce what did i lose control
okay with more of this are gone at a rate who could could
gotta go
