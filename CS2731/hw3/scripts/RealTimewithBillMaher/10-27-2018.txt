right







relax receptor a scary time
i want you to relax
security sweep i've been assured there are no bugs of a bottle

got okay
the good the bad or said bob's pipe bombs through twelve people attempt this what happened in this country is an attempt to decimate the upper ranks of one of america's major political parties and it turned out to be is exactly what you thought and angry asshole in a red

he thinks trump is the greatest human being ever to live and of course he's from florida

and i could make a stripper
also strips experts
experts call this pic florida
now it gets worse lives and plantation florida
how is that still on a slave ship florida taken
okay so that we have a racist male stripper
a worked in a storm trooper dead
his name
is caesar say act like most most of drums friends he's white over fifty a registered republican and has a long criminal record
it is also bankrupt has a creepy then lives with his mom and
may and are ray named him loot water of the month
if
it's been arrested
eight times a terms battery for drug possession and threatened to bomb the van the creepy van he had had pictures of trump all over it make america great and then pictures and hillary and other democrats with their faces in cross hairs
is it ok to call this one deplorable

that hurt republican feelings because there's also a prolific hate twitter sometimes sending threats to democrats and he was frequently trump rallies where he was known as a moderate
now he's a typical trump loser blames everybody else because his life sucks that's who he is that the profile biggest supporters are always to a middle aged guy who's package doesn't work

ultra twelve with the bomb also i'm guessing it on a big believer in science
in his petition for bankruptcy and two thousand and twelve there was a handwritten note attached to it said that he lives with his mom and has no furniture
and we know whose fault that is eric holder and hillary clinton
why do you want to blow hillary yeah she's not in office she lost she has no power she's a gram bar
fact when the bomb squad was opening the package he said saved the wrapping paper

make no mistake what happened in this country this guy wanted to wipe out the top democrats in america all the major players got a bomb obama obama
obama by the clintons eric holder porch him kane is waiting by the mailbox

bernie sanders is you to stay but what am i chopped liver

nothing look
it's good yeah but i heard he was thinking about it and it's
done honor just to be and

trump is mounted the bomb or to not be good the bonding because it hurt his momentum he actually said this out loud would heard his momentum with the midterm election because before we were talking about like great care of the caravan of the seven thousand of these desperate honduran people who were coming
only about half now are still going if there's anyone left by the time they get here they should get a trophy i mean
if this was white people that would be on nbc sports

okay well stormy
well people might think it's will in congo and your your own so desperate newsweek good actually have quite a connection with what happened this week because you yourself were targeted and you know i think people have to understand that this bomber
he didn't need to get instructions from donald trump
he just went after everyone on trumps shiftless because he knew that's what that's what's expected and in a way that's what happened to you when you get busted in hawaii in hawaii i was thinking about my mind it on vacation
in ohio
because you know that person who was obviously gleeful to arrest you want nothing from called that cop and said do it they were just trump people and they knew what would rate so tell us what have and there was actually floor and the craziest part about as as it was when it
it was three undercover or he won my man and one male
and so you working at a strip club i was at a club which one
and i don't advise to get there
and out on stage during the same know what city current levels are higher i like the platinum lady
a name for every strip club i defend strippers by the way one in the last group of people who it's ok to shit on in america
men moon admit they know women think they can look down on them i like strippers on a girl who fucking knows

i danced in ohio many times i'm very well aware of what the liars and i was on stage i was trying to show i always feel know people at the sage putting dollars in their mouth which i think is entrapment when they told me to do it i think it's disgusting
oh yeah they're like yeah strippers are okay but dollars have a lot of the that on there
fecal matter on a dollar bill than on a toilet seat i do now you're welcome
good morning show
anyway so i did my show then the officers legit know ours is actually stood in line and paid to get photos and buy dvds from me and then they came back and harassed at me and they've got something called motorboat are in the atlanta the i've me to demonstrate i would not

politically correct l a wants you to show us your to it
but what is not exactly
my my village in their faith and take the money and i know is normally if you happen to do that someplace where it's illegal they just write you a check at it's never it's something you get hall dense for a strip search
the officer shona or sheena correctly who took part in this road she send emails right after you got arrested giddy about it chocolate she said
you're welcome i work for vice now we arrested stormy this morning she's in jail
you know this is not death squad stuff but this is not what america is we don't target you had to go to jail we do as politically target the people we don't want and that's what we're seeing happening in this absolutely yeah
okay and brother where they said it was a long term investigation into allegations of human human trafficking foreshadow
like you are hiding refugees in your to it
right
back after this learned from
okay so let me ask you about donald trump now that we've got the important stuff out of the way
why did you fuck donald trump
you know i have no fucking a no idea why you thought
that kind of well he has a spell on a lot of people so i'm in
so it wasn't money now i was not paid here offered after now he never out to pay me but we never on foot
okay would you have accepted now know now i would have been like so if i know but you get paid to have sex on camera that i get paid not by the person i'm having sex when i get paid by the company to film it
technicality
yeah but a motorboat that
okay
yeah and look i don't want to think about drumstick anymore
the only one already have but i mean i mean i was the first package i got the first packed and sadly mine off


let's go right to the cooking said
but he didn't use a can now
but you are partners to that you let that happen
wealthy
i thought porn stars post a guard that's your moneymaker how can you run your rod though the sleaze bag like that
on
yeah i don't know to hard hitting interview
you said the
what you say it's not a me to it is not immediate what do you think the me to movement and they certainly could have thrown in with the no i couldn't because i would be a lie okay and the i wasn't assaulted i was an attack or raped or coerced or black belt and then i think that
the him moment and movement was a very important thing for opening the dialogue and it was very powerful
and i think that when i first came out i was telling people what had happened the truth that they tried to shove me and the need to box a friend on their own agenda and first at lining part of that but it's not the truth and i'm not a victim and that regard
birds more feminism but the most important thing is not a big from right you had the agency yes you did what you wanted yes and now you say
there's audience fuck somebody they regret
i'm that guy like many people
i'm showing it tonight so
but like at that moment where you said ugh in here we go here we go
the dutch like the greatest title for something
if somebody does not write a book about and you don't be like oh here we go i think to be my musical
the ago
work in a strip club
be able to think of a better way to monetize this been shaken your tits it
my intent

for the pc crowd loves to reprise i love it okay
okay so last question porn today
it's different than even where i think when you did it right shoulder i like i said you still doing it
but when you started right what year did you start with term thousand to two thousand do i don't think it's benign and you know i'm a pretty liberal guy but i don't think the porn is benign i think it's right be it's it's it's gross it's demeaning
i understand why this generation of kids is fucked up
that's what they're looking at on their phone when they're fourteen hour know i agree there some seriously
disturbing savage it's posted limit for sure but i mean all of it's not bad
i think there's a place for it and healthy relationships edge
a way to explore sexuality open dialogue
i'll always be a fan i think by just like anything there's there's good and bad in every industry and is it something that should be consumed a lot like alcohol or blanche
i think
make a buyer to make a good case that a good thing for america and i hope you have a good love thank you


hi guys
is trying to get it
it economists are the larger and post an author of the corrosion of conservativism why i left the right max boot
experts
politics
water an nbc sledge n b c contributor betsy wonder of great
communications director and or version and this the new documentary much which was on i tunes on the author of the book trump the blue collar president and that a scary remote

i know he only lasted eleven days when the job but i gotta i thought you did a better job than the other two they have doing it thank you i appreciate that will do everything my nickname rhymes with booing
tell the difference okay so we're going to talk about bombs and lies this week
with bombs i think what i saw this is the president on stage using a domestic terrorist attack to threaten the american media and my wrong about the because he treated a very big part of the younger we see today in our society is close by the purposely falls in inaccurate reporting blah
mainstream media must clean up its act fast that sounds like he's not condemning the bomber it sounds to me like he's partnering with him he is literally saying that shannon's fall and
got nailed upon your i'm not you're not stretching any of his words to get and sense that that's the point that he's making and there's a really i instructive comparison and i think we have to make little talk about this about a year ago bernie sanders supporter shot up a baseball field full of republicans and i was korea i was there at the baseball field that they're following the story and within hours early sanders
on the floor of the us senate decried it does about it so this is horrible i have nothing to do with us there cannot be a bigger contrast between how he handled that horrible catastrophe and now how toronto saying that it somehow sienna his fault that this crazy guys going after them it just couldn't be more so i don't think sarah sanders and actually said something truthful and
now she so the trump to so track could not have been more presidential and that's exactly right for donald trump you could not have been more presidential but that's a tragedy for the country because we actually do need somebody who was more presidential of he mostly massive opportunity here if you just expressed a little remorse for his own hateful rhetoric for calling them
media the enemy of the people for calling democrats traders and evil and crazy if you accept that a little personal responsibility people would have loved it you would have gone up in popularity but he just can't do it
smart
you got that i would you listen you can be loyal to somebody and you have to be honest about the situation you know i don't like to take advantage because it's like selfishness and self preservation and so you have to tell the true the max is making a point i tried to make the point in the white house which is probably why only last at eleven days
it was no reason to have a war with the media the first thing they did in the white house was turned the lights and cameras back gone because i believe in the first of men men and you have the whole people in power accountable
second
and the war declaration because here's what happens is both sides get fired up jeff zucker sent out of a missive and then the president sends out a missive and then sarah comes out and says something and it's totally unnecessary because would it winds up happening if you
like the president's some people may or may not but he has an eight to ten point head wind as a result of the bill city of this rhetoric meaning economy's doing well he's got a lot of things going correctly for the society as it relates to jobs job growth deregulation etc but this sort of stuff is now a battle between policy and you're saying this is how
helping him hurting and heard it is and eight to ten percent head wind blowing that is really depressing his poll numbers and preventing him from getting to a higher ground that he could get well and also let's be honest this is never going to get better because what he is asking the media to do is not criticize him see i said this week
ago the end diverse through it's all comes from this one trait of narcissism
this is a disease that we are not going to cure and as long as he as it it's not going to get better because the media's job is to criticize him especially now more than ever so that's going to keep going on and he's going to keep interpreting that as you are being negative to me and part of the reason that it's such a big problem for this particular
president is that she's obsessed with the media he probably get more cable news then
the average human beings they want to be number one was more races viewers have cable television and because of that because he's so obsessed with the way he's being covered and because he's been obsessed with for decades going back twenty was a real estate developer and he would call a tabloid reporters in new york to pitch them on stories because of that the media has a much bigger impact on his mental state
state and on any other typical president and that's only is op's adult and see also got this amazing sense of victimhood i mean i think crusades put it best when he said some our views both victim and victor and somehow even though he is president of the united states he feels like he was being picked up on he feels like he's the real victim here not the people who are getting bombs in the mail i mean war with them and
been on the campaign trail and seen him in action i see the little bit differently i think that he said these ingrained impulses that counterpunch maybe roy cohn matter somebody taught him that early on and so every aggression micro or macro aggression he's made a determination that were forty five years ahead five
times harder and it's war from bill you know but she's just isn't working for us
sorry for her

caring more about his psychosis
this is more real than having an observation caves but i was going to say that but this is an incredibly dangerous for this country to have an arsonist in the white house who is setting fire to our politics this is very very dangerous this is not going to end well and you know he may be doing and for partisan advantage but the disadvantage is to the country our politics or
what what happened to calling things terrorism i seem to remember the debate with obama mitt romney when they were all up his ass about you didn't say terrorism what she did after bad guys aires an act of terrorism but this isn't an act of terrorism and god forbid we yeah we unfairly maligned protect
mueller group based on the activities of alone well
listen to me i mean listen there's an opportunity here to pivot
i hope he does because of he pivots any dials back the rhetoric of a little help the country i think max to win arguments and not going to have he doesn't he's not have kids that are you serious

at age seventy three it's all going to click and reality
seventy at age seventy one he was using twitter better the most sixteen year old so and eagles and i'll remember anyone really turn on twitter i don't know how actually how i mean the reason why all of us are getting ahead and shadow ban on twitter is because he probably won the presidency well using twitter i won't he was very very effective with the you may not like what he was doing but the
whole point of my book is that the people that i grew up with happened to like he was doing i have not had an advocate in the last thirty five years in the oval office for the middle and lower middle class people and years you may as
but he disappears he is flying with an airliner he is why did he win why do you win all those are you live in collar people live because they don't bet on do it by policy people in this country are over policy they do it by of ceiling and i'll admit the axis of evil in this country is the media and it's helplessness to they're not super know shit had i raised genius at manipulate
bullshit in the needle in a three is immediate
here's a marketing blue collar people are some of them are races at well but this guy was don't of the elitist the right now he is saying that the ponderous of them are not the elitists are different don't think racism is what their problem is i mean he is a marketing genius but he has helped along by the fact that he has
no sense of responsibility or restraint he will stoop to measure is no previous president would have possibly snoop to in order to win votes and he doesn't care what the cost of the country as i heard you talk about
several shows have you said we want to say he's not like you know now will that's what other people did i mean that's what sarah is anders
i'm not i'm not i'm not a an apologist i know you are because okay
arctic and okay
kearney good self okay i call things as i seem okay i disagree with them on the child separation policy i told him that and a lower the flag at their john mccain i can come up with ten or fifteen things worried i don't agree with your one of the good ones
but i'm really trying to be going i'm just trying to call boy right i would go ahead man we've heard that before
the that went out to those here's reason you said you agree
he said we both know these telling lies i'm not happy that he's a liar nobody should lie but then you said but politicians happen to lot but you know you're a politician now so politicians lie when the lips are moving and so these people lie that itself is a lie because that is is trying to convince people will they all lie
he's in a field with others what can i just read what lies and it wasn't the point deal with that's where your quote no i understand that but the good lord of the quote in that are they what i what i was basically that's the part i'm interested

i mean this other thing was over the years bring you're trying to say he lies they all lie just want to tell you this one week no one that means i'm giving an apology for the line that's not what i was trying to do i was trying to explain to you what he is doing why embellishing those stories but it really worth stand to themselves
embellishing has a nice way to say be as anthony okay
why i'm not i'm telling you why he's doing it and i'm trying to explain why i'm going to beat them calling out call them out on yes
we shall call it okay i'm going i'm going to it was going on in the country okay i'm going to call out a few young was just so people know because there isn't an election coming up and maybe i can persuade a few this is just one week
housing argument for this election is lies on the scale even new to him they are a hordes coming here he calls this an invasion he calls this a national emergency these starving hondurans it's not a national emergency there's is a few thousand of them we took we stopped three hundred thousand at the border last year
he's say republicans are the ones who are for preserving the ban on pre pre existing conditions
when it's the opposite he's saying that the caravan had middle easterners in it
i mean i could go on he he's not disputing flax is disputing the concept of facts when asked about middle easterners in the caravan he said
somebody said there's no proof he said there's no proof of anything
no proof of anything but they're well could be
okay i made a list of things you can prove obama was born in hawaii see an end ratings are not way down climate is man made climate change crowd sizes can be measured
kavanagh didn't graduate number one from yale law school helium is lighter than oxygen
no proof of anything
has a point here
it's important to understand about trans and when he talks and the fans things is that he doesn't think about what he's saying in terms of truth or lie he thinks about it in terms of winning or losing and so he says what he thinks will help him win regardless of any any notion of re our connection in reality has and a really good example of this is very recently he had an old
bale that he signed a bill designed to help mitigate a horrifying catastrophe that's killing countless americans he said democrats largely opposed to opie bell that's not true it past ninety nine to one in the senate he's me only president who will try to pretend that he did it out bipartisan support their a major legislation and
because
and he wants to take this opportunity and are no know that's an incredibly it's an incredibly important point here to to refute what the news trying to say here which is that you know somehow politicians lie and he may be lies a little bit more know this is off the charts long this was a blizzard i watch it
because a lot of politicians lie a little bit for donald trump lying as the default mode according to the washington post he lies and average of eight times a day if he tells the truth it's an accident okay

calling him out on it
he's a lot like being the hall monitor in the elementary school calling them out on it just like elementary schools need hall monitor whether we should all the american they want to loose ends i really help you obviously want to beat ago and yes okay so if you want to listen i can actually cause i'm in saigon
what he is still in his use galvanizing his base he has figured out that by mechanized seeing these words the way he has and getting you have said and max of said and having ten people had seen and read the lies and the washington post has them to six thousand lives let's say ten thousand and one its record breaking any let's say fifty five
let me make the point and say it's fifty thousand what he's doing is he's got the volume up on something and he's made it a calculated bed that the people that are voting for him don't care about that and he's made a calculated bit why i said right
what you what is the alternatives
don't so all him out on the line say and the forty minutes thing he said all that doesn't matter what we want in a loss what do you say i get that but what is the alternative to not calling out lives we all live in a world where we're pretending what the mad king sees as we all say oh no he says the sky is an we don't call him out on that because he is
so what did his strategy okay to call him out on a see upset you're getting right now there's a group of people usually may upset everybody should

i a guy a fair shake from their government so if you can call him out for the lies people think you're not being raised there
you're going to lose and again here here's what's really lot already that here's order already know there's been a lose again and when you when you id bag after the election and he's wanting and i'll explain to you what he did he explained it got it's not really advancing on oil you them knowing why an explanation that's the strategy and it's working at some point
there's there's going to be a national crisis there's going to be some sort of mass casualty that or recession or economic disaster and the american people will need to know that someone in a position of authority is telling them things that are true and every time the president tells are ridiculous mythological magic magical nonsensical lie
yes there's there's a defense that you can make from sort of this political machiavellian perspective
in a long term for this country it's laying the groundwork for taken literally
i'm gonna bring out
it's going to were answer the question you're asking and you're going to like the second half of the show probably a little you weren't as i mean for i'm not a new course i'm trying to explain what he's doing now you and you very animated about it and a lot of people like that
maybe not these people but there's a large group of people in middle america that lie him because he can and need to the an animated about this stance on preventing and and we can't even really seems like a strategy match and i got actually give you the label i now have a link but we're not having the same conversation because ah let's bring on jonathan
in a different word two different levels like that
you ever get into bed and somebody is on the other sheep they're under the sheet
yeah but i said
together they
yeah actually you know i'm going to be you know at lists like i say the same thing and believe me that he's inside knowledge isn't a new york university stern school of business and go off paper times bestseller the coddling of the american mind are good intentions and bad ideas are setting up the generation for failure jonathan hi

right
so you have this all folds and together now the last thing we need in this country is another reason for democracy to be friend but your book says wanted the darn kids today
explain that a little i'm paraphrasing here and actual and professor you said and better word than i the please share well
the the book has its origins in and observations from my coauthor greg lucky on off he is the president or the foundation for individual rights and education defense free speech rights on campus and in two thousand and thirteen greg began noticing that for the first time was the students who are asking for protection from words and books and ideas and speakers
previously students had protested speakers before but they'd never before medical eyes at the acted as though if this person says something i will be harmed damage people will be traumatized and so this was something new and when they put it in terms of safety well then administrators have to respond
so this came in around twenty two thousand and fourteen and it brought with a whole package of innovations you might say micro aggression training safe spaces trigger warnings all this stuff appears from outta nowhere around twenty thirteen thousand and fourteen that's something i did not realize until i was reading your book i thought it went back further because i've been talking about the fragile stuff for a long time but i didn't
realize that this is a new generation the millennium goals stop at nineteen ninety five that nineteen ninety four that's right okay so now we're into the i you call them more generation zealand same thing that's right and even more fragile yeah well this is can leave
start blaming i want a black lives play sports point blank okay i say oh it's you against okay with you i will do all the parents and with the all the all the teachers so you know the basic the basic finding which i think surprised a lot of us a lot of was assumed that the millennium were from nineteen eighty two to around two thousand and nineteen ninety eight but kids born around nineteen ninety five had a varied
from childhood from kids born a few years before and so research by jean jean twenty the show that kids born after nineteen eighty five they don't get driver's licenses as much they don't drink as much they don't go out on dates they don't have sex as much what are they doing there sitting at home on their devices talking with each other and this seems to be changing social development and
no this is not just some perception from outsiders because the rates of anxiety disorders depression self cutting where they have to be admitted to hospitals and suicide all of these rates are way way up especially for girls and it all begins right around twenty eleven and so it's when this general
asian first entered college campuses and two thousand and thirteen
that's when all this new attitude about speech comes in is another reason that they're sitting home instead of doing all those funding is because the parents insist on watching them all the time exactly and then we talk on member or twenty years ago we've talked about helicopter parents hovering over them and now they call it a bulldozer
parents get a clear out any obstacles
the edge parenting i've heard right here so that the kid who doesn't have to ever face any difficulties how can that can function in the real world that's right
the most important psychological idea and the book is anti fragility that there's some things that are fragile like a wine glass you cannot get over it breaks nothing good happens if something is plastic cannot get over it doesn't get damaged but it doesn't get better but there are some things that have to be stressed or challenged like immune system if you protect your kids immune system use bacterial wipes you actually hurting
the kid you're preventing the system from getting the information i eat same thing with social life if you protect your kids from being excluded from being insulted from being teased when they grow up like the princess and the p a little tiny thing that they encounter on campus now becomes intolerable painful
but it's not all over the country real is a minute to know if this is something when they talk about elites
who were talking about i think a little more the heartland let's see what the kids do or fuck you mom calm the fuck you mom generation a white male or yeah i mean calling mom a bitch turning their back on with their mothers talking if i did that i will not be sitting here

the constant negotiating with with the kids you know hey buddy
ready to go
kids shirt and authority and pants try to you had to see their friends yeah but but on the point about whether this is everywhere so this is such a new trend we only began to notice these things in the last couple of years but what seems to be the case is that the the anxiety and depression the fragility the mental illness that's across the country across social classes
across races and that's why social media use is beginning early beginning in middle school that seems to be the most likely culprit of several culprits so that's all of the country but the the the shout downs the screening it professors with an app that out that is almost only in the northeast and just the coastal strip of the well
coast and a lube in chicago with that's what gets the headlines and that's what dominates media the see it's the kid who screaming at the professor who then gets a job at the huffington post that's right and provides fodder for that for media to say look how terrible problems with liberals in general is that they let those kids who are hoping to impose
mr whatever writing their insane woke shit
they let them control the debate just like the parents let the kid control when we're leaving a we let the kids take over that's like job one you don't do in civilization that's right there has you respect the elders not it's like every civilization before this one

connected to this point of why we lose i think that's wrong with it i think people in this country don't any more pay attention to policy so much it's more this personal stuff it's anecdotal i don't know about global warming or what causes the recession but you know i saw that mother at the soccer game
or in the supermarket and her five year old was screaming at her and she was apologizing to the five year old i'm not going to let those people take over the country
i think that's the level it works
donald trump is do i think he understands that because he's a guy who thinks that global warming as a chinese hoax but he knows how to attach derogatory nicknames to people and that's a lot of his success in politics
the sanitation of the social media sites
a kid puts beautiful pictures of themselves on the site in a likud looks at it and feels that their life is less than a beautiful sanitation is that affecting them as well and yet reading a lot of the things are getting absolutely and that's probably the main reason why it's affecting the girls so much more than the boys because if you if you imagine all the kids in america
round two thousand and seven to two thousand and nine and you suddenly just drop millions and millions of i phones all over the country and kids pick them up what are the boys going to do oh video games and it turns out actually video games aren't that harmful and actually more
really that's not a lot about his care
oh dark
but just to finish up here
the boys are mostly doing video games that aren't so bad
even if they're running round imaginary worlds killing people as my son does with his friends it's really cooperative this teamwork they're talking
what the girls it
what the girls are doing is putting something out and then waiting anxiously while people comment on it and so it's their social comparison it's the fear of missing out also girls bullying is relational boys bullying is physical social media that doesn't really affected but girls can never get away if they're being bullied so this is why we think
the suicide rate is up twenty five percent for boys but it's up to seventy percent in her girls a couple of mergers before we run at a time we're talking about why they lose i think the report i know is non political but under should have come out by now because it's going to come out after the election with
somehow completely forgotten about the fact that the president collude with russia
roger help him win that's not
his ten days before the election in two thousand and sixteen you know what happened ten days before the election call me call me about hillary's emails somehow they always get the breaks and we don't and it's going to come out after the election and a minutes
one eye color isn't making decisions based on prior now let will again for i i understand that if the opposite if somebody could have somebody good to let them know right
last thing we're sorry about the media you know if the media's liberal i gotta say they're doing donald trump building especially with this stupid
broken caravan
you know it's a lie that this caravan is a problem of that magnitude then why coverage so much on all your networks you are doing
oh yeah
you you said something in your monologue and my wife said to me the other day there's a lot of women and children in the caravan
you have to ask yourself a rhetorical question would a woman bring their babies or their young children hundreds or thousands of miles of the border if they weren't afraid of something that's the mistake the mistake is that you're covering
not covering it down
this is what the president's very very good at he's got people covering it up here at this level that it's a national disgrace we're going to stop when i'm an executive order on it but it's actually a human story and i think the media is doing a disservice to the human sided story you know
what is demagoguing the central american caravan i mean donald trump is really showing that he thinks that his core supporters are native us with memory loss because nobody sees to remember anybody's guess in april we had another caravan this was not hordes of people invading and raping and pillaging america
it was a big nothing basically it was about four hundred people who applied for asylum which they are legally entitled to do they were not breaking the law and doing that just as these people have a legal right to apply for asylum and to pick up and running out that he was saying let's show a little empathy for them let's not demagogue them but it's not demonize them understand these people are suffering and they're trying to get a better life they're not
said
stand the guy okay he's using that methodology and he's using what you wrote in your books or to get the story appear as opposed to the human side or so getting the in giving the story as low as he can to scare people on his side and then i'll put my hands down here yeah
where it should be me down
i don't know that for down but let me let me he doesn't care about understands what i'm saying they're symbolism and totems hear these using and it's distorted the way the media is reporting it and they could be doing a better job reporting it from the human side of it and obviously not an american people would look at it as a way to our values or that we want to take care of the you're dealing with yeah and that's not that's done
i could answer yes or no
watching from from off stage and we're all trying to figure out how can people believe this how can this be happening
it seems as of the country is completely lost his mind record one thing i can contribute from from social and moral and political psychology is that if you look at how much left and right dislike each other and you go back to the seventies and eighties it wasn't actually all that much data from that american national election survey with been rising steadily since then and as we begin to
hate each other more and more motivated reasoning get stronger and stronger were desperate to believe anything that will make the other side look bad and these tribal processes in which the enemy of my enemy is my friend or any variation of that so partly what's happening is like the temperature is rising turning up our ancient psychological circuits for tribal warfare and
then we say how can those people be like that how can they believe anything and the same conversation is going on on the right about the left or right thank you know it's time
