okay so many liberals are democrats charity
well it was a big day for the liberals fi and go electric did you hear about that
news
yeah republicans got their ass kicked
i don't want to say trump was upset but today porto rico was throwing him paper towel
virginia turned so blue kentucky had to give it the heimlich maneuver
this was like the worst for republican beat i've seen since or whatever happened on rand paul long last week
what did the balls you know things are looking so good to the democrats today bernie sanders said he's considering joining the party wow
really good but
it was like liberal christmas right
liberals suddenly found out that a whole foods had moved next door
no it's amazing the big win for diversity across america in fact we have now elected across america seven trans candidates and this is all thanks to a president who has taught us that is okay for men to wear makeup i think about
this was largely they say a vote against donald trump even though he wasn't on the ballot chance for people across the nation to speak up about how they feel about him after a year of living with him in office and it was kind of like that moment in air force one when harrison ford says
get off my play
and the did they say or voters in the suburbs they have had enough of this republicans tried to scare them with immigration rhetoric but mexicans coming here and it totally backfired turns out suburban white people are much more freaked out about the possibility of having to mold their own long
you know this was the new strategy called trump ism without trump and it turns out if you want to win in today's republican party you can't fake being an asshole you have to take all
and we know who the authentic asshole is he's in asia right now
this trump is on his trip to asia he was in japan oh my god talk about as well
he was in japan two days ago he was imploring the japanese to shoot down missiles of korea fire them and he said to the japanese you're a warrior nation you're a country of samurai warriors
he asked what they're going to know about godzilla always taking down the power
warrior
but just summarizes like the japanese present it came over here and said america cowboy bang bang
shoot man for snoring
and that it was on to china he's been there for three days china of course exposes the big differences between our country and china china's can totally embraced globalization
embraced addressing climate change robotics aerospace high speed rail trump on the other hand all in on closed borders and coal
it's like seeing another kid doing long division more yours is in the sand box playing with cat poop
and tomorrow of these are off to vietnam
just the thought of it the bone spurs started acting up again
yeah he's scheduled that's a big thing with the trump this on this trip because in vietnamese scheduled to meet with vladimir put going to find yeah that he's going to get a christmas bonus
