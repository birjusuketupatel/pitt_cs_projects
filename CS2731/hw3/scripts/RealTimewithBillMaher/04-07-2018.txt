that is worker know i think
i go back to minnesota eight to ten times a year which lot by work there but i always see my brothers sisters all the time even their time even that times when you don't have time to check in and i think it's about checking in and keeping people party or talking i mean yeah
people are talking
they're mad at you don't let them run away from me and don't i am i ok corral go after all the work
you did exposing mental institution like willowbrook what do you really think about trump declaring we need to reopen these institutions why think it as governor spitzer knows there is a confusion in the public mind between people who are mentally ill which includes schizophrenia post traumatic stress
bought bipolar that's different from my area which is the developmentally disabled mental the school mentally retarded
down syndrome autistic people who were way are housed in institutions not asylum but they were warehouses that exists that people forget over five thousand people kennedys
a lobotomy and all the rhetoric just horrible horrible treatment of be one has kind of normal like you something off and those are the people who like running down the street
guns or things that look like guns and the the developmentally disabled or people whose i accuse or below normal who who you want to have his mouth you main living environment as possible that gentle people they are obviously very needy
but they can be you know
good post take vocational training they can evolve they can live longer rather than being in institutions were sixty of them were jammed in a room naked smear it their own feces unattended one it and then for sixty people have one more thing than when he did that king it was terrible
if they're good

yeah i can max
do you believe that the u s has learn from our experience and vietnam terrific book by the gutter a great writer
and highly
the us has learned for experience and or that we are continuing to make many of the same mistakes obviously lot
this person mean somewhere
fortunately i think we continue to make a lot of the same mistakes and this was a frustration for me as a story and you can study the history you can draw the lessons that getting people to actually internalized them and act upon them there's something else and for example today across the middle east one we're fighting the war on terrorism i think there's a tendency to think especially on the part of the president that american bombs and bullets will win the day and there was a
similar tenancy in vietnam but think we could bomb the vietcong into submission
gen william westmoreland thought we could kill the vietcong faster and they could be replaced on the guy that i wrote about edward lands wales said no this was never going to work out the only way to win is to have a viable and state a government and set and south vietnam it that people can actually support it's a day we're not really focus on creating governments that people can support across the middle east were just focused on bombing and then leaving and
that's not going to be a successful long term strategy yeah i know he talks about isis being annihilated but there may be annihilated in syria but just going to take their talents to south beach well
it in their case
that's where i always think oh i got i don't remember what happened with al qaeda in iraq and al qaeda in iraq which was the predecessor of isis was annihilated by two thousand and eleven then president obama pulled our troops out of iraq it it says and i oppose as a result of that he created breathing space for isis to arise and the take this fast cable say it across
in iraq and my concern is that trump today is going to repeat that very same mistake that he and other republicans were criticizing not so long ago thing it's also true if i might say that we always look at our model as the model for other countries and we have no idea who all these tribal things and all the history and i think we always try to
these people that do things our way and they don't have what we have to do that they define freedom differently i mean that was george bush's big mistake he was like everybody loves freedom we also don't forget that it's all about religion in the middle east we don't understand that it's a different than the sudanese we we change the order and the era
invasion of o three unsettled society that had settled however may be unfair it could be perceived from people in a democratic society but religion rules in the middle east it's been forever millennium it'll be for and history that happened six hundred years ago to them is like
yesterday yeah that's just the middle east that's a lot of contrition or yugoslavia when that place fell apart now you gotta have on the ground understanding like the guy that i wrote about arab lands that we spent years in the philippines and vietnam and really came to understand our society and he was trying to talk truth to power to generals without their good just bomb there a way to victory but today i see a and
a similar mindset or again there's not in the white house you don't see a lot of people were very worried about the dynamics of tribal society in iraq or syria you know trump just wants to throw you know bomb bomb them and then think that we're going to one that way we have the phrase wag the dog other presidents have been accused of starting wars to distract do you think true
there's above that now i'm going to go and i think that there's almost nothing the tropics above
the around
when you say something
what you ignore his we get one president at a time we get one president when he succeeds the nation succeeds when he fails the nation is failing
so no way you know when you alienate yourself from the government and say nothing they do is worth a shit then then the country that is that what we're doing everything we don't want him to succeed what we're saying is that his absence of fact based decision making run around oh just pointed out
pointed out the decision to move the national guard the border i view as a manifestation of a bad week he wants to distract he does something got home i did that area
no no no but but not this moment not i don't wish they'd say no you're not gonna
we all we all want to succeed but this guy won't but by the way that he said something nice about him your house
only that gravity of the show well
arthur when he made the when kim jong on said let's meet and trumps a great let's me and all the liberals said that's great and i said no you know what these two guys probably the two crazy as people in the world they might understand
laura ingraham also supported moving the capital to jerusalem and so believe me i am perfectly capable of doing you know when he does so no other one that's important to tariffs in were democrats should stand up and say you know what it's time we stood up against china which should do what is a global coalition not is one off deals somebody had to stand up china
it was gaining weight as like an adult like democrats have a supporting trumps strong have started a trade or with china this is not gonna work out we'll need to stand up to china and traded up but on we get not rice why that i be and way
don't just stand up it's about time somebody said what do you think of republicans do regulating the banks and some democrats the road late in the bank well he he hears the thing i'll say it's been so many years and we had a financial crisis
it is the same boat any single most erotic pelosi move i've seen since moving the national guard for the it is
ten years after the crisis we want to go back and recreate the very predicate to the crisis of oh wait just makes no sense banks are lending their lending enough the economy is booming why go back to minimize the in limiting the amount of capital they need it's insane simply insane but it's also
i completely agree with you one of my happiest moments in washington dc they are few was when i worked on the wall street reform bell sat at the bill signing saw us really try to china page and the time when them wall street in the banks wrote all of the rules in the sack days they still are the biggest donor
to democrats and republicans in the financial sector and seeing that list of democrats that elizabeth warren had the guts to call out that list of democrats who were just saying you know what less deregulate again let's go ahead and join with a republican caucus this is why the democratic party is not as popular as it needs to be with working and middle class people have

we had a nice lunch and many huge beyond me
