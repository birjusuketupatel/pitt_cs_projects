welcome to h b o pie passed from h b o maintenance eve real time
users as your the waters rest
in the nicotine
what what the republican reaction democratic bridge that their health from the public or pushed for their position to make false statements you didn't even get to that oh really that he wrote his own medical report it to the doctor like that
dr arabia is the answer depends on the flammability of sean hannity

so where so past where the buses run
oh good i'm glad you're loosening up and agree with me out
you around about it i'm trying to save the republican i know you're and you're doing a job
mapped as libertarian as a member place to the in today's political parties hell yes
libertarian party first of all me were an interesting moment right now we're both major parties have retreated on stuff like government spending like holding line on interventionism against surveillance warrantless surveillance
things like that
and i would also argue freeze at age in the we need more libertarian ideas in both parties and also in a libertarian party i think what does that look like in his underwear
general how are an essay operations being protected from a president who leaks intelligence to our adversaries
without arguing the premise
the seriousness you carry ohio
michigan wisconsin you get to secrets
until you get an issue there in shock to the voters if not to the agency
depressing
but that's what it would be worse if he was interested they would be worse if he actually read a briefing or cared about anything except whether nordstrom is selling a bunk his shoes and that's one of the challenges we have we have a president michael gershon want to push wu speech writer said donald trump lives the
eternal now
little history no consequence
job with intelligence is context
and we just fly by one and the long game yeah exactly that's why we didn't have a hot war when we had a cold war because it was floored by your people and that's preferable way to do it
alright is there a chance john that current partition divide could become so irreconcilable that america plunges into a second civil war
i don't think so but you will nothing out
come on over there you go
because historically we we did have one i think it's more likely that they'll be a reshuffling of the parties the elements that belong to the parties that's happened whenever there's been a failure of consensus on the central issue of the time so on slavery in the fifties and sixties on industrialization
at the turn a century on the role of the state
in in the middle of the century and then chiefly in our own time
the shift from republicans being the party of lincoln truly do the gym and the democrats being the party of segregation is gonna stop saying that the party of lincoln
the party switch yeah completely switch it is just ridiculous but but
there's something wrong with aspiring to bed now of course the case recently is that they don't well the case right now the case right now is that in any sixteen is the first recorded case of a candidate of a hijacker boarding a plane and the passenger siding with hijacked and that's what happened with trump he took over the base
they got rid of the pilots jeb bush's and the great moral question right now is who wants to be on the right side of history
talking that earlier and say this will not stand
hi
i love when republicans say that the party of lincoln like i love it and like okay now could you act like it do with it
i mean doing i mean it's just like when conservatives suddenly are all worried about women's rights and gay rights they bring it up so that they can bash muslims but then when it's actually their own policies and actions they don't do anything to uphold it but then when it's convenient
they use it as or fig leaves for the otherwise races behavior or where the party a blanket it sort of the way george bush remember when he was talking about his national guard servers or don't denigrate the guard well in his day the guard was a way to get out of the service
and he took advantage of it
when he was president
it was a way to get sent to iraq so he completed those two okay
the question right now it seems to me and the democrats are going to face it again with sanders and warren and the republicans are facing you're right now is the central issue is globalization and it's implications and neither party as it stands has a coherent answer to that and the the racism and xenophobia are all related to the fact that people
are worried that immigrants are coming in undercutting them the date is not very strong on that of course which makes it all the more hard to make an intellectual argument about it okay mayor as a young democrat do you think the party would be better off if nancy pelosi and she would endorse are younger and less polarizing democrat to be leader
speaker pelosi our house you're close he will retire when it's time
are the article that talked about how a lot of hate she gets is precisely because she's a woman and they will with power that she's the when the most effective party leaders ever so
that's painful for her leadership at everything she's dead i think when it's times and i'm glad it's declare like that
okay i think to the water point their party does have to develop a bitch
there's not just age ethnicity
sexual orientation that looks i think we're seeing that i mean there are more women candidates than ever this have your bye bye
i thank you everybody thank you audience we will see you next week
tell me that the center
had a night
watch my
on h b o dot com
i think your base back when seasons here they pack ass other his grief doesn't go away
even if i'm from grief just learning to live when we don't address our agree
close your him moving and honest discussions learn from others have experienced life altering office i've been trying to spend as much time as possible my kids
listen to other is an anderson cooper wherever you get your pie gas
