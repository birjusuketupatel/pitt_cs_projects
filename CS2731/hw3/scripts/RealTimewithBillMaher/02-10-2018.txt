your other question for getting richer crater do you think the ethical degradation seen in this presidency will be a permanent realities of the as well it could get worse but i sure hope know this is some digging out after we've survived this is a low point is a combined all
all of the sense of all the past president

i don't even get me wrong i that's why we got your it again
congressmen share of gems get majority in mid term's what do you think congress should work on right away good question
i think one of the biggest challenges facing the country and its mass by this sugar i that bad from the stock market although that is coming down from that i are structural changes going on the economy the effect of automation is going to be as disruptive to people in retail as globalization was certain manufacturing
and we need to prepare our workforce for that we need to make sure that young people can get the education they need to be able to compete in a newly automated work environment need to make sure that people in the middle of their career or lose their job through no fault of their own are able to get another good job that pays just as well and people at the end of a worker can
retire and ignite here democrats say that all the time why don't they believe you are talking about the coal miners because that's what pilloried all the coal miners and they just you know we don't believe we don't believe we're going to replace this job or common change my life and any way i need that's the only job i can get in the minor mine is here and i want to go down in it
i feel like democrats have a real trouble making that connection and convincing voters that they can do things like that which is that they have the right answer i think i just don't think you're right well first of all you can't give that talk from washington dc
you need to be in coal country and you need to show people respect you need to start the conversation by saying i respect what you've done for a living with your parents did for a living how you put bread on the tape
i can't say that i'm going to change the global economy and energy and so many promises you that i hope you know they're giving you wanna bowl but what i can say is i want to work with you to bring other jobs here what do you want to see your kids do and how do we make that happen
that's a kind of conversation i think we need to have and coal country and around the around the nation it can't be talking down to people and has to mean showing respect people and cold come in coal country were told if their kids just got an education they be fine and they got an education and there were no jobs for we need to be able to partner
federal government local government local a business private sector to help create jobs and the parts of the country that had been left behind
they've done
if the if the mueller report comes in any time this year before the election right
then it'll be close to over once he gets his report but if it happened after two thousand and eighteen it would be better for the democrats right because they've been might be in power
in other words wouldn't it be better if the mueller the report came in two thousand and nineteen when you could impeach and if it comes in and thousand and eighteen when you can't impeach him because they're republicans will go along with that doesn't have then just die in the woods a very well it can't you the stall
that's right
garcia what do you like pets right now
and says way preferable to donald yeah all ultra ultra could either definitely true yeah ultra ultra clean first of all he's got a russian spy yes
he's not as he's not wearing clown makeup
nails governance and out cabinets he knows how to govern yes he's not a complete not he's he's a bush
but he won't take us to your your your war right what i was going to
i didn't want me to say i again i'm so sorry
look i think we proceeded the investigations expeditiously as we can and ironically it's the republicans who are slow walking phase now they want to basically put the government on trial this is what you do when you're a defense attorney and the facts are mounting against your client and he's looking increasingly incriminating you basically put the government on try
while so there are witnesses we want to bring in they keep delaying their documents will want to subpoena they keep delaying they're the ones who are drawing this out right now i can't tell you whether it's better not for bob to finish this year but i can't say this the most important thing is that he be allowed to do his job
that
for the record if you're watching bob mahler don't finish this yep
wait till twenty nineteen after the democrats may be have at least one house so this thing or a minute he's a republican wait like of that he is actually but he's an american and foremost bob more is that america he's going to do this job
the public and the trunk is fighting against that's what did the most amazing ironies of the whole thing called me it was a republican rod rosenstein it was you can't even get along with your own team and betray me swung the election to him
yeah that's what nate silver things was the turning point in six particularly absurd the trunk to be now claiming the f b i was trying to destroy them and they were in fact helping him the majority of america agrees with you i'm sure because a majority of america
see something totally different than this thirty nine forty one whatever percentage that president trump has but you have to remember one of the reasons why we're in this situation now is because things were not laid out the way they were supposed to play out and they have to play out the right way so you cannot say well it was done this but it has to play at the right way
because it's too much covered up too much shift the shifted and everything and mean for instance you know just what this memo situation the democrats had something that gave it from what i mean for my sources are bottom line for line and my correct line for line against new years and even gave a different timeline but the president again wants to keep his
narrative in show the people what he wants to show versus what the other side's had other side has it could actually be more factual then what newness has a known yet was actually what did he have accused himself how in the world can even present any and used to be closer than you this is that this is the president on the newness memo i'm vindicated
rice the present and then somebody there was a democratic response i'm is classified
pretty good friends with devon
we used to get along very well together
same home state signing support and love and event will go straight or not
well
i think particular
is the chairman got very close to the present during the campaign he was part of the transition team he had to see to the table that's a heady thing right
and then when he was put in charge of investigation he still want to maintain the seat of the table absolute power and do both credibly and and the investigation is what suffer a lot of relationships were broken and washington dams and republicans were able to at least talk work things out i mean i had a lot of republicans sources and democratic sources and
last with they perceive to be is that i'm a liberal but they perceive i don't tell my politics not lost a lot of republicans sources and republican friends to this last two years and other thing makes us and that's that's known as memo doesn't say a thing of it there be i was doing his job have gone and getting surveillance and
as a warrant for hanging around with russian agents that what it was what i'm trying to that that is they're just trying to do is alex jones it just create a haze of oh shit
seventy percent of republicans think the f b i is biased against trump this haze of bullshit and everything and everybody who gets crowded and the mike's lens and so forth ban and now
to go unseen mueller do they get a message from trump do you think saying the worry about it all part of the biggest hundred and plus those russian are joe a pile that case your pie that case whack and over yet
and the message he sent there was you have my back i won't even wait until your sentence to use apartment
when he was asked about flynn he said well we'll see about that in other words will see what he has to say is it with me as against me
of course that is so destructive of our system of justice but then that's the point it's especially her and us with our pio actually interviewed or power went to the prison where he made women who were serious addiction problems go out on a chain gang wearing a tee shirt saying i was a drug addict were members of the public more condemn them i mean this is one of the most wicked people
interim championing in reveal so much much from let me see now he's running for senate rare
yeah she's eighty seven right so we had chelsea manning and real arms hail this is the state of our politics
manning did it's really admirable things don't have a pyro husband's career out of the stating that he destroys i any has aligned herself with might turn a bitch and the right or she went she went on i'll say to a party which she went ten min intelligence on those be state how i don't want to be one hundred language
i was saying about politics with them for them
when i'm lost on the burner
