you think it's fair to criticize democrats are taking money from our state
this is my feeling about that like take the money i mean it's already the
i think this whole thing with you a fee and they gave a big they're getting back the money but he gave for women filmmakers like keep it like where's it going to go to the board of company of already or failure
nearly like murray
james carville do think the democrat doug jones as a good chance to read roy more

erik erikson do think steve that and will be effective finding candidates to primary congressional republicans finding more and
finding them to primary yes funny than the when i'm not so sure we've got the one who was in jail the one who believes in chem trails i'm not sure if the one who believes in u f o's is one of his
they may very well be some of the republican samples were guys and honestly a lot of the republicans that was guys i think deserve to be beaten because them campaigning in breaking promises got the base show pissed off that's what led him to burn the party down with drop so they deserve it but then they're going to lose to the democrats of the general election you run the felon or the chem trails lady they're not go
going to win the general the a lot of influence with those voters what do you tell them about i listen i said dildo for trot they didn't listen to me
what do you tell them about an issue like healthcare were like
i've read that many like the affordable care act but they don't like obama care
there were many them you know i think i probably have been saved by
trump called doble in the care of this week a disgrace which is such a disgrace to mean maybe you don't agree with that but it's not a disgrace and again james where are the democrats to sit and full throated ugly and say this is our signal dirt cheap that i can't do you know what pushed about every democrat eight against repeal and replace
okay the democrat
they pay a fit by what about they voted by i mean
what you want a democrat in order to talk about all the democrat
what do you a i'm saying
why is going to get you very far
in a democratic party they'll all come out and work at be that tax cuts create sharp fish as they do it just can't do that
you're a democrat you can't run against immigration can do it if he didn't he wouldn't be a democrat
the nature of who you are you can't believe that global warming is okay because you're anyone in your dna until you are it
they don't think that way they're still shooting that happened under the afternoon k and there's after that though thing they really trying to tell people that if you cut the state tax you going to grow the economy
can't say no no person and can say that but stayed maneuvering can say or to gauge the you pronounce his name
in have been a fair
what do you think of jeff sessions sending a justice to farm and lawyer to prosecute the murder of a trends teen in iowa
you know i just i i think
murray actually know because i find that essays yeah i wearing a stance and one would think well maybe this is interesting even as a change of heart which jeff sessions but i'm suspicious i'm curious i don't know why he's doing it this is a man who doesn't have a record of standing out for any individual's their rights and algae t americans and this is a man who advised me education department or ascend that
guidelines for and transcend our students and his and then somebody who doesn't believe it's a real thing that people have gender and it's mark yeah so i am concerned actually and because it down
on the surface to headline reads really well he's in rafting and maybe maybe they'll find out this actually wasn't really a hate crime or kind of intolerance
and i suspect that there are worse forces at play here
i go back to the thing about a democrat be the and
go think people are plenty appointed black people under the gun cashflow dollars people they documented dish
overwhelming the number of wires that they call that people don't care they don't care
michelle is why go back and look at how many special counsel independent prosecuted etc and gender are republicans are all of them because if a republican and done investigation of what you have a democrat and russia invaded but never it under investigation is that where you can have a democrat get and you know what all of the don't cry
establishment
editorial writers the commentators the everything oh yeah she ever why are they never a democratic independent couch ever
a look cause
we get except the back that they will raise hell and not pay attention to what a democrat
right to a point where you get that a point to say what we need to do is why as much as i do people running a lot of to had a size is not exactly equivalent to lying okay and or german the political right we're not talking about the policy
talking about next time when they target holes they always say people will say they trust the republican party more to defend this is their the daddy party and let's put a chip in that because you know when john kerry ran they went there i will put up a war heroes to they when they go there and we don't know
i great
know here now with thank you very much
