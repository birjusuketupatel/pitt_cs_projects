these i loved ones mothers brothers
today and and fans
no unique
when experience over dallas every second counts see the life administering the locks on learn how to get in the locks on a visit and that path
back backlash
it's paid for with pennsylvania taxpayer dollars
welcome to age be a dance
from h b o maintenance real time with him


people are happy
dr
drop came up a great idea
right i've got to the border
setting the national guard
why you're doing this now of course like everything would just because you've been watching fox news
and they started to talk about a caravan you heard about this care of people from central america has come care of it are everybody freaked out
home depot was like we're gonna need a bigger parking lot
no he thinks he's going to lose his colder
they made him president with her book about immigration
she's mad because he and built the wall gets so she's waiting angry things about him when you cannot lose and culture of the last time a woman spank him that bad

all out with him everything is about keeping his base happy you know the forgotten americans can we stop using this term but a ridiculous forgotten america the lost tribes of the rush
or condoms living in a hidden valley
no they're not invisible these people instructor at walmart in their pajamas i worst ever

even if you wanted to get people out that the wall wouldn't work somebody was telling trump they said using technology instead of a wall is a lot cheaper and more efficient and he said if i if i wanted cheaper and more efficient i'd let the mexicans it
the other genius idea had lately as a trade war with china
witch project will be now china has responded with tariffs of their own so the white house's frantically backpedaling are now we were just threatening
just the first offer bigger you know the markets the stock broker to do that seemed to be enjoying the unpredictability of president brain forward
because whenever he proposes something the markets tank and then one of the cabinet secretaries comes out and says oh don't you dare
nobody around here does in the markets bounce back
everything this guy says of like or fourth of the blame on the dog

the final story i think is really interesting story daniel
lawyer
this says she can describe president drums genitalia in great detail
based on that i'll pay or hush money
tell me that he said
my had a watch watching
i'm not going to be gone
i think your based back when season here this pack ass other his grief doesn't go away
the i'm to grieve
learning to live with we don't address our greed
close your building and honest discussions and others who have experienced life altering losses have been trying to spend as much time as possible my kids
nice
listen to other is an anderson cooper wherever you get your pie cash
