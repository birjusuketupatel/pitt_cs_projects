this growing list of people and you say a movie mogul gone director gone reporter gun corporate ceo gone president united states peace day
what's that all but not everybody is willing to turn a blind in the republican party this week jeff flake the senator for a marriage
like joined the resistance
he announced his retirement in a blistering speech on the senate floor he would denounce trump for all the stands for and says he just can't be a part of this any more he is the rose mcgowan
the republican party
except that instead of the other republican joining in with their me to stories they are continuing to lead truck molester that's the problem
jeff
just like is not a hippie the say hard right winger who vote with trump same thing with other there are other republican of conscience which is bob barker who this week said trump is utterly untruthful and he is debasing the country
that said if you can sign our tax code for the rich debase away
yeah that's the problem you know senators have quit before their party over arguments like this with the president
even switched parties jim jeffords any remember that guy in two thousand and one left the republican voted lincoln j v over disagreement with bush but these were policy differences that said what's going on but trump people quit trump like they met him in a bathrobe any jacked off and do a play
but
maybe add big do art out our president added up your heard but he solved the opie i did epidemic this week yet
yeah he solved this was his quote word for word you said this was an idea that i had
this was an idea i had to young
people not to take drugs it's really really easy not to take them
c
tell people not to take that she does he have to think of everything
and then he made a very moving speech about the whole problem he said yes we've had drug drug epidemics before but never have so many of the victims been so white

but god that's not all the president get done this week oh no he was very excited about releasing the jfk assassination files and just as republican suspected they only raise more questions about hillary's email
and you know jfk he lived in a time when bad man hater
was never reported especially among presidents and that day is gone as george h w bush
i doubt this week yes kids i'm talking about the ninety three year old who apparently is addicted to crack
ass crack
a third ninety three a third woman has got forward to say that he groped her from his wheelchair
and he didn't deny it he just said a hero

i love you didn't just grabbed the as he had an police guys had demos i didn't get any way he is emma was before he grabbed the he would always say to the woman
who is your my favorite magician is david copperfield
and his sculpturing evidence that meant a lot of work his spokesman said the president to put people at age that was to put people
the sweltering to put people at ease the president tells the same joke and on occasion has padded woman's rears and what was intended to be a good natured manner
you know it's bad when w's go and play dead stop embarrassing the

fred got a dr de are is air
an academy award nominee actor who started the no film l b j out in theaters on november third i understand he's very personable what do you than



what did look at the they're yelling at you
what did you do to become so popular
you're such a such a pain
i had nothing to do with everybody wanted to be woody's friend and back in your smoke and days many were
but let's talk about your movie because it's a terrific movie to good pizza work an eggplant lyndon johnson i understand you were reluctant to play it because as many of us we didn't like vietnam yeah we all we could see with johnson but as you grow older
as we both
see people in march
i think i'm more forgiving right and you see the good and the bed together more you think i wanted to work with rob reiner because i think he's one of our greatest directors and the
if you look it's almost like grabs is the tale of two presidents because there's the vietnam had been there is always important legislation that he passed like the voting rights act the civil rights act the head start other than it is he was great yeah
any any pass legislation you had the kid has it because you know helping poor people like the war and ruined so he did a lot of great thing he was very colorful guy
so and i think you caught this needy you know he really wanted people to love him i feel like that is maybe were you in the character
we're able to read his you know like everybody to love you gotta do it
oh i don't give a shiner
plainly i don't give a shit because it would prefer it i would i would prefer we would agree with me

i'm not going to say what i don't think just to make the vagaries with but let's get back to l b j because that's what way
i'm here is gorilla

i'll say there i know you guys
guy i've been we've been lot of i'm every long term very long time who smoked a lot of joints to together
and this guy has been expressing what we've been feeling and sound was afraid to express for so long and i think that's why we appreciated

okay thank you very very reason
jesus
in bed health am i going to hurt
okay
that sort of the vulgar part because we have a vulgar president now and before trump johnson was the standard vulgar and like one of the first change in the movie he's his truck and there's people in the room important people to doing government business and he's on the phone to his taylor talking about and we need more room because you don't want a big is johnson is yeah yeah
how could you were landing hiring or and use long
did you talk too many will have used pain
healers and publicly vogue like a prison income right
he he did use father in private but in our current president aids when you've had dinner with trump or i didn't you have a dinner or did have the day with them learn what was that circumstance well and i that invited by jesse ventura
well you like to two thousand and
new york and so will you come with me
you know term and
fair to get a been his running mate on the two thousand and four ticket democratic ticket
and
as a democrat
he is he does media so
and
as brutal it was good
i never met him more narcissistic me talked about the holder has changed a lot
you could see had the standard he was going to bear
i had to work out like halfway through smoke a joint just just silly

is that would you tell yourself about why is the
interesting
he needed prompting yeah well let's talk about that because it's funny i mean you have given it up for about a year and a half now yeah
and i think that's great when we were in hawaii last year in solidarity i didn't want to tempt jews who i didn't do it around you when when we were together but you were one of the pioneers and i'm not going to try to get you back on the wagon at all but i just want to show you know now i just want to show you some pictures to reminisce i mean that you on our very first show of real time
now we are in my backyard and two thousand and three were doing a sketch remember we did a sketch about smoking yeah we did that sketch yeah
okay but here's my hands my point nobody here is us this last year and hawaii after you had given up pod and there we our jeff ross and you know you're lucky
the like okay but not ecstatic
clearly i the next night at your house your porch the you live on because it has no walls so you live in a poor and it's okay
i mean it's a beautiful view it should be there's no was into point
okay so we look ok there too but here's the year before when we were completely big

can
uncertainty about your happy with don't
again not stoned
stop
stop
but that's a strong case
fire
i heard that
but you haven't given up all your happy ways and that's great and i'm always amused by the great dichotomy that is you because you're seen as such a laid back guy and you are i mean you're laid back is it comes as i know you but you're obviously also a very talented driven ambitious person
none in one not into but you're in three franchises
you're in hunger games you
or in the woods the magician one night
me and you're in the movie
planted it
that now how did the hippie
how did this laid back guy get to be the guy in hollywood who's got a monopoly on being in all the
i mean there's a little bit of
a personality and and beads that i am actually genuinely lazy as shit and i
i mean i can get by noon or they you know you'll see me i didn't really get by when when the last time you were my last time you were always the last time your home
january yeah because mr lazy works his ass off and where the benefits because you're leaving a great body of work in this movie is part of it you should go see it woody harrelson
i gotta


okay
an author of the enlisted new york times best seller beyond the messy truth how we came apart how we come together van jones

politics reporter for the daily beast return to devise yo betsy wonder
for national or via whose name you may recall was floated to be the presidential candidate of the never trump movement oh if it had only been so welcome aboard david french
right so let's talk about the republicans they had a big week and i thought it was kind of a microcosm of everything that's dragging our republic down because just flake this republican conservative republican gets up there and he makes this amazing speech and
this was well written and beautifully delivered in the well of the senate and to all about how we can't continue under this man
it was his have you no decency speech and the republicans said yes you're right you should open investigations and they open to into hillary
i'm not kidding guess they're still after hillary
the gift that keeps on getting republicans will never get tired of talking about hillary clinton and always works for them
but she lost she was voted off the island
why is the tribe meeting every week and skills nothing around and a few things i agree on a watch the health care debacle and they had some trouble with that one watching tax reform having trouble with our when everyone agrees that hillary clinton is terrible brings all family it and i will look i mean
let let me let me offer a partial defense here as talking about hillary clinton some of these issues are actually really important this story about how millions of dollars flowed into the clinton foundation in half a million dollars into bill clinton's pocket and then next thing you know about twenty percent every year he was malarkey
when speaking fee and russia
and nixon you know that twenty percent better because your nerves or and i'm not going to grow ebel that there are some clinton issues
are you saying that they rise to the level of the trump issues now i'm saying we can do both you know and not present now but it's still important how this happened it says you that a little worried as it is important in the way it's pathetic any kind of shelter they don't have
what i the worst the worst everyone says i'm know i am a little concerned that people are so happy place has made this great speak he so courageous when you courageous you say and i'm going to stay and fight
get the heck out of here
he ran scampering out is because of banning ban and has a billion dollar in and pointed at the head of every republican is against donald trump and these guys are giving his great speeches and turning the party over to ban without a shot and that's not courage that i agree with you i agree with you that
she stayed in thought she stood in thought i don't think people are all that afraid to ban and bad got to that well because billion dollars yeah a creature ban and is somebody that everyone talks about in washington and on twitter you go out into actual trunk country nobody knows who this guy
two years vote for his candidate
here's my take away the most against people who go against trump that's what they do okay but who go against trump bank will primary voters republican primary voters vote against people who go against trump it against us the take away from this week that's really important is that this is trumps party now yes this is laura ingram said that she
we're not an element we are the party
is this is kind of important donald trump what we first real laughing at that he was even going to get the nomination and then always the president but he's going to get broad die data for last year it's now his party start to like i said people are cutting and running really fast i talked about how primary voters vote against people who were anti trap when we were actually know that we haven't had her about it
primary i just like has not had a chance to face off against kelly ward who isn't very far right ban and support a candidate we don't know how we do and but on i don't have that on that we don't know we'll say we don't know but but here's the real problem to me is that fox news has become
state tv
it's they were always of course republican it's different now as all things with trump it's worse and this is a very bad axis of evil because data they didn't hear the jeff like speech they didn't know about didn't even it doesn't exist the things that we talk about do not exist because they are not shown on fox t v
this for jeff like speech life for what it's worth they showed it live but they didn't talk about and they ended up going to the same player website so their website
the extra had no like headline it was hillary clinton and and the very bottom they took away from this speech just like i could work with trump on some of them
there it is so but it's which show i mean to hannity is trump prada everybody knows they all are brett bear is a good journalist other folks like dean a primo very high integrity in a hurry new is out in trumps not natural and
actually his personality who doesn't get enough attention for being very close and friendly with trump is lou dobbs i've been told that trump will actually called odds at his shell he loves it when dogs goes after mcconnell and paul ryan wheelchair and nine in a recent interview in a trunk as jobs who he should pick to be to fend chair that's not an aberration
at the kind of relationship they had and it is a fox business house too
gives him his agenda
typical fox viewer is now president an old white guy with anger issues or not sure why
so they're anecdotal falls racist field the country is his view and they know that they have this viewership of one person that's all they have to please they very often do give him his agenda you see him saying they're talking point
bizarre to can see this sort of way
in the morning whatever they say on fox and friends he tweets about whatever it and the braves and them for korea that's weird but i also think it's important for progressive and liberals to actually tune in sometimes we've got to be able to go to the able to get our tolerance level up for this kind of stuff because otherwise what happens is we literally have no idea like our cousins and
we went to school with these people are crazy because we're actually in our own bubble and in certain way because we're not learn what can i
just give you a view republican views from the latest polls sixty eight percent of republicans believe millions of illegal immigrants voted in the last election
so that's over two thirds you believe something crazy and completely untrue this is what i mean about i gave the i can't get illegal people to vote

the have to get millions of people do something that americans won't seventy three percent of republicans thing that voter fraud happens somewhat or very often again something we know is completely not true fifty two percent of republicans because of that last one i read voter fraud being so been
what support postponing the twenty twenty election
until we can fix the problem that doesn't exist
so i think that yeah so again in then conspiracy thinking is not confined to the right like i'm not going to defend any that i mean you you could you could throw a number after number including a large number of republicans who believe in revoking citizenship for flag burners which is an anathema to the first minister but we've seen polls that said a whole bunch
democrats believe george bush was behind nine eleven we got a problem with conspiracy think a whole bunch policy in the bush era six least to fifty percent believing that that bush had something to do with nine eleven and so there is there is a conspiracy theory problem in a lot of it is because of the thing the van mention were and bubbles and when you're in bubbles you think the
absolute worst of your opponent and but rather a tried and millions of people voted friday or way he
why so many republicans there's enough it's not true because the president's but it's not going to fire
oh yes there is a journey know if i'm over here but what about this
it's sort of a mammal there's not there's not there's not two things of equal size you think of you think totally depends on the issue i would agree with you
okay
well
well our move on
if jeff later somebody like the wants to really make a difference you said you should go back and fight with they really should do is run as an independent eighty percent of republicans are with trump that means twenty percent aren't you could get those people you could as a patriotic service
split the republican vote eighty to twenty an elected democrats like teddy roosevelt did in one thousand and twelve

on the tip of my tongue okay
ask about edge because this is what the president was jerking this week he said we must fight back with a really tough really big really great advertising
and it was rather gentle on the people who are the addicts and if while i this is one of the things that i think criminal on the part of trump he and the republican party during the primary went out and actually found out which allow people
didn't know that people are dying all over the country you know one of my close friends parents died of the same opiate crisis at killing people and coal country is a national catastrophe more people are dying of opium painkiller overdoses than they were dying of hiv aids at the height of the crisis so you literally have a catastrophe and you could do something about it right now
now it would take money it would take willpower you have to bring people together instead you do a press conference a tweet and talk about advertising you're not going to say people's lives are not going to the you've got morgues that fill up every weekend in some he's read counties they have to order freezer trucks on friday night because they know the more they're going to stop you're not going to save those lives and
on the other people's arms with an advertising campaign it he is demagoguing his own basis pain and suffering and outrageous it's just our

i'm gonna i'm going to agree with most what she said nothing significant has happened here this is a and that's a crime this is a national crisis and it's one that look we got to face facts here we need to the federal government needs to be involved absolutely but this is not something this is something that in some ways may even be more difficult than the crisis in overcoming
aids because there there was a medicine medicines that can be developed that you could take well hear you're dealing with people who are gonna crawl over broken glass to get that next
let me just say i wrote a book a big part of a book is about stuff that we could actually fix tomorrow if he just came together and this is one of them there are in fact medicines now you have medically assisted treatment where you can get people instead of having the detox and die model where you get people just won't have to go and overdose you could actually fix it but you'd have to bring people together to do it and
doesn't actually want to solve the problem he wants to demagogue about in other words with the idea that there's nothing we can do is false false false and we get on this right now another piece of this problem that's really important and doesn't get enough play is the fact that at first it's a lot of drug or types including our attorney general like to talk about how marijuana as a gateway drug in reality a lot of pro
scripture and b o it's are legitimate gateway drugs to heroin use
exactly
both it
data that shows recently i'm gonna say that most recent cdc day and maybe shows that the opiate overdose deaths that happened about about almost half of them are from drugs that were present legal drive them characters are giving people and thirty as tough as doctors were under pressure to prescribe these things pain became the first violate were under pressure from bed
farmer that was push night
and the other thing is that been donald trump been lies about it and says we're going to have a big wall because the walls going to keep out the opiate you have a wall around cbs what do you talk

david
yeah because our responsibility to bed i mean i'm sorry
no now i get that's about as know i say i wasn't even bigger you were going to go there with it but it was enlightening but listen it's it's halloween time and we make flooded this guy roy more who's going to be the senator
his way the senator and alabama that's really that's how we address is it's like howdy doody
watch fox news and all day
and we thought you know this is interesting because this guy does not need a hollow in costume because
he is a halloween costume
and we found that actually in washington a lot of people fit that description they don't need a costume because they are one for example sarah huckabee sanders does not need one
because she's going as marie osmond after a bad breakup
no and congressmen trade county is going as the last face you see before the car trunk closed
ben carson is going as the guy at the end of the bar who say

joni ernst is going as your high school gym teachers roommate
paul ryan
his coaching as an emotionally damaged former child star
betsy device is going as a woman who just found out her new neighbors are mexican
mike pence is going as the guy you're always tells his barber a little shorter out and want to be mistaken for a beetle
steam bad at you go he's going as that weird shit you see growing on trees

and gone junior and eric remember going as the top of the gay wedding

das a study guide to surviving truck while jive


so great to see never
girl old you always have the same i know you're always talking about being old on his show lately and i'm saying you're afraid to die
death metal was but now it's more like yeah
but i be just because i love do it
make me laugh but also because i feel like i'm also have been argument like almost on a weekly basis with other democrats were you're on my side yeah i keep saying democrats are tonight said to nato and you are my ally they don't go for the jugular your ankles so that when they go low we go high now when they make a lot we should go low exactly
people
goodbye
crazy talk to understand that crazy know you don't deal with white supremacists i'm not talking to himself
you didn't do but but yes i mean what what happened to that gene in the democrat
makeup i mean it wasn't that way with bobby kennedy and bend and john f kennedy they were tough they weren't this kind of to nice democrat but busy get laid
well as
certainly part of that i think the problem is political correctness yeah indeed believe i did a show about from your ago i'm going john kerry was running ice i saw him at something and i said you can't deal with these people need to be tough when you're going to do to deal with these republican he like don't worry i can handle it now he did he didn't
they don't they don't announce on where the genus went research and also you have to speak very simply to people they don't want to hear all this and stuff that here on c n n and m me si go right so the jugular the weight trump to he's his smile that where he is it's an only thing that smile exactly he's a terrific con man yeah
but i mean you play club clone that little i know now i don't mean clubs like when you get into theaters in us
and
it's a little the atmosphere is a little more constrained than it used to why you can't say anything now i mean look ugly you can we can because we're a little grandfathered in
again but the old age
yeah we are grandfathered in my grandmother did it
i don't wife doesn't work anymore as his standup highly because anything you say they write it down they tape us a that tweet about it is and like james coin got in trouble last week whatever rose mcgowan it's like a layoff the comedians okay
that can be we like the philosophers of the toy not socrates and aristotle but we either philosophers right now
you know
we are living thing comedians is that because we can work in the club's we don't care about these jobs like this job on my job we can always work so we will say whatever we want will speak to or so
go back to that oh yeah
but all right so let's talk about men
behavior because
this is a watershed time things will never be the same ryan ryan why do you think now i mean what does harassment a year ago when when the trunk tape came out why not five years ago or ten years ago one of the dawn of the women's liberation movement why is it now that finally admitted it's kind of the main
am a little i don't think that men too optimistic because really a need a hill came out and then we had we have clarence thomas
a commodity a different era with social media and all the women joining in and all these you but they're still most men are in power what did then the ones in power they are the ones to intimidate the women they yeah the one i know that you're not going to get the job unless you let me learn unless unless you look at my penis
that's basically that's what they so my i know when you read about the they they all have it
how do you like at it and on now
they eleven ammo
yeah it's just like be like take some drugs running knock you out
that's true it says or or you know like masturbating
just rubbing an erection
i thought i didn't know women or my life i don't know man

what didn't deal or riley do that that gun that woman thirty two million dollars what what could you pass how vile does it have i now and while i i i wouldn't suck them to thirty two million

he's not worth thirty two million
and i must say
when you look at the list of people it is always married good it's always married yeah just say why is because they have shitty sex life
oh yeah
i think they're not having a search of satisfied
lloyd at home and about it now now now that's good then there's nothing wrong with my i open is accused of masturbating under the desk wise talking to somebody was that got to do with him being married
let's bring the lion's den
the wives and well welfare
why business while these decks a joke and
my book your book i have a

donald trump
perfect
at the book is called the great gas powered said call great
i toyed with other top titles what do you think of
the war and hair piece that was why
moby dick head
what other titles digits
santa
lemon law sun rises found out that
when i wrote it for a trump trump anti trump or as if you're it trumps support it don't buy the book i forbid you to buy the
close the book for her

then i think we have to be a sophisticated there's a problem with trying to solve you gotta you are correct that will have to fight about and i love you for it but you mentioned bobby kennedy bobby kennedy was tough on his opponents but he also went to appalachia any talk to those poor white both and got him on his
all i'm saying is we had a great circle that includes women people of color muslims everybody jewish people list as get the circle bigger to take his base away from them and tell you what you don't go and we don't go the nazis are going to go time i go at that happened my country hundred

ellison the track it can we be honest
one hundred and one hundred and twenty million votes we lost this thing by seventy thousand votes spread out through three states and the rust belt and seventy thousand and some people had voted for obama we just gotta go back and get those folks and we have now as you can adapt and that's what the book is about that and models are bugs work
the topic
true
others in the last control
capitalist
so democrats always say they want to win but i just don't see a lot of soul searching some of the issues that might help them forty eight percent of democrats are concerned about immigration and here's what andrew sullivan said this week he said the democrats current position seems to be that the dreamer parents who broke the law or near heroes and their rhetoric
the democrats rhetoric is very hard to distinguish from a belief and open borders democrats increasingly seemed to suggest that any kind of distinction between citizens and non citizens is somehow racist
and when you see in europe is a rise of these sort of like trump like guys and it's always in countries that were lax on immigration and i think this is an issue democrats have to look in the mirror a little about because i think andrew of it is not wrong about this
here's where i take some exception i agree bad beating people up who have some concerns about lobbying broken and condom the bunch of names and stuff like that is not constructive because it keeps us will have an honest conversation
but as a matter of strategy
i don't think that the democrats should throw away the latino base chasing hardcore it people if you are hardcore anti immigrant you are always going to be able to find a republican you like better than a democrat so i think that we could be more and when he wants but the idea that we should somehow become a party that's tough on immigrants
doesn't you say disney this strikes me as and fighting the last war isn't because right after two thousand and twelve the republicans did this big self diagnosis and they said the path to winning is to be more open to immigrants
and that is exactly the opposite of what happened in two thousand and sixteen and i think what's happening
i think the republicans are shooting themselves in the slit innocence was and said seventy thousand votes i would even married in three cities basically philadelphia milwaukee detroit if you have to press the united states using the bully pulpit to directly attack the most popular african americans not just in the country in the country but in the world
have any nfl player steph curry who attacked steph curry steph curry with invented in a lab by dad's want their kids that get a i don't know why
yeah
turnout seventy thousand more people without changing some of these stances republicans i think are way too cocky politically was such a narrow victory and i and i really think that fighting last war them may not really apply when we get to twenty nine thousand and twenty twenty it's going to be a different landscape any other thing is taking a step back
like that politics here is up here is down piece of as if democrats went to pitch themselves as mean to immigrants they can make that case where obama dramatically expanded the practice of family detention what does the practice or taking women and children or babies and putting them in a literal president we have facilities and tax as in pennsylvania that are full of women and barry
young children right now about three thousand obama dramatically expanded that practice so democrats might their talking points might sound like an open borders immigrants are great blah a lot but in reality there's a lot that obama dead as a lot of the obama legacy that's very troubling to immigration attorney is that i talk to regularly to people who are undocumented doesn't this notion
democrats and a spotless record on it and are really soft on enforcement is just not true within they have the worst of both worlds
they're actually doing bed and their reputation is the opposite also not getting them both
so while i mean that was true another number of things that obama he had the reputation of the peace president but by the time he left office he had boots on the ground in syria boots on the ground in iraq and afghanistan in north africa honey you know we're learning now there's a thousand troops in zero eight hundred ships amnesia the first detachment got there during the obama administration
who knew that so there was a big disconnect i think between what a lot of thought about obama and what
i think you're you're trying to figure out what's the pathway out of this ditch the democratic party as far as fallen and you not think everything should be on the table
for me i want to figure out a way for us to hold on to those you got eleven million people in the country they don't have papers but if you've left tomorrow the economy would collapse and you so you do have a country that's based on the hard work of a lot of undocumented people i want to respect those folks and i don't think that you have to that is almost as false
thing now do you like the immigrants or do you like the a white guys who don't have jobs i think he can like both parties to help both and i just think this false choice of been pushed into now we have to pick among pain we have to pick among funerals we have to listen why don't we just get everybody together who doesn't have anything and go fight the baggage that
yeah
something you said earlier democrats are too nice yeah you know joe biden said about mitt romney he's going to put your back in chains okay that doesn't sound very nice i mean the democrats integrate well come on
i've had to trap
amazing
your ability to jerry good thing
i make it look like it's going to think that as president the united states
i in america that everybody at around to the economy and that's not a who was he saying that about into the lack of was talking to african american on talking about the republican that horrific scary romney ryan ticket that they're going to put it all back and change that oh you know the gaff mr
which i'm sure he regretted oh by the way the guy like reorganized and says something like that well he he's capable of saying you sorry i've seen him do it sure did the guy who's in charge now is not well
this is what we go for you know if it's global warming it comes up you know that like well you know we used to have a cold periods
scientists predicted it would be a cold beer
we had hot weather back in the nineteen hundreds or what
it doesn't lose as fixing problems it doesn't help but if the idea of fixing problems is the democrats need to be nastier that's not going to fix the power as an aids but he hasn't but people do want to realistic that was because you have to be nasty to show was real but you know that's exactly the republican argument that i dealt with four months his eyes
getting slaughtered by republicans for opposing trump we gotta be nasty to when we got to be nasty to witnessing no appeal to people the better angels of people's nature and they tell me know we got to be nasty we got to be nasty and they want and not president
i think so too
i don't make when you're sitting there
your i couldn't get your leisure
i think on the on the substance of what's going to make this country a better place the argument and in listening where the idea that that trunk one simply because he was nasty i think is wrong i think if trumpet wanting a running galleon also a lie or that yes and
but we're saying
i wasn't people are having a very hard time and people want to know that you going to be tough enough and strong enough to deal with their problems and there's some stuff that we should fight about what you want to persecute muslims you want to you want this was back jewish people you want to attack brinkley immigrants you want and you want to going to we should have that by but we can't only fight and still have a country that's all i'm saying beyond the better
graham we can find some come down to it
if only one side is playing with civility that side is always going to lose that's that's called during a knife to a gun that's called
and eight two thousand and twelve i don't know i don't know if that's true
i got to go to neural thank you everybody

want to have down they design though in this photo i should feel more sorry for jimmy carter who kind of got pushed into the background or barack obama was just about to make david copperfield

general now that we know george w bush is go to joke well robbery women as you know my favorite videos is david copperfield david copperfield has to admit that i radically when he grabbed the woman's private party or he says my favorite president
david copperfield really does it was for the point
neural the pc police on twitter have to calm the hell down about l and posting this sexist picture of herself with katie barry allen just think he's battling a little harmless fun and katie think she's meeting justin bieber
bringing i'm justin bieber new ruled tattoo artists have to admit that the tiny birds to is there a gateway drug
that's just in weber's first tattoo and harry is today
pays to be such a cute kid now it looks like the prisoner you have to have sex with to get toilet paper

no rule if you don't stop taking pictures of your baby's blood painted like a pumpkin i'm quitting this mommy grow
if i wanted to say and orange as

yeah
finally no real or i must tell me why do people who wrap themselves in the flag are always the ones most clueless about what it represents

like the way trump turn day respectful protest about police brutality into a patriotism pissing match the nerve of these young black men kneeling while an american idol runner up sings the bombs bursting in air song
how dare you exercise your freedoms while we're honoring them
we will not stand for not standing
trump literary said that soldiers have died and we need to spend because they were fighting for our national and oh for fucks sake
no one ever died for the and them
some have died trying to sing it
but trump know that for conservatives the anthem is their senior prom theme song
it makes them all misty eyed the way i get when i hear the captain into nails do that to me one more time
remember this guy john boehner so unpopular with his own republicans they booted him out of beings bigger but they never criticize them for doing this i poured my heart and soul in iran in a small village
provided
the security of the american people

no sir whenever he and cry like a little bitch because someone mentioned
tidy american flag at his club sandwich
they all would think that was great what is it with these people always falling to pieces of her flags
drums in commercials for pickup trucks and
these throat catchers route sixty six and port swings barber shops that still a shave and cowboy hats unless you're a black congresswoman

farms
oh barnes
pictures of we give them a hard on
but a party that things of itself is the tough guys to so susceptible to sentimental isn't that's where they love the paintings of thomas kincaid with his vision of america as one big hobbit village of fairytale cottages
and of course christmas they are so head over heels lady gaga in love with christmas they even imagine liberals have some now banned everyone from talking about it until drug got elected and now the bed has been lifted we could say merry christmas again
they really believe this shit it's like no one ever broken to them that the bearded guy who delivers goodies isn't real


but
but nothing triggers that soft machine part of a right wing or more than the military they love the military the way eight year old girls love horses
wholly and completely with a slight tinge of sexual frustration
they get a tingle in their teens when the
blue angels fly overhead they cry during the president's martian fighting speech and independence day
let's see a guy in uniform at the mall and say thank you for your service and even though the guys thinking i'm a security guard dip shit
last week in his heroic battle against a grieving widow donald trump cent general kelly out to talk to the media and offer us a lesson about honor and when that on or less than included blatantly lying about congresswoman wilson general kelly was
sized which president trumps spokesperson said was highly inappropriate
that's right it is highly inappropriate to ever question a general which it is in north korea
right
this has to tell people not to protest against the police not to question the generals this is not american and that is the problem with all the fetish patriotism it starts with goose bumps
but it ends with two steps
right
i guess

we hadn't
