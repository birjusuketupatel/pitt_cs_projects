back backlash
it's paid for with pennsylvania taxpayer dollars
welcome to h b a pipe passed from h b o maintenance eve real time with him
cameron first pressure is for you guys should we lower the voting age to sixty with that incentive schools to teach civic engagement earlier and with more urgency
i think schools could just teach civic engagement earlier and with more urgency

i think erica senior year and that's when most people i believe take their got was i think we should be doing that every year because that's what we used to call civics yet class okay
my was better
kids these days ago and they teach you like how government works yeah things but drug doesn't know what there are three branches
the house or senate springboard
although i pre registered to vote the other day and i think that's what we need to be doing because right now a lot of the kids my age are voting the way their mommies and daddies are voting and that's a little daunting to think about as i mean that still happens when people are adults but there could be a little bit more freedom is
because as it goes on and again that's the number one predictor of what political party will be part of your parents passed and that's terrifying to think about considering that our parents had failed us oh yeah you really don't like us
okay
piss off the kids any more the merrier
was
oh really
oh no i do we feel about would be a very tight at stanford
so all the way i feel about gotten reform is we need we don't have many limitations on the second man i know i believe in owning a gun and my father has a gun cameron's data has again i believe
both our parents were in law enforcement i do see the reason to meet the reason to have a a weapon and i do see the reasoning behind the second amendment but i think we should have limitations on second them in the same way we have limitations on the first where you can't scream fire in a crowded theater you should be able to get an error fifteen if you're mentally unstable individual i don't get what's so hard for people to understand about that i'm not trying to take
slavery was a thing and women weren't allowed to vote and we did something about that
it took awhile but know if the only thing that comes out of this tragedy is that we outlaw bump stocks and we raise the age at which people are allowed to buy a or fifteen that will be a field that yet because the reality from my perspective is you need to do what we always try to you which is to ban the sale of a lot fifteens universe
background checks and also have the ability to buy these laws magazine but the problem that is it makes way too much fucking sense for our elected officials to take care of
there's a study that today from the rand corporation that shows that these kinds of measures actually have an impact on gun violence
empirical evidence that shows a what's your opinion on like the the fact that the cdc can't research most in this stuff and that's another thing that has this guy dickie that's his name
this congress
congressmen put in the funding for the cdc the so they are unable to study the impact of gun violence in the causes of good that's another thing that has to be yeah wouldn't risk his name was a number
yeah it was only i just landed and i am i think greater things all do you think he was a congressman markets oh oh oh yeah he's aren't the republicans winner
the thing in a waiter what you're thinking what's up with having like all of their records be paper like that's just insane and that's required by law rain
required by law passed by republicans want to hobble eighty when you've tried to modernize these things and keep the records in the way any other a corporation of the big entity would keep them electronically republicans have said no you can't do that limit the amount of time that you could hold on to these things have to keep them okay
we have other issues to get to jon meacham would the founding fathers agree with billy graham lying and honor at the us capital
probably just because it was it would be is it would not be a violation of church and state so much as a recognition of of a cultural figure
madison who wrote the bill of rights and was a hugely important thinker about religious liberty
was actually presented with a case of late in his life about why the us military paying for chaplains isn't that a violation of establishment clause almost certainly strict sense that he said some things are just not worth fighting and i think that's where you probably stand
if you're in jeff sessions current position would you resign
i mean when i read when you read these tweets were trump is going on and it looks like this is the kind of treat you would right if you were in the opposition party why isn't the attorney general way these scarborough dirty joke
through the looking glass and jeff sessions
nothing in common with leaves a confederate soldier
do you feel sorry for the feels something know i mean he took this job knowing who donald trump what and who he is right and you know at some point though you would hope that you would have the intestinal fortitude or the pride to simply say you know
wanted this job all my life but it's not worth it and i'm not going to take that kind of abuse and simply going to tell you go to preserve and mild but he's kind of doing a service for the country by not doing that because it's right john don't you agree if he if he last than trump could appoint someone who would fire lower here
as a sign of where we are in march twenty eight team jeff sessions has become a pillar of democratic work
amazing true not be confirmed for the federal bench right right
amy is there any one particular cars that you see has the potential to unite the many different drugs in america or anything i think it's part of having go at at that
yeah that's interesting
the few things that does unite red and blue america
conservatives
yeah i think effective i think i entered nugent
jeff sessions
i mean like the olympics people come together i mean i'm a little guy i think i'm going to rally around now not to say that they i think fact if if if people the studies that are most optimistic and my guy that if you actually pull people out of their tribes and have them interact assuming
thanks
enormous progress can be made so for example the integration of the military in the fifties was one where everybody said there's no way this is going to work and they went failing that afterwards that was added prejudice in america
now that what this study showed that the integrated you next war and you know there are equal or superior to what they said weiss when you're forced actually when people talk with them
lives are in their hands you use each other's human beings and same attitude stride same sex marriage to actually dramatically change when people started seeing these people as their neighbors their children you know it went from like ninety percent disapproval to sixty two percent approval and just thirty years and are to demonize somebody that you know or group that you know
organizers we have introduced the democrats to the republicans and no it's not just exposure the studies also show that just diverse and exposure is not enough back making the hate each other and more you have to actually interact with each other as human beings when that's car part when you are so tribal right
circle it's no mistake that the civil rights movement the women's movement
the victory in the cold war ultimately came after the mixing experiment of world war two
sailors on p t one o nine were people that jack kennedy would never they would have carried his bag into a hotel
and he the the pacific dribble and really remembered them as as he came through and and the prosperity was important
you know we always the tribes come together but it's always brief and it begins to fall apart again i wouldn't over romanticize the past but i don't think it's a simulation i'm talking about i mean i think where i get my optimism is i as i say in this book i think that alone in my the major powers were what i call a super that it's me and this is not
saying that we've met all these ideals that that we had this over arching national identity
that strong you know not like libya or or but it's strong and at the same time we allow our individual subgroup identities to flourish so they don't all have to melt away i mean we and i think it's as if you look through all the different powers act not even when not if they had to have one or the other but it's strong because it's built around ideas that all different
for all we all cut into the same idea and that is what i find it going away
eric sunni so important to you because you can't just getting people to how do you get people to buy into this national identity unity it's not just by cheering that anthem very loudly right you have the system has to seem legitimate and the dream has to seen accessible to all otherwise to aren't gonna buy into he was about our work cut out for my mother
