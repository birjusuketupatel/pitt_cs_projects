we finally reach the post american world your wrote about a decade ago
what do you know what i was writing about in that book was the posts american were because you had china rising at india rising you had your a bit had come to get the point i was trying to make was were to get a historical shift of power where these other countries often been a long been mired in poverty arising in
economic growth political power cultural confidence
that word has been going on you know the emerging markets were five percent of global gdp twenty five years ago then a fifty percent of global gdp but what i did not predict was that the united states which sort of abrogate leadership
its position because i i argued the united states would still be incredibly powerful it would set the agenda it represented the values it had a way of be able to be the leader and this shift where the united states has decided to literally just walk away from its own creation i mean people forget this was the world at f d r and harry
room and built after world war two and to see the europeans as as he has sort of surprised because they don't quite understand like with you built this house and now you want to set it on fire i am surprised that a trump could rise i mean that is that within countries where as how quickly the republican party
just completely got behind him it reminds me of the neanderthals you know know
no really
i love agent the archaeology and that kind of stuff so you have the humans and neanderthals were sharing the planet
from about one hundred thousand b c two about forty thousand and then suddenly no more neanderthals well i think because humans
they figured out the blogger so they could kill from ten feet away i'm getting this from the movie quest for fire
but i think
so it's like there's neanderthals and then suddenly gone and that's kind of what happened to the republicans i feel they were just there and then they suddenly decide what happened is and this is get one linda was asking what happened to my party i think the trump recognize and the primaries you see this that the the base of the republican party was in a completely
different place than the elites in washington thought the elites in washington who was still repeat reciting the reagan formula free trade you know expansionist foreign policy entitlement reform the base of the party is now a white working class based that wants to hear about mexicans muslims and chinese people they want to hear about how the but the mexicans are dead
new jobs the chinese people as in your factories that muslims are killing you trumps says beat them all up you'll be great again without help
one
i mean the fact is they were like sixteen republicans running in the primaries
and didn't he did not get a majority of republican support during the primaries he got a plurality anyone anyone in a lot of places but the fact that it was so divided the fact that the party had no discipline whatsoever i mean i like to bring back the smoke filled rooms let's have a vetting at peace
right or they decide to run for president for good and they said it you know
should trump did as a political matter whether you would it reality or not he he had sixteen opponents many of them governance and a little to slaughtered the my one by one without really any and of to helping and now and now i think the world and the bills making is today with the never from
trump is diminished dwindled almost nothing but you've got this incredibly high historically i said before historic level of support among republicans and no one even though you can at least the beginning of the administration you want to people like paul ryan and mitch mcconnell as well the go along with trump to get their agenda done well they got their tax cut and now today there still and then
yeah i imagine this earth day
i know right
there are more he's always get another here
they will spend time writing these questions
this is for you hear michael you said you can you said you can be a minority and a conservative but can you be a minority and a republican under this administration
you know that's a good question i think that the expectation at least from what i get from talking to other african americans and minorities in general as sure we don't have a problem with you been a republican bill our expectation is that you are articulating the concerns of our community so yes i'm a i'm a black person who happens to be republican that doesn't mean i don't
care about police brutality and as a man i don't care about criminal justice reform those are issues are disproportionately impact my community and it is my duty if you will when i'm at that table when i'm in those meetings to advocate for the issues of my community because i recognize there will be moments like the moment we see now where you have a jeff sessions running the crew
the justice system and he rolling back a lot of things that president obama did with bipartisan support that benefited african american so it is my char and say wait a minute here you're not going to pass policy legislation is going to continue to disproportionately impact not only black people but brown people so i think you can most certainly be a conservative at a man
already but being a republican right now and age a trump i think is a very difficult thing when i go you know right
sure michael have to be one of my favorite republicans because what we've seen as a of you
pretty short list
some of your best friends or republican you know the islands economic lines but the thing is is that if you have black people who understand it even in that
with administration that what trip is known as undercutting the value of the only black people but republicans as we've been saying and the fact that you at william coleman the fact that you had a legacy of black people jackie robinson for that matter who were republicans who understood that it was about an economic orientation of fiscal conservatism it was not about
the culture wars that trumps seems invested in because one of the fact is we missed and all of this is the demonization of the big black bogey man barack obama and that spooked a lot of people into voting for the republicans a as one
i disassociate myself as a black conservative were what we call lily white conservatism that sort of walls in racism if you will bigotry sexism if you will and i think you have to make it clear distinction between the two and where the republican party
go do you do this
i can understand how you could do it when the republican party was a party that was about economics and free markets and for you right now the republican party is defined by its suspicion and hostility toward people who look different sound different worship different gods so what do you and that's the party how are you distinguish what will it for reading
president from talks a lot about patriotism to the country when we say the pledge allegiance to the flag we say one nation under god indivisible celtics as one nation under god indivisible one nation rhetoric or reality do he truly believe we are one nation and if we are than that means we recognize that we accept that we are country compounded of different folks from all over the world where girl
what they look like they're sex or their religion well that's not how out of your fellow republican
okay thank god or time certainly doesn't family you had to do look at you know hurricane maria and and look what happened in puerto rico always allowed has limited know area invitation to the sea pack and mention not it an anchor
