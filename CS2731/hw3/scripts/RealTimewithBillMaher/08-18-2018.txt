the internet just making sure there be eighteen year term limits for the supreme court yes some people have mentioned i would say yes because trunk got two picks in a year and a half jimmy carter never got one zero
mixing got for reagan got four years
look so i think a little reasonable case to be made for i think you want to have judicial independence which the founders thought could be accomplished were having life tenure by the also probably thought that over time the people and supreme court would sort of match get over long period of time
the ideological proclivities of the party that was a plane them but if you like a stab at people don't focus on you go back to nineteen sixty eight fifty in the last fifty fifty years and if you count the new nominee there will have been eighteen people a point to the supreme court
how many of them were appointed by republican president fourteen of the team so it's over eighty including for from two president who did not win the popular vote correct
because of the jamie raised liberals on the court but the reason why people have freaked out more than they might have is because you know yesteryear there were times when a president gerald ford would appoint someone like john paul stevens who ended up not being is ideologically pure and right wing as some of the people you have now that that problem has been solved by the right
in various ways but it is interesting to see how lopsided it has been even are democrats have been in office for much different percentage of the time then the fourteen to eighteen would would suggest well you know where the founders screwed up they didn't know that we would stop smoking
so they didn't think it will be living in the eighties and nineties
if if we were still a smoking country will wouldn't have to worry about term limits we wouldn't have a country run by people who were all eighty eighty nine years old
so you're saying america was never really that great

they were lousy
america okay
charlie you're going to join other principal conservatives and vote for democrats in the mid term i would prefer to vote for sane rational republicans i just i can't find them
but let me know
god i'm to write in you know the pope rig
just a jungle and would definitely won't be the pope known it
edit
but no you're not going to vote democrat or you know about
only two sides
okay we're going to pick race by race and i do think that america needs to had like to not crazy parties and i do think that of principle contributors all abandoned the republican party then leave it to the the swamp lizards and and the crab pots and the trumpets but as of right now
i don't see any any any constituency for republicans who are going to stand up against donald trump and i do think that the elections going to a referendum on constitutional what about democracy to about the next presidential i mean john case that looks like he's making some moves and the mitt romney if you could find mine consists system
could be you know
do you think there will be a challenge from the republican classic wing of the party there will be a challenge and it will fail because the the party has basically become is jonathan was saying has become kind of the baltic what does that movie
we sat way okay i it tried to eyes
it won't fail if it saps enough though right way to elect a democrat when it will suck say well and that's why
i'm not saying john case it will win the election but as he runs as a third party candidate the third third party candidate will be interesting but then again i mean don't don't underestimate the down from could be reelected a white guy which you know i mean never underestimate the democrats to blow and i'm the guy who says anything even if he loses the election
yeah really funny but okay
jennifer how important is the election of women to the success of the democratic party board drug ability to take that there's that i never get a whore so often right
lack of that
it said the groove on say they're very potent give us the be provocative about why they're not
no and and we're going to see i mean we have incredible numbers for those of you who have been watching this lemon or kill and women are killing it both in winning right they raised their

that comes out of emily's list were in the mid term's last cycle last time and about nine hundred women who had raised their hands to say they wanted analyze let's help in this cycle forty thousand winner
catherine stormy day nose and on earth
grabbing tape and women i think it is women who were going to wind up emanating we hear of this country i'll on it
one of the stardust analysts of the elections in speaking the house is dave last it works it could legal bought and he called issue
he's already called it the ear of the angry female college graduate and i'll tell you when you talk to trumps political advisors that use the constituency they fear most because they already vote in huge numbers and his approval rating among them is i think twenty six percent something like that it's truly they voted for him and twenty sixty i don't know what the college educated women
he won white women and he says i won women he actually means wife women
yeah i don't know what he's numbers they were actually met so bad that will not so bad and sixty and now he's underwater even with white women just white women without college educated

adam is it naive to believe that california wildfires could be random are they truly do to man made climate change oh that's a that's a softball question for me they're absolutely dudes in am a climate but not know that that just eight years are people that are really going after differently you would have ruined you for
people don't realize is that when natural disasters happen and people say oh it's an act of god
we really are the ones who make the natural disaster so distracted and the case of fires it's because we built we're doing this on this show coming this year
because we build homes so far out in the wilderness that now we extinguished every single fire that happens right but those are like forest need a certain amount of fire you know like small fires if with clean out the dead wood when you extinguished every fire because oh my god now people are the suburbs of encroached out into the forest then the dead wood builds up and then when the fire does come it's a real mother fucker
and that's what we're seeing that's what we're seeing right now i mean it's impossible to live in california and not realize that climate change is real and that we live in a man made landscape that is crumbling under it's own way it's really astonishing and a nice weekend everyone
