an arc the greatest generation has given society so much as hollywood seen its own greatest generation yeah
i don't know what
the grid
nevermind
don't get we know the democrats are guilty of identity politics what responsibility should the left take for why politics or so polarized today
i think when we found out show democrats had control of congress for like fifty years and ninety four newt gingrich into that i watch everybody figured out that anybody could win any election that's what created the massive polarity the we have now where it were two to prejudge and he i can win any election right well anybody can but you must admit that the ripper
public is cheap more no i don't have to admit that i went away voter suppression you don't think that voter suppression have been to california with illegal immigrants be registered to vote
that has been studied and it's not true
will trump says they were three million illegal votes
yeah she's numbers right but i think that
it's i know it's a lower numbers about that is it up to a million i don't know i don't know the number of i don't know the knowledge that you know it's a abroad
well i've seen it happen to share
the border just out there i mean i i i live in san diego on order and they do register your legal leverage to vote in our elections
a democrat speaking to the border or it let me ask you as a question about the border because we didn't get to that
we didn't get to this issue this week
district is right at the border as you say jeff sessions it answers we were having a very new policy and it doesn't look to me very american and that is splitting families at the border if a family of mexican people are coming trying to get across the border we're going to send the kid off in one direction and the mother to jail and put the
maybe in baby detention center
splitting up families israel
that's not a year against let me tie would say
i'm going to get booed and one second we should
really the whole family if the parents are here illegally
separate the family in the whole family back and if they want the kid to stay with the guardian or somebody here like someone that it's already here in this country until they're eighteen years old they can do that why i would have family up i which and everybody back and show you apply when everybody going to was policy is it just to be as big a prick as we can just send the message you try to get to this country will
your family then ago
maybe maybe upgraded admit that okay
i just ask what about refugees what about people who actually are fleeing dangerous circumstances you only have a tradition and then i'm opening our i've been working for five or six years
try to get people that are translators in iraq afghanistan syria rename replace should have help with the us military times and their families right moved to india and pakistan but you're not to escape people and afghanistan were been trying to get them refugee status and a us and that's hard to do you still people that are not over here yet that are overseas
who should be here so get that job and we should do as americans but remember this is not about mexico which about people from the entire world want to go to a better place than us not wanting them to bring the same problems that they're fleeing from with them here and there was a nice fighters they want a country ruled by law that's what makes sure safe that's what i want your yes
i'd certainly met people from other countries who say i do not want the shit that i fled coming back here i threw that they'll off when i got here don't make me wear it here
ethan hawke what are the keys social differences you notice between the united states and canada as someone who lives in both countries that a great question
one of the a
you should be piloted and not
you know you'd come on a show like this and you wonder what you're going to get hit with it's so interesting to me because i do i have a place in nova scotia that we spend summers at and they have for a long time the things it's amazing there is you know
you would call rural people lobstermen fishermen
hunters guys out mystics this book
six in the people there are environmentalists in they are extremely educated in in protecting their environment and it really because it's their living in a make it really easy everyone has to recycle they have a bag for compose stay of the bag for plastic bags for different things and you have to do it or you get a fine
so you can go to a hunting shack and it you know a nanny at four in the morning people play in their smoking pot they're drinking and they're putting their recycling where it belongs
you know
they going to they make it really easy to do the right thing
is is really exciting
okay rebel care about the environment and
joan get him started on observation is not an environmentalist but that's what people who want like i do all kinds of days but conservation is not what the wild land to be beautiful i want dear all over so i can shoot them and eat them
plenty more for everybody else rolling
environmental movement gray one hundred as efficient as country and they are the ones who should be leading us the cause and it's and look if you eat what you shoot that's no different than someone who goes to the supermarket so the hypocrisy fact my doesn't have antibiotics that it does an exact roy jones
we're going to do a better job of with trash and at bus stops in this country that we share my god we don't make it a and think what do you think that you can go or why do you think that like the teddy roosevelt isn't great model of a republican leader in college
why isn't the republican administration take that more serious like how how are they okay with when scott food is doing because the history of the greatness to the republican
yeah right to home and making that more available as i feel like that is a place where you could really show the department of interior that navy seal hedge know a former congressman navy seals now the head of the interior and he is doing that i mean he's he's a conservationist those groups like so far better nash
will they try to bring more elephants or around they try to bring more deer their introduce an antelope back into san diego in a way next year when it went out and like lot of thousand years and about scott how can you not about that allow for alone
what about you
do you think he should resign know yes i'll come how come
i think that there's just one he a large international in our environment is so over and socialize with all the extra inches on everybody
one of those give up at all i'm like i don't agree with this guy anything but he why they when because they're not fuck wants see they show
they say and that's very attracted to people and democrats need to learn that schiano total wrestle
this has gotten more environmental question the i'd rather be this with the cdc says diseases born right ticks fleas and mosquitoes never used that mosquitoes in california when the great things about it now i see mosquitoes
out of control and these carry really horrible diseases that they don't have a clue how to fix and you go camping or even years to come just staying and home you're going to this can be more prevalent this is because of global warming because winters are shorter that there's more environment that's friendly to these bugs for a longer time
time it's going to bite you in the ass literally
the air is you know it's not something that rich people can cordoned off that's what i don't get about why republicans why the koch brothers are not environmentalists say can't have their own air though you can't get away from this shit it's going to get everything but you gotta you're selling bottled and remodeled and nothing more fiction
yes i am a global warming
in new york times or talks about this didn't mention global warming wants or wasn't the word climate change wasn't use the word temperature was you one on and has to be one of the main reactor english speakers and what not telling at all on i promise you it wasn't in there they should people fly now from other places and the ease of access in travel and in the world be and flatter that is what has really lead to this
not pigeon flatter now
they're want the one big elephant in this room that we're not talking about is money in politics
just the head in iraq
not immune but republicans really have have led the big money they are think the republican party has been much to corporate guys but now the way too close to wall street way to close we were used to be the party of not free trade a fair trade of mere trade what trumps do and now what i did i did we do and on steel on terrorist
on an afghan and and a adequate what he's doing its kind of the time
right
don't wanna get big money on politics like going to just go back to the operations can't donate
millionaire shouldn't be able to run against guys like me
mccain history that was his big thing
yeah does it really is i had all that was the fast the one bell they got it thank you everybody thank you
