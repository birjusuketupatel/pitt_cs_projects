what what trump did really go ape
was trading about it
do i
he waited till it was over
that show discipline
felony tickets for i think i think said a complicated relationship with me
the way that use twitter at me in the past and danced around without trying to get too angry because i am his base i am demographic
and i am an angry middle aged white guy from the midwest
right then i am his your worst enemy because we the battle is to get as many of the people i grew up with to go with me and that with him and we watched michigan by two votes for precinct that's it
vote for eating right and and so i'm on a mission to make sure that doesn't happen again not just in michigan
yeah
i'm making a film about him to right now he knows that and and he he was on fox news during the election year bragging about how he and i had dinner a couple of times and a wall he's a great guy he's a great guy and he's and i'm like and he's doing this because he's he knows that crossover where i live those eight
million obama voters that voted for trump or also people who with me and so we're in this battle for that that group that will probably decide the next election he needs to come after me and i say bring it on

and democrats effectively battle against gerrymandering republican gerrymandering we gotta do what we did on tuesday that is we have to when gubernatorial races
next year they're thirty six gubernatorial races including here in california tenant a tap large estates if we want to have veto power over bad maps that number one number two winning more citizen the legislature
the legislature but remember the governor's can veto that's why i was so important to to that the gubernatorial race so once again we gotta get out there with data vote next year's to keep because if we control statehouses and
two thousand and eighty will be able to read can figure these districts and twenty twenty two the new saying is when they go low we go local

we don't know chris did something about the trump era make you want to revisit bobby kennedy's lights and like this is the obvious that he's a man of heart
when empathy for people from can express empathy with a widow he doesn't have a bobby we go to the black community to dr king was killed
show him to the you have to make yourself vulnerable you can't just walk going to be tough with all the armor own kind of got to walk in and let yourself get hurt he walked into it the cops wouldn't come in and he had the old tape the they know you know he has to tell and it were up
power of winning and he basically was in his awkwardness
he was true and he ended up saying things like we have to say a prayer for our country and our people but it was all like my brother was killed by a white guy was awkward and yet here is telling people to the greatest hero in history of their history certainly and he's dead be killed by waco innovations killing and here to tell them that he could do it i knew anybody else could do that in light of all
sex scandals lately what do you say about the kennedys bobby and giant were both i don't know they can only guess the important thing about them
okay up be the important thing but soon as you date on people's lives they didn't they didn't things back then
and will loose me and i'll respond to each point where i think kennedy certainly was fucking a mafia occurred that was a problem

you know how to head over sir bobby
no no i having fun is really important in a language and robin has gone into iraq it's for three years of the rankings could be he's going into the yet now dubbed labour guys you go ahead and got to be nice
meanwhile she eyes years in jail economy good to meanwhile the old bands ask the kind gonna grab you give money in west virginia what else i hard to figure out anything else i mean bobby's working against this against a family on issues were going against the i a good as his brother's girlfriend jack kennedy is having sex with jim kind of girl for
this is a problem and and bobby stop stopped from doing it and mayor you have to see i know where they were july when he was a good marilyn monroe or think they both got in there
i mean that's not the against a big deal
in a night case i mean it is will find a book written about want to read about his public life

and i a young man would you watch i said yes i've lost my parents and and when the elevator doors open on the next four he took me to the capitol police so they could put the radio out that there was a child and then he stayed there with me until my parents came talking to me about michelle
