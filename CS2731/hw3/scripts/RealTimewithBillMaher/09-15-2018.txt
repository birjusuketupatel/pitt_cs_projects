okay
will anyone in this administration ever be held accountable for the separation of immigrant children and the abuse they are enduring well accountability is a tough thing to come by lately but
i hope so
probably not
now and it's fine it's appalling and that it is suddenly politically courageous to come up and say that that's a bad and babies in cages are really really disappointing
good girl and a grandson and then what's your advice richard clarke to the next person how to respond to russia is ongoing attacks with you had your old job so there's a building in st petersburg call the internet research agency which is in fact a front for the russian intelligence service so it's world are trolls and that's where all that old and middle
a lot of them are and they're still doing it every day
i would fry every computer in the building we have the capability really yeah we could do that tomorrow with a portion of about tomorrow we will so why don't we do it because they'd replace them the next day maybe but i'd feel that i wouldn't they do too
they're already doing pretty much everything they could do to was there in our power grid there in the pipeline controls and if they're if they're in our power grid couldn't they couldn't they freeze or computers to now they can yeah there's a corner
i'm asking for a friend
yeah
oh
we can't be to what do you know by computers
right forty three
okay
he recently held a shareholder meeting steve for american taxpayers you think the government should run like a corporation that's interesting because when people elected troubling
business
this is more than much the gun
i think we should have
the as we need somebody who's got the discipline in thinking things through in knowing numbers in using data were not trying to maximize profit or exact i bleed and balancing the budget but it's not all about that it's about the outcomes and using numbers and being
systematic and with usa bags we welcome anybody in my country to use our data i mean politicians when they run for office they always write a book
dishes and that's my platform seems like usa facts data is a much better platform that a dumb book if you wanted to run you could say this is i've already done the work i already know what to do it to have sex america and i'll tell you something we just finished up called the state of the facts poll we go out and paul and stuff americans
want the facts
gotta you get that out more and looks a lot
that pretty funny
values they wanted spell say we want to start united you don't want to be opposed to here i want to stay married i like like like it
want to stay where you know my wife doesn't
sure to put it this way
you'd probably do more and stayed married to my lovely wife to him
i'm thinking when you're saying is the fact that i need to start talking louder because they can
i don't want to be the quiet bordeaux
just going off your your great i wouldn't change a thing but but what happens when you have these objective political pull it effect like things is that whenever something comes out that one side disagrees with republicans think that a lot of fact all these things or the congressional budget office or oh it's partisan
what do you say when the inevitable that things partisan because they don't like the numbers comes we don't make forecasts
forecasts are partisan what happened happened what happened we know how many people are covered by health here i won't predict which goes forward we know how many people died in a what age last year we won't make forecasts for kids and be partisan the history she's we can't even look back and objectively say that is what happened accept it
what we need to i got and there's more to say you can add your own opinions but you can add your own facts and we know what happened and i'm getting at is disgusting when people to just ignore their number like

how the clippers going to do this year and we're going to win a lot of games that's a forget

a final question as he cup do you regret your right in road for paul ryan in two thousand and six day
take to do
yeah
not voting for my party's nominee i don't regret that and i'm chance on that all the time and yeah of course
i don't regret that with every day i and true then i think right in that in that for me it was not for me
don't really help now it did it
there is only it were me is only two parties only into people running it seems like i couldn't adults are either but i can tell my sign in twenty years can agree with that either awful oh yeah
yeah hillary was going to be anywhere near as bad as trump worth while i can't forecast by she was a terrible terrible can't candidate yes not president would she have been a terrible president i think remains rate based on past it close to how terrible trump is well that's a high bar okay
so i'm sure people make assessments and one thing is always better than the other isn't the irresponsibility and to pick that out hold your nose and do the right thing i did not think one thing was
now they're really seem trump for almost two years and you think hillary could have possibly been this bad
in different ways yeah i think she could have like what like what would she have done that when the magnitude
relax i didn't vote for either i know and that's the problem but where i don't know
when i voted for nader i copped to it i said i was wrong
you believed that i don't believe my was sorry okay but know i'm just asking you what hillary hillary have possibly done that that would be as bad as trump has been i think that she's deceptive and on accountable and ways that people don't condone
don't don't know we have that now it's awful but not really as deceptive and you can judge that you can inspectors to do is told five thousand why i don't regret not voting for okay
that question not even not about you have stood up to my whether a glorified thank you everybody
we had a night
watch
my not
on h b o con
i think based back when seasons here this pack ass other his grief doesn't go away
the i'm to grief just learn to live with it
don't our agree
close your him moving and honest discussions others have experienced life altering office
trying to spend as much time as possible my kids
to listen to other is an anderson cooper wherever you get your pie ass
