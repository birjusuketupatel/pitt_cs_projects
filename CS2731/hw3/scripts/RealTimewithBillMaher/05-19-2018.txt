so i don't want to be the web like enjoy the hell out of it tomorrow are you gonna watch of course you are going to be great when a be list actors marries a man who will never be king in a country that doesn't even met

and event so important and even the russians are in fixing it
yeah
this a while but first happy as the former f the special agent or author of messing with the enemy surviving in a social media world of hackers terrorists russians and fake news clip watch

right so listen
in light of this shooting we don't know a lot about it but it is of course involved with social media is everything is your book is a lot about that you have something a phrase i thought it was originally and click bait populism you think this applies here would to tell us when it does we could not have donald trump is present
before the era of social media in there or audiences that hit power him what he's been able to do and what other leaders like the leader of the islamic state have been able to do is use social media to power their agenda and when it crowd leaders aren't born any more a crude through repeat weeds likes and shares and what we're seeing today
a or audiences taken on the tactics the same tax that too he said the russians and using it for their own partisan purposes we don't really need to worry about the russians at this point because everybody's copy in their playbook
that within twenty minutes of the shooting
there was fake information about the shooter the right wing is always trying to make these people into leftists they faked him with a hillary had on right
and people don't really check this stuff they are going to sides first of all that confirm what they want to believe that to begin with right right this is all about confirmation bias an implicit bias confirmation bias is i only pick that would i want to hear implicit bias is if it comes from my friends family or people that look like me and talk like me then i will
one and believed to be true and no one can shout that down so the first thing you see is what you tend to believe is true and that would you see the most often and that's why this social media and this information we saw like today can mislead people defame people it can ruin people's lives and yet none of it is true in it's very hard to correct them falsehood

the shooter had two subjects on his instagram account guns and trump
i don't know what that means but i don't think it's good know mean what we've seen across all of this populism whether it's jeff hardy populism we used to talk about with isis islamic state or with the extremist groups in the united states it's violence and it's a promotion of violence and we've got easy access to weapons we've got unlimited
access to social media very easy ability to make content it's a dangerous
just the way they micro target for selling products they do it with people's opinions to i know you've said that alex jones or example is perfect for for word russia is doing because he will lead the right to the gullible idiots that's right people that are falling for this often times are new to these information
sources they don't really know how to evaluate them their new to social media and they're hyper partisan they really want to be part of what i call a social media nation in the more time people spend on cell phones and with their virtual friends the more connected they come with them and that search to overtake literally trump physical nations those people that live around
around them like americans so they start identify not by the american flag or a common beliefs and values in democracy but hash tags avatars buyers and pictures you want to know when isis supporter is that's easy go look for been one pictures are how cute pictures their daddy pictures and isis flags if you want to know the true
i'm supporter is well that's may mega had mega trump train in a handful of other hash tags and the next one that come up is the resistance i mean if you want to understand how trump overtook the g o p it's the same way isis overtook al qaeda and how the resistance could overtake the democrats that's the next real social media bubble that's come out when he mean the
resistance could overtake him i took the resistance was the democrats jesus it's worse than i thought well
it's true i mean among are they different and said you can understand there's more of an identity attached to the social media nationalism then there is to these actual traditional organizations so al qaeda used to say how do we know these people are and al qaeda radio pieces we don't actually believe in these things trump supporter say and now we have the resistance
which often times is that the battles with traditional democrat so and in the mainstream left so as a long time after year in what do you see this week when trump since there was a mole from the f b i and my campaign
doesn't do moles and campaigns do they know it's a bunch of nonsense and i mean it's yeah
the rush
don't need to make fake news because the president makes plenty for him to use
the new threat really is that we have american active measures we have americans that are destroying us institutions with complete fall so the f b eyes mission is to protect the united states so if they had tips that there might be a russian infiltration into the united states to meddle with her election which has been found out then they should go after that
so using a confidential informant a trusted source to go test out those lead it would be negligent for them not to do that and they were doing what they should be doing protecting america

how it has turned around about the f b i i mean i was freaking out when trump won the election because at that moment i started to the i was in his pocket
there were calling the f b i trip you yeah the trump ville near running right they were saying that me release that letter eleven days before the election that song calorie because he was losing control of the f b i he had to do that from pressure within his own organization under no that's true
but how did the f b i completely turn around this is so scary that they are so quickly able to change people's minds on a fundamental matter like who who with the who is the f b i with yeah it's interesting that the president likes to pick on people they can't fight back namely the intelligence community and the f b i wrote can't come out in defense
and themselves who can well the milan investigation can but they're going to do things properly they're going to go through sources they're going to go through methods and traditionally from what i remember it's a very conservative organization i remember going to the service i remember going to the seventh floor of the f b i gore's with a green shirt one day and there are like white or blue here and yet
what do you do it
yes i've always been a big fan of squares their squares keep society going in ways i could not
my read through it is very true i'm not the one hunter i'm drawing on the cave of the wall but that's not essential
did was much more essential what what do you think about rudy giuliani saying
a guy just threw up at the
throw up in his mouth
right my right

im saying that you can get information from a foreign government and that's perfectly legal you know when iran people try to get dirt on may it's not nice but it's the way it doesn't matter if it's or russia or that's crazy to right now
america first means americans first don't take anything from a foreign country was trying to destroy our institutions destroy and put divisions between our own people so that they fight each other so they can break us up into pieces divide and conquer us you don't do that and what we have seen is even in other cases let's go back to
gore vs bush there was a gore staffer who received a playbook essentially for the debate what did he do he said i'm turning this over the f b i and i will recuse myself from the debate because i don't want one to be seen as doing dirty tricks and to i don't want anyone to think that there was some
up when the debate comes that the exact scenario if the russians show up at your building called trump tower as rushing government attorneys the first call you make as the f b i and the last thing you do is shut the door and don't let those people and



wow
see our area and thousand and cia operations officer ran as an independent and the two thousand and sixteen presidential election please welcome and mcmullan
the savage love columnist and a host of the pod cast savage love dan savage

they are apparently it's actually very wise says back
i'm getting too paranoid isn't really that scary out there as it am i having a bad week or because i tell ya i i feel like term is swimming
i feel like he's remaking this country and into his own ugly image there have been school shootings before of course but we've had this is the sixteenth this year
that's the most ever
i read that november ninth day after his election
the most hate crimes recorded that year he calls immigrants animals
i saw this guy ranting about the new york lawyer the million a lawyer ranting about you're speaking spanish and he says
my next call is to ice
haven't done that a no fly zone that survives in new york city get the hell out of spanish triggered see that is what we're proud out
they were big but i don't think they would go i'm going to call ice on you i think that's a gift and we don't have a solo across country of white people calling the police iraq people who happen to be walking down the street carrying their bags to a car after staying in a
a hotel overnight
trump has been the great this inhibitor and what he's just and hypnotist lot of great weather leno's that was that was under the service and a little bottled up and should be bottled up because it's a poison
trump is just open the floodgates and the poison is coursing through the veins of our body politic and are entered citizens and it's horrifying that i'm depressed i think it's worse for us here in the west coast because we wake up to trumps early morning tweets it's the first thing we see people on the east coast can brace themselves for five minutes
i think dan says is absolutely correct i think some of these sentiments have been cocked up and sort of hidden in caves for a long time and in dark corners of our politics but it's not just trump it's all the leaders especially i hate to say republican leaders who sit by silently core as these things are
needs to be more of a counterbalance it has to come from the right has to come from republican leaders otherwise there's going to be a segment of our population that increasingly is going to be led down this path i call bullshit
i'm already
face you were saying this
republicans have been cranking up the races town for forty fifty years the southern strategy
but saying like dog whistle dog whistle dog whistle along comes trump who takes the dog whistle and throws it over his shoulder and picks up a little horn and just
maybe lead the logical conclusion of republican politics about fifty years of republican i her as but i haven't agree i haven't seen more of a symptom as opposed to a cause but i do think it is circular and he is making things worse and we do need more leaders to stand up one of the most troubling statistics i've seen during the era of trump came in a canopy
all in in january of this year seventy two percent of republican voters believe that trump was a positive role model for children if that has no leading indicator of trouble i don't know what is and
a poll numbers keep going up he's in the mid forties now that's normal territory for presidents and americans thirteen percent of them think he's honest they don't care
they don't care that wonderful start to care if we continue to have the school shootings i mean like the sort of
we talk about you know i one of the things that made me totally unable to vote for trump was a famous you know the hollywood reporter tape right well the access hollywood exceeds me when they enter a has grabbed heads donald trump grabbed by the pepsi ok and it is
it's appalling the fact that we are not trying to do everything possible to try and stop these shootings is disgusting you have to be twenty five years old to rent a car why don't you have to be twenty five years old to buy a gun we should try
when parents today put out a press release saying let's stop naming the names of school shooters because all they want is that notoriety let's try that let's try maybe even holding people like the one that just happened today he was using the gun in his father what do we hold people criminally liable
the republicans passed a law that made it impossible to sue car manufacturers for libel and they can't be held to the same standards in any other company producing a product for the consumer market in this country then again we had shootings before donald trump but i just think if you if you made
then diagram of trump and what he's brought about
all right types and then just these internet unhappy types right but we don't want to say that obama is responsible for sale or clinton our at all and i know what i'm saying that all we're just doing what you said before where was the word to use this inhibitor this in the head that are
twenty seventeen was but i think the worst year in terms of casualties from her shootings in four of the five worst in history worst mass shootings in our history happened within the last five or six years i mean this problem is getting worse and again two thousand and seventeen was the worst of the most appalling thing i read today was the more high school students who died in school shootings in america this year
than us service members had died in the two wars that are still under way that were involved so sorry schools are more dangerous than iraq and afghanistan and they did you see the interview of the one student today where that person asked her did you ever think this is this would happen in your school and your answer was yes
that is unbelievable so appalling about it was the report it was asking for the comforting banality yeah so that the viewer at home could like relax about this not happening where i live right or like return to normal expectation this isn't something that happens every day and this is something that fucking happens every day in this country because of the n r a the g o p
and i asked
like it when there's a sex expert on the show
you nothing i'm an average
so this in sell thing if you haven't heard about in cells stands for involuntarily sell but we did a little bit about it a few weeks ago on the show and there was a tragedy to them now
guy in toronto only a couple of months ago or last month i good ran a car through bunch of people because they're angry they're angry that women don't like them and they can't get laid they want to
and there was one a few years ago in santa barbara and this is a social movement now and they want the government to provide prostitutes for the not quite
bernie sanders
they're beyond geographically prostitutes they they talk about redistributing sex as a commodity and it's about really insulating women is handmade tell stuff not about sex workers it's about the government giving you a woman as a slave not the government giving you a voucher so you can go see a second they're nasty they think women are receptacles
right
and they wonder why they can't get laid exact
if we can zoom out for a second as write a sex advice column i do with sucks of those packets are your everyday from people who are miserable because they have an untouched ever their virgins or they haven't had a relationship between twenty years sexual deprivation and romantic deprivation does make people miserable not all people become in cells become part of the end result
movement but this is truly a misery doing that kind of loneliness and that kind of despairs we have to figure out there is a lot of people out there who don't have sex and relationships there's a tiny percentage you become active in this insult committee what's the difference between men are socialized to believe that women are their property and they're entitled to women's bodies and that meets with the black mold and must
algae the grows all over the internet and those are the two places we need to really intervene
men are socialized to what they expect from women and the massage any that runs riot on the internet that creates the insults not sexual deprivation but would change when i couldn't get laid
it was i good okay we'll start a band become a doctor
know
get a job at a restaurant they're always fucking each other
morley and make yourself who are they going to go over time
the problem though
i think what it means we needed to do besides it's socializing males differently is we need to be stigmatized decriminalize sex work because you know you have social skills most people who have social skills even if third a dry patch and they can't get laid they're going to be able to get laid eventually you know there are people out there who don't have any social skills the vent diagram have no social skills and in cells
circle and
we
yeah that's a lot because of the phone will spend all day on the phone you don't have social skills
when you think of sex work and sex workers and decriminalize and stigmatizing it's not just the stigmatizing stacks worked for the sex worker but also for the sex buyer and what the culture says about someone who buy sex is a criminal these a misogynist he's a monster he's a loser and so one of things that get said about the in cells is why don't they just go see sex workers well we already feel like losers so going to sex workers going to make
that were especially if their prosecuted we need to do now i don't want to wake lock my friends were sex workers and rooms with violent rage filled in cells but in the same we socialized medicine not stop social going to expect women to their property and nice to meet on sex workers and sex work there are some people who the only way they will ever get laid his to buy is to pay for it i mean that shouldn't be
the stigma to think that people are if people were quadriplegic like the movie the our those sessions with helen hunt oscar nominations quadriplegic the only way this person is ever gonna have sex in his life is that he buys it because he's so physically disabled will some people are so socially disabled that their only outlet for any sort of sex again is
yeah i mean we have an expert here on these issues all that those comments stand just as they are
i have to say this isn't new i mean people who struggled but some arm unfortunately you have the here
how can i say i have to say i'm i'm evidence that you don't need to look like dan to get a gay and i mean you can you can get a date
the high of a less complex answer just run a few laps and brush your teeth and get out there
edit
people who are right yeah i know adapted the bear and repulsive but the put the other thing i have to say about this is again this this challenge i don't think his new what what has brought it out in this sort of way in the past couple of weeks learning for the first time about this in sell movement i felt so all because it just seems sure darn crazy right but what i think what
it is as we have a massage and mystic leader a president who scapegoats people for one problem or the other any combine this sort of thing this massage any in the scapegoating blaming other people for your problems and it gives rise to the vocal the localize in of these feelings that i think you're confusing thing with them
sergeant is to happens to be our president has had many wives and has as we know as had sex at many women and paid for and paid for it so yes and paid for it but it's a confusing message when aside i said
in the case trump paid paid for this he also said he tried to offer money to stormy and karen i'm just saying trumps to massage and he has not turned women often will and fees okay i let me interrupt for a piece of comedy
but i do enjoy the that times married for us magazine us magazine should send me a frigate fruit basket
because we do this all the time twenty five things
you don't know about me busy
okay so this week we're doing michael cohen
i got on my kids use air quotes from they call me a liar
the reason i have sixteen cell phones is because i grew up the first fifty and the toilet
based on that stormy daniel sketch i can't believe how hard i used to look
i can get you some clean urine
i was forty five years old before i found out ice picks can also be used to pick ice
i do crossword puzzles when i'm waiting for line to dissolve a body
and i mentioned us lazy lawyer i think when i'm stealing a ring off corpse corpses hand and get stuck i run it through don juniors
i'm a jew who acts italian my nickname in high school was much sugar partners yeah
my first media parents was me dragging a slice of pizza gonna fly

and may oh you are bitches i'm already in russia
denmark
see is failing to deliver economic growth and how to fix it
wow

congratulations on your book and a terrific i think you have the right topic i'm also worried about democracies a dying tell me why so many people aren't concerned and when you say democracy is in trouble i think a lot of people would seem so abstract how do we make it personal to them and let them know it's important to bear actual
while while their whole host of factors that are suggesting that democracy and to seize for one thing voters participation rates are down considerably on the around fifty percent everywhere here well maybe the united states is the vanguard him liberal democracies and i'm particularly focused on the us but of course across western europe where democracies are so prevalent we are
seem very low
participation rates are low income households even worse it's less than thirty percent by some studies in the deep concern is that this is really far from the one man one vote mantra of democracy but the other issues that money has seeped into politics
about one hundred and fifty eight families in this country that responsible for fifty percent of the of the political contributions to the president in two thousand and sixteen lobbying has doubled in the past couple of decades people feel disconnected actually disaffected and their study some pew them the think tank that eighty percent of americans just don't
even trust the federal government to do what's right and a regular basis and we don't really teach the with of that and should anymore so i think i don't think people know what's missing because they didn't know it was there
i think that's absolutely right and you know issues around civics and education but also there's really no minimum standards for being a politician anymore and the way that they used to know we don't have politicians who have experience in agriculture is farmers and teachers and lawyers and we now have a professional politicians and i think that's a great disservice to us as well
so a lot of people around the world younger people they look to china know because china gets things done but it's not a democracy so you're hitting on exactly the central part of the thesis of my book which is this my nokia in political in liberal political systems is particularly problematic all the problems that the global economy and the unite
states is facing over the next decades or long term intergenerational problems things like the amount of debt income inequality worsening the risk of technology killing off jobs i mean those are all very very deep structural problems and yet our politicians are very short term that thinking about no next election and this creates discuss your how do how do we make
i'm not do that way but i mean that's the really i mean that's why china succeeds because of course you know if you have a dictatorship you don't have to ask somebody with we should do with they go watch but switch from coal and let's do it tomorrow and they can do that or they can bring people out of poverty which they have yes you don't want to live in a country or i wouldn't want to live in
a country with the government exactly we live here because we want to they can think twenty five years ahead we don't think twenty five months ahead he has how do we devised politics i think that we can incentive buys them by linking their pay to longer term outcomes i think one of the areas while their compensation i think should be higher but they should be forced to
justify their compensation just the way we are forced to say the laura
in that sector yeah so loudly it
drugs in that right exactly but just in singapore for example the politicians are actually paid bonuses at the end of the the yeah based on long term outcomes what happens in life expectancy what happened to gdp i mean in this country and politicians and paid we get people like the discount pruitt go ahead of the yes i think he's in government
just because this is as good as it's going to fly first class you know he's in it for the production well you know i think there's been so much of a revolution or on compensation in private sector i don't see why we shouldn't apply said stringent rules to the public sectors well but some of your fixes for democracy sound like going backwards
they sound like maybe they're not for you're talking about waited voting which is worse on people who are experts but how do you determine that sometimes get moreover a vote and what they used to call a poll tax know giving people an exam before they can vote i can certainly see this
there you have to profit
i heard the what we certainly don't want that i mean i think i'd be the first person disenfranchised if i actually started to put proposing waited voting so we don't want it in a way that does adjective such as wealth a race or gender are the the guidelines and but as an immigrant coming to this country you are required to take a civics test and essentially i think it's really about
showing engagement and caring about the civics civics and also the political process and that's really what i think is worth considering
that sounds like a good neutral place to to weigh in and maybe he started the referee referring of the girls are issue because course this week
open the american embassy in jerusalem us which did cause a riot as was predicted
course people are blaming both sides what's your view well when is they're not a riot in that region of the world i mean i think it's an armor
it's incredibly incredibly infuriating to me that we tend to be so short term on these issues why don't we have a set of proposals that are longer term that actually can stick in a way that is much more fruitful made this but the a bandaid interventions and in i do understand that there are some but i've been to jerusalem i know
know that people are living cheek by jowl from very different religions i don't see why we keep coming back with these very short term policies that we know are going to be problematic in the long term what do you
i love you but the riots were not caused by the end the see move know i should they were linked they're not like they are no know they remains much worse than these demonstrations were going on but they explain how does anyone actually israeli thousand and eight when hamas attacked israel and two thousand and twelve and and attacked israel
two thousand and fourteen the embassy was in tel aviv all of those times
this was no this was intentional first of all these protests him and going on for six weeks and they intentionally moved up the day so that it would coincide with the opening of the embassy move so that we would all be discussed in in heartbroken when we saw this horrible split screen of a farm could trump looking like she was at a country club next hour or desperate
diner yeah i agree with you they planned that absolutely right and i'm just saying let's not fall for a trap it is being set by a theocratic authoritarian rule that is send the children are for rooms know
i couldn't agree more with all of that
there's this idea and i would call it the soft bigotry have lower expectations so before when people booed me on the subject but i think they're the bigots when they just assume that if something goes on in this part of the world as you said there's going to be riots and you can't organize your foreign policy iran choose what what is muhammad
going to do
while i'm running
shut everybody else
we're wondering where wondering why now why did the why did the us government move him as he did yours will now but this was going to happen previously past administrations have thought okay will doable will do it as a part of a larger peace deal that was sort of where the right in the left on foreign policy were but we have a different situation you know we have a president who is increasingly vulnerable
because he and his people's families and his administration his campaign are being investigated by and a special counsel and everybody else mid terms are approaching the democrats may take the house back and he'll be at risk of impeachment he was throwing red meat to be that's what was yours
this has been the capital of israel in every country has to decide grew up and we've got to be able to dissect what the right policy is there for the united states but in what's motivating trump in that movement now in the way it was done because in my view we could have done that and we could have done it now but we could have done it in no way that may be extended
an olive branch to the palestinian authority maybe not have much
i agree about her got it's the palestinian authority that's in misery in gaza is they're the ones who are cutting off a boss is the one cutting off the electricity to guy's not vote for complex reason you have a terrorist organization running gaza so it's it's it's which complex as you hundred and nineteen forty eight harry truman recognize israel
when it was first announcing it was a country and a lot of people in america said if you do that there's going to be riots and there were riots now would you go back in time and say harry truman shouldn't do that because there were going to be right and we shouldn't have thrown moving away of something israel netanyahu wanted desperately trying and so it was a point of leverage he's a
there goes the worst you make isn't guys in some concession not of israel to try to tamp down the violence or or or come back to the table and negotiate in good faith with not hamas but the palestinian authority which they're not doing and so trump just through that away and didn't use it as a point of leverage and no longer
a bad deal maker he's got some pretty good deals of the last couple of weeks i mean he's guns for him yeah absolutely
i just think that i wouldn't dismiss them as outright being a bad deal made about john harbaugh yeah oh yeah to us and but you know i try to the extent that think that's exactly my point is that his base in his is a direct audience loved exactly what happened
he's made promises and he's he is keeping them like it or not that's the point i did what kills me is that he's inviting these korea i mean it's not just evangelicals it's like katie it's heyday it's bad guy jeffers it for islam is born in a of hell and hitler caused israel one of the people that travel invited to the opening of the undersea to give a prayer was this
reverend hey you got yeah most often became camping because he said that hitler god sent hitler to hunt the jews because they rejected christ and he's the dude and netanyahu is fine with this he's the do the trump invites to the embassy to give it the jesus right hand robber jeffers i mean it's all a show it's a production for the base that's what this yet
not to say not to say that the policy of moving the middle east jerusalem isn't the right thing or that we have new to i agree kills me and the reason i grabbed the going to go exciting
just spit it kills me that trump and the republican party are turning israel which should be a progressive issue into a right wing one and i think it's a was turning
it's now not one single democratic are showing on rails the either israel did that under obama went to war with obama and democrats if anyone turned israel into a right wing issue the last eight years it was the hypocrisy of people who who this position and like where would you rather live with your in the middle east
in gaza there's no real low our pride terry the guards it's not your values yet they're defending my okay so i once had queen of jordan on the show and they said we'll will address or as your highness and i said i and will not
not it as queen
or of that area just because any clean and i bring this up because the royal wedding is tomorrow and we did something on the show a couple of weeks go about grandfather fathering stuff from old times and not getting upset about how everything has to be what we used to think back in the day and i made the point that people are doing things
today that are going to look terrible i think the way we treat animals is not going to look good in the future i mentioned beauty pageant
still have to look
and i think calling people your highness i know that the biggest issue in the world
but it bugs me
i think it's really stands out like a sore thumb when we're trying to get our alitalia and about everything else and we were happy to do it americans loved the world the more than the british like oh yeah we to a british really wanted first family and their surrogates right now
that's right
ask ask or to defend monarchy just a little bit learned something to be said for taking the power in the trappings and the majesty really of the role of head of state and pushing it away from political parties and political power that the trappings of airforce one in the white house the palace been benefits republicans are benefits the democrats depending on who's
in power in the u k and other constitutional monarchies in northern europe vat is the royal families shit and the politicians don't get to get their grubby hands all over it and exploited for political gain and political benefit and there's something to be said for that the role of head of state being separated from political but to other european countries subsidize the monarchy the way
the british to him and it cost them a lot that's a big house clean and that's not the only house they got summer castles and giant plate what why and the prime minister is like in a office park
there was like that's where the monarchy should let me see donald trump in an office park is approach normal
yeah but i mean it just seems ass backwards to me and i don't know why they the foot the bill for that
last issue
gina hospital
was confirmed she is going to be the head of the c i a l a
i mean there was a lot of controversy about that because she did run a black side apparently she was somebody who was overseeing torture in two thousand and three when it was all the rage
and i think it's okay just because whoever is behind her would be worse at least she wasn't on dancing with the stars
yeah complex issues here i'm glad we had the national discussion again about the enhanced interrogation and in torture and all of that i mean we were not in the right place before as a country a wasn't just it was deal jr elected officials on both parties actually you are aware of this we moved on from there
they're mostly the president still talks of torture but as a country we've moved on i hope we never go back to that but i will say that my concern with gina hospital not been confirmed was the president trump would then nominate a political loyalists to somebody who would use the great powers of the central intelligence agency ago
an organization i was which i was proud to serve for over a decade in perhaps turn those on the american people on behalf of the president for political purposes we can allow that to happen i don't believe gina and experienced professional having gone through her thirty plus years of experience they're having experienced a national
mistake with she were announced you that's right now israel is that enough but we still geographically i may i i think it's not over his intimate thing that because the president says he still wants to do and not just about the president i think the united states for decades in the past has been the vanguard of true
justice and values and what we've seen over the last several decades it's actually been quite disheartening as somebody who's one of the poorest regions of the world and we expect much more from the united states is not just about legality it's also about morals and ethics country and we're talking on the stand that scene is that right
the moral authority to tell other countries you can have nuclear weapons because when we first started doing that it was like everybody understood where the good people example or the people who would never use them except were the ones who did one
where the people who always stand for right and good and we're not that we don't have that authority and get more i'm not for other countries getting nuclear weapons but i can see why aren goes why should you be telling us that have nuclear weapons
you're not a dirty place now
the enhanced interrogation it's not enhanced interrogation and torture enhanced interrogation is towards your one of the techniques that was described was locking people in these boxes were they couldn't move money ago to say amateur if you go to dhaka the concentration camp outside munich there is a room full of the boxes that they locked people in the torture them the things that were describe
having is enhanced interrogation when the nazis did it was torture it's still torture when we did it it was torture okay thank you

it will look like this

the chinese family that claims that bought a puppy and raise it for two years before they realize it was a bear

there are more cat people

our oldest boy who was taken do or truck rally in indiana has to tell us at one point during trumps page he realize oh my god my dad is an asshole

and finally no role of all the fairy tales we've told ourselves here in america the one we most need to get rid of now is in america no one is above the law
like conservatives could we be i'd about this magic infallible constitution that jesus personally delivered to the capital
it's incumbent on the rest of us to remain clear right about its flaws and when you don't have to follow the orders of law enforcement as trump clearly doesn't you are above the law
i'm tired of hearing t the lawyers say the president can't refuse a subpoena even rudy giuliani said that he said you gotta do it i mean you don't have a choice you except that was a nine hundred ninety eight when clinton was president
now rudy says we don't have to use the president and the united states
as where these three ex wives can tell you he's not really good at being married to anything

i know liberals have this vision of trump forced out of the white house and arrested but that's not going to happen no matter how many cartoons or that you post on your facebook feed the news is tightening i hear people say no the news is not tightening his face is always that color
the constitution does not give permission to indict or prosecute a president yield can't legally resist arrest but he can could you ignore a subpoena could you pardon yourself if you're obedience to the law
strictly voluntary or compelled by shame of which he has none you are above the law if you don't believe me the next time a cop is writing you a ticket try saying i don't think so office or your traffic stop is a witch hunt
don't bother arresting me either i've already part and myself executive privilege bitch
checks and balances is a cute theory but have you met paul ryan
the constitution only has two week courses for an evil president the twenty fifth amendment which allows the cabinet to remove a president who was crazy and incapacitated which might work if trumps cabinet wasn't crazy and capacity

and impeachment but impeachment means nothing without conviction which requires sixty seven votes in the senate which even after the best blue wave election ever would mean at least a dozen republicans crossing party lines not going to happen were on the honor system
and republicans have fresh out of honor

john adams had it right back in seventy and eighty when he said there is nothing which i dread so much as a division of the republic into two great parties but that's what happened and even the founders couldn't foresee our current level of tribalism were half of this would hear laurel and a half would hear ya

they never imagined a congress full of shameless partisan enabler who wouldn't turn on trump if they found out he was using the eternal flame to light far it's

and in that atmosphere
as president doesn't have to do anything anything except explore how far he can go until he stopped like the way he used to walk into the dressing room with the this universe pageant
oh i know i know we're playing three de jess and he yeah he's playing i tip the board over
because here's what's going to happen muller will requested interview trump will say no mother will then subpoena him trump will say go fish
it goes to the supreme court their parties are now to we learned that in bush vs gore but say they do the right thing and order him to hundreds of peanut and he still says know what do we do then called dog the bounty on her

that's when the same experts will be saying a president has never defied the supreme court stop telling me he'll never do that he always does that
it's not normal is not an argument that works on donald trump that's the kind of dare that make some hard
like a penis pump that runs on coal

if the supreme court rules against him he'll attack them just like he did the f b i the justice department that supreme court will be the new deep state enemy and their rulings will be good news
this year when president g of china made himself president for life trump said president for life i think it's great maybe we'll have to give that a shot some day
a month later he suggested he should have for terms like f d r people say he's joking about this stuff but when his trump ever told a joke
his idea of a funny gag is making mike pence kiss his ass in public
maybe the reason he keeps saying he wants to be president for life
is because he wants to be president for life think about that
