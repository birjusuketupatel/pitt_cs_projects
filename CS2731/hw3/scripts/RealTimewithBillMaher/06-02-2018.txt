welcome to l b a pipe passed from h b o maintenance real time with him


right




yeah
we're very good job at night
a tough tough week for the line
the line the one that comedians sometimes growth that
a lot of work the wide africa was roseanne to go away forever and the gutter he wants to be to go away forever so so much for wanting more female voices and television
roseanne
my friend but our world came crashing down
a series of tweets you put out on tuesday that were just so full of racism
spirited theories and personal attacks they were described as of horrid bordering on presidential

this is instructive the tweet that sealed the deal i think we all saw on television and i'm sure when you first saw this you had the same reaction i did i don't have a decoder ring
i have no fucking clue what new wing nuts in your bubble are talking about
now my friend roseanne admitted that she had been admitted to a mental institution she said she has multiple personalities and unfortunately one of them is quite a racist
but it's also not a mystery to me how a person with mental illness could be taken in by a party that has lost its mont

the j in the tweet is valerie jarrett who was one of person obama is key advisors and she took the high road she said this is a teaching moment
whoa what a day for drum supporters first they lose first they lose their favorite show
they get threatened with learning

trump responded in kind of where he always does right focusing on the real victim him
this back a tweet about the hawaii is volcano would make it about him
on orange and gas a

such a whiny little bit
he was complaining that a b c
never apologized to him
yeah because no one in a b c ever compared you to an ape you're thinking is may

the snowflakes on the right and yes there are plenty on the right to try to drag me into this saying i should be fired because i compare drummed to and a rag tag
okay obviously this is another day where we have to do explaining jokes to idiot

here's why that's a dumb analogy it overlooks for key facts one trump isn't a rag tag
so white people have not been subjected to a racist trump comparing them to apes for hundreds of years
my offering trump five million dollars to produce his birth certificate in two thousand and thirteen to prove that he was not happen ape
which i'm sure you remember he then actually did
certainly went to court to get bedside million dollars
but i did that big it sells itself a response to his birthday
racist bullshit so
for i've already been fired by

the other person i was in hot water that samantha bee apologized for her her joke which called about good trump a sexless c word trump was furious he said i am the only one who gets to talk dirty about my daughter

why is he mad about that word
not come feckless
no idea what it means he was like a bunker
luck is not loaded with fuck
maybe in a whole history the world nobody has no effect

i say that very strongly
yes the man who put grab them by the pussy into grade school history books is very upset about the coarsening of the culture
trump had much bigger things on his mind this week he held historic talks with kim kardashian
at the white house this really happened there's a picture of and you can find it online if you google when american died

but when you're thinking about it it was probably a good meeting they have a lot in common they both come from reality t v they both have their own brands
both screwed a lot of black people

there actually was a high level talk to a young child who is the north north koreans by master news and margin and delivered a letter to president drum trying to get the korean thing going again
drum says version of the reporters it's an amazing let you pay me to see what was in nine minutes later he said i have not read the letter
really
roseanne drunk
crazy crazy but apparently the letter was very polite but direct it said if you ever want to see maloney again place fifty thousand
small
the base of the washington
no one has seen the first lady in two thousand and two days
she'll turn up
and we all going to get a good laugh and it turns out she ran off with the mexican gardner

i heard as charlemagne by god as backstage
have a democratic presidential nomination and twenty six day and you might remember the standard from remote bernie sanders






you are more popular than stormy daniels lawyer
sounds like they want you to run again

but there's an election before twenty twenty
been going around saying and i couldn't agree more it's the most important election ever i'm going to ask you why but first a little bone to pick with the politicians i have been hearing since i was eighteen years old every election is the most important election
you all cried wolf on this one and a lot of people are not going to believe that this one really is the most important please tell us why
the most important because we have a president who is a pathological liar
have a president
who has strong or authoritarian tendency to once through every day undermine american democracy
and in my state and all over this country you have many women who have fought and died to defend the american democracy and this guy looks so all over the world and it kind of likes all of these or authoritarian leaders
he attacks the media every day trying to make it harder for them to be critical of him
and we have a president who is a billionaire himself was surrounded himself with billionaires who gave huge tax breaks to the wealthiest people in this country and then brings forth a budget
that would cut medicaid by a trillion dollars mehdi can't by five hundred billion dollars cut nutrition programs for hungry kids cause social security disability a president who told the american people
that he was going to provide health care to everybody remembers their bill
cheaper and better cheaper and better and then he supports legislation to throw thirty two million people off of their health care that they had one does that sink in with his people
because gas prices are going up reality show the around deal people do not as good health care and some have been thrown off is going to lose jobs because of this of trade war he started when does the cult of personality where away in favor of wait you're actually hurting me what we need to do is a couple of things
frankly from a political point of view it is not good enough to simply attacked from every single day what we need to do is bring forth an agenda
that working people all over this country are going to respond to and let me be very clear and i've said it before
in two thousand and sixteen it's not the trump one it's the democrats lost and for too long
how to party
democratic party has been dominated by wealthy campaign contributors they got to open the door to people who work with their hands people who take showers at the end of the day not at the beginning of the day
actually many young people
we have a generation out there have some of the brightest most decent young people in the history of this country beautiful young
let's start to get this for years ago in two thousand and fourteen we had the lowest voter turn out for midterm election since world war two thirty seven percent of the people voted if we increase their voter turn out by fifty percent democrats when the house when the
and that's what

so imagine the democrats lost last on
what your agenda one newman and have won the nomination right but it talk about an agenda they're all behind that now get medicare for all in all the people who are running for president we can i know who they are
income inequality all those issues but an agenda is not a message they are different trump is better and messaging they know his voters don't seem to care about an agenda or anything except build a wall locker up
what's the democrats message if he had to boil it down to something that would sit on a hat which is about all people can take in at this
what is the democratic messer democratic message is that we need a government that represents working families not billionaires

an agenda that says that a health care is a right not a privilege
speech to the young people and says that we should make public colleges and universities tuition free and lower students
trump has shown that the american people they elected him i understand he didn't win the popular vote it had gotten a lot of votes
and his popularity rating keeps going up not down yeah it's it's almost in the range of like a normal president which is really scary because he certainly is not that so they obviously don't care about so many things they used to care about like decorum or policy or democracy or
freedom of the press so in this new arena and he's a is brilliant at controlling the debate and controlling air time what does it democrat has to do to compete on this new the day
new stain that's a fair point in the air time issue is very difficult people's where where the democrats talking about distance you want in many cases democrats or but we're overwhelmed with trumps tweets and the absurdity of the day so i think what democrats have got to do basically is go into
trump country
and talk to people who are now living in desperation you know the truth of the matter is one of the reasons in my view the term one is that he sense that they were millions of people in this country who were ignored by the political establishment
they ignored by the elite they're working longer hours for low wages they are scared to death about the future facing their children and he said and he lied i hear you our job is not to lie to have the guts to deal with the serious issues that they face and to take on the people who are power in this

my bill i'm here in l a today tomorrow
i'll be with workers in disneyland who are working for one of the largest corporations in america they gave their ceo a four hundred million dollars compensation package but paying their workers starvation wages and i'm going to stand with those workers getting decent wages and for me


we're going to be dealing and working with folks from black lives matter addressing a broke criminal justice system which more more people understand the it's fundamental reform

you sound like you're busy i let you go over more
a big agenda and by the way you don't look any different than the last time you read so if you don't run don't do it just because of age don't let them intimidate you are out there

the democratic party is traditionally pulled apart by this battle that we saw in two thousand and sixteen between the left and the center hillary clinton's a centrist you read a whole different kind of campaign
how do we unite them because that's the path to victory is to is the night and the last want to do it was obama who was really more of the centrist but people saw him as a leftist because they wanted to i think we are coming together around a progressive agenda as you indicated medicare for raising the minimum wage climate
change etc
and i think frankly that at the end with the primary season
every person in the democratic community will understand that we have infinitely more in common
then our this for differences or and that we got to unite we've got to bring our community together to take on the most outrageous president in the history of this country

okay


as a prize winning economist in our rights than airtime secretary to m s n b c or friend brad stevens is over here
and democratic strategist georgetown reverse see an anchor german or paul begala
a staff writer for the atlantic contributor to m s n b c n n b c natasha bertrand
a knife overtime is going out to them after the show on youtube okay so i'm going to pick up from that discussion and let's talk about never trump or as you are and ever trump or i guess still am right you actually voted for hillary i did and you are now
you are now a member of a party that no longer exists that's right
in theory it exists existing remarried but
when i read this week is only five percent of republicans have a negative view of president trump so i guess my question to you is do then work for democrats in two thousand and eighteen you've called hillary a survivable event i think ball and i would have gotten quite a bit better they on
what do you actually work for democrats
i work for the new york times some people say it's the same thing
look what i what i'd love to see is the republican party rebuked by the electorate in such a way that it causes some kind of excuse the expression come to jesus moment for
the alternative is a republican party that's going to continue to drift in the direction of france's national front and other not just populace but bordering on sasha parties that we're seeing rising in europe and we can't let that happen i think are ahead of them and somewhere
anybody surprised at how quickly this party was overtaken by the trump people because yes yes i mean my whole life the republicans were the corporate party and they were for free trade present slapping terrorists bryant so far mostly on our friends and allies as an interesting things and nothing can make been happier
by the way into be attacking the europeans can aids experts who are best friends
the republican stood for a whole set of of social and cultural values
that they like to pretend to oppose on everybody else he he's up ended the entire thing that's been shocking to me is how quickly the republican establishment washing by which i mean mitch mcconnell paul ryan all the big shots have knelt before sod and brett easy
for me
brett milk crystals
a few others just like and band sas in the senate center mccain there have been some who stood up and it takes an enormous amount of courage it's not really surprising to me it's not fine to be in the minority in congress and the republicans they wrote that trump wave may knew that trump excited his base so much and they saw
they kind of the way that he animated so many people and the way that democrats with hillary clinton just cut and and this goes back to kind of the the shift in strategy that we are starting to see from progressives starting to ryan i'm very very progressive platforms like states abrams in georgia for example just being on a pile
on apologetically progressive and liberal and not trying to pander to their lives in a way that donald trump never dead
the person who might be the first black woman governor right
in a good actually won the primary in georgia should be another woman who
took the opposite approach was going after the
maybe the people voted last time for trump the working world class the maybe you know you've had your trip to crazy town come back home to the democrats and she got her ass kicked and this woman so zebra is no i'm just going to go through the base just minorities young people fuck the rest are you nuts
but then in georgia then i've i've worked in about what i support and stacey evans who got beat by fifty three points so this was an instructive thing for me but stacey
abrams who won what she said and election night soft stacey evans a woman who was defeated endorser right away
so you're seeing party unity and an abrams said something remarkable she said i want to ensure that all georgians from farmers and montezuma to mill workers and don't know that we value them she went out a way that night actually to put forward that wedge issues but web issues either actually did a great job of trying to stitch things back together though it's just like bernie did here i think that the day
distance between the factions the republican party is extraordinary the distance between the factions the democratic party is not very great and he will try past national healthcare and a bill clinton twenty five years ago and he supposed to be a martyr how but if you're if you're nominating very progressive democrats in very red states you're going to lose and i don't
want the democratic party to seize from the republicans the the the mantle of being the stupid party into the point is is to win right that's the point of the the election so you know democrats think if we just turn out our base when you turn out minority voters who didn't show up last on we're going to win guess what to can play that game republicans
can turn out large numbers of voters that also gave her to there's more of us the new that's what you think know that's true and we just don't vote
i mean i agree that you might be right we don't know but but in georgia it's interesting
the democrats nominated moderates before and they only got twenty five percent of the vote around twenty five percent of the vote in georgia and come support among republicans may be around eighty five and ninety percent but people who identify as republicans are extreme king people are leaving the republican party so if the what they said would yeah
this was going in years ago a grudging democratic much right and and trump looked around and when you know what i still see a lot of white people out there but still
a lot of thought that crackers and i'm going to go after each and every one of the put a lot of those white people voted for trouble had voted for barack obama they are not lost us democrats do have to go out from i think abrams we'll we'll wait and see forty four percent of voters in america are white with only a high school degree how can the democrats be the party of inclusion and exclude for
four percent of the country it's a bad way to govern it's a bad way to run and i believe this they have much more top common those working class white folks with people of color than anybody wants to let him know that i saw senator sanders should i make in the case so that it had a great job but the issues that are the you know the true
the left issues when you look at the polling people who care that much about the environment even guns which was certainly got a lot of publicity lately you know somebody like connor lamb walked away from at issue you wouldn't touch that the go the democrat and one in pennsylvania
income inequality i know right it's over and big issue but voters want to be billionaires you know they don't hate the rich i mean i think that the immigration the mantra of the democratic party and twenty eighteen or twenty to twenty should be make america seen again
right
kind of purple state candidates why don't we ask candidates one was the last time you change your mind when was the last time you cross party lines on one issue
show us that you can get along with the other side i think that would be amazing and i think it will be winning for democrats maybe winning or redeeming for republicans if they could do it because right now our politics spends towards the fringe healthy democratic politics should bend to the sun to look at virginia this week virginia expanded medicaid one of the fondest dreams of progressives like bernie like barack obama
like me they expanded it with a republican legislature why because elections matter the democrats picked up seventeen seats they almost got the majority and their moderate governor ralph nor them cut the deal to expand medicaid to four hundred thousand virginians that's every liberals dream so i just get there is a way forward for
so why we
but republicans are running on immigration that their big issue that's what gets their base riled up they've already run thousands of eggs and it's always on that issue and democrats are weak on that issue or they don't know they're right on that issue and they have to stay right
they should be your next boss is going to be an immigrant and probably already is
and it's shameful out you're working with voters now
that's that's a that's a core values issue about what we are as americans and one of the reasons i've said i can i cannot see myself voting republican again is this stand this hatred this constant bigotry against immigrants high and low

i think democrats should have and probably still should call out present trumpet it's a con it's a con
net flow of mexicans is from america to mexico has been for almost ten years we've lost a million mexicans we have misplaced of the gone home while you slow down
if you if you look at what democrats are winning on its what bernie talked about connor lame in a very very conservative district ran on entitlements more medicare medicaid protecting social security he ran against that trump tax cut which eighty three percent of which goes to just one percent of the wealthiest people and that's in a district that trump one by seventeen points so it's these
economic issues i think i do think they should call b s on immigration stuff because i think a diversion that mean you tell him what the diverting you from i don't necessarily think that people that voted for trump are paying attention to what he's actually doing with regard to issues i think that they're just focusing on the latest outright cycle it's also so hard for there to be transparent re
porting about anything that's happening at the border at the anything that's happening in terms of real substantive issues when you have a new tweet from the president every day and you're wondering is to he wake up is insane today i mean it's just really really difficult to keep up with all of the scandals and that is a major reason why he's been able to just distract everyone so much with every different thing that he has
going on every day and that's that's what i think people are looking at everything now about the republican party is about owning the limb to say it's about know it trolling people and distracting said that they don't see what the actual the sausage being made well as to worst episode here and real time previously on real time
i was saying that prison drunk wants to be president for life and that he literally is above the law even though your everyday on to the he's not above the law who's totally above the law but there's something even scarier than that his son done jr who i call a dish big on fox

all my greatest hits the night
i don't know if they will people realize that he is being groomed already the he's a huge star know in the republican base and he's shopping a book i saw a headline today it is donald trump junior sniffing around for a book deal i guess i don't remember that we showed the book he wrote last year
some kind of an introspective guy
i read some of these and now that we know he's looking for another book deal i'm going to read some more would you like to hear that
it's out by the pictures i vp is like sometimes i like to get out into nature to pause and reflect into imagine where we'll put that because you know
is a true satisfaction comes i'm earning an honest day's pay and working your way up from the bottom i would imagine
you realize just how insignificant you really are when you look at all the stars in the sky or talk to your father
sometimes i worry that there is so much beauty in the world i'll never have time to shoot at all
people who say never mix business with pleasure haven't done cocaine off the backup of qatar reposted
strongly daniels will be a good name for a cocktail

if a genie ever granted we three wishes my first wish would be go back home terrorist
and we have met the enemy and he is us i'm kidding it's mexicans
yeah

yeah
wow it's about time i got you yeah i've been wanting for a very long time man think you've added me you are a great talker so it always makes my job easier when i have absolutely i hate the fact that you are insulting orangutans open complain on the donald trump
everybody
the plane of age during a modern and down
and i think we have quite a lot in common one we both been fired on the fire fluids from four different radio stations seven times in life though if you count like taco bell and stuff like that
hired a few times and those and it's not a bad thing right i mean it can be a actually a blessing in disguise
i believe in divine miss direction
because because you know when it when he would call me an office they would always say you know we're looking to move in another direction and i got a homegrown name is kendra gees a little to her she told me once ammo is not dumb will the u in another direction it's god will be due in another direction and know you don't believe in god but i do so
ten your name yes
maybe your was in my name i believe that
and i think we also would give the same kind of advice i read in your books and the things you would say to younger people i remember years ago i got into all sorts of shit because i was taking on the idea that people in this country are always saying live your dream but it's always someone like an award show and making kids like want to be
musicians and model
athletes athletes i'm going to have this great story about someone who is very important you yes i do you fuck your dream you dream
vote
i actually say fuck your dreams you know because out but as a funky and dreams when it's not actually your dream could we do live in a country especially when you know you from node and the people that look like you black
that a successful are usually in entertainment have some form of athletic so everybody wants to run to the field that can't work for everybody it can't just not possible so every night and you need somebody to tell you fuck your dreams that you can figure out what it is you actually want to do but they told you you are not really a good rapper
right
they thought your dream right
your dream rush forgot what it is you actually one right and that's also something i think we both talk a lot about social media the fact that people don't really have their own opinion more right they have to check what everyone else is saying they wake up in the morning to attempt to shake is it ok to think like this didn't write it ok to like this
oh this is what everybody's not like you know camera with this so everybody width of in the morning and we wait for social media to tell us how to think and as way okay
so let's get into the people who were fired this week joker
what do you what did you what what was your reaction when you first heard about the rose and situation
it wasn't surprising not at all
rosanna the history of racism she either history of bigotry and i wasn't i didn't feel sad for her oughta cast on crew because when you get in bed with somebody like that you eventually know you're gonna have to deal with the consequences of their actions so we may go now you gotta go now
yeah i mean there's certainly no condoning it but there is something about a person who is mentally problem has mental problems
wow when lead and not not a lot nowadays you know me
if she had just came out the day before and i have mental problems i'd be like well that's an excuse you that this goes back a long time
does not excuse it absolutely no no i'm not i believe her freedom of speech but i don't believe that people are free from the consequences of stayed speech because
but you can't tell somebody how to react to it not been calling you know black woman a monkey is smart when your boss is indeed a black woman
it's horrible
and i think what we have to also understand is that donald trump
took great ownership of that show when it came out a member him at a rally saying this is great rose and she's something like this is officer for us to represent as well you know i always said about the trump people there's two things they they hate being called a racist and black people
you know they they make they make are so afraid to say you are racist because then they all up in arms but doesn't it kind of proves it to me that rose and you can't have it both ways she was your representative as the trump voter and now it is revealed as we've talked about on the
show before that the trumpeter was not really animated by economic anxiety so much as this i want to have my country barrier i eat a country that looked more like it did in the nineteenth what
arrested and i tell people what is all the time when it comes to donald trump when it comes the rules a financially they're going to be fine even after this whole situation will dig in fights you can we find somebody you're just too broke to be openly racist

set the fuck up forever
the openly racist shut up romance no move on
well i'm sure she's in hell right
put herself so that's why as where did they let people like donald trump empower them me like why are you following donald trump he's rich he can afford to be openly racist and right u k
yeah you suck a lot of anxiety
year
i found interesting
the people of color live with the kind of anxiety you think
your man okay
it was a shock
interesting the way you put it that way that kind of every day anxiety beard is my second book my first book is called black privilege opportunity comes it also created s l right now in real time
thank you i appreciate
second call it shook my anxieties playing tricks on me and that's what it's about is about you know just me deal with anxiety my whole life dealer would panic attacks and now wanted their be to try to deal with it because you know yeah when you are black man in america you are constantly dealing with a sense of anxious this like to eat he means it is the only two hours without taking
because i don't know if i'm going to get pulled over and taken to jail for some stupid and if you had to sit in a cold take needed to shape you know why you should call it

i think it's great that you can make yourself shit on command like that
that's a black thing but i got every right about losers
so this line thirty every morning

arie explore
so what about let me ask the panel this what do you think about the rosen situation and the cement the be situation and the whole idea of people stepping over the line and being vaporized will we should be able to make intelligent distinctions between will roseanne said which was an example yeah hundred and what samantha bee said which
was an example of outrage her outrage at an outrageous policy towards immigrants so yes
either the words you use or misuse the word cyclists which is really is almost as criminal but
but i get her point which is is furious that yvonne to trump is participating but not suffering the moral consequences of an administration that was forcibly separating mother's from their children suddenly that should never happen in america

there's a distinction to be made between what is a violation of free speech or what might be a violation of free speech and what isn't
and for the white house to have come out into of said immediately after samantha be made this comment and said she should be fired her show should be taken off there there's an argument to be made that is a serious violation of free speech
you illustration you're telling a search that workers
this is not
the president was completely silent about rose and comments and that was that was a company's decision to take her off the air for a racist comment that she i don't you an word can auto word was the because i don't understand why as an insult to call somebody something you enjoy
i agree especially know
and they keep changing the rules on on all these words
years ago you would never heard that word and are you hear it on larry david has done episodes where the blue with all around the word continent job with the british say that the queen probably so it's not it's not that bad and a little a little come to get over here
i just don't see that horrific sick of sense and i understand why it is a big word and women hate that word and we shouldn't use with the words do change meaning i think a lot and it is romania just changed because when ted nugent use that word about clinton mr trump welcomed him to the white house roger
stone drop ally
united not timid this is this is trumps bit close political our that word was fine for mr trump until sam be used it so spare me the self righteousness mr president
or sold at trump rally is that called hillary clinton that very worried i mean how many teachers and we have a door how many times that we have to see hillary clinton called that were during the campaign of course without a pizza in the town campaign so it's just all very disingenuous it is this is what we said and it was good joke that how he made it about himself but it is about him
this way and then surely you pointed this out the president sets the tone and there's a lot of social science research on this about social contagion that when the president says bad things about african americans about mexicans about muslims
it increases there's been studies of reddit that shows which never was very happy place it's gone
critics a way way way i absolutely hate crimes against muslims or up seventeen percent this is mr trump took office it's not t doesn't directly caused it but there is a social contagion we all learn from others but a particularly we learned from adelaide it reflects the movement itself because what the movement combines is is kind of sterile nasty
knows with relentless juvenile self pity and that's the president's character
which is breathed and therefore i want to kick you out of my country i'm aggrieved and therefore i want to put down your race or or or your religion how this came to represent the conservative movement has one of the great moral disasters of our of
time and that goes back to your earlier question at one day we're going to want a healthy conservative movement and some of us are going to have to represent that five percent tiny sliver so that sometime around nine hundred and forty five or i'm in two thousand and forty five there's there's something to stand up the whole all
benefit conservatives now to stand up against the racism and bigotry and white supremacy then the health related
and that's why i don't think you should dismiss never trump or we have to do it every single day it's why i'm not a democrat and i'm not going to become a democrat i'm going to remain a conservative but someone has to stand up and point this out and say this cannot be the movement ever stop using
politically correct times like old right call them what they are crack ass crack a white devil

has a particular republican bread right when when a klansman burned across and a family's home in maryland wrong right and went to their house at the same day he saw on the paper he went over there and he was no great what celebrate
he called out when david duke ran in louisiana george h w bush called him out he eat about him
when the terrorists bombed us george bush three days later went to a mosque try to educate people they just not about us like reagan also started his campaign purposely and the shelby county i know he has complicated history but in a moment of rachel ray rice which he did well
but in that era
edit your guy called john mccain who who jeopardized his campaign sure a rebuke a voter who wanted to insist that barack obama was an arab that was an instance of political courage we should never forget

could have phrased it better
she said he is an arab and he said no these are good man that's not exactly the message we want out there but i know what he was trying to say get him the benefit i do
so
where's millennia
no it's not the most important really hope she's ok we hope it's not helping her husband deported
no
think the last time she was spotted was the day of that of the prisoner traded in north korea

and that you're criticizing i don't remember this offered a not fire agree given his she's married to a titan center line or anybody you imagine i trouble looks happy you sweat more
so i'm just saying you sleep in the bed you make
okay so
pardons i only have a couple of minutes but we should mention is of course donald trump
ruins everything he touches but this i thought it was particularly said biggest part and is one of those cool powers that of president has to right or wrong it's really an act of mercy and of course he's turning and it's just another partition tool to undermine our democracy and he is so for juror pio and a scooter libby engineers to
any conservatives who were treated unfairly
the department of unfairly and now he's thinking about
martha stewart
oh we're gonna bitch who were also who used to be on celebrity apprentice
he's using it for a political allies i mean that show and right that this is a tool that supporter and you commit a crime i mean hey it's a great time to be a celebrity fallon because dollars round man mean i did he like
the main part in and also i mean there's a pattern here he has said that these people were treated unfairly well guess what he has also said that michael flynn was treated unfairly he has said that oh yeah but this is the kind of tactic he expect from my duro in venezuela or places like that you your political
you your political allies you know there was a front page story in the new york times by my colleague rosie golden sun about drug addicts who share drugs and one of them wakes up and the other the other is dead and the one who wakes up ends up going to jail on charges of of of homicide this is an outrage that this is happening in in this country
imagine if the president use those his part and powers to help those addicts to help them recover instead of sending the sending of having them sense of prison that's the sort of thing a pardon to be before those are the sorts of people that order before to imagine that it's martha stuart
i mean how many times can we say it but it's just the most extraordinary wave misusing the power of the presidency and debasing the entire why do we can talk into this guy like he's a president though he's a celebrity in cheek so we shouldn't be surprised that a celebrity is looking out for other celebrity but it's not celebrities it's sending a message to the people who turn on
human the russia can a dodge the fences when he has focused on lying to a federal grand jury disobeying a federal court order election law violations perjury these are exactly the issues mr muller is looking at so this is like he said this is three billboards outside the white house
that note i have to go
you
okay
from doesn't have to produce those two three and one hundred immigrant children he lost but we are going to need to see maloney
just proof of life
a photo of her holding up a newspaper
an here
here's a bad sign in the last time anyone saw you have your husband was holding a shovel

are all these golfers who chose to keep on playing during a volcano eruption have to take a serious look at their marriages
that's a hot lava toxic gas or an afternoon with the wife
what do you think bill before vote on this one i would
neural islamic terrorists have to come up with the new attack various besides all akbar we get it got his grade that's claire from the way your jabbing that life into people
but why and on freshen it up with some other tired catch phrase like billy billy or
can you hear me now or no collusion
you know if we as a society cannot get the boarding group thing right
let's just give up
you have a number is one know than sit the fuck down

we can't even get this right everyone has to try and push the way up front for what it's the night and gate agent not the last helicopter out of saigon

no someone has to tell illinois which fears legal marijuana will force them to retire almost three hundred drug sniffing dogs i'll take them

this is exactly the kind of dog i need loyal trained and able to answer the question why the hell did i hide my week

and finally no conspiracy theories has to go back to what they used to be fun little stories we would tell each other when we were high space aliens crashed in roswell hitler escaped argentina elvis is alive and working at the i
that's what conspiracy theories used to be but now they're the ideology of the republican party
conspiracy theorists used to be called crazy now they're called senator flag

it used to be an unwritten rule of both parties that you can't just make shit up the old you're entitled to your own opinion but not your own facts thing but
before republicans discovered yes yes you can just make shit up
you can have your own sacks in fact we just pulled a fresh batch out of the oven
and by the up and i mean our ass
you know
i never like rush limbaugh but i would take a return to ninety's a ditto heads any day because it turned out that rush was really just a gateway drug
to which they eventually built up a tolerance and then needed something stronger that was glenn beck
which led to alex jones and now republicans your the alex jones part
literally nothing too stupid and conspiratorial that you will not swallow hillary running a child sex ring out of a pizza parlor sounds right
obama his birth certificate fake jade helm absolutely trump tower the easier it gets the more they like it that's their jam they believe anything so we can stop sending reporters didn't diners now to figure them out they're not there for the breakfast they literally
there are clouds in the coffee
this week found out that eighty three percent of republicans either definitely believe or unsure whether five million people voted illegally in the last election something trump just completely made up even appointed a voter fraud commission based on his own fraud
odd
remember that bullshit i made up i want you to get to the bottom of it
this isn't about ideology any more trump has none anyway when he decided to run he didn't brush up on conservativism by studying buckley and reagan
and there's only experience with gold water was in a russian hotel room


and this isn't about actual republicans either those guys are gone george bush the first quit the and are ray in nineteen ninety five when some gun nuts called the bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms jack booted dogs more said deeply offended his sense of decency and honor
but when alex jones has children think their own deaths at sandy hook it doesn't deter from from telling your reputation is amazing all that i will not let you down
their some makes you say and crap to crazy people sort of why
we should grab a pussy some

the latest thing truck pulled out of his ass is this nonsense about the f b i spying on him there was no spy it was just the mirror checking out whether someone on the trump campaign was communicating with russia based on the tiny fact that everybody in the trump campaign was communicating with

it's what the f b i he does investigation
it's in their name

even the folks who believes that the world is secretly run by an alien race of shape shifting lizard people
they ever video to back it up



can argue with that
but spy gate and there's literally nothing and that is so alarming because one way we measure the health of the society is by how conspiratorial it is communist countries arab dictatorships those places you could always sell anything because there was no trust in the institutions reaper
applicants that's what you're doing to this country

the only answer is that more sane people have to vote than insane people in every election so
tell your same friends that the mid terms are the most important election of their lives and tell your conservative friends that climate scientists are working with the clintons to slip a chemical into the air ducts at polling places that will turn everyone who vote

yes
oh my god
