these i loved ones mothers brothers
today and and fans
no unique
when experience over dallas every second counts see the life administering the locks on learn how to get in the locks on a visit and that path
back backlash
it's paid for with pennsylvania taxpayer dollars
welcome to l h b a pipe pass from h b o maintenance real time


right






i actually know why it
real that because finally somebody
but you're not going to say it always treat those countries actually in jail

the judge said they should lock blog
even worse knows kim kardashian is not taking his calls so
going to get apart
trump said about men
the kid that they do with a exactly you're partially brought him in you gave him the title campaign share with you that just something we told him
it's like roommate told elvis and a black belt and wasn't really
so much happened this legal stuff happens week find me after eighteen months of working on this the the justice department's inspector general released his report on the f b eyes actions and the two thousand and sixteen election trump said he wanted to
read the whole thing before commenting i'm joking of course

five hundred pages he gets bored halfway through a fortune cookie
the upshot of it is that the f b i help traub as we all knew and trump made such a big deal out of hillary's emails that komi didn't want anyone to think that the f b i was helping hillary and was on her side
so they read fucked her campaign
it's like when the raf needs to show that he's fair he shoots the home down quarterback in the mouth

and michael cohen the junior their trunk
her lawyer would agree on a problem
lap dog he's they're saying i don't know this sure they're saying he's ready to cooperate with prosecutors i hope that makes trump nervous i mean michael cohen has given more money to porn stars than charlie sheen
but
and
go and took out a restraining order on michael out an eddie
right you to stop appearing on television
the blade i love this community is creating a circus with his quest and question unquestionable
thirst for publicity
michael
you work for donald trump
but and also listen to this new york's attorney general has filed the lawsuit trying to shut down trumps families phony cherry
they say
assistant illegal can do is basically a slush fund which they used as an arm of the campaign they were funneling money to some of the least deserving charities in the world doctors without borders though
that's not a real charity
st bart's children
so with all these scandals you know who's poll numbers are thinking like a rock that not donald trump's his are up people who are sinking or anyone in the republican party who crosses donald trump member mark sanford from south carolina the guy
hiking the appalachian trail
is really having an affair with an argentinian woman he was like my appalachian trail
what you know he vote to a trump seventy three percent of the time and said a few critical thing out he didn't win his truck primary because he had he survived he was reelected after having sex with the argentinian woman
but trump banks porn star is right here in the us ladies and gentlemen
one reason trumps numbers are up of course he has a new friend

i know it seems like years ago it was only the beginning of this week they had their big submit trump cannot stop talking about what a great guy
negotiated
we found that out
he's got a great personality
he says
a funny guy he said is a funny is a funny guy is a funny i know he does this one bit
where he will throw three generations of your family in jail
listening to radio that's not on the government stage
great stuff
sex ready to do his bit about how many north korea as it take to grow in a light bulb none we have no electricity
funny

donald trump is over there and tried to give it to whatever they were dry to do
come into the modern world so he shows him i couldn't make this up a fake movie trailer that trump put together and looks like can put it to get did you say this show a few seconds it as you have to see it the believe it
a new world can begin to gain one of french respect good will be part of that
it looks like something scientology
could make if they were emerging with amway
drug comes out but he's got great beaches
hotels yes because so many people in that country of money to burn so they get a condo on the beach of course know resort hotels in north korea are a little different
cool down in a room service they ask if you have any food
so
and across all the credit you're saying in their right to and nothing really came of this it was to people who lie about everything who signed a deal that was specific about nothing
i would say it was a feckless stunt

while he was in singapore the president past a milestone he turned seventy two years old
that
trump people are welcome
insane but welcome
but
that they throw him a big party in the hotel suite and then the hookers pete happy birthday on the

like a canary funny really
but first step
man this guy i've been rooting for my whole life of all the pundits i have read on the conservative side this guy's the sharpest minds of all i want them to get in here for the longest time i'm sure he has a pulitzer prize or to george will lead

yeah
may i borrow it
but i wasn't kidding i want to do here more than anybody else for twenty years or a lesson good be persistent
five years but back in the days when we used to the clip things that of newspapers and magazines
they still do
i clipped you more than anybody you always kept my liberalism honest so an oxymoron but go ahead

so he said you're a great words meant i thought we'd start with some words i heard this week that i hadn't heard before
sen bob quarter so the republican party is now a cult
it's not a cold cult implies misguided if sincere worship
this is fear
not worship folder invertebrate they're frightened
but it seems to be a cult of
donald trump now has an eighty seven percent approval rating and the republican party that's higher than any republican except george bush right after nine eleven higher than reagan at this point
higher than eisenhower bush the first yeah donald trump that guy that seems like a cult of personality
well as told of personality among his supporters and the supporters are nothing if not vengeful differ from him and for that reason
vast majority of people in congress or in congress to be in congress that as they want to stay there
and therefore absent term limits this is the careerist motivation they have and he's the biggest threat there is to that so how much responsibility do you think the republican party barriers for producing donald trump you can't really picture him as a democrat even though before this run that he made he really wasn't he didn't have any fix party
he belong to democrats republicans wanted to be an independent for a while
yes but let me do the democrats are wanting in the spring of two those followed summers twenty fifteen you had eighteen republican candidates on stage and the most lurid stood out in the summer of twenty nine teen there will be eighteen democrats onstage and maybe the most lurid will stand out there
the idea that only the republican party or only the right can produce something like donald trump is naive and cheerful really name somebody on the left to is in any way comparable to donald trump who was lurid on the left i can't name the mouth but just been lowered will arise in the next year they might and and they might become
it as they compete to stand out in this crowd on the stage but how would they stand out in the way donald trump then he stood out by being more xena phobic more racist
more horrible than any way more vulgar more personally vulgar
and that wouldn't appeal to the democratic base i don't
don't understand the democratic base but how
analyze the democratic race pretty well all i'm saying is that there's a dynamic in the nominating process produces an opportunity for free beauty in people like the buccaneer currently on the white house you know and buccaneer nother great word okay so let me throw some other words i was saying in two thousand and sixteen before he was elect
it was a slow moving cool
i don't know if you think that word is applicable
appeasement is a word that republicans used to throw a democrats anytime they even talk because i'm going overseas
i think trump is done a lot of that i don't feel like he's often acting in the interests of the united states of america purposefully if the red cross interest with his personal interest to me that's treason or any of these words applicable or do you think they're all too strong i wouldn't use the word trees and the trojans a crime and i think we have to resist the
impulse to criminalize political differences even when they are shoddy differences and foolish differences such as he as about his new best friend and north korea
i don't think it helps to to ratchet up any more than we already have for the volume of our rhetoric about this
what if it's true i mean everything he does i can think of any policy of that doesn't help blood and are potent
well also feels helps lot of let's think about
the subject of slow motion cool
clearly the modern presidency now occupied by this man has swollen beyond reason and escaped the limits implied in the constitution
by have to say that the progressive than this country brought that about it was woodrow wilson
the first progressive president and the first president to criticize the american found in which he did my peripherally but about the essence of the constitution he objected to the separation of powers
because it inhibited the discretion of presidents to act without the fetters of congress what's a day we've got and uninhibited president and i don't think progressives are happy with what they help to bring about
well i can agree with that but as always you spigot eloquently
so are you optimistic because i didn't other greatest or in here recently john major but we were arguing about that he's much more optimistic about where we're going i am not i think that we have crossed the rubicon on this i i'm not the historian you are but i do remember what the rubicon was
caesar came with the army's from ball and they said if you cross the river with that army we cease to be a republic any more and we will be a dictatorship i feel read a caesar rubicon moment there's much to be said for pessimism because pessimist
pessimists and write a good bit of the time and they're delighted when the wrong which is why i subscribe to the ohio and and eight thousand ninety five theory of history snow name by me for a little known fact that in ohio and eighteen ninety five there were two automobiles and they collided
things go wrong on the other hand this is not a flimsy country it was made by flimsy people and the flint a real us about human nature and the temptations of power who wants to philadelphia in the summer of seventeen eighty seven
and devised a government full of blocking mechanisms three branches of government two branches of the legislative branch with different electro constituencies and electoral rhythms
super majority his veto veto override judicial review all kinds of ways to slow it down and make it difficult for an overbearing executive or congress or judiciary to have its way but it's not working it really yeah so are its own
take me through and how donald trump was going to see his demise because i see what happens is muller
what is report trumps says it's fake news like you did a b i g report today is based believes him he doesn't get impeached we can't do that because you need or majority in the senate that's not going to happen
if muller in dates and subpoenas him he says go fish doesn't show up what happens and i don't think he would even leave if the last election in two thousand and twenty because he would call it
set this up in two thousand and sixteen it's rigged because he thought he was going to lose we've already seen the polling his base thinks it's perfectly ok to cancel an election it's it's rigged and politicized i think he leaves when he wants to leave i think he lose when the american people to tell him
leave or when it doesn't strike me as a kind of man it does a painful duty of public spirit so that he was not having fun which even going as having fun that's the worst thing that happened to us is that at first he didn't like this job member of the white house was a dog now he likes it was not going until he wants to go had a really depressing
oh would you george well there is a very serious argument mr keller breezy a professor at northwestern university makes it among others that the appointment of robert muller was unconstitutional is not mahler showed the fact is under the appointments clause the us constitution as
developed by supreme court case law a principal officer of the government and by the power he is wielding them the people the a subordinate to muller qualifies as a principal officer all principal officers according to the supreme court must be nominated by the president and confirmed by the senate which he has not done there for
it is possible that a year or so from now
a case comes to the supreme for brought by manifold or someone else that says news of the supreme court's words in cases like this all the subpoenas the indictments and the convictions and the sentences brought about by this man are a fruit of the poisonous tree
i've been trying to sell on fox news for over a year now this is news
supreme court decisions going back forty years about the appointments okay let me ask you one last thing though always bugged me because again i do admire you so much in your your ability i don't know why you're not more with us on climate i'm accused of not believe in climate change and now they're not doing
it would be impossible to state with greater precision the opposite of my belief which is this the one thing we can all agree on is that the climate is changing because it always is changing it was changing when the medieval warming period came about it was changing when that was followed by what's called the little ice age none of that happened because of the
internal combustion engine or the carbon based economy that we now have what makes climate science so interesting so complicated and so inherently unsettled is that there are so many variables of which human activity as one solar activity as another all i'm saying is that before
we'd make enormous exclusions from our freedom
and trillions of dollars in investments or and wealth created we ought to be more certain the well being created is in renewable energies the wealth being created always is by the technology that is coming we've seen that many times on this country so i think that's a specious argument that we are giving up something by becoming more green and it doesn't
you that scientists i mean i know you're a brilliant guy bigger not exactly a scientist but scientists climate scientist and overwhelming numbers usually the number you see is ninety seven percent it doesn't get much more subtle than that
it doesn't persuade you that they all have come to the same conclusion that we're and yes climate always changes but this is also different both things can be true there's nothing counter intuitive about the proposition that human activity when there are seven or eight billion of us now is effect in the climate but the proposition that goes beyond that
as we know the trajectory of this i think mrs understands the extreme lot of bad if iran
right we're gonna find out yeah not a climate than not
i'm not a climate denial climate defeatist and the sense that we're going to proceed pretty much as we have been for another fifty years at which time a lot of the predictions that have been made hostages given to fortune and are going to be i think shot by fortune as fortune has a way of doing alright up try to work and into in years to come thank you so
much
yeah

as a daily basis turnaround however of isis inside the army of tara michael weiss is back
say and contributor host of firing line or margaret over from june twenty third on p b s margaret over
now
ricardo you are and heard from right here in california are congresswoman karen bass great

okay so george well we're just talking about maybe getting trump out of their probably not i think more they are he was too i'm i'm stopping the malo report this an inspector general report came out today you know it sounds like a boring
but when you when trump lies about it it's really not can i read some of the things he said about it because it came to that conclusion the exact opposites that he said i think it's most instructed to hear donald trump talk and then
now that we live in opposite world
it totally exonerated read there was no collusion or obstruction it does not exonerate him because it was a now
jones they were bloody against my electorate know it joe's the exact opposite exactly there was totally biased know it reaches the conclusion that there was no bias that they made mistakes but there was no bias he also says call me was the ringleader of this whole den of thieves now they're thieves
you look what happened they were plotting against by election and it just shows he can just say anything exactly in the post truth world it doesn't matter any lower
called i don't care that george degrees that's a cult when you get into it and they drink the kool aid
let's you
five hundred page report yeah basically seven words seven words is what easy road in i'm i'm on the judiciary committee and i know when i get back next week we're going to subpoena the guy that said the seven words in two thousand and sixteen
and he was on the investigation for three months and mother got rid of him so what is the really none yeah and by the way i mean this guy who said this is on record saying if i wanted to scuttle donald trump's nomination i would have released or leaked information that he was being investigated for colluding with russia that would have turned the tide particularly and of the the can
pain but yet you see here in black and white this report is quite damning about the guy's behavior not just carry but the other officers and attorneys and agents but it states in black and white we found no documentary or testimonial evidence directly connecting the political views these employees expressed in their text messages and instant messages so the specific media investigated decisions we reviewed
in chapter five in other words okay they did have bias they did have a political tendency they're human beings they have thoughts right and f b i agent who was investigating a serial killer or a rapist or money longer going out to the bar talking to his colleague that what we're going to get that son of a bitch that's human interaction their big mistake was they express their opinions on f b i issued device
the irony of irony being this investigation was about the conflict in public and private correspondence and i think we should demand that are justice department and are just as officials not pretend we wish it did a higher level of integrity and that they not get money in a political waters and and i just i think the contrast between call me and now
crowd is with the mahler investigation right is that he seen nothing of our and i think nothing of his people he has hermetically sealed and because they idea is it is all about following a law and it is not about trying to anticipate win no action and how if i do this and be seen from my reputation and forget about it
not about politics and out just say one thing about your point about opinions there was one place where it went what i think past of opinion and unfortunately that's the text they got showed this thanks this is between two f b i agents peter struck and the and the woman that he was having an affair with trumps on ever going to become president right right and he right
bag no no will will stop it okay so nobody reads the five hundred page right on our side never catches a break that they got this one thing that is a smoking gun type thing though is whether this is not just an opinion when it's the guy in the investigation know he wasn't doing that he was just trying to impress the girl

saying oh my god is having fresh new say no i'm captain save a whole
late at night
stop it
big bad daddy who's the guy who is good as dr
was to make the sex

and the door they need to they're already calling for the mother invasion to be shut down because of that kept us department official said mean and media i mean you just don't do it just don't call their don't go to politics yes i am that the letter of a lot during that time when i was worried about you remember when giuliani went on a show on sunday and he said the october surprise was coming
and the concerned then was the f b i agents in new york who was apparently mad but i know we're sure they is from plenty of exec don't let me ask about the primary elections on tuesday we did the right
the narratives alps
what hundreds of as eagerly anticipating resulted as high res kind of november
as a patient here in away
don't worry that the narrative seems to hold that the democrats give fielding more and more stronger women gathered and the republic

the republicans are more and more of a cult
the big take away is that if you cross donald trump you're out exactly that's what happened the mark sanford
the woman who beat sanford said this is the trump party now this is no longer people saying the republican party the party of small government the party of freedom all that stuff i heard from people like you and i doing normal republican it's public and classic
also i think it said recently endorsed her on twitter you see this is the thing and people the media have a hard time getting around how is this guy so insane and comical with using social media to express opinions that he has other ample avenues to express including the white house press corps
he does it because it does resonate and he has created i do agree there was a personality cult that i use that term very conservatively because i don't like moral equivalence between the united states and totalitarian regimes will get to that we talking about north korea but around himself here it's not even your with me or against me you're with me or your professionally killed
you're out of a job and that's frightening but there was another space for dissent but it presents an opportunity for that because you i think when when they elect candidates that and so far too extreme and we know what happened was really more in alabama number one i believe that republicans that are real republicans then it suppresses platoon
actually suppresses their vote and then for democrats it should be energized i didn't in alabama has an example the pedophile lost by one point five of and that they hadn't already had air and he when the black vote was inner shore and that was why he went to what's happening is a and bella airplane tail and is is just sort of acknowledging that the parties
trying to find and in those deep red districts and the districts that are like that sanford seat was gonna be a republican district no matter what tend to be overpowered was going to win eight but in those kinds of feet the trump republican wins now and said that fact the for vacation the republican party certainly for now what we don't always if that is like the obama coalition that didn't
continue after obama we don't know what the having price and i'll look like post trapped period i only post out and think faster when you that that there is no i was driving
just can't shake shack continue and that mold or other people who i met him from hundred last
maybe the
a party back because it clearly has no gladly gladly right
i rarely to
the way can make america
when we can hopefully america to a guys not allowing bill
going to go near there

i'm not saying i want to give a shout to canada
okay
i loved can we all love canada
i just want the people of their to know because women on and can and for a while though
it's not us you know that it's just

and the contrast between him and justin trudeau couldn't not be greater and i took this is the perfect time to do an update for something i enjoyed for my entire childhood goof recent gallant he remember to said gallon
go and gallon those cartoons they used to have goals as i can't read that but
boy looks like the yard
gallant that good as the jedi
dashing polite justin trudeau such a great contrast to the old fat stupid
were updated go visit the island
justin and
for example
justin weights politely for women to get on an elevator first donald grabs their opposing

justin researchers an issue and consults whereas before reaching a decision
donald violence brain fog and leaves his staff to clean up the mess

justin speaks the king's english donald speaks queens bay

justin remains devoted to his wife when we met in high school donald remains is devoted to kim jong who he met

just separates paper and glass donald separates parents and children

justin took an oath to protect his nation dunno doesn't wear protection

just an age where the fork and knife while fine china donald age bands that have a buck
justin tells us that you have a problem that they know donald tells else that leave me alone i'm pope to eating
just didn't know the importance of balancing work and family donald is pretty sure the name of one of his daughter starts with it
doesn't look sexy with his air blowing in the breeze looks like mr clean stable the dead

just as a passion a box donald's wife arrived in a bog
yeah
the campaign glamour terms
really

yeah very funny and i think it's great that you're turning your talents know something a little more serious you want people to vote we can't get enough people out there getting people to go to blame up the midterms to twenty years ago they call that rock the boat
yeah anyone to a but it's still around actually a really amazing work here but i started this campaign with my friends that funny or die which is the production companies by will ferrell and adam mckay who have been producing early on the street for many
i was just making out with george will back stay
israel
so
it took me twenty five years to get me and also hundred minutes together

what if i come back so i'm talking about voting yeah so i started this campaign with funny or die called glaring up the midterms which is are fun way of trying to make the midterms which sounds like it sure sounds like home or to a lot of young people sound fun and exciting
and sexy millenniums you know any ails the millennium i am not
are you really are a little person i'm a little behind on a thirty nine but and i have as i as i have a lot of young fans you know really on the street has a cleansing him that following a lot and a big falling online and so i thought you know i'm always tweedy angry things every day
and as many of us are and there's a reason to do that
is productive but i wanted to do something
yeah
annoying that felt productive and that right a tangible result and so we're doing this campaign to get young people to though i saw a statistic which said in the last mid term in two thousand and fourteen only depending on which report you read only twelve to twenty percent of millenniums who could vote did vote and that's a staggeringly low number and so
where did you ever her generation of figure mean
a break even aware that they're very self entitled but they just can't
yeah i did ask my twitter following after the california primary where the numbers are up the numbers in california were up on june fifth that's a good start especially in ca forty nine or we is crazy jungle primary but when i asked my following why the ones who didn't vote in california didn't vote if they could i got a lot of
frustrating but honest responses and me it means that people are still really fucking lazy right
authentic lately the midst of all ever like and you're putting on shows like you've done this before and like you have to be registered to get in the show it's basically a bribe exactly is it wrong to bribe people to vote why don't we just pay no well we can pay them and so we're going to put on a show
do you make the guys
they get the barn but
that we're doing are actually if they're very locally curated will ferrell and i did a show and district forty nine in oceanside here where we'll played ron burgundy who has a very direct connect san diego for i'm not as we were in only entertaining the people that came who registered to vote but we also brought up young local leaders community
leaders kids working on dhaka analogy b t equality and march for our lives in bad district to come on stage with will and i and talk about the work they're doing and it was it was very inspiring so

ask what would motivate people to vote because i keep hearing this is very important to you tube diggers you're running keep hearing that the democrats have to do more than just be anti drum
okay but wait i even here very often don't even mention impeachment because that just makes the other side crazy they're crazy already
the latest poll embassy news wall street journal poor people are coming around to the idea the donald trump is a dangerous criminal the needs to be checked by forty eight to twenty three voters indicate the likely to support a candidate who promises to provide a check on donald trump i do think it is about donald trump
i don't think people are hearing about the other issues yes i do think you should run on repealing the tax cut and restoring your health care
to get a message like that
you have to get the message out door to door and then youth do it in an entirely different way and so we're doing this project sea change where we're taking democrats from los angeles going into red districts and we just kicked off a youth program with millenniums this week they are coming together and they're going to come up with their own plan on how to reach those
voters were giving them the boat or file they're going to figure out is a twitter is a tax what is it but will have them will come to your show your millennial should meet my millennium
kind of growth fair amount of and now and enough fat fucking you're saying these primaries now it's it's younger voters right the my nails are motivated women that are is angeline already batteries and for that like tramp is on the ballot and that's been energizing factor that's mobilizing and that's that's not bad for him
mean that any yeah it's that's not a good formula from kinds i mean you know that he's using a games just kind of trance on a that bad it doesn't mean republicans are as in bangor is it a good thing that on tuesday we saw that the republicans are primary there are more moderate candidates for these crazy
the curry stewart guy was in virginia now i guess the answer is it's good if we win will implement it is we don't dry it that and we've got a nazi adjacent guy the if it's a swing district gets good at it it's not then they're going so i'm corey stewart in virginia now
as these running against him kane hello like he's raining it's a very it's a blue state that went for didn't vote for hillary clinton and to gain and he's running and against a guy who's holes
i do had to deliver you got ever had
good
first he was he would never even wrong
just for publicity what the parties or any money with what you just said that there was this sort of coalescing faction of people who want to vote against him and see him thrown from office
counter to the idea that in fact he has trump or five the entire republican party and if you oppose in your out right here is really scare excuse me one second in view your shot but curry stewart this guy i'm talking about the third you who confederate not nazi adjacent logos that
he says when they start chanting lock her up because hillary so dangerous as president
he also said tim came to so now we're calling what it tim can do to get locked up
where the place again where it's so scary where their politicians running in regular primaries in elections who were calling for their opponent to be locked up here's what donald trump said today about komi me i loved the way he listen to the way he goes from the as should james caan be locked up
i'd never want to get involved in that that's the first thing is a second sentence
just seemed to me like they were criminal lacks oh third sentence what he did was criminal
i think i will never wanted to get involved too it seems like criminal acts what he did was criminal
and then what do you did this horrible bed in terms of constitution terrible thing to our people locked up let somebody else make them
memorizing lock exactly what we're not normal i have a natural were not annoying right here that we are calling and saying what it is and a lot of people are down after going to probably had a heyday in november which asia they deserve tail and he looks so upset about
yes after the country but this isn't this isn't bad well not be the country we're all just as a but as i are
what you're saying is right bell like this is isn't new lab and we can't allow us to ourselves to normalize and it does take us are saying that this is unacceptable don't also

don't underestimate the ability of these guys to reactivate seemingly settled questions of the culture war this is a guy who also at removing confederate symbols and statues was tantamount to what isis was doing in iraq powdering babylonian in summary and artifacts in other words the union is like isis or anybody who opposes
every and what it represented is similar to the islamic state is creepy scary to think with the child
i had this debate already did right we have to start debating to raise a culture war or not there is a fucking culture
i'm dealing with someone like tramp who is ripping in fades from their parents from their mothers
is a battle of good versus evil and i don't think it's over simplifying it
yeah
they ask a request okay a lot of times in the past when republicans didn't like a kinda like many who didn't like donald trump they said okay but when i go into the voting booth on casting a vote for ronald reagan or i'm writing and betsy ross er mitt romney said he's writing in his wife's name isn't it past time to
