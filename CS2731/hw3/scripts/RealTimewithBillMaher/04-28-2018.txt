the bad advice
okay what do you think of it then juggles who give trump again for his behavior that is otherwise
i don't think
i don't think well of them matter
nerds right
no i mean i think there two evangelical styles sort there's an evangelical style that says we always knew he was a bad guy we were just voting for him because he wasn't hillary and we needed basically like a tough guy a bodyguard we lost the culture wars and that i can work
yeah and that that i can at least understand but then there's the other styled it's like trump he's like he's king david david had a lot of why just
if you were but don't know
that are important jerusalem
well that's it i really believe that a lot of the then juggles believe that jesus he was coming back many them in their lifetime because he's going to want to meet them
he's gonna want to meet you too
but the debate of
they do the trick for you
like bank well
okay so do you think that conviction of bill cosby will lead to more celebrity trials
so every throws of like
sure
i do work
the important about these cases the cosby case and whatever is going on in the subsequent investigation of harvey weinstein is that we really do need to make clear division as roman said earlier in the show between the fact that there are people who have committed serious felonious offenses
should should be taken in front not only a court of public anger with the court of law as opposed to people whose behavior is disreputable but not illegal and part of the problem in the early part of the me to movement was that there was a blending of the two
thing which know after you speak of lady
that would talk over the lady
people
haven't committed criminal offense it's definitely should be treated to criminal court and that's the only place you get due process
all this other like screaming and yelling about whoever got didn't each process you know about frank i didn't get due process and matt lauer it and here due process that mark halperin to get due process there are no due process of losing your job or mark halperin unfortunately yes
remember i'm really really good
if reporting can lead to criminal proceedings and at times yeah it's not all of the reporters but it can happen in tandem and that when i would just say in the wind reporting one thing that was really important about the cosby president is in a world in which most women could never envision taking this risk speaking out against a powerful guy and actually being hurt
and saying hey look at these women who came forward against bill cosby even though they were smeared they were covered their stories were sort of kind of heard that was a hugely important precedent to tell them about i think we err on the side of listening to and not believe all women that's not a thing no one says that but listening to women letting them and speak in finding out if they're telling the
using reporting to find out more i mean that's where the where you like glum their al franken you in the same sentence with matt lauer somebody else and just bernie mac enough friend yeah because it just i just don't think mark halperin and al franken are the same guy
really
to them as they lost their job which is a bad thing but it's not like a lifetime tragedy like i'd lost lots of jobs quite frankly man
i think pretty great tragedy for the democratic party to lose a leader like that
i got cost
notably done i don't lay by the democratic party is not going to sound out with their numbers on already like the right thing to do i'm a constituent health of al franken i voted for i'll and bag didn't know these things about him if he i still don't know those things i know what a few people said
you know as
they're just in that picture alone was enough for me to reconsider my the picture was just really that you can't get by the picture
the one we're doing that
you know what i can't get ruined i got that somebody should lose seven job
he said actually loses a job for that we should hold those people to hire account but he was a comedian at the time
it's just it's a threat
really letting trump certainly has to make all this so much more ah yeah so much stronger because when when the person who is in the highest office has obviously not only gotten away with all the stuff of the course was like but also clearly treats women as objects as ornaments it's horrifying to watch and i think that
that's one of the reasons why people have just gotten so incredibly angry in rightful backlash can i just say what are the most common things i hear from survivors of sexual violence when they care debates like this which are smart debates and very fair and all of that this survivors the people with the actual story is get lost because we have headline after the headline about these men and we're not
listening to the women and sometimes men as well who actually endured the mistreatment focus the conversation there
sounds most of those victims of sexual violence aren't famous and the people that commit those acts aren't famous and it's those are the people that we really need be paying attention to it's rampant and service industries it's rampant in restaurant industry in a hotel industry and this
this is something that i i'm glad me to transition from the me to to the times that movement in a matter of fact i don't want to start using that more times it for everyone
and it came into
the entire
wrote the entire business model of facebook undermines liberal democracy how can we stop that model
i think it's almost impossible to stop that model because it is for me the definition of just hope he is good citizens get their information about the world as determined by the world's largest advertising company
and i mean as much an interesting way to put it i'm on it the world's largest advertising yeah right and and i mean i think as for it when mark zuckerberg said it had no idea this was going to happen i actually believe them i think he had no idea because he didn't want to look into it because he was talking his book which is i have
moto we need to build money fiduciary responsibility that's the way it's going to be but it is very clear that of all the things that we've talked about that are ripping apart of the fabric of liberal democracy nothing is doing it faster than technology
every day
that's behind fake news that's behind you know sort of us versus them that's behind everything that makes us not want to have civic nationalism and common values and there's nothing that makes me believe that we're moving away from that but you don't want i mean i i've i've read part of your book
and i think i agree with that generally but i think one of the strength of your book is that it's not just about sort of
i think there's a tendency for people who are should have associated with the establishment in the west to want to pin everything on facebook and fake news and social media and so on when the reality is that you know the reason people believe conspiracy theories and fake news and all the rest is that the people running the west
you know the global lists to use to use your language has had a really terrible track record over the last fifteen years and i mean the biggest threat to a liberal democracy in certain ways is the fact that we had the iraq war a global financial crisis
sort of totally terribly designed euro zone that lead to all sorts of economic problems that we're totally foreseeable but none of the people paid to foresee them for saw them and so on and i mean in that sense i think the strongest part of your argument is about the people in charge not the will run alone i really appreciate that and obviously i agree with that but i think that think that and everyone should be
i don't know but i think the thing than my book but the thing that everyone to everyone
when the time
the thing that really been turned on its head is a twenty five years when we started the internet it was all about on the internet no one knows if you're a dog right it was empowering tunisia and egypt
yeah now everyone knows your dog on the internet they do it doesn't imply rely on it out
tapping our now we went from this ludicrous techno optimism where this was going to liberate everybody and save civilization and now it's destroying civilization and we never went through the period in which it's like it's got good targets and it's got bad parts of maybe we can emphasize the good things and downgrade the bad things i mean a ten year to wish steven pinker here was to make to
to make the case that he makes the actually we look at the bad part of it but look at for example how many people have been lifted out of of extreme poverty
probably a lot of liberalism in the last twenty thirty years how many a billion billion billion in her out of poverty and it's never happened before in the history of mankind am optimistic in terms of the global most macro view it's a pretty good time to be alive and tanker in the world and right he had that labour has actually less violence
but the astra need gotten worse in the united states we have our life expectancy going down here
quality is growing here and life expectancy at between the races or says wow but you certainly earning or ad time he said hey going to that what's coming as host the united states is increasingly china a country that is authoritarian that uses technology top down and much poor right and as a consequence i'm much more concerned about a world
led by that and i am but a world that have and were eviscerated our capacity to go toe to toe
so that's reversible and all i'm saying is only if we found the state department and watch but i'm say it's reversible it may not be reversible this monstrous by the book for this year but first that the milk will do it all but
you're getting at the last question how would you stop the west from committing what you call cultural suicide well first should by allianz
ross is real
i have books out of print bill has a night hold hold true
israel's
you are
for books that are as a rant no one reads books anymore
it's an act but i have i've actually quickly and have an eight i think
buyer bucks okay
okay but i would say man is right
that part of it is that we don't tell ourselves we don't tell ourselves in the west that we are inherited of a great patrimony that we have wonderful great liberal tradition we we all we do is most elites and most of the public discussion is about everything that's wrong it's important to highlight things that are wrong so
can be changed but we have no culture horseback i'm to advance
the fact that we live in a time of extraordinary growth and extraordinary opportunity and you know china is is a danger and a threat china also is a country that has no ideological whole than anybody can preach it's got nothing to preach it's just a different can't breathe
and they can and can't breathe and what good is dragging america purity album in the next ten years with like three hundred and fifty million people meet in eight and relief and there's no money for it and so i think if we think more positively i mean it sounds like a little dogs that main i would say that
it's all true except that i just think the environmental iceberg binge watch melting and that's where it's going to get us going on
tell me that my
watch
not on h b o con
and i think a base back when seasons here is pat cash other his grief doesn't go away
i'm from grief
learning to live with we don't address our agree
close your him moving and honest discussions and others have experienced life altering office
spend as much time as possible my kid
