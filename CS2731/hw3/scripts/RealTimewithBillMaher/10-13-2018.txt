when experience over dallas every second counts see the life administering the locks on learn how to get in the locks on a visit and that path
back backlash
it's paid for with pennsylvania taxpayer dollars
welcome to l h b a pipe pass from h b o maintenance real time

okay these are the
what for you okay
great more top officials in the white house defecting and speaking out against him well
what a rush
the writing on the
next after the midterms when the democrat to take back control of the house and possibly the senate i think you'll see a great defection they'll be a mass exodus and everybody will be trying to fight or write another book or tell a story so i worry about who's after i mean
that that verse crew was bad but what
i mean like rex terrorist and you know i said that i could get wrecked religion back and there
chevron to have someone who could step in
okay going on is the us army justified in its decision do this charge over five hundred immigrant recruits in the last year well if you're talking about i think it's the end
program i think that it's just a it's frankly one of these things it's less a policy decision than some kind of administrative cock up in which they're just are a lot of different pieces to it but i have to know the specifics of the case involved i do think that when they're folks who don't pass a background check and what have you but i honestly don't know specifically what area careful on the show
the real atlas careful eddie is free speech on campus being stifled with students protesting controversial speakers i mean what about that part is political correctness that you can't speak on campus the home of free speech any more i think this overstated really
yeah you can imagine after milo spoke to her going to sell that he probably went someplace else and spoke without any any any incident you think about charles murray and middlebury probably while that what she did it and why you the next day without any without incident so if that were you can speak now no thousands what i'm saying there are thousands of lectures on college campuses
cross the ideological spectrum that happen every day without these incidents what you usually learned a lot about it i know that's because that's because it it's sensational just like you in your opening monologue you talking about the weather man they got a guy in the weather report when the wind was blowing and the people who were walking behind them casually sometimes we report about what
is happening our campuses in a sensationalized man
dave
how is your democrats address how badly they are polling with latinos
if there's one worry area for democrats in terms of november bets it right there
one of the issues there is it's almost more fundamental when we think of the latino vote often in the media in in politics we treat it is okay immigration and we think that is the major issue it's going to drive it and we expect it for democrats are going to get the lion's share to latino vote and yet
there's a recent poll it's said latino voters what is your top issue it was not immigration it was the year i went there to latino has identified as conservatives a quarter identified as republicans i think ryan had to pull their from a couple weeks ago they had trumps approval in one hitting forty one percent latino voters i've seen it between thirty five in forty one percent and also you have
historically low participation level lower relative to every other group out there among latino voters especially in mid term elections so if you're a democrat and you're looking at california texas florida couple other districts around the country were potentially will have to know though is going to make or break you i guess your biggest concern right now you got the suburban energy you got the money i think that
it's a big factor for them
rebecca why do so many liberals peg maloney as a victim rather than as a willing participant in a crooked family god i don't now
of
drives me bananas spring as there is such that sets an impulse to what i mean maybe it's about you know ever renewing hope for white women but maybe it's about that same impulse to think to to want to make a secret hero added some many next to him when it is so clear that milan yeah
these women are propping him deriving power participating part participating in the oppression and the destruction of the democracy and i don't know he drives me crazy
i loathe as much as
hope that the idea that money and some kind of secret agent in their resisting know she's she's as horrific as he with
republicans are still chanting locker up with trump rarely is it necessary for a democrat to publicly distance themselves from hillary clinton a ghost since clinton in order to move on from twenty six it's amazing the way they they do to tell
it a few was as if she was president
the idea that we could run away from the open calls to violent massage me by distancing ourselves from one lady you notice said they base out as it doesn't it is not about hillary it's about lock any of them up you said in your monologue and is dianne feinstein this week you know it's lock her out on her stanza stands in for a much bigger matter
for for when they want to do donald trump's political
just to turn a strength and weakness so when you look at the enormous enthusiasm you have on the left you talk about angry mobs right
turn it into something that looks scary and threatening us so that people will rally around it and that's part of what makes him so effective that's why reasonable to cut down all of his rivals in the republican primaries when he has our rival a clearly defined rival then he can be very very effective at trying to turn their strengths and weaknesses and that's why when
you have an actual democratic nominee that's the moment when he might become a lot more politically effective and he has when he does not have a clearly defined rival all that and he might just need a new channel leader and the i've attended to his rallies when we were on the campaign and there's a guy at the rally who lead these chance and he just might want to opera absolutely he just might need a
playlist instead of lock lock her up locker at they might need something to say by locked him out
the fact that we're talking about an american politicians saying lock her up yeah about anybody the american politician the most powerful man in the war in the world it's right it's so third world and there's so many books called basically it could happen here
surprise and grieving the also see populace politicians and pretty much all of the market democracies around the world who are gaining prominence this is not just a us phenomenon it's a global phenomenon and i don't think we're seeing the last of it i think we'll see more of it in the years to come right thank you everybody
