publications unveiled finally this week their new tax plan so hang on americans billionaires help is on the way
it's amazing i mean remember the tea party
rubber the tea party back in two thousand and nine two thousand and ten the way they took over congress
based on their bedrock principles that debt is out of control our biggest crisis an existential threat to our way of life
yeah i forget all that
this new tax plan blows a one point five trillion dollar hole in the tent in the debt and someone someone asked paul ryan
they said when when did republicans stop caring about debt and he explained after careful consideration at the current president is white


and of course you know there was another horrible terrorist attack in new york trump immediately started treating stupid when president doesn't keep us safe and then he was like a way that nina
but here's the feel good story of the week
i heard what happened at twitter on the last day at work at play
employee there i got deleted drums twitter account for eleven minutes i don't know this person is but i have one thing to say to them thank you for your service

here and a little later out with these baking author and isis expert graham one first up he's a military analysts for m s n b c and a medal of honor winner
talk about thank you for your service retired us army colonel jack jacobs

so
i'm guessing as a military man you're a student a military history and would think
and remember when caesar crossed the rubicon
that old but
and i mean you are there but that's when in rome when from a republic of course and there were four soon as he go to that phrase means as soon as rise of the rule gun were no longer republic than the army's and charge i wouldn't bring this up in america because we never had these issues before but the toddler a jeep seem to be
constantly being baby sad by generals he's constantly he said just today he was talking about the f the i should go after this i'm very frustrated the justice department that's not with the president should do it's like he's aching to be a dictator how concerned are you about this military thing going
i wouldn't worry too much about it i would be worried about the fact that there seems to be some level of ineptitude and at least one in probably both ends of pennsylvania i'm you
i think if
we're going to see something different probably in the midterm election and one of the reasons the republicans are not doing anything at the moment is because they want to see what the outcome of that it's going to be they don't want to irritate trumps base things might change at the midterm election i'm not worrying about national defense
in in terms of the leadership involved but over the long long term we longer term when think lives a crazy owner
well
that's about a kind of
what an interesting notion well you know everything may blow up the every presidents had the opportunity to do exactly that
every president wasn't a demented man child and clown makeup
this is
worried about these issues at all before i of here a general in the white house i guess you keep the football away from the president if you're concerned about that but that they have to take orders from oh well you know if you're if you're at the bottom of the food chain like i was
you mean among general i mean colonel even yes but any time you you're required to put you to censor in the you get the order in the order as long as the order is not immoral or illegal you have to carry it out but when you get to be at the top of the food chain
responsible for making sure all so that we don't do anything stupid
well that bus has
whether or not the president can order the and destruction of the entire known universe by himself
and not be checked by anybody
yes he cooked are
okay so what about general kelly
we're only a few weeks ago thinking this is the guy thank god he's around and you know he's done some pretty bone headed things lately for going after the war widow and or at least the congress woman who is defending her and and now talking about robert e leland like he's a hero in the civil war good
should have been a compromise and he looks to me like just another version of trump which is an elderly white male fox news viewer well as family candidate for that's dangerous
his responses
i've been something of a shock to a lot of people including those know him and know him well what a great deal of respect for him
who served with them for whom he served and so on
he was viewed to be something of the adult in the room
right and then he came out on the podium and started the this ad hominem argument renting like a fox news viewer that really quite as compared to yours
but but the most significant pair of course was talking about civil war and those of us who went to public school in new york city learn all about the missouri compromise in the kansas nebraska when we were in middle school now you're testing my history
hi i'm fuzzy and then the fact and the fact the matter is lincoln wrote that very famous letter five years or six years before the civil war started in which he said
he wrote
a nation can't survive half slave and have free five years before the war story sure so anybody who articulate that the war was not about slavery
as you don't smoke and too many left and cigarette

i can show you a few of those if you'd like
as a family show i know but it seems to me we have never had more really really disturbing national security issues when i think of them in my top four when they get your see of you think these are the four and in what order north korea
isis islamic terrorism that kind of stuff the environment the pentagon is totally on the page ahead of the head of the politicians and the environment being a national security threat her and russia
to all those four areas are all really like nervous
i think we've been a lot we've got a lot of threats the world is quite fragment the fret threats are fragmented were not organized to cope with the more isis is a problem only to the extent
that isis is getting defeated overseas and as a result they are going back to first principles which is to blow blow up innocent civilians were so that's that is a problem
we're doing a lot of harm to innocent civilians in the territory they conquered as well but they're they're on the way out there and least for the time being the liable to come back again but for the moment they're going back to the kinds of things terrorists always do and there has to go to places like the united states and europe and shoot up the countryside without necessarily taking any territory
so they're off the territory bit now
north korea a particular problem and it seems like it's intractable but if you consider the fact that north korea
is basically a continuing criminal enterprise
and the only thing they want to do is continue killing their own citizens taking forty to fifty percent of the gross domestic product and putting it in their pockets and all that stuff
it comes clear that they do not want to antagonize the united states by setting a nuclear weapon
on guam or any other place because they know they'll they'll get annihilated so
north korea's view is if they have a nuclear weapon then nobody's gonna bother them than they can continue ripping off their own people
north korea i think is less of a problem than a lot of people say precisely because it's a container i'm glad you have such optimism would you ever consider if trump card you tomorrow and so did you come in here and babies with neighbor
like so many other military men at the call because no had of your country i've got to restrain my tennis racket i don't have time for that



she is a los angeles times assistant managing editor of objects her scene of allentown a
yeah
the americans factor her former white house associated with old director under president ronald reagan you remember from c n n free large
l b j with woody harrelson navy is invaders a rob reiner

you're hurting for nice over time zone finance and after the show on youtube all right let's start with russia because you know this cloud has been hanging over the white house and this will get started to rain
i'm just wondering in light of recent developments what someone like you jeffrey would think of show that we have a little montage of donald trump denying he knows anything about russia and anybody who ever worked for him know anything about russia
i have nothing to do with russia
best of my knowledge no person that i deal with that and now now now nobody that i know of now
one
a bold faced lie at this point
the thing is
i can hear the groans
because already spending himself
wow

just say is a friend and ally he said
edit her lobby activities from two thousand and six to two thousand and fourteen you for donald trump ever ran for president oh come on what it forget
yeah i got not the entire group of what we're talking about three different to think tanks and by the way and that rain cloud they just announced a trial for him and for any made seven next year they are going to continue to go on for days
so okay but we do have the information now i mean we had it before but we have they been more that shows that he did know and by the way that the metaphor thing goes up to february twenty six am so it's not quite the way you present it doesn't matter the point is that we have this guy papadopoulos who says he was talking to trump
directly about russia and when he said look i rush you'd told me they have the hacked emails from the democrats and i told trump trump said well we should go directly to the f b i know he didn't because he's a trade
great set up some meetings on let's find out more and the fact is trumped doesn't know anything so he probably wouldn't know that you were supposed to go to the f b i
but
hall matter for when he was in that meeting in june with jared and with john junior he know that that's what you were supposed to go was going to the f b i and my in his was poor man afford installed by russia i mean he that's what poor man for did for a living he longer and that's called the swamp
that's called the swamp right right
bipartisan i have to say which is what the problem is
wow we got the that quickly
this is what they do fox news is already preparing its viewers for the firing of robert smaller because i swear to god korea and ask he said well we should be focusing on earth continued lies in the clinton administration
he's not talking about the bill clinton administration he's talking about the hillary clinton administration you know because she's president now
considering that just think i should i president doesn't mean you get to collude with the russians and break the law which is what does he easy to lose an election
but that's what she did
but my question about poor man for it looks like me because he kind of walked in off the street and said hey i'll work for you for free
it's a little suspicious yeah that a guy who had seventeen million dollar a little to the had been working for russian papa jerry years
seems they're always in the same pills which precinct was turned by this precinct yeah oh so you're going to the we don't know it affected the election it didn't but that's not with no no no no no no that's true you could no intelligence community that has ruled out that it didn't affect the election we don't know if it made the election go one raise the other but it
definitely affected the election otherwise you wouldn't take out ads on facebook this

oh god
that is right that is while the clinton campaign
this is politics folks the clinton campaign without stuff all the time
i mean how are we know how to win and now that wasn't from russia labour busy colluding with russia right
they were getting the russians you know and healthy
love with a straight face he says

the set much
are relaxed after after yang on rom has had a family you know but he but but you know about that bill because he he spoke i mean i don't think what big did to jeff was wrong i mean not always resort to throw him off i'd be out of the made a joke i mean it was clearly a joke eau claire
and but nothing there
is i listen i'm not on either side in terms of the policies but i mean that was a bad deal i think it looks like he's more relaxed is because we were talking about him like he's not here
looks like
liars
the to our side
met her spending two years of eight to one
so we got off on nothing
we got there are so let's talk about this you bring about facebook because the guys from not didn't know they didn't show up but somebody i guess the lawyers from if you strands
mr strachan with my mistrust rich
google and facebook and twitter testified before congress and they said face looks at one hundred and forty million users may have seen this propaganda from russia so to tell me that you know that it didn't affect the election
and of course
they will never admit that because that would be like saying the advertising that you buy here on facebook doesn't work it's one of the arrested he lurks propaganda exists because it works one of the thing i mean i think we have to be careful about getting government intermediate period
but one of the things that i do think we need to think of is when you go to advertise on facebook should you not identify were getting your money from that's what that's what they're trying there's a bill now
that's why when it comes to political advertising and you can't tell me and really spooky add on television that swings a bunch of lies can both sides do it that has a little fine print at the bottom someone's going to go look that up and maybe issue of on irritated press release about it there's not any teeth and that right you might know in a money is coming from but
it's not like there's going to be people digging into that new federal election commission record on facebook and twitter ads right there's a limit and like i was writing about
bet that study that and try to make the american people care about it campaign finance as a whole bores people usually this is pretty absolutely right but it was a red carpet bombed like they used to do in every election and it didn't work because people people see those said over and over they hate the new put the it out and of course they know it's coming from that person the most effective advocate
using his word of mouth that's why facebook is so dangerous that people don't know that they are repeating
the really scary part about this is the russians came in use facebook use twitter and invaded and infected us in a way that propaganda like you say works and now they're here now they're here and not determine who
what's real and what's not and they're gonna do it again they're coming in
they wondering how she's is a wall on this issue let's even forget the past we know they're going to try to do it again and we have a president who denies that they did it before where it doesn't seem to be concerned about that all members sat there for seven minutes on nine eleven
the is go right well you're sitting there trump is like sitting there for like years yeah
like seven minutes times his old right he's just sitting here while we're under attack
to be nice and nobody ever wants to say anything about goes what the chinese the chinese have hash the chinese the chinese have hacked into the white house they hacked into the defense department has a permanent but they have westernized it the way the russians were able to weapon eyes
the these hang on the line and of the security agencies you're a good american right you believe and secure all seventeen said it was the russians so why are you bringing up china will because i think they're probably the greater threat but in a long time but the as you here i think it really also has to be an element of personal responsibility right if you get a craving email from your
crazy uncle that says you know barack obama is a muslim or whatever it's your obligation if you don't believe that and you would like to prove that person wrong to go on snakes and to send them the factual information here to the coffee
it was not that different on but you have a responsibility if you're going to share something maybe google it for smear but you know side
the time
us by the time slots picks up the fact that it is an illegitimate that thing could have gone viral and again
well we've scientists he goes to that rain with kids are like there was actual potential violence bear based on some of these erroneous main thing is she last election
if it wasn't because of the russians well annoyed it was because of her it was only was a potential it was a combination of reasons is every complicated thing you
i'm not going to make
they ask about a original
the tax plan that came out and i was managing and it in the monologue especially about the tea party part of my base for remembering that that the tea party is there solely because of this issue that debt was going to be our downfall and now they have a taxi when adding taxes that i know but
first it was dead
it was a kid got taxes and not increase of debt and let you cut revenue there's not no revenue
but this happens
that's going to hurt people everywhere around public and gets into office they do this they when the democrat is an office they run on the idea that they're running up the dead because we're not just on it and if mitt romney were president this is a very similar tax planning he would have seen radio interact flannel yeah all ryan has one in four
decade and longer and but i had a reality check because it's not law right we're a long way from that they presented a plan you immediately see republicans who are worried about an election that by the way as one year from monday they're concerned about the fact that it blows a hole and the deficit they are concerned about the fact right here in colorado yeah we could disproportionate
the government has to be huge and we have have to be paying for this enormous government where's that winner know i know what you're saying you're saying
this is the starve the beast theory except they never get around to doing that well done this over and over the swap you have been as should be part of the zig overall deal which is the major chunk of money goes to the military and to medicare social security and that big deal that they always talk about unless you're going to look at those big parts of
money than you can't make a tax cut like that
either
and also to amazon
chris christie new jersey is offering them like five billion dollars in tax breaks because there was competition for them to put up their giant warehouse somewhere really they'll go broke without those tax breaks
alright so one of our favorite refill a as we call them i don't know it for a fact i just know it's true and this has been
so when he started before donald trump this idea i was just like you know there are things that i can prove i just know their true and now that's of course how we actually operate in a governor
but i like to make a list every six months or so for example i don't know it for a fact i just know
not for a fact that matter for it will be played by joe perjury in the movie
i just
i don't know for a fact that if you tried to pull out one of donald trump's hairs the whole thing would unravel like and christmas sweater
back i don't know for a fact that all of sarah huckabee sender sweaters are covered in cat hair i just
for a fact that johnny depp cause friends in the middle of the night and says my durning the nicholas cage
i didn't know commerce secretary wilbur ross his name i would guess it was wilbur wrong
i don't know for a fact that when people talk about seeing other people there are already banning someone else
yeah
i don't know for a fact that vibrator thing del those are lazy
i don't know for a fact that column or sometimes takes and they'd just are the people behind them can see
for a fact that your therapist is infinitely more disturbed than you'll ever be
strangers
there's with the islamic state word
ram
so you wrote the book on isis can't be easy and i remember when you wrote in the atlantic about it and the talk this week from somebody who was making no bones about the fact that he was in with his right yep singing the fight song from his hospital bed
okay and you wrote back in the atlantic in two thousand and fifteen the reality is that the islamic state is islamic very islamic the religion preached by most of it's followers derives from coherent and even learned interpretations of islam what do you mean by that will people say isis has nothing to do with islam
what i'm suggesting is that it's part of the islamic tradition you know the islamic tradition is fourteen hundred years long and it is diverse and isis has a piece of that it is a phenomenon that comes from that tradition it's not the only thing that you can you holiday was islamic but it's looking at things like the idea of a counterfeit like the idea that there are particular
laws that were handed down from the beginning and it is implementing them in a way that would be recognizable to muslims from many many centuries before when people say a religion is it's on was a silly thing to say right because
his bright different people in different ways and with some paypal it is isis and of course many more people it is not but just say it is a religion of peace hopefully to all unfortunately enough to all it most muslims do not consider ice is the best represent notion of the religion but we could say that about various christian sects to and
but really used to talking about christianity is having a crazy fringe a mainstream center peaceful christians warlike like christians and isis happens to be one part of that spectrum with the difference with the islamic world is the the there are many more fundamentalists mainstream people yeah or what we would call
fundamentalists i think the best analog within christianity might be the westboro baptist church which is that this group that used to picket the funerals of servicemen and they pay me that they're like video is even if it's a small group with with isis unfortunately there were about forty thousand people who traveled to syria and yeah i'd on their side so that's a that's a much larger
proportion so when people say
a double standard
how trump or yeah know i think we all agreed trumps solutions are horrible wrote okay i would agree that
his reactions yeah
but they said there's a double standard in the reaction to the vegas violence that we saw the las vegas shooter about a month ago and this are you mentioned the westboro baptist church people mentioned ten nick they they mention anders brother been mentioned the ku klux klan
who is there a difference
i mean there is a big you started to say just a numbers yeah oh we don't even know what happened with big as yet but the difference i think is that isis is claiming part of this tradition so it does have a certain way of of justifying itself that's different from other types of violence doesn't mean that those other types of violence
aren't concerning in fact that in many cases claim much larger numbers fifty nine people in las vegas but what isis is able to do that during this year yeah that's one event and that guy was not trying to acquire nuclear weapons
but he was very that's a big does very effective at killing people from from one hotel room of course but with with ryan that's what we get the sense that
any individual muslim can be activated in an isis mold because of the belief that they can speak to this kind of understanding that isis is reviving a tradition that they have some some part of now that's that's something that i think certain other ideologies don't quite have the ability to do is to to try to
you awaken the sense that we've got the right version of something that you're already part of
what do you think is the effect when people mention this has happened to you because you've written realistically about this so your mirrors why phobic
yeah i i have to look at some of these issues with trump in orange tinted lenses and i understand this is not a great time to be a muslim in the united states muslims are targets of bigotry their targets of actual islam a phobia at the same time at some point you have to engage the bullshit detector
and if someone says isis has nothing to do with islam then i think they're really going to misunderstand what's motivating people to kill and its name
and cuts cutoff debate
it absolutely does yeah i my belief has always been that you you're never going to solve the terrorism problem
unless you modernize the religion that until the religion itself has a reformation enlightenment like christianity did this problem is going to persist would you agree with i think it might even be more dispiriting
situation than that isis in some ways is the reformation within islam they're doing what you know five hundred years ago and christianity we have martin luther saying we don't have to listen to the established church we don't have to listen to the pope ice is saying your neighborhood a mom forget it doesn't always talking about we're the ones we can just read the koran and we're going
to have an interpretation that that is extremely violent but it's the right one even know where the minority so
modernization of islam can go both ways can go in and enlightened way or it can go toward that's unfortunately very violent and again one of the differences i think is that there is more support in a general population when we get this pulling back it seems to show like twenty percent of worldwide muslims are what they would call
as long as they're not terrorists they're not taking and violently but most of the things terrorists believe they believe they would say they want sharia to be represented in government but they might mean something so different from isolated they would hate isis i mean they might they might just believe that in some way the constitution in their country should should reflect
islam but death for leaving the religion
is disconcerting the highest levels of support for that that's right things like that which are not liberal principles know they're not compatible with what i would say
know ideas of human rights that i would recognize okay
let me ask the panel about the politics of this because of course trump immediately flew into action and treated that it wasn't his fault
had moments like that i just hate him so much and
and you know his muslim them is a terrible way to handle this right or minutes not affected that's on american it is bigoted but i also don't know what the democratic position is i mean i saw their responses
it was all about how trump handled it badly which is true but it didn't address the issue itself and said this many times i just think the democrats are blaming it on this issue of terrorism is a real concern to people i really don't i don't think as a democrat or republican issue this is a
very complicated issue as you point out and one of the things you talked about his reforming the religion and you saying it's already been reformed but the fact of the matter is until people are of you know
willing to accept piece as part of their religious tenets this is not going to be solved then i don't think there's a public policy that's going to cure what this is this is something that has to be worked out from the ground up and some kind of organic way and i don't what do democratic in her arms and hands of the heart
the democratic party historically it's your head
tough democrats like franklin roosevelt and harry truman lyndon johnson john f kennedy and then you had sort of a soft version the mcgovern carter etc and i i think as long as the public perceives that a party republican or democrat is not addressing a threat that what they see as a threat
they're going to turn on a question is how do you address that i wanted to address but i guess you here it's important to think about that
fight against isis that the government is embarking on is based on a two thousand and one war authorization after that september eleventh terrorist attack right this is sixteen years and i'm making that if congress there are members in a republican party and the democratic party they would like to actually debate going to war with isis to be able to actually saying this is what we're attempting to do
this is what we are attempting to fight rather than a award
that was fat from very different reasons that could go out and opportunity that they die
we don't know exactly what to do i can tell you what not to do what you don't do is send a an armed force into iraq and remove saddam hussein and on leash of and teen hunger year old sectarian
crowd that's a pass
that's not going to win anybody any alliance they even trump believe that right now what how about how about a democratic politicians standing up and saying we find not only the terrorist acts intolerable what the beliefs behind yeah this idea that were infidels were not infidels and of course i'm not saying all muslim
right
says is the political correctness problem it's it is partly that that some of these beliefs are not liberal riots the liberals are defending a liberal tactics problem i find with that is what do we do about it once we find out what their beliefs are we can't police believe what we have a buddy was find out what people are doing well
what what what is most important to me and what's worrying is the forty thousand people who went over there are these people if they come back they won't be just renting a home depot a truck into a bike path they'll know how to kill people moon an industrial scale so i think what we can do is actually look at the military side and probably have more more
productivity more efficiency than if we looked at why don't want get why don't we treat for example the gender apartheid
saudi arabia the way we treated race apartheid in south africa and the yeah
that is
gay people and i don't mind that it's my dad had all day and ten life three when we don't have a president that believes in those kind of human rights we don't have that
a good job due to tear tell you i don't either just going to life of me why so many liberals are hesitant to say these people will push gays off roofs
you know we cannot cannot get allowed was not out most of them push gays or for was but yes a certain do certain percentage a small percentage right and not all know you're right
islamic group that is hundreds of millions of people who wouldn't do it but think yeah gay people right don't have a right to live i and this is a
what's that started in the fifties i think cut but was the first guy to come to america and take a look at men and women a dancing together and went back and started i think the beginnings of what we see is this radical islamic terrorism so it goes away bands we have to understand words coming from
another reason why trumps planet so stupid is because there's no sense keeping people out this guy was here that sign a of brothers were here the guy who shot up the pulse nightclub in orlando was we should just be more careful
about have having people come into the country without examining for instance social media but how do you know you but the people who kind of manhattan and came here in two thousand and ten
where you're going to be able to seven years in advance that and were added to a terrorist group that at that point didn't even exist well i mean you examine where he's from at least designed with and it from listening some of these experts that use pakistan is a particularly hot bed of this kind of thing
that's not that's rather than that's a lotta of some
again
there was this diversity immigrant visa program that's how we got in here also known as the green card lottery and i didn't know about it and apparently it's for people who are from geographic region regions that are underrepresented like australia being one of them right away a really
i'm talking about australians is too many of them
yeah
oh yeah
if anybody in the hands where that
an example of i was trying to set of policy based on an advantage politically convenient for one party or another were you didn't hear live discussion about fifteen a policy after that vegas dating for example we didn't have a conversation that can control because the party they care most about gun control is not the party that had control of the government right now and that's what this is about more than exact
precisely where they're from or being able to filter through old so the lottery that drives me crazy i mean with would harvard say we're going to have a lottery in the first five i mean
what is that i understand being a welcoming nation that appreciates immigration that's who we are gonna we rebuild but later on i like begged them to come here when they're already than thinking about like we don't have enough decks and this
so every time you mention what got you fired so list and people would probably wondering if they don't remember you tweet sig heil wrote a column
i love nazi
it was about a group called media matters which makes a business to run around and and pressure advertisers to take people off the air television radio show
familiar with ben
yeah absolutely and and i had noticed over time alan dershowitz said that they had a anti semitism problem
i noticed this and other places so i mentioned this in the column and speculated how they would rewrite the first amendment and i put it in their borrowed something for mussolini and did it that way that i said at the anti american spectator was unable to come from the last two words in the draft were see higher
so so then we'd have to say leader is insane purity police nonsense that you have to go away because you made a little joke
i mean the thing that got me was i knew that when they set up these pressure taxes i talked to one of the advertisers on on a rush limbaugh show is not political he's jewish and they went after his business threatened him threatened him with his physical safety attack his business i mean this is not that i bring up the political correct
thing that happened last week because the pitcher for the dodgers you darwish game has no future as a pitcher
wow
but we we only got
but he was there was little controversy and he's a little bit my hero this week because the guy in the other team your what's his name your rio okay he had a home run he was excited he gets in the dugout you'd garbage is from japan he did that thing where he held his eyes to look asian which is not cool no one is condoning it but i turned on the t
i mean no one died you would have thing i mean the world got suspended for five games and here's a new dog your statement he said it's not like i was irritated by it
he did something he shouldn't have done that i wasn't angry at all i was told the next day he wanted to speak to me and i committed to hit communicated to him that it was completely unnecessary yes how about that new rules snowflakes
you know
that everything has to be a federal case i mean there have been people that have been reprimanded for doing a lot less less what you fat or when he said and then there's also the people that have faith zero consequence for saying a whole lot worse
i will point to at real donald tramp which has said a lot of things

that umbrage meter that gets cranked up and and ferry part of sand and it's something that let's go have to trump not this guy well aren't i mean he's gotta go away and and unrelated event raining i think he got the message i don't think he was about to march in charlottesville with the nazis next year i just think he's a baseball player he got excited he did something stupid tell him
oh let it go politico i don't want to do that though and that's the problem thank you colonel time for know

survivor survivors or come forward to say they were really touched by paypal name wine stains basie tobacco ratner pair that dick helper and a half men and george h w bush
i want someone to interview this turkey

i know it was years ago but your have to do that to get a pardon
hero he has done online all day to get the new i phone ten and you're setting up the facial recognition make sure one of the faces you make is this one
that were when you drop it into the toilet know it's you
somebody else to tell these young women that's not leicester hold

neural now that the chill women who were lost at sea for five months have admitted that they never turned on their emergency beacon
i don't want to hear any more jokes about how men one asked for directions

milan and must be in charge of setting the white house clogs during this weekend's time change it simply requires taking the small hand and pushing it back and she has experience with that


neural stop acting so shocked that selena gomez his back together with justin bieber everybody didn't reject a good me why would reject an asshole

and finally no role stop making movies where the hero is a guy who can drive a car
something we let sixteen year olds do what does it say about our psyche that hollywood could always count on men to plunk down ten bucks to watch another man make a motor go wrong room

i recently caught up with baby driver because the critics loved it and i had forgotten that critics are stupid
and it turns out is just one more in a long line of movies like the trends porter series and fast and furious parts one to infinity and
the new wheel man and done in sixty seconds and driven and drive and driver and drive angry and ten others all with the exact same plot when there is a tough job or even an impossible mission the cage to it is a guy who possesses the elite mind blowing skill of driving

the baby driver can get us out of this weather's great driving
in traffic
baby driver do this baby driver so it's indispensable to the highest that the rest of the gang actually hates it because they think he's too young to be that great and driver well everybody but kevin spacey thinks he's do yeah

of course the real world is not so glamorous baby driver is really over driver
because driving is not that hard if baby driver is unavailable you know who else can pick you up after you pull a job your mom
driving is so easy that cars can now drive themselves and the same way that vacuum cleaners now vacuum by themselves there's never been a movie about vacuuming
there was a movie called eat my dust but it was a bad driving
now it baby driver was about an actual baby who could drive that that would be impressive but it's not it's about a man driving a car it isn't impressive because i'm a man who drives a car practically every day and rarely as i'm turning left on velocity epic do i think this would make it
terrific movie

so i know what you're thinking bill
make it a big deal about baby it
true but it gets me to the larger point hear me out what bothers me so much about these driving movies is that it's such a lazy way to be a bad ass
she's you get more of a work out doing this
or even fake doing that when someone says hey how was that movie about the really great driver
and yet every day on the street i see some guy in a muscle car waiting at the lights with the chance to peel out and burn rubber and terrorist town the street like we should all be so impressed that he can do this with his foot

let you know who you never see doing that
a woman
probably have noticed in america lately that there's something wrong with dunes the recent stories of sexual harassment or about many things like misogyny and white privilege and old fashioned being a pig but i'm telling you there is
something toxic about this male laziness if harvey weinstein had made even a minimal effort join jenny craig
shaved
listen generally try to not look like a russian cab driver
he could have attracted women the old fashioned way by being rich and not entirely repulsive
you know
oh these creeps
why no dining no game
no effort to be charming or where you just open the bathrobe and say a lot of my little friend
and when they get turned down with this epidemic of i give up your when i'll just masturbate in front of you
cosby didn't even one is women conscious apparently
currently mark halperin and emma was just to rub these erection against a woman in the office like he's some kind of horny spider monkey who dabbles in political analysis
someone needs to write a book called how to behave with the woman like you're not an asshole

chapters like no one caring a resume wants to see your dick
and no one wants to do it in a room where there's a coffee machine
better
yeah
okay
my head
i'm watching my mom
each dot com
i think embrace back with season two of his power cash other his grief doesn't go away
i'm yvonne from grief and you just learn to live with we don't address agree
close your him moving and honest discussions from others have experienced life altering office i've been trying to spend as much time as possible my kids
listen to other is an anderson cooper wherever you get your pack ass
