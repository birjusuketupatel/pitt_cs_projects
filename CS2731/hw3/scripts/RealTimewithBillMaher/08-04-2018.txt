welcome to h b a passed from h b o maintenance real time with him
right great okay amalgamated how would you suggest the us retaliate against russia to check or we ask that question they've shot
you'll get another one i see another one era and therefore you going to try not to repeat the graduate as the years
since trumps revolvers and stinky have any of your g o p contacts and congress become more inclined to believe well i may ask a different direction
i hear that the republican party is shrinking hear this all the time that because trumps numbers within the party are so high it's because the actual number of republicans are going to it always makes me want to ask you how many steve schmidt are out there how many people in the republican party
are used to be who are now switching i think it's a very significant number and i think at she college educated republican women in the swing district delivered the blue way for the democrats because
but but the future the national republican party looks exactly like to feature of the california g o p which for the first time in history of the two parties in any state the republican party in this state is now a third party smaller than the decline to state registrations when you look at the net
that that that millenniums feel towards the republican party you look at african americans brown people you located just demographically the country and you consider that when people in print out a political party generationally and eighteen years age they remain faithful to that party really for their lifetimes for for decades and deck
age and decade so the republican party jumped as a huge huge huge problem demographically and it's going to continue to shrink but as you get a drinker a is it shrinks it is smaller just like the california republican party has it will become crazier
the point that i made earlier about the media this was also trump was an accelerant he has made the situation worse but weirdly if you if you look at data over time of party registration the decline in republican registration in some ways began much earlier before trying it was a lot about younger voters specifically young women if you look at what millennial men's party
unification looks like you go back to the first time millenniums can vote which it the two thousand and four era millennial men are just as republican today and they more than the for millennia women those numbers have fallen to where it's a democrat last fifty margin
the parties not paying attention to that stripping party gets to it
everything we see now is about a shrinking group of americans trying their best to enshrine power and privilege and prestige
so they know that they will they will come a day when they will have the numbers to do it
but if they lock in as much and changeable or difficult to change mechanisms then they will hold on to one another they don't have the numbers will join but what's really funny
that as a cheap but that has been all that reigned supreme court t from barack obama right because you try to and in something for out about numbers and and if we have mandatory voting they would not get close to winning office if everybody who yeah but but we don't have that if we we have voter suppression is and i'm saying get it's about am
radical went name's the rules wherever they get power they each of literal some are and ultimately the ultimate roles book is the constitution and they are taking dead aim at our constitution and brett commoner is the coke select in canada you look at how we came to me through the federalist aside long letter to asia a coke was investing seed money as he eddie royal society since the nine
and seventy cavanaugh is their guy he was selected by donald mcgann who is a coke person who is
trumps white house counsel who did the vetting of these candidates this is the coke candidate for a supreme court and that is a crucial thing that we should be talking about over the next month okay i was going to ask about stormy then
serious stormy daniels got arrested
supreme court
it doesn't you don't find this an alarming that we are now arresting private citizen it's it's not that me that it was only maybe it was trumped up charges i set up it was a police set up what do you think happened what do you have would do you think it came who gave that order or was an older not needed to be no water needed to be given i mean you know it's like the
the fight between the brown shirts and in the black shirts on the nazi germany back that aegis that you want change you
that means rolling up your political enemies you roll them up whenever you want to create mayhem it's like you said you know you have nuremberg and hillbilly nuremberg and these people will go out and they will affect change themselves if that means walking into a newsroom and killing everybody in it they'll do it it's unspoken laws and unspoken orders that are given out there
as you said these things are long ball games they will change the system to allow these things to be punishable
other as politically motivated but for his part and parcel with ice agents for example in a cocker new hampshire bus station walking down the why asking people for their papers please show that you're a citizen and so in this country the only appropriate response and someone asks you to show your papers and prove citizenship is to say go fuck yourself right right
okay
before we get on a bus but but all of this is is alarming
all of it as radical and we shouldn't be used to it
but we got used to but the current president and the men in to see the papers of the previous
it is him signaling and people saying that with me and they are kind of falling in love and doing exactly well that's all have or on this goes way back to nineteen sixty to are in the republican party deciding to plant a flag in a stable wouldn't let a major hundred
anything else far from that oh that's right away like and more of the world's the tripods were were under arrest
and and i came to the planet and they came from an autograph
i wish there were always under the limit the first law enforcement organization that into a strong border patrol and ice they are you know i feel sad about this because i love my law enforcement officers i train them in countering terrorism and counterterrorism intelligence all the time i engage with them but there was a block of people right now think that they are
the enforcement arm of the trump administration and they are taking these orders literally like you said new hampshire bus station really you think that there's going to be illegal immigrants trying to get on a bus up there they want to enforce his orders in the head ice himself came on television and said until the owners your change that's going to be
the orders locking up kids no problem this is a malfunction that has to be re calibrated and when when we change if we change this congress were going to have to change laws to where they're gonna have to pay them
had was good
last question briefly james asks who in the prospective field of democratic candidates do you think would be most likely to be donald trump in twenty twenty it was year ago the essential skill is going to be somebody who can provoke trump
have trumps swing it then and then be smart enough to stand back in not get into a brawl in the middle of the ring but to cut trump with humor
to laugh at hand right is a narcissistic
humor is the most potent american
our rank and than a great
we got we might as well cause you to stand up there and robert deniro with all respect he says fuck you ride he's play and trumps gang exotic godzilla you new godzilla he just gets stronger
you you try to how vile donald trump
yeah and also had strong are supposed to harness and the poets best we can do fuck you
name a person
i like sept molten kim ryan to to young congressmen and wow
ohio because i think that there's heavy a lot of energy for new and you know we talk about that loss of affinity for the republican party among women i mean it looks like the commanders meeting from the handmade tail when these guys
so i think that whether it's john hickman loop or whether it's eric garcetti of this city it's gonna be someone camera
just out of the progress through the line but i will add to that it is very hard to win
democratic primary with not be from the south and you have a name in back from the south and i think you have to mix into that group people like and you of new people like that because the democratic crisis and swings of soak because what bernie had a problem he could have one but he did
he did not get into the south quick enough did not as message strong enough to not connect close enough with those old the older black women voters and you have a killer makes great guy but was his killer was a killer
does it to you
because i have like someone from the mid west or it could work but is hard but there's there's going to be at least two credible african american candidate and there may be three as governor patrick wrong are not gonna take me seriously when i got it
an outsider
i'm doing now guess
