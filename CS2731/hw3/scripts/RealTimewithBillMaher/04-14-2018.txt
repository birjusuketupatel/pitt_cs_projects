shoulder
i've been working out
also his shoulders
how much of a bombers legacy will survive
the republicans are really think most of it will i honest to god think most will obama care already has they couldn't repeal it will the jury's out there yes so they tried a thousand times to repeal it and they've been they've given up that not going to do it only
way into your to there
the dodd frank reforms of wall street
i think a lot of the environmental stuff is going to is going to stick because electricity
solar power is getting cheaper wind power getting he were all that all those changes i think our outliving because he made better policies in this stuff truck tried replacing about what are you in your apartment where users are wider than than poetry accomplishments i mean when you look at the way
the morning or generation my generation generations that you're stepping up you can trace that directly back to transform a waiter told us or the ones we've been waiting for that ultimately
our salvation work i'm not from will come from his legacy which has he made a lot of people particular in my generation believe we can do what what what
he's going to transform the courts in a very bad dangerous way and that we're going to live with that for very long
i mean they're sort of stuff
it's bad there's there's parts of this country we're never going to get you know
okay
no let's move on to something for and let's good
palate cleanser
do you feel that reality t v can be seen as pure entertainment or does all media share responsibility for setting some sort of example for viewers
question i mean it is a loaded question i think for us
bravo as the most educated audience on cable outside of all the cable news channels and they're smart enough to know the house was there aren't people can watch stupid they can they can and they can know that you cannot make people feel guilty it's true i read the tabloids
done it since the eighties when i was wearing the right
i've had people say to me you know celebrities will don't you that because you know what they take pictures with my children and you're only encourage and by giving them your money
hurting my job i'm like fuck that you know what i agree on a plane tomorrow morning to go to replace your do to i'm tired in the morning so that i worked all week there's your i want something i can laugh at yeah that makes me laugh out loud not intentionally it just does yes
also keep up with my friends okay
did you finish your enter good
oh shit he flipped a table should i do that
they reviewed it just right
you're going to fuck up your life
they're taking your kids
okay
my it is as a critic of the use of excessive force by law enforcement how would you suggest we go about changing department protocol legislation
in fact california it's already looking at legislation
it was very marginal destroyed while you literally right and what happens right now is police departments essentially right there on patrol guides that tell them what for physics at what you know that the rules of the road for police officers and what they do is they building huge amounts of discretion rather than setting boundaries that actually makes sense for keeping
everyone safe because the truth is it will also keep officer safer
i've been running the bill for a long time
how they had this idea that if i feel threatened at all i get to kill you
that i don't know how you legislate that that mentality has to manage why we all empty are clip into that guy if we think he's got what happened to just watching the go right forgot about the old free just goes away
cell phone or a gun
after to start having to pay a price for bad behavior that will change may i see right price and they were starting to make some real changes with last couple years of the obama administration is finally got a new york city's made some real changes even while we've had some really big problems because there was an insistence that we stop policing people from poverty now
now didn't happen and eric garner right but if you tell if you actually say out and actually district attorney races have mattered a lot getting reform minded people elected as public prosecutors is actually and ken thompson in brooklyn actually said am just you can bring me people n y p d for low level marijuana
and we're not on prosecute and that's actually what
oh he passed away
jason candor as the first in an era millennial five months
what's the current oil
i'm thirty six thirty six as a millennium just bury finance i'm i'm angry senior millennium
there
what do you want to know i want to do more
okay
inviting you to know i think
he was implying that you are hitting
i certainly was
thank you
i resemble that remark
as the first no avail ever likely to a state wide office how do you feel about the reputation of your generation of being an engaged lazy and self obsessed yeah
yeah i don't have any of the are the threat i think the idea that this generation wants to have our personal identity match will receive from our country will receive from the company that employs is that those some entitlement i think that's not true i think from the folks that i saw in afghanistan who volunteered know and that when they sign in the
out of line they might end up there to the folks i saw marching in ferguson
when i was secretary of state of missouri i don't see entitlement i see patriotism well there is a lot of that
some of the
i think the problem began when parents i don't know what generation it was a or millenniums but as soon as kids were able to say fuck you mom
that's where we all went down hill
any kid who grew up saying fuck you
fuck you mom generation
that and don't live in my yeah know i know
they live in a lot of people's houses okay
ended you think the me to movement has affected the game isn't my question that somebody wrote
believe me i am obsessed
it says ready or do think the me to movement has affected the gay community and yeah i think it's affected everybody in hollywood i think it's affected a lot of people are on the country that certainly in this business yes absolutely
because of kevin spacey way because we all have to watch how we speak to each other the entertainment industry is very salacious by the nature of what we're doing i mean where where look striven there's a lot of jokes there's a lot of things that are not considered appropriate in the workplace i think everyone is
had to look at the way that they speak louder than kevin spacey i can think of a lot of well i'm just saying anything up in the entertainment business whether you're gay or straight it effect right beneath the earth
some day she in the shoes about to drop
people out there that you've heard that maybe be should possibly yeah like had done some things and maybe yeah the positives
going to be good for them
i'm just looking for a school
good for a skill
saying this because i think it's really important and now that analogy between two people in this country have largely been significantly less protected and even when we have laws on the bucks will cause there's this this this assumption stereotyping about somehow you couldn't be sexually harassed
and that is that is a serious and justice that we had not nights and be beyond that i mean listen they're discriminated against in the house down
legally across the country and we have a vice president it was incredibly anti gay and a nervous to see what and not of cause it right so if you're sexually harassed and then you don't want to come forward because you i don't that's where cue comes in
my view is to say
yeah
meth incidents in real time
