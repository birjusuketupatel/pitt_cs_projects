no unique
when experience over dallas every second counts see the life administering the locks on learn how to get in the locks on a visit and that path
back backlash
it's paid for with pennsylvania taxpayer dollars
welcome to age be a pipe down from h b o maintenance real time with him
yeah

right



yeah

the i know why i'm happy because kim jong north korea
today it's old south korea
that is willing to meet with the leader of the united states but wasn't available so trumps go
a fat man a little boy
are going to have a day that looks like trump is going to travel to north korea in christian are reason is a hundred reasons why this is dangerous or talking about after all a family that has reneged on every deal they ever signed and kim jong on can't be trusted aide
you know
it's got to all the cable news last night and all these liberals who are reflexively hating on this a obama remember him
proposed the exact same thing in two thousand and eight and they loved it
and they fuck you don't live on the west coast where a new can get here faster than over from north korea
what does is bullshit no president has ever done this yeah and they all failed so i'm going to file this one under so crazy it just might work
this could be the one thing that trump honestly is uniquely qualified to pull off because kim and him rocket man and rain man

mirror image in a weird way they respect and like each other you know trump said he's a smart cookie they had the same interests flattery celebrity tyranny
they both have daddy issues and overeating issues and problematic family members and inexplicably hair

they both love missile parades and both why and their gob scores and one day
f members working for them in the next day they disappear

the one american that kim likes dennis rodman will trump is the closest thing we're going to be get to president dennis rodman
another stupid argument i heard on tv last night well we'll just be giving him the respect he and his family have always craved so what so what if it works my old plant taylor used to hang out with me because i'm a celebrity i still got free weed
and you know it behaved so much i do this may be happening because of donald trump it could be his tough talk it could be because of the sanctions could have been tickets at the olympics who knows what is kim jong on mine it could be because shape of water won best picture
he saw that and thought well if you can fuck affair she can negotiate with a whale

north korea is not the only place trump will be traveling to next week he's come in here to california is that great a didn't want to but this is where the porn stars or
i've been following that we now have a full on sex scandal in the white house stormy daniels is now suing if that was the developed but this week on monday she filed a lawsuit enough you forgot who she is daniels
if you recall
okay the man who got eighty percent of the evangelical vote for president
sixteen and the star of toxic cum laude six
met at the at a golf tournament in two thousand and six after which she was paid to shut up about it but sarah huckabee standards is really fucked up and she said in the press briefing that trump one in arbitration case
with her a lie that contradicted her original why that trump had nothing to do is stormy daniels so now it's just that he said gee said stormy says they had an affair and trumps says they didn't but who are you going to believe the fake blonde with big tits or stormy daniel

i couldn't wait to do that
but here's the story day does not suing for money she is suing for the right to talk about the fat disgusting trump sex that jihad
she wants to get out of the non disclosure agreement you signed and trumps lawyers this week said they want to issue a gag order and she said that cost extra
but here's why
here's where she has a case because in the settlement papers first of all the settlement papers trump goes by an alias
and alias david denison
david denison because dirt degree was to on the know
what those set up this settlement might be invalid because trump mean drug dealer
forgot to sign it this happens a lot to a stable genius
but it is always going out about other countries in latin to get it out
now really not even big as the president fox porn stars but ticket she has a better lawyer

gonna on drop manage to find the one woman in america to have sex with him who then wanted to talk about it
usually when he sector so many says don't tell anyone in they're like not a problem
but the best part is that the documents say that this drama daniels has quote certain still images which to me sounds like depicts what what else can still images that he doesn't one out there and you can tell it's trumps dick in the picture because well two reasons
first it was a big sign on top of the trump penis

and also it's and sean hannity his mouth anyway

very wife somebody or kinds of first up is a grammy winner and a two time emmy winning canadian and actors who holds the guinness record for most comedy specials by a woman more importantly she is a good american who loves her country and should be able to work in it kathy griffin



do i did i cut my hair very very sharia while shame in our hands down pissed off waiting were angry or shame our heads just fine to scare you guys down first of all i really want to thank you for being one of the first and only people to publicly support me and say what happened was bullshit

attacks from celebrities that were like and don't have any i think this tag
yeah i don't care you all the way here
jerry seinfeld now
as if we yet there's never been in jerry's i felt exactly yeah but no data
but we've missed you

one thing nobody could ever take away that you are a hard worker i love it now you will love it you got where you are through hard work you joke by joe and joke at a time
i never had a writer i never had a stereo i never had a manager inches are grinding it out and and so i love doing so for you to have it all taken away overnight it just really pissed me off more than anything because i mean look you took a picture you took a very bad salty
i blame the dog for i've been on these photo shoot and they're always trying to do something provocative writer said hey why don't you know lackey picture the wacky picture and it turned out to be a little do what he has quite wacky okay it was very wacky and but you know if it wasn't the united states had babies the first thing you said was look i went to florida i get it it should have been over
she gets it fine but of course everybody has to go bat shit about everything oh yeah i'm yeah and actually the south the analogy is a really good because almost like imagine if you tip know what he had the worst suffering in the world he went to and you woke up and you found out that the president waited about it which then mobilize the right for everybody
else and then he also lot it was illegal which right
peaceful but not illegal covered by the first amendment know i went to
i mean
i went through something like this yours is worse because you are actually interrogated you were to two months federal investigation by two departments from the o j that aren't yes right i mean after nine eleven i had this on my walls and or while the variety headline the white house keeps heat on a b c s i
remember very well yeah ok so and it was bad ari fleischer was talking about the in the press coverage every day but you had it far worse because you literally had your livelihood taken away from you'll get my show can go and we are ratings never dropped i haven't had my eye was in the middle of a fifty cent each your and i had like twenty five day
it's up until the following fat february because it's happened i may thirtieth teams he was reporting my show cancellations and real time which scared i think the theaters so the theaters which i don't blame because although some you know normally they do like stomp her mama mia and all the sudden they're getting robo calls from like a lot farm in macedonia going if i say that bitch on stage i'm been it
cutter and the chopper head off and put her head up or count that one
no joke that was the number one reason that the
folks who are angry want to kill me that's the monroe and procedure don't want to do
moving on
yeah was it was ugly and yeah i mean
it really get out ahead i think when when the official security apparatus of the united states of america would you'd think would have something better to do and i am sure knew better than you were somehow a threat to the president will they interrogated you you have flying is still a problem for you yeah i mean you are on the deal is know you're on the no fly list
life is much better deal
yeah i'm on the interpol list and so when i couldn't get work here after an interpol the international criminal yeah so i did and overseas tour i did fifteen countries and twenty three cities and i was detained and every single airport which is frightening because they see it and they scan your passport they see it
way this is really scary when you're at the singapore airport and you see the person go like this
and then there's like whispering and then they put me and like a detention room and you don't know how long it's going to take and i'm thinking you know i got she excuse me have it
like show i gotta make soccer moms and gay guys laugh
various in all seriousness there were times when they took my devices that can do that and you might think you know we all have our rights but when you're in that moment you're are really at the mercy of one or two people in that room so it happened happen happened l a x they happened in london heathrow
and it's scary every time you don't quite know what it is so to do it all over again
resume take the picture but if i did my parents now i'm kidding

i waited to do that job allows it
what would you do anything over it
was the aftermath of oh yeah i mean everything about the aftermath was it truly is a historic situation so one of the things i like doing about touring is as you know you're on stage and you can really tell your story without censorship and stuff so the current show i'm doing actually does have a couple serious moments in it because when i described that interrogation you can
hear a pin drop in mean like i said i've just and twenty three cities and fifteen countries and the intensity of those moments when my first amendment attorney said to me you know if this doesn't go well you you leave your handcuffs and the deal j called my attorneys every single day for two months did she come in yet did she come any the everyday they call them
and we can do a it's called a no knock which is what they did department for her no not come in and i'd be like fine c'mon any we can take that back three boys cities
so name was crazy and but that's how crazy it was so i was determined to not do like a walk so it cost me a lot of money of course but at least be able to negotiate the interrogation happening in my attorney's office but it know just been told you could leave in cuffs
you know when it came straight from the d o j and white house
so and that's that's administration that we have now so that's what i am here to talk about his i really believe that it happened to me and i really believe it could happen to you and other people or people's kids around is it could happen it's gotten crazy mean
we're not going
that picture
but i do believe what you're saying in journal is correct everything that was unthinkable two years ago lose think it will not dictatorship fascism all those kinds of things
libertarians are going you nor nothing is off the to correct okay so do you think i know some friendships were casualties and i'm down to three guys
i hear your flow and i hear your fluid
very trendy now very hard sell tickets
and this place treatment
so i want to got can from cnn which sucked because i was never here in an employee only one night a week that they made like this sweeping statement and well i was going on jr was like of all people like don junior that freaking crow mag like early human whatever it deal is goes out what good morning america and
i'm just want to ruin catholic reference career we want to decimate her and that was flight months after the photo so what do do some not decimated right no you're not

we need comedians know that sounds like a proud of what are the what we really do you honestly in this era to to sometimes go over the long yeah we know where the lines are and also to establish that we do live in the country with reece beach that was distasteful it might have been a lot of
it was free speech yeah free speech is still covered the board and most important and also the outright is kind of co op didn't like weren't
somebody knocks over a garbage can set on fire and their all right person of say that's free speech but they kind of co opted that but you know you and i do the kind of comedy to push boundaries and and to do that you have to move them and then cross them and push them again and see what works and i'm finding like i know you're on the road as well i'm finding that people are wanting that kind of comedy or in such an intense times
people are jogging can't jokes know i mean
the does flu
the real deal and they want to be very mean to donald trump
i am too i'm definitely try i do have by the way in a small victorious announcement soccer okay so i'm dipping my toes into touring again even though the trams and nobody wants me to work again but i'm doing my toes and and i just booked today i'm going to do a show at carnegie hall in new york
i'm also going to go right to terms backyard and do a show at the kennedy center
yeah




as a conservative radio show it was founder of the resurgent dog carbon author of of for you wake life lessons from a father to his children eric ericsson's bug where this year
okay she's a geo please draw and blow to contribute to see it and i don't have our
i'm pretty no vehicle parents ages theater in minneapolis march seventeenth in the ago in fargo and marjorie to try crowder
so are listening to a monologue or do you want some the girls that
i'm sure a lot of people weren't thinking that is when i was going to say about trump and north korea because you know we live in this tribal world where everything has to be the blue team of the road team and look this deal may blow
we're talking about it right now
for i just i just want to read obama has quote from two thousand and eight and just remind people where he was because he was asked in a debate if he would meet with the leaders of iran syria and north korea venezuela cuba without preconditions and he said i would and the reason is this that the notion that somehow not talking to countries is punishment to them
which has been the guiding diplomatic principle of this administration
meaning the bush administration is ridiculous and hillary cat cold state department turn it and everybody said but the based loved it and he won the primary any made the money
general election and if it was good enough for him i think it's good enough know i think there is one key difference there
very very keen on reminding us of this yeah donald trump is not barack obama
i'm with you on give it a chance it's better than the alternative and i'm all for diplomacy but i'm still i'm not gonna sit here and say that i have a lot of inspired confidence and this working out in our main to may watch these two guys debate on what to do about the nuclear situation and north korea is like watching
to hammered drunk bricklayers debate about what to do with a brain tumor
them but i know already at the worst place it could be they i mean i was in hawaii just a few days before that alert came over this year and i had friends there said of course we were shooting and are painted came over in our fallen to the missile is in the air this is a real this is right and the absolute look i
i have an underlying and barack obama said that i wasn't answer i was against him
giving confessions to that take on cuba i thought that was on a good idea to me this is different because that's got nukes and then as a sense of urgency now and i live in the east cause i live in miami i gonna lot faster than i am but i think that as a sense of urgency that that makes it less explore whatever solution is that being
said the idea of donald trump negotiating with the came as i'd what are they going to do put their buttons on the table and have been better button
but yes but probably you know that
the bluster blurted that know it's not an unprecedented in the history of diplomacy for the peace breakthrough to come after the two guys have their who's dick is longer shouting match at each other we've had three consecutive administration's that everytime north korea saber rattled we paid him money we gave them food and now we've got a president
true i you wouldn't say it's incompetence or something different whatever he said not going to do it this time and suddenly they want to come have a face to face meeting give it to my mean she had i started he was towards taken out and we never will
try something arrest has already has it except for the bomb actually exploring a kind of reminds me of when we talk about mass shootings and somebody says deliberate talking point and i'm certainly not for arming people but they say what if somebody else was in that room with a gun or would have made it even worse really really could have gotten worse
just the guy who's a not spraying the room it can't get any worse
except for being annihilated
not from could bring the nuclear war on by going there next and the had a winner
i'm going to be pleased to hear he doesn't understand diplomacy i agree with he doesn't understand math or spelling or science
but he does understand schmoozing there is something about these two guys i think that is very simple go they say i have a yo mama contest your mama is so ugly and just go at each other
i don't have you have the insult say i didn't think i have has been going and crescendo with north korea it's gotten worse increasingly so there is a sense of of what had happened
kim these what thirty two thirty three he's been in office five or six years he's done a lot of bad things we saw assassinate his family members and so forth well it's a rough go over there i'm guess we will take over and you use a ruthless dictator the be learned from his father you got to eliminate the competition first drums of business band
the a way
maybe he did that and now he's ready for something new he's going to be an it's another fifty years he can see that map you know that map they show at night of the two koreas yeah south korea ablaze with electricity north korea completely dark his people are in the dark about that he has seen that and he's probably thinking he might be fun
and to join the world lights on things
they may falling falling forget porto rico thinks their fame will be nice to have

we got nothing with they've gotten closer and closer and closer to bomb with american experts saying they're not going to get a bomb it is time to do something different world not for nothing but i'll be stoned if did actually even happened yet he's already very very mundane but never underestimate how important respect is to people just the
of him getting this meeting could calm things down a lot sometimes that's all they want is to be treated like an equal like wow we went to a meeting with the united states now we can all breeds a little and i will tell you it's not only campbell wants respect it's tramp who wants respect and he listens to the media and i think that if he sees
people sending him affirmative wants to make you know kim likes porn stars
right yeah bring stormy day
okay so let's rather the other war the trade war drums started this is pretty crazy first of all answer me this panel somebody answer this for me donald trump went to wharton least on the smoothest he does not seem to understand what a trade death
is he talks about like we give them money and they give us nothing that's not a trade deficit that's trump university

doesn't get the eight
come on
to be an actor is he must understand that we get something back
for all the double trouble the campaign trail bashing liberals and and liberal academics he's being led by peter navarro or a fringe in our relation yeah no no
he's been basically i guess is down return
period of our was a university academic it i leave university california at irvine he's a result ha papers on china none of them and maybe one democrat canyon you use a diplomatic candidate repeatedly very liberal wanted to ban the incandescent light bulb
donald trump bought into his china rhetoric and brought him on board for tourists there is not a liberal or conservative economists alive or in the past hundred years who thought they were a good idea but this guy apparently knows the buttons to push with the president but as with everything he made this big pronouncement and now we see him doing caveats and convey
pushing and pulling back it is be the only consistent thing about donald trump if his inconsistency we signed to do with integration we signed do it with guns with saw him do it was guarding days from the military the guy you know can hold more positions then become a filter
yeah
now everybody came with
don't have a shot at
no i don't think that that he understands the day there but i do think he understands that his base also doesn't understand it really a main the tariffs and every he knows they're going to say about
joe millionaire stock market well that went down but tell me this why is this fringe economics but not trickled down why is his tax cut in prosperous times is almost no economist who think that that's a good though i would disagree with you on that i think there's definitely a liberal conservative divide on economics but it's hardly an equal device
you can always find a few notes anyway listed when there is very few people night the i mean the university chicago is a prominent economic school that pushed ronald reagan back of the nineteen eighties on the idea of supply and may have a panel now with like forty two economists who also this was a bad idea
do but
yeah the not into that
you know this isn't a situation like tears there actually is an academic divide on this with tariffs is like the anti vaccine crowd were you have that doctor saying don't give kids vaccines that tariffs there's actually a pretty academic a rigorous group of conservative economic economists who supports supply side economics okay i a question you know
so no growing up poor model life when is it going to start trickling down

you know they just tried trickle down economics to get in kansas it was a disaster i mean they have tried this experiment and the keep trying because we already have the results but whenever they do this you cut taxes some out to this magical point and then you orange why i and my boat and when
acts as a nineteen eighty one when didn't hack work in two thousand and one we saw an increase revenue the problem is the spin the inside of republicans who say they want to cut government and they never actually do if they actually did super bowl cut she would actually see an increase in income and government has because republicans used to be anti spending they also will they be against and delta or a precedent
good
when it comes to stimulating the economy i mean you give more money to rich people a barrel oil futures and shit
but you can win money to poor people they buy
i just

the last three months since the tax cut past we have seen very good headlines come out of this tax cut we have seen good numbers would have seen good job numbers it's an experiment and we're going to see what the short term is looking good and it's helping trump we've got to see with the long term was going to me it's going to be an exponent either republicans were right or we were wrong on
fortunately there's going to screw something option
okay will people
gary coleman is comparable to those removed over the terms of the warriors people are losing this worried how can you imagine the fact that this guy who apparently you know who and abetting reported and said that he thought of leaving over the response to charlottesville over trump equating neo nazis to those protesting against and found his
moral compass over tariffs least finally found
administration officials to quit over on principle
people have not sled the white house this bunch and the british were burning it may two
so what happened is there going to put up some motivational posters you know these motivation and just williams i'm here are like people put these up in their office team work great things are done by a series of small things done together and know a good morale up with their authors attitude is a little thing that makes a big difference so would you like to see some of the ones are put
up the white
their lungs like it's been sixteen days since our last indictment
this one hundred percent of the procedure don't grant
hope she doesn't work anymore

teamwork a better word for collusion
character always stay in it
integrity when in doubt just chat locker up
sacrifice there's no i in treason
dream big as the ugly married guys who dated whole picks
and believe at the end of this shit show there's gotta be at least a book deal
they are


then so good
so quickly
but it didn't do it ever really loved you and also years voted on my side about a lot of issues and by this point of the show i'm so argued
you can pick up the flag out but i know we're both sort of fighting the outrage machine you know the the professional outrage people and let's just get out because i saw you got some hot water for nothing i've got a bunch of hot water okay without the immigration into the point where like i don't even know what the fuck they mad it anymore i used to at least go okay
i get it i understand it's ridiculous but i get nine even understand what they're meant it the tweet was what you were watching when the olympics in orion a gas to a person born in california her parents are japanese immigrants and landed a historic triple axel happy in illinois
it out video along with a lyric from hamilton that said immigrants they get the job done and now the actual lyric is we i got the lyric wrong how dare you and i jumped up on now here's the thing any i despise the in a phobia anyone who reads and i work you know is that i love in the grants and as the idea they now hold on the idea that i
it would in any way a contribute to a culture of hostility towards minorities and immigrants is horrible to me and i feel awful that anyone heard it that way
what is what is your estimation of why there's this fringe on the list that attacks people like you and me who they must know are not racist
as it just lazy
it's just too hard to attack the real villain i think that if you fight battles way behind enemy lines think a it's the narcissism small differences anyone that departs from work orthodoxy gets a lot more heat in my opinion been people on the actual right i also think that offense taking is being weapon i used it is a route now too
political power saying that i am offended is a way of making someone radio active it's a way of smearing the reputation of making them a liability because once you tar someone as a racist or a misogynist or a fascist or whatever the word of the day is you know it's a way of taking them down a peg and i'm really concerned not appellate
you know people that have a public platform like me are like you but the downstream effects of these earrings because here's what happens if you're someone who wants to get into the public square and wants to teach something provocative and keep your head out over the pair you are not gonna do that you were going to hesitate and doing that if you know that there's a mob waiting you and you see
what happens new to very very prominent people for for saying sort of the smallest things it yeah man i day one more thing
i mean just husband died and i call it so the shooting of won't i really i've been revisiting the philip roth book the human stain okay the human stay in two sentences on it it's about a classicist at a small liberal arts school who uses the word spooks meaning go he means it literally it's taken as a racist slur and
what happens to him his personal ruin the irony of this is he himself is a light skinned black man who is passing as a jew
i'm reminded of this because we sort of live in the age of the digital stain what people are trying to do is to take even the most well intentioned and anna die and comment intentionally torque it and then throw it out through the echo chamber of social media in order to ruin people's reputations and i think it's very strange that were live with them
most privileged people in human history objectively and yet people are spending all of their time on earth hurling pixels at one another i made very very strange use of people's time will

people are scared to front of the real people who talk in private with the friends and how they conduct themselves in the yeah that's not a man those like because everybody's on social media that's like their avatar and that person is super politically correct right out as reason it's like everybody has
their own publicist who's them on social media
which makes it but i also it's the opposite also in real life people are civilized people say i'm sorry i didn't mean that you're standing but on social media they're acting like tor on i mean are usually we should also not lose sight of the fact of how much the russians have been employing thing and involving themselves in social meet
fight on both sides to sow discord in america i don't know how much of the of those attacks that go against you or against you or against me or my actual people on how many our butts well most of the there's actual issues that were minute please
petitions you know that the u n i read in a respectable publications and you know rather than talking about i don't know i find it amazing that there are a feminist web sites that are dedicated to attacking people as being insufficiently feminist rather than i don't know talking about gender apartheid in saudi arabia or iran
it is a real perversion of priority of your dog or the road

nail in iran for taking off their her job
no one is talking about that in the leftist media why is that that's a question we should be asking well those talking about of your many terms and will come back you have come back soon animals or just that but let me let me ask about the movies because you watch the oscars i did okay
i didn't suit okay to working
but
what i heard was that nobody wanted to say anything that you can talk anymore where you can talk about intersection at year about how the ideal man doesn't have a deck which one's for jimmy joke and i don't think that that appeals to most americans i know that there's a ridiculous still popular the tickets
yeah exactly
it's done many bad things what it is bob
so i think that look i think that there is incredibly important role for culture and for artists and for movie makers to move the culture in amazing ways ellen changed the change the culture really embrace change the culture get out this year call me by your name i do believe that
art has a really important in crucial role to play in cultural progress but i don't think that people are tuning into award shows to be hacked to know by celebrity and i also hated that if you don't like black panther or wonder woman neither which obscene
what is you don't like them your bit version yes and the and than the answers for the bullet there's no
just gotta and there's no bottom to it black panther is now getting torn apart because apparently there was a lesbian plot line in an earlier generation of a tough and they took and how know how the public mostly emma stone emma staunch emma stone tried to be woke and say the right thing she introduced the category for best director
and she introduced it as for man and gregor awake will she got torn apart as a white feminists which is now an insult because she didn't mention jordan peel and gear del toro were also in that category it's like being angry at us over compliment in the sunrise and saying why are you talking about the sunset to but i mean it's it's not yours
for something
even if they wife
they can agree with your nanny by personal everything you say and that five percent but
people and the party the country that sounds like you
yes think
think about all i said new year red state to what did they think about this insanity i mean the movie where the lady parks the fish feller
yeah
a little weird
well that's true i mean the movies are not what america is watching i mean i feel a little distance from the movie winners are lately i haven't seen the siege rocking movie
look i think i'm going to hate it but i'm i love i love it i think of it but i might love with i like i may not allow a little last time i saw best movie winner for the awesome right i get to the movies all the time i take my kids to the movies but it's like what hollywood thing
sure the greatest movies they're not what my family goes to see i mean for god's sakes the dark knight should have gotten the best best picture back when and that led to the initial controversy they've been talking about it ever since and they keep getting even more esoteric in the movies on unnecessarily i do think that the country is in a state of hyper sensitive
pity because because of what's coming from downtown because of what yes
hey guys i'll tell you start with dollar each other but he's made it was no
made everything worse
know
under attack and are up and you have it backwards the country was so politically you know what i'm going to say it was so politically correct that he was the antidote for sale like it
hotels are like it is even a out like
he's now for let's not politically correct don't think he's made one of she's made him most he is young people hypersensitive
he's like a champ is run it
right there in a hair trigger waiting to be offended if not to have been scant it's not to further divide in divide and divide the left we should be meeting donald trump's in in liberalism with liberalism not right
packers instead of people saying that seen a full way an anti immigrant this well they should have main focus on that faggot suddenly get it as i about died like it's donald trump is the comment section of the internet come to life and the white house
those read the comments section i think the media spins way too much time partially in every little thing he says on twitter should ignore that stuff and focus on the big picture is president of the united states senate hunting
united states but again a lot to talk about the bigger issue a good on old drop stormy daniels how about you
it sounds physicians but honestly i think this could in a weird way be the thing that brings me down because this is what do you think what i mean we'll look up what brought clinton to impeachment for tonight i'll bet second of all my colleague michelle goldberg had a great column about this where she explained it is not a sex scandal this is a a campaign finance
scandal and transparency scandal and
i think if this brings him down rather than i had it was even who was going to impeach and republicans i mean paul ryan granted and ah fair enough paul ireland and this week that the stormy daniel thing was not on his radar rob rayner is broken
later in life i was a campaign finance law you're gonna help me
it doesn't matter because you have a u f
that is split democrat and republican with an independent investigative unit that doesn't bow to either side politically because it's got the protection of a fifty fifty split on the pc they begin invest in things if your lawyer is get treated in his home equity to pay someone one hundred thirty thousand dollars to keep them silent to benefit your campaign
i don't care what he says this was a benefit and unkind contribution an out of pocket contribution to benefit donald trump's campaign there are huge potential legal violations for this that i mean go back to the john edwards situation when people were doing it for him saying let's not tell him we're doing this he still got indicted for it yeah but john edwards was held accountable
right right down to never is i'm with honor they don't give a shit
where in california through and already have man like wow
where you are one of the few even genitals christian leaders who have actually holding donald trump accountable he has hand apoplectic question right saying he gets mulligan i am yeah having one a and to a fair enough i mean it's just the hypocrisy and i imagine just for a moment

and i am by the way he did it michelle obama when he killed him
one of the reasons i remember given that why we couldn't vote for hillary was because can you imagine the scandals can you imagine the fatigue we'd have with the scandals with hillary law might be honest and showed up at the base slapping of you know all of that people who had accused bill clinton will put his accusers were going any a stadium
to be running a web t shirt contest in a parking lot in panama city and as trumps showed up at would lower the trial
and they let him get away they don't it doesn't seem to bother them the christian right
only they going to go in the christian right i've gotta say in his heart felt that your particular pastors who surround him who are in a transaction a relationship with him who if they really care about they would if they believe their faith tell him to repent and they're not because there were any transaction a relationship and one day they will be held accountable by in a very angry god
yeah
just want to measure one more thing west virginia yeah the teacher strike one
and
at me when you say well i leave lips the ultimate red state mr redstone stringing that way right and this was a union thing and i think people saw teachers and they saw them like literally bringing bag lunches to the students who very often don't get a meal except when they go to schools of the schools are closed the kids don't eat and you know
i just kept thinking the reason why the stadium so strapped for cash one trickle down economics they tried that bullshit
and too because true implied he didn't bring cold background because you can't bring coal back and so i just wonder when those people are going to catch up to it forget about the moral dimension of just what about the economic demand i think that so i think it is a win for liberals but i think there's a real opportunity there for it to be an even bigger win
on a grander scale when it comes to the american left if they see it for the opportunity that it is because of everything you just said because they got their pay raise in west virginia but leadership's going to pay for it by slashing funding from other places like maybe medicaid or community colleges pretty shitty way to go about it if the democrats realized i could come in here and tell these people
we are the party of labor if i go to arizona kentucky oklahoma where the raptor to strike emily measured nine west virginia every murder one if they had any web when and i'll tell you i think that we're will sign west virginia and what we saw today in florida with the gun law that was finally passed in florida
three mad
the last two years what we saw as a victory for activism one what's by the teachers in west virginia and for their students of parkland that demand action and say we're not going to take this crap anymore going to florida legislature and their leaders and they got results today bird for them

since the shape of water just won the oscar for best picture hollywood has to do what it does best did to death signals
the one of those stories about lonely people banging animals
jake jail at all and broke back mountain lion
woody allen and take the money and run
and jon voight in midnight cow
she said
if you're driving this thing that good through my windshield and kill me tying a hanky on it does it make it okay
and there were all the on us to pause website has to explain your article is all about how this kitten and this baby our best friends how come the look on both their faces as if you're a little smaller id view
you know people turning into a werewolf have to stop staring at their hands
they're like turning into a where was i i feel like i'm turning into a werewolf but i'd better check oh fuck
yeah were still people here in l a and the rain check the do they say i knew rain
yeah
oh i don't want to try your home brew beer
keep your carbonated bong water
as a term for guys who make booze where they live inmates

and finally no role it's time to admit president trump or is actually accomplish one good thing he's ruined the phrase thoughts and prayers forever
first the problem with thoughts and prayers and has always been that thoughts are the opposite of prayers
one instrument
one is from the enlightenment and one is from the exercise
but it wasn't until trump treated his thoughts and prayers after the park when shooting and one of the survivors treated back i don't want your condolences you fucking piece of shit prayers will fix this that prayer officially became an eye roll
yes america is finally getting a prayer doesn't work because if it did every drug test would come back clean and deadly
and then be no need for the morning after pill
but it's more than just prayer thanks to trump piety itself has ceased to be a third rail in american politics how could it any more when the world's least godly man has been so fully embraced by our most religious people evangelicals all they love them some donald trump a man has been to church four times
and his whole life free of them to get married

the only time he touches a bible is for depositions
and if we ever went to confession they have to take a meal break
he's into golden showers not the golden rule

it's true he does not treat people the way he wants to be traded
so and trump got his mulligan from the values voters that's when we new religion have jumped the shark and it was finally safe to say none for me thanks i had bullshit for lunch
look at some of these recent examples billy graham my entire life i've watched presidents from both parties suck up to this blowhard like he was the american gandhi
but when he died last month it covered like olympic curling local storyteller did at ninety nine
morose last week openly mocked mike pence for believing jesus tells him to say things mocked by i'm rosa it's like getting dunked on by kevin hart

even oprah was widely made fun of when she said god if you think i'm supposed to run for president you gotta tell me and and it has to be so clear that not even i can miss it and a lot of america said oh please not the i have to check with my imaginary friend excuse which was bad enough when people like scott walker
said i am certain this is god's plan for me something got also told rick perry rick santorum ben carson michelle bachmann herman cain sarah palin got is a nice guy but he doesn't follow politics

folks this is progress i used to be a lonely pioneer here calling religious thinking the neurological disorder but now it's like a everyone's doing it
and in that there is a lesson for the democrats things that used to be third rails don't have to be third rails forever republicans get that for fifty years their fundamental principles were law enforcement good russia bad and then
freaky friday
twenty years ago the idea of arming teachers was universally derided but now while we'd point and laugh they're doing it
democrats on the other hand begun every gotten conversation with i support the second amendment
because they fear this is one of those third rails i can never be touched even shooting victims then when they wake up from their calmer their first words or i still support the second that
now would it be a hard slog to change the public's mind on guns of course but a hard slog never phases conservatives ronald reagan used to be a joke now he's an airport

the second amendment is just words humans made up at a certain moment in history when they felt right it's an amendment not a commandment and we can make up

could make up new words again instead of the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed we could change it to the writer the people to apply for the privilege of possessing non military style weaponry as long as they're not bat shit crazy shall not be and

yeah
they say
