welcome to l h b a pipe down from h b o maintenance real time
garbage slander what your democrats were you doing in order to win
still the true
it's important you know when when
you don't have to go to the far left you don't have to go to the far right
mears we solve problems and i think people look to say how come you can't solve any problems and that's what we do and people are not as ideologically bet i believe in the country as we seem to think that they are just think you gotta you gotta get things done
your it out a country run by all women may that's true for that

krishna is what do you say to people that claim that emerson embassies the liberal equivalent of fox news
defended your network many times on that point it makes me crazy because
fox news does not stick to reality
and that's nbc is liberal leaning that they stick to reality but i'll let you add to their question what do you say to people and that your network only focuses on trumps for profits
so i'll take the first second the first question which is that the way to understand fox news it was built by a very unique man named roger alles know who had a foot in two different worlds he was a tv show business guy and he was a politics guy is a guy who advised richard nixon and five george w bush what he was building and the
owner of that network robert and rupert murdoch was explicitly a political project that was the goal from the beginning it was an ideological project it was a political project it was a media product that has never been the case at emits say never been the case there is no roger ales and i missed it was never believe me it was not built by ernie els like figure
it ended up being where it is in primetime largely because he founded audience for that
yeah jobs was army yeah and it was a reflection of of the fact that by hook or by crook a market demand was found which brings the second point that you focus on track for ratings daughter was present united states and it turns out people really want to hear about what the united states is doing and there's only so much that you're going to apollo
guys for covering the president
and
and i
everybody's ratings are up due to donald trump and by the way he loves that and takes credit for and then he was jokes his favorite the just seem excited he doesn't want anyone else to make money on the fact that they're using his image and and persona to make money with wants to figure out how it can all come day i you feel intensely
before the exposure election where did the robot
say you'd hate it if i was boring
as if it as important thing is that the emperor toss britain which to the employee absolutely and sak that's how he picks people to apparently he like alter as he is interesting as opposed to make master who are boring and or yeah
right
thousands were you called liberals useful idiots of the russians would you say it applies to republicans and know
okay so i'm sure it's like a giant of the title of my book was useful idiots i was eight and the of art okay
was it was a quote from vladimir lenin who said that other girls in the west would be useful idiots for us and we could tell them all kinds of lies and they repeat them and out so that was my point was i think it's still valid
i think guess it doesn't apply to some republicans to the trial and regarding yeah that totally not all though there are some there i just want to say this on behalf of the republican party since i've been hard on them and i do think that we can either save this great american institution or we can turn the page and i think we should save their republican party
or maybe i keep saying go back to republican classic i think there's yeah yeah right
need somebody is mitt romney is looking pretty good know
gina other any regulations that you would be in favor of repealing i really good question
yeah the ones about those garage door opener

i am
well i don't love the every regulation the only regulate when you feel like is and need to do that when somebody is harming somebody else and you need to resolve a market feel so yeah there are some that should go away and we look at them and we required to look at them like every five or eight years
you look at them you make changes you try to keep up to date but what you don't do is go in with a list of things that you want to get rid of regardless of knowing anything about them are looking at them and do it for the sole purpose of reducing business cost to certain constituencies that's not

how old trumps trade war to stabilize us foreign relations
he he kind of went back on the steel one right
any put one's on
such a classic a mean girl with the shiites
i'm still terrified still terrorists is a great example of a very efficient means of producing corruption which is to say i don't answer black a blanket era of but i'll make some one on one side deal with everybody like maybe you stay at the trump hotel and maybe you hook up my son in law with some financing and going we can work out it's like it really is a classic means
using the state to produce corruption the now we've got all these the individual bilateral deals are going to carve it out ultimately what it's going to end up with his china's going to punch back right now we are not in a trade war were of the beginnings of something that might become it right now it's actually fairly penny but if it gets worse it's going to have read
