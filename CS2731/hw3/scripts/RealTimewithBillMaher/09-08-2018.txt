bob woodward's new book excerpts did it's called all the president's thinking
bob woodward first nixon
oh and drop he has brought down more republicans that gay sex and the public restroom

but it's a double whammy for the because personally excerpt give out for the book and then the day after that
anonymous saw this
this anonymous
it was printed in the new york times or a very high up so
official at both the book and the op ed take based the same thing that there was a resistance from inside the white house
i don't know sir arthur said many senior officials are working very hard to protect america from trouble
and trumps started to respect someone who was going on he went into a cabinet meeting and they were all wearing pussycat

but this anonymous as a senior official who wrote piece that
he or she finds trump to be a moral an impulsive and ellen formed and petty so suspects include everybody
but it's it's heard that everybody in the white house is living in this bizarre a world where they are not who they say they are and today maloney said oh i thought i was the only ones

shiva didn't i mean even as millennia
she said no it's not me
if i i'm going to say i'll write it on my jacket
trump is so pissed off about what a turncoat right in his present a traitor board but tried the russians like that
haste pissed off
it says the new york times was turned over turn over and not turn him over
country does he think he lives in return people over for national security purposes and we catch this guy he says the threat level is going to orange

but still white around the eye
you know it's a warning sign when the president looks like a warning sign that

debating whether he's crazy i'm still getting over the fact that the president dies is a a platinum blonde and pains his face and basketball
he sounds like a drunken looks like a tequila sunrise
and these two things came out this latest
hard pressed to find someone who worked at administration who hasn't at some point called him an idiot or some version of that idiot more on that now we have the defense secretary mantis saying working towards and working with it was like working with a fifth or sixth grader
and trump he was so mad when he heard that he spit chocolate knows

yeah
let's do it again oh no or alive
but the paranoia
white house because as soon as the anonymous came out then trumped course detective drum
twenty seven high level people have now denied it might pens denied it might bump pale coats bad as they all said it wasn't me
link and that his team of rivals trump has his team of shaggy
nobody remembers
but there are even talking about how everyone in the white house has good at detecting why detector to a lie detector test for the drug administration

we don't do that in america
we don't have enough electricity
but who wrote it detective trump want to know who is the author who isn't is it kelly
isn't kelly and couldn't be sarah huckabee sanders not like heard a lie
brick very sit right it i can't even read it
ben carson said anonymous anonymous do i look great
but i will lead the last word on anonymous to the president himself
an anomaly


build the wall i think that drugs are still getting it
yeah
backstage jim carey's
writer and producer of the documentary active measures now playing in theaters and on i tunes jack brian jacques

thank you to integrate service with this movie is out today people can see it
right now it's on i tunes and were be a country this because i think this is so great because it pulls together we ruined hearing so many things you watch the news and every day it's a different scandal little lot of that has to do with russia you pull it all together and when you see what pollutants aims were from the beginning x k g b wanted to get rush
your back to be super power status and you see who trump is it's almost inevitable
that they would figure in each other's lives like this the stooge and the puppet master absolutely and it had happened in other countries before
in a playbook was the exact same and you look at these the sphere of people that trump is hanging out with starting in the eighties and dealing with independent people that is going after going back to the late nineties
it does seem completely inevitable he's the perfect mark is mean
like you say the playbook goes way back when russia and the kgb who do they look for and how does trump said that he has so intelligence officers when looking for somebody to flip they have an acronym they use which has mice and it means people that are susceptible to money ideology compromise or ego and those are the levers they
try to pull i see three out of four ram
he has no ideology
but you don't need all for now three and four must be they must be like we did our guy really need one you'll need one and yeah he's totally it okay
and that's what i love about it goes back in time to i mean this
didn't happen just in two thousand and sixteen where would you put this where would you put the beginning of the story where we try to find the beginning and it was a long trail back but we really started the first clear act of illegality which was nineteen eighty four when donald trump personally sold five condos in trump tower two russian mobster named david bowie didn't
with the state attorney general rule that was money laundering
that relationship
continued first her casually there were a lot of russian mobsters that lived in from buildings
tons of rush monsters are buying from properties and hang on the casinos but between the early nineties and around two thousand and four
from go through a series of bankruptcies and he starts losing the ability to get seed capital the casino the casinos yeah atlantic city has is three only man lose money in the casino yeah
people give you money for nothing yeah indians make this work yeah
and it was destined if i mean steve wynn
not exactly in their heritage running history knows they can do it
and steve when they you magnet shows in the film describes why he lost and it was it he built a casinos twice the size of any other casino atlantic city it was never going to be successful but this thing this fascinating to me is the russian mafia yeah that the fact that explain this to us again
the russian mafia really an arm of the russian government yeah so it a little disconcerting to find out america is now
so subsidiary of the russian mafia the i think that's a really important point and i think we as americans seem at the mafia we think about the godfather or tony soprano a character it's good doing battle with the government whereas in russia that's how they launder money out of the country that's how the corrupt officials starting with potent and his inner circle get money from
russia to save judiciary is to safe areas where to go back to why their money is dirty to begin with yeah gluten and is always hear the term old girl yeah those are the people around him right yes and they're all thieves right they're stealing from their own people absolutely they say potent is the richest men in the world of that bureaucrat salary
how do we know that though i mean was it the panama papers
a huge part of it but also just the assets he controls the fact that he and it's it's hard to quantify what kind of money has in part because it's rubles which is not a steady currency is dollars but also because it's so opaque so they're taking it from russian industries from just the cost any like any dictator and in such as europe
hundreds russia it's also ukraine they still tons of a gatorade
and it's throughout especially energy true they want to park pocket in the west or in safer and they have to hide it somehow out and real that's where trump came real estate is the easiest way to do that
even in the the patriot act has a cut out for real estate transactions so unless there is a bank loaning money which there isn't because there's no they don't need alone there is no government body looking that transaction they use their own brokers are known as nodes which these points of intersection between dirty money and cleaning it out
and those brokers are always russian mob people and so there's no government and a trump property is all over the world know they are laundering money and have been the russians for decades yeah great
so like the hookers paying is like the least of it
only not illegal
not illegal
what they know maybe a hundred and eight
some places might be right but they know he's committed financial propriety run now they know that he's worked for them during two thousand and sixteen and that is an ultimate comfort so when paul man afford who was prudent man and ukraine when he came on board is you see that i do as what some stall our guy right i mean that they didn't even has to catch
catch them right in collusion the game to my collusion because the collision with so baked into the cake from so long ago yeah and not only that i mean it's an essential component of the operation is well i mean these are originally look at what happened in ukraine they have been in georgia play by play the same the same operation one of the components
each of these and not just the ones we show in the film but other options right the world is the candidate that they are supporting they accuse the social media let's out the opposing candidate they call them criminals online and the candidate that they're supporting repeats that line calling them criminals and so an audience has heard it in this independent format they think
one guy thing it on stage is that candidates so it sounds like he's the only guy telling the truth
so potent basically franchised you know
trump was one of the mcdonalds owners who bought the lice and frequently they use billionaires that an urban in politics before because they have no track record with just trump know he's this much of a russian
i think so i think it would be very hard for him to act in line with the historical precedent just one for one without knowing what he was doing also people i think assume that because trumped doesn't do anything up policy because there only the government or law or the world based on the word or words that
goliath
we're getting this something the president urged age knows and i want to air it his organization is organization thank you he knows what is going on in ryan asian and those the people and everybody you talk to says he knows what i think this will be doing a great service see this movie
you need to what you need some alright thank you jack thanks for making


everybody
a political common and and host of the x files are insane and the former white house senior adviser under president obama david axelrod

she is a fantastic the most even over paper is failing
i'm rochelle goal very low
it was the seven term us congress i'm from pennsylvania fifteenth recently retired you spend more time with his sanity charlie

it was very happy that because we saw president obama speak for the first time today
right now more about this than others
is this because was this planned for now or was this because of the events of the week i mean i think people the threat level and all of our ass what way up is that why has his own those i think his sense of urgency has been pretty high for a while here so this thing has been plan for several weeks she was going to get this war
the university of illinois but whenever you're going to speak about this president and where we are as a country you have to keep a sharp pencil in your pocket because you never know your one tweet away from a rewrite and so i'm sure that and you know that some of the lines in that speech reflected events of the last few day can i read my favorite he said
people ask me what are you gonna do for the election know the question is what are you going to do right
right
okay
anybody else on obama or can i move on to the supreme court
under this car and i mean the obama thing was so heartbreaking right i mean this vision for a second when you remember what it was the president's yeah but you know my job that i was yeah it was not to remind people of of of what we had but to remind people about who we are and what our responsibilities are and that's i mean he's looking forward and back
it's one of the reasons why he hasn't been out there because he thinks we need to act together not wait for the messiah
and i think he's right that people are out there doing i mean i and in much more of the state of black despair and panic than obama is just temperamentally and bad situation
the one thing i agree with them is you do go out there is astonishing the amount of kind of civic revival yes i mean they amount to their women particularly as laid as trunk on how they get it has they cannot tolerate this man yeah i think the president makes and president obama may seem fair points about the republican party what's happened to it
it hurts even more republican than democrat says you there's like it unlikely her lecture me about what's wrong with democratic party but i think his points more fair and what happened at a party and mitt romney and mccain bullish reagan eisenhower roosevelt i mean a good result so this is a way that's a real soul searching to new in this party the party he's
to be about some ideals now it's about loyalty to a man
and that's what's particularly troubling and then here
it was more troubling this week is this man
even if it gets to his the luckiest son of a bitch
say this about that is that is the one thing about him but he is so lucky when you trade places with no i don't think i am lucky right now okay but the fact that he got the second supreme court pick any can pick a guy who can now vote not just have him answer subpoenas and you can pardon himself and the rest of the last that he's lucky
yeah and were cursed i mean you know he is he any this pretty dark right he's this sort of metaphysical kind of gaul on think you're at this like personification of americans since to keep stumbling into these positions where he obviously shouldn't be but the but the metaphysical twist is that he's always miserable and takes no satisfaction from any of his son
guys are born six feet from home plate and i think in a home run
that's as reality of life so what's what's so so disconcerting about what's going on with the supreme court hearings is that it's a charade he's going to get on the supreme court and power begets power that's the thing for everybody who was like hillary is just as bad really
now that we see that the president's own cabinet i mean at first it was the democrats hate me for no reason and then it was the media hates me for no reason and there was never trump or hate me for no reason and the f b i
with my own people
the best people number was the best people the best people turn out to be the lakers
so
atmosphere the fact that he is picking this person and this this cabin who
can i read with lindsey graham says because it since it's a fait accompli are just one event
lindsey graham lecturing the democrats had a chance and you lost if you want to pick judges then you'd better win an election you can't lose the election and pick judges if you want to pick judges you'd better when what we did
i thought they had with

even just picks picnic garland that then trump sheets his way to a minority victory is an unindicted coke and spirit or in one of the crimes that ensured this election and now is choosing the judge is going to you he thinks i think leaded skate on all the crimes he committed to become president and i wonder how mirror garland watching ted cruz question
kavanagh here all the times he agreed with merit garlic and holding up mirren a garland as the gold standard by which a judge should be measured a guy who they wouldn't even give a meeting much less a hearing or a vote i know
if they wouldn't need coal if they could run the red states on hypocrisy
just

you're right it's is little like w w f wrestling it's kind of exciting to watch but you know kind of how it's going to end the only debate right now is he going to get fifty three a fifty five votes not as really an issue okay so this anonymous
or however you so i know that's not your
what's going on that we know he doesn't do drugs omission
but what was that about
well that with the bigger issue is
there was much more or less the people who probably did not write that article and then there's supposedly who's your guess if i had to guess somebody national security establishment
i want to get my friend in trouble but it's also a dan coach director of national intelligence
you're going on her friend
america
but whoever it is says that there's lots of people who think the same way and could have written the same op ed piece so you think don't go to the you think you know i had a feeling i was i like that that jon huntsman theory but i started have a feeling it's going to be somebody his name or i'm not super familiar with yeah i think it's murder on really someone were not familiar
or with nothing your papers going to be that balls he has to go this far out on the limb and then we go i think that john kelly second in command is a high level person staff secretaries hello person so there's a lot of people learn in the news all the time that are still by any measure senior government official i think it's like murder on the orient express were
everybody gets one sentence

i think it's general kelly
i do first well i think the mccain funeral
was the last straw for a lot of people and he's the kind of guy who i mean look he's not been happy for a very long time like i said in the monologue ballistic people who have called the president of an idiot
it harder to find one who didn't and kelly has been in there he in would read bookies or something like we're we're in crazy town right there's no point even trying to talk to me doesn't understand anything i just think he's got the balls to do this well that's another question do you think this this is heroic or do you think my
question is what was nine point what was the point if your messages on going to stay inside and act as a guard rail against those crazy president why poke the bear and make him crazier
either come out and say claire who are you are at say it wasn't a call to arms right to me you could turn of understand if somebody said i'm here to tell you it's worse than you think and congress needs to exercise it's oversight function but that's not really what he was saying you saying there's people here have got things under control so that my look pretty bad but you know yourself that deregulation and were here
handling thing or give me dispensation through continuing to work for this whack a doodle right or yeah i might go easy on me and my a lot of the trials were all that laura fyi this guy i think the person just simply trying to reassure us yeah it's really bad but there's some of us here who are you know we're adults i think that's what he's trying to
do i hope this is truly a senior administration official i'm you'll be terrible from new york times if it were yeah i'm ready whenever you mean my outlook by and calming i didn't find that calming not really we didn't know what my outlier opinion on this is this person i would like to say to them
thank you for your service
the united states has made the same mistake overseas so many times will take out saddam hussein or somebody we don't like and don't think about what comes next right yes saddam hussein was terrible what came next the isis what comes next if these people who are preventing him from
doing really crazy things go i think general kelly would love to leave this is gonna be worse than iraq
he said that he said this is the worst job i've ever had he was in full lucia
the other side of that is that all of these people gary coleman all of them has sort of short things up and made sure that for all of the president's manifest incompetence kind of the trains run on time for merely it has i think given everybody else a sense of false confidence or a sense that this
this whole thing is more sustainable than it seems rate because people will save you all the time right after the election i really thought that everything was going to fall apart but now you know it seems chaotic but everything started holding together and as it holds together that president masses more and more power he gets more charges he gets more loyalists and so you know if this had come
out safe three weeks into the administration congress might have been more willing to do something he's already just sort of been able to build his power base even if it's fragile and that and so at a certain point they're not they might think that they're protecting us but really they're just kind of squeezing through
will a few of their republican policy priorities and making it seem as if things are okay when they're republican priorities policy wise we have lived through that before and we can survive those things he were part of the court for it
that's not the case with rule of law and the end of democracy and all that other stuff that he threatens in a way that we have never seen before that is what is so unique and these guys are stopping that but they're not stopping at or maybe there's nothing some of it butler but people like madness
i'm glad a geneticist bomb and defense
good for the country a guy and coaches at home or next tellers and while there i never thought i'd be saying he wears the guy for american sort of the challenge that
the toes
it doesn't chevron am someone who are going to step into that
we've never had a president who doesn't stand up full throated in support of western value
no independent judiciary judiciary democracy and free press rule of law and that's job with the present he's an excellent ratings are who are older doctors a embrace that is totally workers and losers
who wants to undermine the order we created that we benefited by this is why it's so frustrating to me okay so listen i don't know if you've heard about that or work down in texas and from
he's going up against ted cruz and ted cruz
great
and every week we see that kind of pulling a closer and so today
is a little bit nervous now and one of the attacks he's made against good or workers that when he was young he was in a rock band
folk rock but i don't know what it was but it wasn't texas i guess it was folksy music and we have a copy of the album that he was a liberal in texas so liberal folk music is a little different
i'm a liberal country music it's called tear drops in my avocado
the
liberal country songs i'm so long so i could adopt that
they harbor valley th say is on the
ted seen
a miner's daughter
my wife's gone girl and peyton be dog ate all as a lot
they name so
i shot a man and radar just to watch your muse is affordable health care

absolutely admire what you do well it took me forever to good jr but i knew it would have been had to start reading yet
thank you for waiting for me pretty i would always been a fan of yours
i saw you the first time i ever saw you you didn't act and you didn't even speak you just did impressions with your face that's right yeah that's right and i said this guy yeah it started early when i saw golden pond when i was a kid i went out in the theater and i was like
hicks shrubbery
i didn't know i was doing and i saw myself in a shop in a shop window and i went wow that's his face when it came home and
i mean by the way i have to tell you to of the most audacious the same night at the comedy store for mitzi oh come on years ago years ago the like you are they should certainly the years ago gym and okay
i don't think we have all the time is happening
you know that
that's the new school of all time happens okay well i never was you're an actor
yeah old and i suck right yeah i didn't pass old tight you got you were regular and stuff i got up there and the microphone fell apart of my hands and first thing that happened you know it's going to be one of those nights in and i ran past me the back to canada for two years
you know i've noticed we're both around the same age and younger but as time goes by i noticed your mind really move the furniture i don't think that was me i think you're transferring that really i don't like mandela of yeah i know that
i never let unless you're thinking of greg kinnear
young love really omar
don't remember ever doing mood of the house or go
i'm glad your memories of my life were better than my you are beautiful
but i must tell you i've seen so many movies
one way i judge actors is by like oh look at a party or yeah he did great and that could anybody else do it and usually the answer is yes sure with you
lot of times a splinter know
why i see her it is making the wrong choices that committing completely no i don't think you have my my favorite movie and i love many of them is cable go oh thank you
show i feel like they should be on a film festival together there's something about them that is very prescient about the way the world came to be absolutely you think they're we are parent lists
we are baby sat by the television were taught how to think by the taliban that's the dangerous time i think about what's going on right now there there's there are there are generations growing up right now who are learning to lie that lying is okay yeah that this kid say fake news is that you're supposed to hate half the country
and if if if anything if anything we've got to get back to a place where we realized that a vote is not who you are you know and and because you voted republican you're not stupid you're not different you're not worthless
i could break bread with anybody who voted for trump we could find some common ground to love each other
doing stupid shit
we expect so
stand together so let's plug your show us why this character the hitting the old kidding where are these of mr rogers
who i think of the shows really interesting because first of all i get to work with michelle go hungry again which was a dream the first time in a dream come true again movie was eternal sunshine okay
i assume every knows as bio
that's really
but yeah it was a beautiful experience in it's about a guy yeah it's about it's about
love being hit by lightning
i mean this this is about a gentleman who's hard is so big and and his his approach is so authentic that it's undeniable when you come in contact with him when he sounds like you
well i was going to do is a seeker
when you what you are always seeking something right
yeah here not always happy know i'm not always happy that's for sure happy to the weather and
but i don't live in orange on place
that isn't isn't are ordering the see to let the flowers grow because it's hard to find what you're looking be especially when it's deep yeah and basically i have learned how to and i am is angry and caught up in this stuff is anybody i outrageous like a cop the carpet bombing of outrage that's happening i deleted it under aren't absolutely no i first sorry i didn't realize until
so you and jerry seinfeld coffee show when you use your studio what a great artist you are now i see it all the time on social media because it totally the only show you a feel of the show that i love this one of drum
no that that's my and noone ads aren't the flying monkeys
perhaps i want a detailed analysis and then lincoln is then there is my main can guarantee lincoln symbolize i love good biggest trunk was always a president that actually had the worst tribulations our country has ever faced and brought us together now the opposite is happening right now
i'm a president who started out when the country was gather and had a wonderful leader and he is tearing us limb from limb work destroying every institute let's let's talk about
we don't remember that he's a car salesman he's using connor and stabs a little and he's he didn't he didn't make america great again but he did turn back the odometer
okay
as i wonder where the back seat right right
we're going on in because i watch this week what i kept thinking was it all comes down to this case of narcissistic personality disorder we've all talked about its and to been on the public seen what we see it in real time somebody really unraveling spiraling toward madness so i'm an asshole was that i out know
there was a with him talking to bob woodward right we heard that this week at the end of it he gets a little frustrated and as well accurate is that nobody's ever done a better job than i'm doing as president he says
what
travel what demolition man

is
a couple of drinks implosion up couple of weeks ago he gave himself an a plus
even if he thought these things you did to say them out loud as soon as he does like that
star trek right and meeting kind of says these things that are so outrageous over and over and over again until eventually people think that there must be something they're right that even if it's not you know even if he's not worth ten billion dollars he must be worth like one billion dollars as opposed to a few million or
suppose being in debt if you marry and right you were going to run into one hundred and five right so that's the ratio of truth to bullshit
anything he said if is twenty don't want to
twenty to one man when you have this older you know like when his i can sing for his home his personal cabinet and that was turned on and the person with this disorder is never going to go maybe it's me
of course whenever you want to see something internet everybody is saying you know the one on everybody's and sound like trump know ever to saying
janet
is in my head or saying yeah people are saying that's it
it's on the receiving end of one of the tantrums
yeah i met with and twice and whether you do well
i told him no three times to his face he took it while the first time was a second and third times you can take over the healthcare issue and i try to explain away with problems with the bill and medicaid he strangers and planned parenthood and
time the second time i told him he will i i told him i was opposed to the billing said why or this was on a thursday so why he said why as well be the same reasons i told you on tuesday two days before i went to the issue
the off and he said during destroy the republican party and
know the tax reforms gonna go down
you're going to destroy the republican party because he couldn't remember where jews that because for the health care abilities are going to take down on i am i finally interrupted and after about it seemed like lol forever
isn't the cabinet and we couldn't get in get laid into here as mr president he telling me that this you said mr president yeah
but nowadays as an affirmation
it was going to fail if the healthcare bill didn't pass and i said i you tell me if we don't pass a healthcare bill in this form we're not going to be able to attach informed because a baseline is that long enough that's exactly right when you lose you lose an aussie one again and then or a whole room everybody says yes leading us if you lie to him and then back to me at the end you still are no i'm still know mr president goes off
from me again and so on mr prasad gone and done talking to you on one here anymore
and when want to be look you want to see are sure and cloud ignore trumped for a week
know i had a girlfriend one time long time ago and we were having problems i went to therapy and
and the therapist said sounds like your girlfriend a little bit borderline personality and she's a narcissistic whatever and i said well maybe if i just find a different way intellectual wise or get used to what she's saying and i could my band comebacks will be different and that i could just accept the fact she's going to get month
whatever and he she said please do please please try for a week to ignore and not react to these buttons that are being punished we actually don't there's a lot of money are trying to have no i know we don't
little this morning and i'm saying or needs to be people around them
okay that's on all we apparently yeah yeah yeah okay so let me ask about we have the democratic and zoltan here of the last successful election
the democrats seem to be getting their groove back a little bit when i mean by that is that alexander or cover your job your crutches i had a presley stacey abrams carry evelyn davis these women who won in primaries weren't supposed to and they did it with unabashed liberal proposals
medicare for all ending student debt a different approach to the war on terror ending mass incarceration it seems like if there is a maybe a shining spot in this term tragedy
it's made the democrats sort of rediscover who they are and

i think those fundamental issues health health care a secure job security and all of the things that are being addressed whatever the whatever form it takes your hearing this kind of across across the board those camera is reflected their districts well they reflect
their constituencies well you know kind lamb and your stay probably has a slightly different
slant on these things but fundamentally the values i think are very consistent and you know the the republicans are running with the word socialism they're trying to say i don't scare people scare phoenix alarm nose and venezuela from says you were going to be living in venice when i grew up in canada we have socialized medicine and i
i'm here to tell you that this bullshit line that you get on all of the political shows from people is that it's a failure a system is a failure in canada it is not a failure and can i never waited for anything in my life i chose my own doctors my mother never paid for a prescription it was fantastic and i just got back from vancouver
and i keep hearing this like canadians are still nice comedians are so nice they can be nice because they have healthcare

when how real live in a box there are certain people in our society that need to be taken care of their there are people with out as many opportunities that need to be helped toward those opportunities there are people who are sick but that's been injured enough to lose your home and as your mother got sick and look i've he said
the united states has been a quasi socialist government for one hundred years for crying out loud it's not a sauna plenty of subsidies for oil company that was net also the only air and so easy
yes of course there's nothing more socialistic than some of the pentagon programs that are just jobs programs the pentagon says we don't want these tanks and they build them anyway
but that word the democrats seem to get a plan to fight this slack this slander of socialism you're going to be living in venezuela i don't have to say yes isn't socialism to the word and everything we have to stop a pilot i am i am interested to see if that works what i see
see now are republicans madly and the president himself madly pressing these buttons hopefully you won't press that button pressing buttons
to try and scare people and it's truly this learning and occur to me don't you think they think are unable to resist least used up the currency of socialism with obama right i mean they pulled that line so many times with obama that people i think you don't particularly younger people people who are younger than me have really positive associations with socialism but even younger even on
people i think are so used to every democrat being accused of socialism that i wonder for people who would ever consider voting for democrat in the first but drive and really this analogy rebellion the attack and strategy right now this election is really not about the democrats it's about republicans it's about the party in power it's
it's a referendum was all about i'm not going to be eras united states that's it
some democrats relating to the before i had to be against trump and that's that's the reality republicans plan left they're going to let their their their their opponents they're going to try to discredit their opponents and others whatever they've got good opposition research and going to go there without their lungs already there
has become a farm system for the russians
yeah you think that trump is the only one being groomed
no well there and eight are it right now are unable to exactly they are enabling regular on as a republican
i'm frustrated by this this point that
i'm very much opposed of and report and i think most republicans all
russians out
the whole idea
i'm not very controversial
can't loses the wrong place we never even had to like we say i'm against that didn't have as to be said by
i'm assuming learned is going to put in and many out with the republican the third the town i would say i'm sorry about like it is time for new

when they have to get rid of the honey smacks these are grabbing of other honey max
if
even before the salmonella they were basically heroin for kindergarten or
it's got smacked right in the ne
richards would aid is here are six years old
all someone has to break into cult and underwood the first virgin bachelor on the bachelor who has also been on the bachelor and bachelor in paradise
while waiting for the right one
your penis just isn't that special
yeah i know you think of it as a trophy to be bestowed upon some lucky disney princess but
it's just a dick
a guy has even my pants probably
called may be what you're searching for isn't out there it's in here
and by that i may go fuck yourself

never mind the anthem the link must address the most offensive thing about the nfl that all the commercials are for beer tapes of trucks or insurance is that all you think men are drunk fat slobs who gotten their trucks and crash them
we're not we also like chicken wing

all don't make your four year old wear a shirt that kisses your ass
this doesn't pay well my parents are great it tells priests i dig older guys

they're all now that we've found that kimberley guilt oils pet name for donald trump junior his junior mint
he must come up with the appropriate candy nicknames for the rest of the family term could be whoppers
erica gober
jared kushner dude you be
wow bob

and finally new rule until donald trump is no longer president don't talk to me about any cause except democrats winning elections
sorry partnership for a gluten free american
drag queens without borders
you're gonna have to wait we need democrats to keep a laser focus on the one issue that really matters finding out what is trumps kryptonite i think it's ridicule the one thing that gets under his skin besides red dye number two
is being made fun of remember how he received when obama made fun of them at the correspondents dinner
the hair on the back of his neck stood up
which was fascinating to watch since it's been transplanted to the front of his head

we need someone who can shred trump like a stand up takes down a heckler because trump is a heckler and to fight him we need a comedian
that is why tonight
after serious thought and consideration
i am officially announcing that i bill maher
that would be a great idea if al franken got back in the



good enough he's smart enough and doggone it people still like
now of course i can hear purists already saying good bill what about the allegations
america always over react and then has buyers remorse we did it with nine eleven and janet jackson's net ball and bird flu and bill clinton's blow job and certainly one of the all time over reactions was al franken sex predator
can we break down what he did it started with that picture it's a joke he apologize for it no one died then there's the sketch our wrote to perform for the troops with glee and tweet and she says frank and had written a moment when his character comes at me for a kiss i suspected what he
was after okay what's been forgotten is that although i was always careful to say women should be heard he never said yeah i did it he said he hoped resigning didn't give people the false impression that i was admitting to doing things that in fact i haven't done that
sweden is a favorite guests of sean hannity and donald trump junior twitter power and somehow roger stone new it's al franken time in the barrel before she made her allegations public
i believe our
i think that's though my right

women should be heard always and we should always keep in mind the vast majority of women reporting serious abuse or truthful but women also didn't completely lose the ability to ally in two thousand and seventeen

crowd knowing that oh yeah
i have to see for the record there was a lot of ask grabbing tail
i'm going to get to that
quite isn't your place
you have the whole show and i have this one little time with year
i also find it very curious that in hollywood for two decades parties at the playboy mansion popular in the world of the sports the only guy who ever got out of line
it was al franken
seven other women for anonymous accuse l of mostly hand drifting while taking pictures does it matter that at least two of these are ridiculous one said al asked her to join him in the bathroom
another said he told her a kiss was as right as an entertainer this is not al franken another woman said during a picture our quote put his hand on my waist grabbing a handful of flesh
again
our president now is joan crawford
are are democrats really going to permanently send away one of our ablest warriors to being a waste grabber
he didn't drive off a bridge and lever to drown can we get some perspective

because every infraction no matter how small has to bury rehash for an entire lifetime that's not politics that's marriage
yeah
you know when you're a politician being touchy feely is kind of part of the job campaigning is literally cold pressing the flesh have you ever met joe biden it's like meeting a great danes smells bacon on your clothes

some guys just aren't good at hugs that's why i always take pictures like this

and here's me sitting
we can have me too and al franken they're not mutually exclusive it's time to get our off the bench so we could come back to doing what he does better than any other democrat taking down right wing blow hards i
si how franken debate donald trump and by the way so you are right
i guess
jim carrey and jack ryan

we hadn't
watching
my
on t h b r dot com
i think based back with season here this paying cash other his grief doesn't go away
i'm from grief you just learned to live with it we don't
close your humiliating and honest discussions from others have experienced life altering office
spend as much time as possible my kids
listen to all there is an interesting cooper wherever you get your ass
