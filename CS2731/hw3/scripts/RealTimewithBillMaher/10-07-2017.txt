wow
okay
right could compose myself as well
fuck
it's a major what do you make of this strange relationship between trump scarborough in prisons
or morning news show called morning
good never
memorable i remember it
he antagonize in your president used to be friends right is that the deal and they became friendly accused her of being a bed face through it was that
i mean they were friendly and jokes
scarborough is accused of being too kind to him throughout the election when it really matter in terms of people taking him seriously at the beginning especially
editor
what you yeah they didn't become critical
sort of in a very emotional anything personal
and papers go from them were drove both i mean why the you jump started attacking men in a really vitriolic way you know even more than a year ago
that they had some kind of personal relationship with untoward in some way
and
and
they a couple yeah but untoward is that he would spend it on that he was suggesting that there was something going on that one knows what's going on
anyway because there isn't a sleep
hello filth
basically was vanity
like what became of that you know we've got to get to the of it
became very hurtful
and then as president he attacked her for having plastic surgery and claim incorrectly there were photos of this event that she was bleeding at marla so obsessed with that is nice
the iconography of credibility that it's actually true misogyny me
no he's he's a bad day you don't like it i don't like
surveillance on yeah absolutely
also i couldn't even
try to tell you
he
he had a birthday accused obama of not being born you
and then we saw diving and we were boobs okay
after obama released as versatile then trump when after his college records as a black i would be in college he's working his wife there his life
the best of then the college and then who knows what next so i said oh please the court and logical
in a way his mother not so believe
he understands how time works
least one time
time right
oh they are
america have any that can happen
get up with a renewed a little less regulation but
you get sued by trampling right let me finish our it so he offered
he offered obama of trouble for obama five million dollars is he would release his college records i know that itself is so ghost author the president it's vulgar vulgar
madeleine would easily anger man okay so i as a joke offered trump five million dollars if the could prove he was not the son of an orangutan big as we show
say
there
so
moron
then sued me too because he went into court with his burst or i made drunk produce his birth certificate busy such an idiot he as it was gonna say or to hang on
human to have a baby with it and so he sudanese with the five million dollars because he proved he wasn't in a result
the i can't even use i fundamentally misunderstood the theory of evolution
one of an hour
i i can explain much about married so stupid but he just to fuck with people and i think really you can look in so many things that he's done now in the white house and explain it i think our fucking that people which is not what you want a president obviously which is not part of fun thing to say it's just factual it doesn't mean i'm on a team is factual to
they don't
with him
it's not a team right let's not have to i'm sorry
team
don't have a team
reality and and other stuff
anyway
like i go with the whoever makes the most phones which is mostly the democrats not always harold is the democratic party moving to for a list
some parts of it are in define left but just sort of being unrealistic about what can get done democrats came out i guess was a few months ago with a plant call a better deal with help what our plan was a girl the economy and create more jobs and raise wages at all start a fire in it and it didn't really resonate really anybody i think we're gonna talk about growing again we're going to talk about protect
people's privacy this equal thing where people hundred forty million americans had their their data stone is a part got to stand up for that with the same time figure out how we're going to grow businesses grow wages and for that matter grow the economy and we can do it without taking from people we can do it
growing economy and we do that they will begin to get one pair to getting something that will resonate with more americans because something as much as we talk about this guy is out of out of control as he has on foreign policy and economic ideas he won the race it was nine months it seems like it was nine years ago was only nineteen months ago that he was neighbors installed as president with gotta understand we're now
going to win again just by complaining about him if he offers a tax plan would get a counter would a tax plan if he offers a health plan it's been we've got to offer health plan it's better i think what bernie sanders it around the single payer plan i like obama care i think parts of it a work and we've got to figure how we shored up and strengthen it to abandon it like bernie want to do right away it was the right thing
do and certainly not what the republicans propose doing so we got a ways ago will find our way there and be going to get russell brand help us article is over
