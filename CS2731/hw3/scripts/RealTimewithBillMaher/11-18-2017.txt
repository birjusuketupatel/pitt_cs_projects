welcome to h b a pipe down from h b o maintenance real time


right







i gave recovery disk our last show and so i know
we will that january nineteenth talk about all the mass shootings and masturbating accurate
make america the greatest got very the world
yeah you know what i do too
bric a brac about
i think we all a little break right i mean this has been a tough year for america for truth for women
for a potted plants
i don't even know where to start with the harassers i watched entertainment tonight was it was it the half hour of mental odell throwing up into a bucket
but if there's any bright spot in down in alabama where roy moore's
and you'll admit it
from alabama
roy more is running for on the republican ticket his opponent the democrat in alabama doug jones is ahead in the polls while in alabama

political experts are saying that his recent surge is due to not fucking kid
yeah that's where we are in america more has nine accusers now add boer said he would not drop out more had a press conference yesterday judge roy more he said we need these not dropping out because he said we need moral value back in our country
and then o j came up to discuss anger management
guys
you gotta get
yeah i mean all these accusers they're coming forward one girl said that roy more hit on her when she was at the mall
as you do when you're the district attorney in your thirties
so she didn't give me her phone number so roy more called the principle of her school who colder in
you know it is
here it is excuses he said i don't remember dating any girl without the permission of her mother
i'm a shovel risk child molester
that's where it
alabama of course a high school seniors and mills
that

i mean when i think of alabama back that i think of they're horrendous civil rights record but you know forget the police dogs get that the to stop pumping my leg
and you know he was you heard this roy more was banned from the mall
too creepy for an alabama mall
like being too fat for the iowa state fair

too high for a burning man i mean
and then there's another woman who came forward or said she went to see roy more in his office and nine hundred ninety one just signs in custody papers and more grabbed her very heard in the but she was twenty eight but more says in his defense she looked much younger
so you know fox news is not really wanted to talk too much about the sexual harassment when it was roy more or donald trump or everybody at fox news
and then al franken came along yes
very disturbing i was so shaken i called bill cosby to see that the economy

but
as i'm sure you know by now when i was on a us o tour in iraq in two thousand and six whitley and tweet and he released a picture where he is mock groping her while she's sleeping not cool at all and then he wrote a sketch where they were kissing as a pretext to actually force a kiss on her this is what she says so als a friend
but now i gotta tell you if you're right a comedy sketch where you al franken
here's a model and the next line of dialogue isn't get off of me creepy it's not comedy it's science fiction
so
he did a bad thing
become a nation has been universal which he deserves what he doesn't deserve is to be lumped in with roy more for kevin spacey

or donald trump
on time
cause his accusers wires threatening to soon the did long riffs at his rallies we would say that they were too ugly for him to assault
plus with al franken we're talking about one incident trump has sixteen accusers roy more has nine
more spend more time chatting up young girls at the mall santa claus
so how how about another need to campaign where i can tell too unlike things apart me too
i know that different route a man who once acted like a dick and a man who is a dick

i know the difference dream someone who behaved like a high schooler and someone who targeted high schoolers
yeah
in overseas news
but there is some overseas i trump got back from this big twelve day to you see this his speech it to declare his twelve asian trip a huge success
a trip been anybody ever had they love me more than ababa over there and you see this speech yesterday oh my god he was racing like i think of it
nothing
taking a drink some water you just say that he never actually fought in vietnam but he still came home with a drug problem i don't know

everybody made a big deal of him taking the water you know what i don't care if trump drank water during his speech i wanted to see if trunk can keep talking when put put in and takes a drink the water
you got a great
oh he's hilarious chelsea handler is back
environmental activists an author of the novel radio free vermont a fable of resistance bill mckibben

okay so it's better year here on our last show because this has been a year where we saw a terrible things happen with the environmental movement
and i was very dismayed to see last week the paris accords which were so in two years ago none of the industrialized countries or even close to meeting their marks and they're not mandatory
the scariest in a way was what happened in china where they've actually been pretty good about putting in a lot of renewable power last year they're cool cool use when a because they had a we drought california style drought in they couldn't run their hydro electric dams businesses
i think it's starting to happen a vicious feedback cycles are starting to kick in the we had a record rise three parts per million and the amount of carbon in the atmosphere last year and were afraid it's because oceans forest to have been damage to the point where there are no longer absorbing carbon as quickly as they used to
right on the edge it's the moment to be moving fast yeah i've heard that three years were right on the edge we got her start moving fast
a i mean in some ways we're right over the edge i was in yeah center was two nights ago talking with people who come through the fires me this is as close as we get to sort of the definition of the good life in america beautiful place huge vat of wine everywhere there's people
fleeing for their lives and watch them not making it out that kind of thing happens someplace on this planet every day now
and you know there's another conference going on this week in bonn germany and the trunk of administration showed up with a plan
for coal
they're trolling the climate agreement meeting is now they got troll right back all four hundred people who were at the sitting in the room for this call presentation just got up and left and
this or that i mean the rest of the world's like electric cars solar batteries whatever the trump administration's like we've got some great eighteenth century technology that we'd like
yeah rick perry wants to subsidize coal and maybe whale oil after that
when you think about that someone did a study report a few weeks to go there's more people in america who work at our obese roast beef sandwiches than mine call in a rational world will be having oval office summit center of roast beef policy you know
the real jobs
a real thing we should be subsidizing is sun and wind which we desperately need and you ever convince deny or have you ever been able to take some of the side and just talk to them calmly and rationally and have them go well i see your point i must have been wrong all these years this is this is the right question the week before thanksgiving
my advice would be don't wreck dinner sort of trying to argue with your crazy on call the most most people to seventy percent of americans understand what's going on the thirty percent who don't aren't going to be convinced by the next
study of infrared absorption patterns in the stratosphere or whatever
believe what they believe for ideological reasons if you spent the last thirty years marinating in rush limbaugh you'd be impervious to reason to
i think
right responses to say we had to take that seventy percent and get them active and engaged in this fight or at least some part of them if you just can't stand it at thanksgiving you know turn to him and say you may not believe in global warming but
mobile warming believes in you
and i want to get your opinion on the economics of this because i don't think this has brought up enough the economics really we know how it affects the environment
the argument that it's going to ruin jobs which is of course not true but it's also true that the people who are poor
generally don't care about the environment when you cannot blame them because they have the argument as they have more immediate problems and they do i'm just making the plant that income inequality very much impacts environmental progress as long as people are living hand to mouth they kind of can't be i'd always heard this
right
environmentalism is something rich white people do if you didn't know your next meal is coming from you wouldn't be an environmentalist and we started organizing three fifty dot or first thing we did was this global day of action we had fifty two hundred demonstrations in one hundred and eighty one countries people were sending in pictures from every corner of the planet it took me about
half an hour of watching those come in on flicker to realize that pretty much everybody we were working with was poor black brown asian young because that's what the world consists of i think you can make a pretty good argument at this point that rich white people may represent more of the environmental problem on all so
can get away
thanks to the mean you know that rich word prevents self logan
so let me ask you about this elephant thing because i saw a great documentary this year called when giants fall you can get google it and you'll see you can see it on the internet and it's about the elephants in their plight and trump he's kind of hedging on it now you like any was saying yes they were going to undo the obama role because we have to
do everything obama of course that you couldn't take your trophies from killed elephants back here to the states what do you think of that because there actually are some environmental people what this is just done junior protection act you know roaring back to bring back
it goes hand in hand with i mean he's he's saying we're going to take a pause on this one today because there were so much resistance to it maybe he could also perhaps pause the new rule they put into effect earlier this year that lets you let's hunters shoot hibernate needing bears in their dens
hey look i think there's there's sportsmen i think there's a contest in the white house every day what's the coolest thing you can think of and whoever wins gets to wear the red hat for the next day or just
have anyhow
we a lot to him in the hope is in the resistance and i have been a good but it's got to start resort to this well that's right and sign virginia that the resistance starting to elect
hello



there are non resident fellow at the modern incident at west point max broke and back
n political commentator and journalists like icon oh with bob woodward brought down all the president's and carl bernstein
she's a writer at large from eric magazine and author of all the single ladies now in paperback rebecca traced
over time tonight so we're good answer them after the show on youtube
well you
it's not original at all to ask you to compare
for the watergate
it's terrible but i have to i just want to specifically about last week when he was in vietnam trump and he was talking about prudent and he said he said he didn't let i asked the gun you can only are so many times that's a real now you can only ask how many times every time he sees me says i didn't do that and i really
we believe that when he tells me that he means it i think he's very insulted by it
he so protective of pollutants feelings this to me seems like public collusion is there such a thing is that impeachable public collusion i don't think it's impeachable i think that his conduct in terms of his embrace of proven without any thought given to the
actions and to undermine our elections in this country
his extreme and it's a reason we have a special prosecutor trying to get to the bottom of what occurred what drop may have
perhaps enabling helping to enable what the russians did or not we don't know where this is going to go what we do know is there is a cover up going on and the president does not want us to know what to cover up his about whether it's indeed about something that happened with enabling the russians
as to do with his family money what we know as he saw to mean undermine obstruct not necessarily obstruction of justice obstruct these investigations to keep us from knowing what this is really about and that's why we have a special prosecutor we're going to find out presumably what this is all about i hope
i guess what i'm asking is it that's all in the past but it seems like crimes are happening in the present it seems to me first of he's calling our own former cia head and national security head hacks while he goes he's up to put it's like his
his his favorite national foreign policy advisor on russia is potent and on china edgy
that that's to me
part of the problem you've identified it is how do you separate what might be criminal what might be a conspiracy from the merely outrageous and vile and it's very difficult to do in this presidency with an average president and that's what we're trying to sort out that's why the press has been so good
the old fashioned mainstream media has coaxed out these stories about both aspects of possible criminality as well as indeed a present in the united states too many people in the congress republicans believe is unfit to be the president and that's part of the story too
the military people in the highest ranks of the intelligence services republicans in congress their own large number of them who believe he's not fit to be presidents are all these things are coming together with possible conspiracy and yet the outrageous daily
cheese and wine on a scale with never seen by modern presidents and then there's also something we can do as citizens you know it's easy to feel powerless and sort of oh please muller save us but on the homefront as individual citizens we can be more responsible for the information we take in any information that we pass
online
evaluate online information that sort of the way we reevaluated free love in the eighties
you know it's great it's wonderful but there are consequences it's not free you have to be safe and responsible about where you put it
going to get to that
the other thing is that the companies that are profiting from the dissemination of this information could also play a part and being more responsive oh yeah february so that facebook and twitter i think need to take a lot more responsibility for the information
helping to determine the outcome of this election and the fact that we have this vial guy to begin with what about wiki leaks and then we learned this week that wiki leaks is in contact or was during the campaign with don junior among the things they direct messaging each other hi dawn
this is from i assume julian hassan
hi dawn if your father loses loses in quotes
we think it's much more interesting if he does not concede and spends time challenging the media and other types of rigging it's hard to imagine that coming from anybody but a russian agent
and i mean done i guess complete idiocy that he didn't know any be right

whether he will colluding with them are plainly they were colluding with him
and okay so wiki leaks
talk about a fall from grace and where we've seen it with a lot of men lately
i mean wiki leaks is to be a champion of seemingly what they're absolutely not helping with right now what this is where this weird ideological crossover took place and you could feel it a little bit during the election and there was a lot of push back to you know wiki leaks was championed by a segment of the last i think for a very good reason
for a long time and yet we can get aches itself seemed to be already early on champion in championing donald trump and maybe the any logical thing they had in common at least over the past couple years is a shared desire for hillary clinton to lose the presidential election in two thousand and sixteen
oh he landed our right shown a real and demands through ball antipathy to the united states originally when we saw their first releases
well he said the economy
equal opportunity disclosures they've been nothing in the time they've been pawns particularly of the russians they're not an equal opportunity disclosure
infinite
what a good comparison question we live now in the post truth error that wasn't true of watergate worker good wound up being kind of a victory because you intrepid reporters did with the first amendment says you can do and you on earth the truth
but there wasn't what i call state tv which is fox news who are giving this alternative reality and that there are so many people the people who watch fox news
the of thing has just made up that just fake and as you're just saying about twitter and facebook and passing on information that isn't real i don't even know what's real anymore when i read something i think you've got a small piece of it with fox but it's much deeper in there that we now have a culture in which
apple by and large and increasingly are not looking are interested in the best obtainable version of true too many people and this is very different from the time of watergate are looking for information to undergo to underscore and reinforce what they already believe that they're not open and goes for people on the left as well as the right
there's no monopoly here and what happened in watergate and there's not an equivalency know there is not a asymmetrical there's no question it's a metaphor is among the willingness to look at science among other things
but but we do not have a culture open to the best obtainable version of the truth in our citizenry the way we did at the time of of watergate and one of the key differences is what watergate our institutions work not just press the judiciary the congress in the united states supreme court
the republican party which was heroic in barry goldwater the nine hundred and sixty four nominee and his party march into the white house and telling richard nixon he must resign we don't see a republican party now now seems to be interested in principle above party or the best obtainable version of the truth
this is a big difference between watergate and what we're seeing today
yeah
point about this sort of fractured attentions and the ability to burrow into our own ideological home wherever that may be within a new kind is more democratize media and i agree with you about all the ways and it's problematic but it is also true that when media was consolidated in the way that it was in the watergate era and you had three networks and it every
but he was looking in the same direction at the same time response could be better organized and you might be able to sort out your news sources better but at the same time that consolidated power meant that certain stories where it towards you could have the three networks but they didn't necessarily cover shirley chisholm speech at the nineteen seventy two convention and so there was a very it was a very narrow lands bit determined
some of the news that we got so there is a kind of democratizing impact of having social media even though i agree with you about all the ways in which it's problem and have a totally different media configuring night but even then we had other magazines less mainstream news but we're developing stories too but you're right in that that today we've got
a smorgasbord although one thing that has not changed is that at least three times in my lifetime a conservative has won the white house because the left has split wide open
let's not forget nineteen seventy nine that jimmy carter was challenged for the presidency by joe kennedy for being too conservative if you can believe that and the middle left and the far left split apart and through that gap roared a b movie actor named ronald reagan that started a conservative revolution
so reagan didn't when we lost because we turned on each other and didn't know how to compromise and come together okay we're going to get to
gregory
a lot of people do get their news from the show right i in this is smart people are
always see this as a service where we're going off the air for a while we do future add lives because people are not going to know what's going to happen
next generated so we predict their lives for you get your headlights
going
next couple of months

hired ripples have any ads outrage fox fans cut off their deck yeah
jeff sessions mistaken for l shelf traced to allow
yeah
a host of problems they talk show on that and i was dreaming episodes read second season one of our favorites chelsea handler



i'm going to rather some positive energy and are going to get excited about what happened in virginia would happen in new jersey we had a lot of good news is we had a lot of
as you said earlier it's the resistance but there were women who have that sixteen when in emily's list sponsored thirteen wine and got elected in virginia house of delegates
forest african americans like day we had our first latina selected and that stay we had our first trans gender percent
that had we had our first asian american woman
virginia has a delicate so delicate it's it is it is an important time and in there are things to recognize that are happening the world is getting browner and gay or and everybody needs a hop on
but now i mean it is a devastating circumstance that were and but there are good things happen so we have to kind of hold onto that her by my first question
well i was gonna ask you what's going on with you though
we get all that we have you take it anymore
we care about you not doing yourself any more you're more of an activist now i have to be i feel like to know what i had money i don't have to work spend my time trying to get elected we need women and office we do

i think elizabeth warren really has to run for president that's the
mostly at this
i had somebody emily's was recruited they took her and said you should run for office yes
i mean this is a great organization for anybody who wants to support women to support so nineteen percent of the house is only nineteen percent of
twenty one percent of but women vote why don't they threw themselves
well i think we had i mean this is my personal opinion and i think this is i think we had a thing where women have a trial our problem supporting other women and powerful
situations they don't have a problem electing a predator but they have a problem letting somebody who stayed with a predator mean like with hillary it was like well we can liked her because she's with but they don't have a problem electing the man so it's almost like there's a backlash on women that don't support women and now that we have this maniac in office i think
women are like oh shit
this is not what we planned on i think the backlash that we're seeing now with the sexual harassment and everything is is the reactions it's from being the president of our country but he still one word when right
and that was after the hollywood actors
you think the his child molester with more and more different i feel like that as a litmus test and getting about truth that as a litmus test for whether fox news in the crowd can make something just because lorrie moore's about everything is well she's lying or that yearbook is a forgery or the
news know he's godzilla blaming tokyo
he's literally saying well tokyo was asking what do you expect you know but there's a big difference between somebody and taking accountability and responsibility for for an act and somebody giving blanket denials and then accusing their accusers of lying and then
pretending they're going to see them on what grounds i don't now because i'm a winner
more than one person that comes forward then you take that seriously i agree with you on al franken i'm sorry he's not a predator we all know anybody who's marrying a yes that's not true

also i feel like we've lost our ability to think in this country to tell unlike things
i mean there's a difference between zero tolerance we have zero tolerance of that a maximum punishment does everything have to be i mean we don't have that for murder there are different grades of murder and other crimes not for this i think that the focus on the punishment and on what the repercussion is going to be is where this
conversation goes wrong and i think it's largely steered by a media that immediately after a picture is published says do you think he should resign like within three hours somebody handed out of the concert many has it right the media sets up the conversation it is not the on telling the stories here are coming for these guys jobs directly in fact many they were going i don't know i feel we i don't know what it means but they but the focus
on the what the punishment is going to be is also on some level and easier conversation to have because then we get to fight about it should resign and we are good or a partisan battle seasons than actually looking at the more difficult conversation which is that it is about the whole culture it's about the culture that empowers white men to abuse their power in a million ways from the villa
and his predators to the fact that there is a sense of humor that we all understand in this country that if a woman's asleep it's funny to grab her tits and that a man can gain power and stature in a place in the public sphere my profiting from that from that comedy that doesn't make him the same is harvey weinstein and it's not about him it's about reckoning with the fact that we make that culture we participate in that culture
it's er good politicians it's our friends are
zhao
could be having about this moment not should resign and will a governor
right but i think that conversation we are having i think we're deciding like okay now it's become into you know there's a tipping point happening this is happening everywhere what are we going to do about it what are the repercussions going to sex rehab in arizona at the meadows is that going to fix army right right
i mean now are a larger problem that we have not been able english culture to look at things context
yes she's are going to make distinctions politics
in our views of gender in all kinds of questions the inability to recognize context as we all important as big of the truth taxed on together individually
surely the truth and that's the internet is everything
kelly
talk and say it was known congress had only one troubling as it goes to meet you
goes to the questions were discussing here
it also means indications of beer is a possibility that after these special prosecutor is permitted to finish his investigation
possible he won't find a conspiracy but yet there will be one would hope a report did put everything into context that's what we lack on a daily basis in our culture can i ask just about the pole
but it is kind of important who's in the senate right now i mean that's why they're willing to put up with maybe a child molester to get the vote for the tax cuts that's how they play the game i'm not suggesting we go there or that floor but al franken can't be in this and we don't need his vote because we do
do we do need his vote on things that affect millions and millions of people so we can do two things at once we can i have learned to be okay of course we can my complaint is with the fact that it immediately goes to the and eight
to people just wrote that or said that you just
oh i see the and they said a tramp will he firebomb mahler it's i don't say that don't give him any fucking idea
but it occurred to him
also he needed to put the news what i heard
some people who are making this argument yesterday was well we have to get rid of al franken because otherwise it's a push they're going to say al franken we say lorrie moore and this is what democrats always do they shrink from making the counter argument instead of going there with oh well we can't win this we just going to go away let him resign make the counter i don't
i just the monologues
these not the zodiac killer
same thing

and then had should be able to point out that al franken reaction is to begin an investigation into his behavior and that given not to not to given cookies that's correct that's a good response we should also have an investigation into the sixteen women who have accused donald trump
yeah
that shirt listen this is what i was saying earlier was the reaction to women voted for dallas out the act the reaction of women voting for somebody who admitted on tape that he's a sexual predator he admitted it was bragging about it they went and voted for him and that that after effect i think that pendulum of looking at what they've done
i think has led to this i believe that i think women are sick and tired of being sick and tired not to go of the civil rights movement that women are just like now my god look what we did and better late than never
i want women and stick up for each other and look out for each other i never silicate any hobby wife seem bullshit like that
but this has to be this has to be
because we don't want to find ourselves in the exact same trap we found ourselves after obama because right after obama got elected suddenly everybody was spouting that we were living in a post racial society which is it all the shit at four hundred years to get here and we can't say suddenly we're living in a post sexist society because remember
while all this is happening right now we're talking about this great backlash people are speaking up the number two movie in the country is storing mel gibson all right so let's not pretend this is going to go away overnight this has to start with our kids what we teach them how we teach little girls to fight back and we teach little boys to respect girls this has to be
wrong cultural game that we play for the next generation
okay
one other aspect
say anything i just want to go on the record and say that i'm currently dating mel gibson
as fact that he visited
yeah i forgive you doubt that is hunting for him know
really i almost was going to ask your how's it going
he knows i like older man not battle
yeah

okay
yeah and speaking about that defensive harvey weinstein have about well hey it's not my fault i grew up in the sixties
was that okay
wasn't like that
we're not used to wear got taliban has ever one in the washington post
six years everything has changed ready it was never ok to masturbate in front of a coworker

but even back in the good old days raid oh god
obviously it
three we're in we're in a moment culturally a great reckoning year and it also comes from earlier than what we're seeing his party would continue first wave of feminism
whole idea of violence against women having the kind of currency in our culture today in terms of the way we discuss it
there is it comes from what we've been doing over the past twenty twenty five thirty years this is not or like yours
come out of this moment is what i was going to say
al franken accuse early and britain has forgiven him and said he should her opinion is injured and step down
and i said a couple of weeks ago we were talking about the baseball player who made the objective asian thing with his eyes he was making fun of a putting was just teasing and but it's a big dance and you can't and the baseball player the japanese vapor for boy said that's not a big deal to me i forget i said you can't be more offended than the victim
if his accuser and it's only want to kills are now if we find out tomorrow it's eight more and i don't think it will be but if we do different story but what she says that isn't that game over you can't be more offended than the person
this is happening in a time when people are just so self righteous we have to stop letting fives self righteous millenniums at the huffington post goalie everybody into having opinions that they don't really hold
but we have to be careful because we created those our generation we ride it and it's a well as a parent
her generation to be this way and we have to be careful next time to say listen it's not just about you you gotta take your lumps you have to listen you have to talk you have to have a dire have exactly and people we've had guess to cancelled on this show because they don't want to talk about this subject people don't want to talk that's that's a tear
casualty that this country is facing i was written let me read this quote i don't even know who this is diploma
as i am i ok
okay i'm sure he's very good at what do you guys electronic music i'm reading on a plane reading rolling stone magazine this made me cry reporter your twitter used to be really wild now you've toned it down why diploma whoever he is
every once in awhile he said i'm a political it i just get millions of people attacking me i don't really feel like being a catalyst for arguments on the internet whether it's politics or whatever sarcasm doesn't travel well over the of it especially being a white dude on the internet i don't have any past is aiming sarcastic or funny so he just shuts up and i see that all the time
people just won't talk a not worse
aren't bees it's like a swarm of bees coming at jack that's okay that's it lesson that's kind of somebody who's on ecstasy probably all the time he's a detail
you have to take into account that you're right people get shy they get gun shy especially actors in our industry people don't want to they have a brand that they want to protect they want to protect the midwest and south and if they're selling clothing or whatever luckily there are people that don't give a shit about that
all left this now
julia have a culture a twenty four hour screaming
but it's i genuinely hunters for the laugh because you cannot write aim to love diversity and multiculturalism if you're not willing to have an open and on i love it when you have open and honest dialogue eventually accidentally some people might get offended by what we have to hang in there i respond and so franken is a good example of his first apology
she was kind of crap though like it was guy was trying to be funny that was that was not good right
that defense gets old real quick and goes very quickly to the ladies are just humorless then he gave a second longer statement it was really good and one of the things that we have to get better at in addition to not just shutting out of the people who are going to be overzealous in their criticism is also talking about the people who are criticized giving them the chance to wreck
in with whatever it is they're being criticized for and gave everybody on both sides of the equation a chance to discuss it what happened with franken and his accuser is that he gave a good apology and she accepted it that model can happen more rather than just everybody yelling at he did and why there's still people saying you must go away
we're really in the midst of the cold civil war in this country
in terms of our culture and perhaps trump has brought it to the point of near ignition
but is it possible that we could have a debate in which right and left republicans and democrats is it possible to have a fact based debate no question
it's not as i agree we cannot have a fact those debate in this culture and that but i'm not sure maybe asymmetrical but that lies at the bottom of a lot of what we're talking about so what what about bill clinton show for you to imagine being molested by an older man
then that man denies ever doing it and then goes on and gets elected to united states senate and when either broderick to yeah chelsea handler i can imagine and goes into how she said she was raped bell kind of at but the unlike the the right you then said oh you have a point i say i'm so sorry i
apologize every first of all every victim deserves to be heard anyone who's alleging any sort of assault or this needs to be listened to you can do we look at go clinton well do we have to go back to look at bill clinton and i mean i think this mean isn't the jury out on that we got what bill clinton was okay he had a lot of sex with a lot of people and and yeah
we know we're now we're talking about four stacks which marseille riots right i mean right you're right do we have to go back and look at that yes i'm not going to disbelieve a woman i'm a woman and it is my job right now we're in the area where we have to believe everyone and because we've done such a poor job at believing each other's one of the reason
one of the reasons that i think it is crucial that we go back as part of this conversation and look at bill clinton is because the timing of what happened with bill clinton was really crucial to the development this conversation about sexual harassment it was right after the anita hill hearings in which that term sexual harassment and what it meant to win
as a class of the way that this behavior disadvantage and economically and professional i came into the lexicon and feminist made this point even though clarence thomas's a to the supreme court despite being accused of sexual harassment by anita hill and then immediately after bill clinton is elected president and there is because he is better for feminist policy then the twelve
years as and this is the politics you're talking about it and because there is a right wing attack on him and those things are simultaneously true there is a left feminists defense of bill clinton's power abuse with regard to monica lewinsky and that the rails the clarification of the conversation around sexual harassment
so chronologically before we even get to whether we believe when he broderick there is a derailment have that conversation in the nineties when the left is moved to defend bill clinton right after we've just talked about what sexual harassment means so it's important to go back and talk about it on the other hand we can't just make this about bill clinton and not the guy who's currently in the white house not the guy who wants to be
in the senate that and were aired send it right now frankly the stakes are higher with a trumpet
this guy should i appreciated
now
