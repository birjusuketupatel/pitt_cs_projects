back backlash

welcome to h b a passed from h b o maintenance real time with him

back the
bradley word for it howard your whispering character josh lyman
yeah
josh
there were a jerk or less real character fair at the trump it
fair he wouldn't be the driver
stupid question number was released
ryan astrid barack obama be leading the left into the bridge or or is there a better option
there's a better option
but the question i would ask about that you know obama keep saying he's playing the long game
what what's he waiting for know
it's about i would i would hope that he would be dead
yeah i mean now would be the john and i think he will take obama better would be michelle
i think he may be the only choice by the way for two thousand and twenty idea
that's popular woman hating america
okay
which would be the best strategy for games into are you taking the high road are fighting dirty we already entered
like a more which of your movies would you most like to make a sequel to
interesting
well sadly there are still relevant so
i mean
i was gonna ask you about bowling for columbine
guns
now that fascism is coming to america
their side has all the guns
any second door
seventy eight seventy eight percent of americans do not own a gun right and they're all the liberals and there's right
that their seven million americans that own one hundred and sixty million guns they have stockpiled them this is the elephant in the room in terms of the discussion of what are we all do putting their bodies and the line what does that really mean we'll do it not violently but we people are afraid people were afraid people who voted for hillary were
afraid that she would win because of he told my second amendment people is going to be a regulator and get ready get your guns he was calling for an armed revolt if hillary won
ask yourself that question it gone the other way where where he won the popular vote and she won the electoral college
that civil war
they already know or and that's what everyone's afraid of and we don't we don't on the guns but there's more of us and i think the military aggression and they've got bigger guns and more guns and i will never comes to that but the thing the military know it's a huge question grow
that if he sees the commander in are you worried that that question and from a sitting senator you're talking about the war in yemen and i was trying to talk him into declaring it unconstitutional and getting us out of the damn war and he said everybody all the office for a few minutes and he shorter
presented to me
while
it was in terms of maybe the last massive loss in the midterms which i don't think is gonna happen now let's say it did and then impeachment proceedings proceeded with haste from both parties
and trump with call his legions and in the street with their guns in the military do it and frankly i couldn't answer it
can i mean is worrisome because him that we have to us i don't know although constitutes workers and because the military is in general conservative and also because he is their commander in chief here's an interesting point
two sociologists do of paper recently called the casually get lazy studied the world war one world war two greed and all the wars we have good dad granular data on they found there's always been an imbalance poor people more than rich people everybody knows that i'd rather as a brain but in the last seventeen years of war the gap has grown ass
ironically show they want to see if that had a political impact they went and did a very fun on pole with controlling factors for other answers and so forth
came to find out that most of the families who lost someone or had someone wounded badly voted for job
there is a political result of what we're doing right now which is learning poor people die overseas or get horribly wounded or come back with posttraumatic stress for all the rest of the republicans have always had this amazing ability to be in an abusive relationship with their voters the more they hurt them get the more the
yeah i had a to gay in the midwest
he said to me that trump groomed economically vulnerable americans like a pet harassed like while like would hamsters or yeah i was like wow
but there's have changed but
but at a fiery area
when i think
his vanity and search for love to fill the god sized hole in his soul which is not intelligence but it's as inevitable as water rushing down a hill right he will go for that love and
yeah that's the that's the bait and switch why there's economic anxiety oh wow blaming immigrants works
that turns it up and then you and i get a tax cut
that's that's
you know that the switch given the commonality of threats cameron asks made on social media by mass shooters should the government take a more active role in monitoring these sites
now prompts government i think
one thing that i feel more than max a cupboard as donald trump sal
but now i am
hey much about what happened in annapolis
the person who is fermenting violence the most is the president can overheat the crowd on journalists a holding hollering screaming mass of people he individually pick fat journalists for them to direct their ire he us the enemy of the people he says that we are unpatriotic that we do
not love our country and were surprised when someone picks i feel it on the street the way people drive angry and i feel like more than ever there over the line
like the line in the middle of the road i'm always honking like get on your side of the wrong
i don't know maybe some that is texting but i never i don't remember that before i think i think bill worse than anger most people i think a lot of people in this audience are filled with despair
and delivers a bad week this was a week said it was like nineteen forty when france fell it was like seventy when the temple in jerusalem
know i mean that's how it felt there's another and put seventy thanks
it bothers me the supreme court you're out its history has always shown a difference to national security issues it rarely wage and on national security issues whether it's the patriot act unconstitutional wars
we're going to get a court probably going to be even more so that way and so more supportive of the national security state will become the warfare state we've become and that's very very dangerous that's where as in our we were all good
today had to remove a teacher that they are for sale and the t shirt said rope tree journalist
some assembly required
and and enough uproar about it and they are not selling anymore what were they doing selling it in the first place right can come china
really
but he has as generous
trump has perpetuated this year this level of calling for violence and that that's where this civility that's where the civility debate if we're going to get back to some place we gotta do it from let's not be threatening each other and when i say each other we're not doing it to them
it is unprecedented even presidents that who i totally disagree with they they did not actively want to separate us this guy wants to separate us one little piece of hope
