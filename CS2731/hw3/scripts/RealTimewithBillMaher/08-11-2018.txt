when experience over dallas every second counts see the life administering the locks on learn how to get in the locks on a visit and that path
back backlash
it's paid for with pennsylvania taxpayer dollars
welcome to h b a passed from h b o maintenance real time with him
the
wanting to know answers to what why do we need a space for us and we have yes
mr trump sent out by pets to announce the space
pence does not seem like a space guy but he's in charge of space force a sixth
branch of the arm service that trump wants was
separate but equal
it that don't notice the space force opinions what do you think congressmen your trunk two dogs a draft five times to avoid serving and in vietnam but maybe if you could have been a space
fuck out
job i had the moon shot as vice president they wanted to have something equipped very nice present but is there is there anything to the fact that space is different than it was twenty thirty years ago
it is it is becoming
a place where countries will as as the north pole is a place where countries didn't use it used to contend for power and they will be
do have to invest in space the airforce does that get the air force and we should do more that i don't know that we need a space force
i think it's the seventies on tv i made it to it sounds like a sitcom doesn't sound it but the most important thing to know about it is and i think the congressmen and will agree with this is it's not going to happen
it's it's up to him and has to be voted on by congress and this is at the moment the beginning down payment on it as eight billion dollars that you don't have it's an increase in the deficit by another eight billion dollars and would never get through as it is now well they ran up a trillion with the time
tax cuts so eight billion would be nothing if they wanted to do it well yeah but when he speak real out next year he's not going to

you're running against the
no i'm not going to run for speaker myself but i do think it's time for a new generation of leadership but our part
we'll see we'll see what
okay
he learns what do you say to people who claim m s n b c is just the liberal version of fox news of fuck
look we work with facts of fire
yeah really is seat back the balance of my time
steven pinker how do you fight a political party that's winning with a platform of hate and fear well it didn't identify which one
i to the democrats should take ownership of policies that have worked like the environmental protection agency which has reduced air pollution
i don't really democrat i cannot brag well yeah like any may already measures which really have reduced power and a trump has really shown us be people in this country to hold it against your when you brag that debate and this midterm election season without your inspection be about nancy pelosi rain like there is his agenda
asian on discussion to be had among democrats if they went back our if they doubt however the it should be about ideas and if democrats are moving more to the left on healthcare she has patient be out there talking about medicare for all or why they don't agree with that or how you will defend to the and instead you have this constantly their reaction to what the president has to eating
more it becomes around whoever the bogeyman is at the moment whether that was hillary clinton or and and total iran and here in california where have these very competitive congressional races that's again i mean and the times we wrote that story now what are people saying about nancy pelosi because it is nearly as the candidates get lost and and that doesn't really help any voters trying to distinguish
what the ideas you're actually fighting know the democrats position on track
we get we get the democrats are opposed to trump we going to start talking about what we're going to do you know what we're going to do
i wouldn't completely hold up on
rad talking drunk
there's a lot to be said about we hate trump and he's a traitor
i mean he did sell this country out to another country i would hope i would hope one
that stop saying but we've got to start talking about well we're going to do you think that bragging about what you do is good so we have to teach you had agrarian as ones in one
that would be culturally appropriate
here
i think it's best for a black celebrities to shun trump or meet an attempt to reason with him
what to trump
the law photo out like he he never when he wants he wants to talk to at least actors and comedians about the problems that have like me why don't we just talk that david blaine and make them all disappear
never like he's never serious about what he does and i think i'd never say that present me with him who got a result other than being a with him in a paycheck so they said
what do you think about
there's any credible
oh cause know he sold us out and that was the by
a soldier here's how
written by the guy who owns a huge
the headline added that for me was that president tramples eating paper
which right eating paper yeah whether you're tearing up i had secrets are you baby he just eats paper
what the hell was that i i think it was a fit of anger just was a crowd
this is a labour and with nacho cheese or yeah he says that than his regular guy
this is here to report to have him saying they were like that
i not only that but don't
from say they were
but as i think it's also funny that trump accused obama and co mee member of secretly taping but who did actually taping
that they would present morose a and my will go on and that's all we know about it and that and a soccer ball from potent as a minute
john enough incentive
we had a night watchman
for me
on h b o dot com
and i think your base back when seasons here his pack ass other his grief doesn't go away
i'm from grief you just learn to live when we don't address our
close your him building and honest discussions and learn from others have experienced life altering losses have been trying to spend as much time as possible my kid
listen to all there is an anderson cooper wherever you get your cash
