very good so the question you want to work
or as we talked about starbucks we talked about our great border rights bill we talked about our efforts to be climate change but for you bill i cannot hear the best when the united states
oh regulated as well regular regular extra extra with the county would give you a run for your money they are they're in a little pressure on us we've heard from attorney general in seattle actually we didn't make sure that the back off
wouldn't it be wonderful if the first time don't throw said something that was actually true as he said he leave us alone and marijuana decriminalization that
jeff sessions i said good people don't smoke marijuana
you are not good people there okay michael will you ever release the contents of the warning shot disc of evidence you tweet about you
possibly it depends on how it progresses i mean we we worked on it
wow
we took that picture and we we treated it out in it was exactly that it was a warning shot to michael go in the president that if they tried to claim that my client was a liar after sixty minutes that was going to be consequences and it worked and it worked perfectly because we've heard nothing them
we have the dvd and we're going to release it when it's necessary and we're going to see what happens with the case

make no mistake about it it's locked and loaded
can i ask
just like this yes mean i've been listening to all of this about trump and watching how this conversations go in the us and i have one question about it i mean there's all these people in the us who are on the conservative side who are aligned with trump for all sorts of reasons and there's all this tension around his presidency and attempts to pull him
out of his office for various reasons and
what do you think will happen it's that comes to pass what what do you think will happen to these people that have identified with trump and like how is it that that the democratic types your example are holding out their hand to say to these conservative type sort of like welcome back into the fold because it looks to me from going out for an outsider's perspective it
your country is polarizing in a way that's not good and that you know people are going after trump and i understand that it's not like i don't understand that but there's all these people that elected him and that are identified with him and they're they're not taken this well you know and so well they're not they're not it's not and you know you might not think they're very bright and all of that and
and you know their backwards and and all of those things but but but you know you need to have respect for the rest of your citizens and if your if your country isn't going to pull itself apart and as you really see this happening from an outsider's perspective when i come down here and i lived in this makes for on it wasn't by this before
if he was just a regular republican president with the republican policies i would say you'd have a point but what what is so alarming is the assault on democratic norms what we were talking about here today things like threatening to put people in jail threatening to put journalists in jail wanting military parades praising dictators wanting to be a
dictator i mean we are at a moment here this is i try to impress on this on the people who are too young to remember a lot of president and a lot of elections how incredibly different this than anything that ever came before i never much like the other republicans who were in office but i have a renewed respect for them
george
they just wouldn't what about nixon nixon got caught and he gave himself up basically well audio other this president makes the watergate burgers or brilliant
it's easy to me that it's not point we can we can be as tough as were being on the president we should for all the reasons you just said bill without telling his supporters that they're stupid without saying beret of deplorable if we want to bring them around to what i would say is a more enlightened kind of thinking and who happened to see donald trump is someone has turned the presidency into one
long infomercial from our logo you know we can do that without saying to them you've been due to your champs you're dumb your deplorable and i think we need to talk to them with more generosity than we do
he says that the left is too preoccupied with being non confrontational
re my last is buy orders by we are entering now i know that he's a good question the idea that that liberals especially intellectuals are are preoccupied with politically correct speech that their eyes i see yeah i know they're too preoccupied with which identity politics by a large margin
and they tend to categorize everyone by their ethnicity and their sex and gender and i think all that does this turn people into tribal actors in that the end result of that is contacts weren't you also saying know that that the left is too worried about offending people
i think that that goes along my world yes well that and then another hand when the left for example offends people in their political sphere air questioning whether that's somehow bad for society writ large well i'm concerned about i don't i think that those two issues
those two issues are somewhat separate i'm concerned about the the dialogue in the united states around the presidency
pulling people people farther and farther apart it has nothing to do with the behavior of trump i think this is an independent issue you can you can say positive or negative but he's only answers my order i know that's the thing is it's like that's the issue that's that's the issue they they support of and without the circus he's just a lonely clown
but he has these people in congress who are unable or and this base that it is a cult of personality not unlike dictatorships we've seen in the past i mean he he said once famously i could shoot someone on fifth avenue and not lose any fans who yes and he has proved that to be almost true i mean week
cannot imagine what he would do where they were turning up because i don't know what that would be i don't think it's anything because whatever was he would just say well it's fake news but it would also imagine he's impeached just for the sake of argument and were convicted okay either of those but it seems to build it mattered one he asked to leave yeah i know why it's not it's not an and
detail but it still seems to me that it leaves you with the problem of what do you do with the disaffected forty cents that are going to be very happy about this independent of trumps behave kind of like the sooners after we kicked over saddam well that's that's a hell of you can nice site yeah right
i'm just this is an argument looking for an argument rather and a solution without waiting for impeachment were making sure that people understand donald trump cannot stop us today donald trump could not stop me from the first net neutrality bill to make sure people have access to the internet he could not stop us from
can i stop for that kid on climate change with all his bully eighteen say that it's just a hoax he can't stop us from fighting climate change he can't stop us from ever the best paid family leave and sickly policy he can't stop us when we demonstrate keep in progress in our state washington state
i know why that's nice
are certainly is stopping us from protecting the environment he has signed executive orders the first thing he did a novice would he has was design in order that said hey you want to dump your coal sludge in the streams go right ahead the head of the is through it is reversed all of a he just changes to the environmental pollutants pollutants i know
but let's just say he can't stop it and he's changed the landscape every so you can't do anything and eight and he's doing he's pointing crazy judges less day i say these are changing things as we speak when i don't cover it because of stormy daniels but all of this is going on

i'd say good
get get used to it
i didn't get any questions but it was a wonderful paddle like you are not
