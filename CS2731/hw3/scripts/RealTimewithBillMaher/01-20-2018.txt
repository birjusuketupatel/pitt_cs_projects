edit
know what i was reluctant than my vacation
that makes it worthwhile there was in a why we're so relaxing and told them this alert
right on the phone
shit not not a drew surrey where could i get new underwear
hawaiians
or so laid back over there and therefore they just swipe left
one guy he texted new phone notice
but happy new season happy new year

twenty eight seen on the chinese calendars the year of his shit hole
what you know the thing about go and gravy already
but about doubt a drubbing he says shit hole where he lasted that they would actually change is real stuff because that was the immigration deal they were trying to do and saying shit hold torpedo did and now they're going to cut down the wedding on that right now library night because donald trump you know he wants to change the immigration process he says
why can't we do immigration while like the way i got milan by using a catalog

actually said they said that we should bring in more both from norway and today norway responded they said thank you pass
so now we have this government shutdown looming and it is a stalemate because the democrats are not budging on the dreamers
drunk
even more did said about and stupid wall because his chief of staff john kelly went on t v this week oh and he said trump on the wall was uninformed
and evolving and trump was furious he said i have not uninformed and who is this john kelly

what's evolution but
i'll tell you what evolution is trouble for two years telling all those beds every time he got that going to be a giant concrete wall of actual wall thirty feet high from goes to goes now now it's of sense
his stream or a sprinkling of cinnamon like you do with and
but
if there is a government shutdown trump says not to worry porn stars will still get their hush money so

any other president there's enough to get mad but yes donald trump only men ever by the way to pay a porn star to keep her mouth shut

you know the story
i'm not even gonna say allegedly
i've been sued up one know in lawsuits with donald trump
if i lose this would be one in one
but they paid or one hundred and thirty thousand dollars you don't pay some than that kind of money if there isn't something that so in two thousand and six only months after milan he has given birth to their is done
donald trump is stopping this porn star who was also cheating on her boyfriend and he knew because used to go home with orange on her collar
but
but as the porn stars you bribery as fans here
stormy daniel stormy daniels
star of young and anal
oh to be young and
now the young and nato trailer trash nurses for good will hunting
and parking with pride to and here's what we learn from her and her affairs with a job she said first of all he didn't use protection
he said he'd only use a condom is mexico paid for it

gotta love japanese the world's biggest german islam won't shake hands to raw dog with a porn star no problem
she asked
she says he chased around the room in his tidy whites
i went from her and tidy why he said well you may my voters

and i love this part that he made her a lot of promises like he was going to buy a condo but she knew he was a con men who would never keep his word oh if only the voters of wisconsin have the same perceptive abilities as the star of working with pride

and so it changes around the robot is tidy why these and finally she says they get out there that he starts kissing your he says to refill ugh
here we go but she's a pro she powered through it
she said you know sometimes i have to have sex with a guy like donald trump you just shut your eyes and pretend it's harvey weinstein

iran and but first up oh wow he wrote the book that president trump didn't want you to buy so you did
the white house like a while


well you have done the impossible you have made america read again
you know if it's a book that brings down this presidency i'm back to the god of irony well
all due respect for great fun book to read but it's not bring him down his popularity has not gone down one bid his base wouldn't read it that people are rated already hate him but it's fun
and it's and you just can't these people that's the thing and i know you've been talking about i want you to tell me something that the other people have not noticed in this book is there something that you think by when they asked me about this that i put in there that they're not talking about
there is but i can't tell you what it is
so very lucky enough money
teasing us like that there is something in the in the light i was absolutely sure of but it was so incendiary that that i just didn't have the the the ultimate proof that the littering what he's done is it
thing well i yeah i didn't have the blue dress
no is it about a woman it is oh it is it is it's somebody is fucking now is oh and who is he just have to read between the lines what lines tell us the line
you say it
the end of the okay well it's in the book than just have to you'll know it now
now that i have to go loco when you hit that paragraph you're going to go
that
i'm not going to make the joke was going to
okay so listen the womanizing thing you do have a lot about the book i mean that i found fascinating that you were basically saying that this is sort of the point of trumps whole life
i love the way you the empire the it really was a boutique industry kind of he really didn't do anything all day the whole point of his existence was chasing tail twenty four seven
twenty four seven that was it that is he's the man i am an old fashioned playboy that's the kind of thing that he says and he says it proudly and i always thought i made last year that your i thought one of the biggest adjustments for him was when he moves into the white house he can play the you know when it was a mulatto
albert eight and then eager yes hotels he goes to golf tournaments we see as all these places ring get together with his mistresses that's hard to do in the white house that's probably why you so pissed off for the done
except now the yeah i mean there's yeah i got back to their back
there are back doors
gailey listen

sean spicer if i can get into the white house
price now get into the white this is the other thing that so first learning about your book
what's in the book just the fact that you were able to hang out
like it's a dorm room like you know just this is the white house that just blew my mind that people weren't saying who's this guy why you see here every day which is listening to us everyday i waited for someone to notice me say please get out but they don't they actually do the other thing they saw it
and say okay come come let's let's talk
and what do you attribute this to
i attribute to donald trump this is like he said okay he like you because you were a new yorker well sort of near his he gave the first approval i said i'd like to come come down and and observe and then he thought i was asking for a job as i said i want to write a book and he said
he just saw he was deflated book might why would you want to do that
but then it was kind of like okay you know what was the tirade
call it fire and fury when you were talking to them right it was like the grand transition or ah yes the great transition a greater of course that's funny you know when larry charles and ever make making my documentary religious we didn't call it that we we called it a spiritual journey
they let us interview them in the church of now i told trump he said he and i said i'm going to call the book the great transition the first hundred days he said
a boring title
right right
so the other thing that where you actually had an impact is because of the book there was a lot of talk about maybe he is just flat out that much
people were diagnosed i mean there was talk about that before but it reached a fever pitch to the point where he thought he had his physical last week that he also asked to take a cognitive tests and then bragged about how great he did even though it was a test that it's the kind of test they give an old lady when she was wandering down the middle of the highway and her
your it's
also you can get the test on the internet so you can get the questions before him
it's it's thirty questions the first for our what month is what day is it what year is it what city are you in
and who's the present a united

so it goes
because of what we're john kelly takes over okay so that is the big watershed moment but this week now he's apparently shooting as i refer a doing the my like with john kelly because kelly committed the ultimate fall pod party criticize trump on t v or inferred that he was not perfect
what do you make of this and apparently i read now the john kelly threatens to quit all the time that's the only way you can get trumps attention and everybody tries to quit the whole operation
it's like had had how do i get outta here
so why does he still command so much loyalty he's been so rotten and said rotten things to just about everybody and all i see is month after month republicans not fighting him more lining up behind him more like
lying for him what do you attribute that to well i mean i think the loyalty thing my book is sort of the example that that these are the most disloyal loyal people who ever ever existed
but but also the republicans you know there was mitch mcconnell said this was early on he will sign anything we put in front of him
so he just becomes for everyone in some way a useful fool
now the problem with that is he's the useful fool but then he goes wacko and said something which destroys everybody's plans to use him so what what are you in what do you in awe of with it
not saying admire did nothing i admire about him but there are things about him that i am in awe of
i like the size of his balls
aren't you just in awe of the size
come i mean i am in awe that that there is actually someone who can go through life
reach the age of what does seventy one right now in still act like he should get what he wants when he wants without anyone saying otherwise demand demand demand because everything is so unfair his favorite word is unfair he's the luckiest guy in the world and he's
got this chip on his shoulder that's that's what i understand the whole attitude is when will white men born degrade wealth finally catch a break in america

everyone i literally a hundred percent of the people around him
always returned to saying well he's like a child right and sometimes he is a sixteen year is like a sixteen year old are or an eleven year old laura to yeah i noticed now on fox and friends they talk to him directly like they used to on ramp or room
i see don
it's the funnest book i read in a long time i just hope the world's days where it is thank you so much
yeah


right
the area is a writer at large in new york magazine an author of the conservatives all are great for an andrew sullivan
the health greater of h b o's and insecure and the host of the park as black on the arrow be speaking at the l a woman's marge on saturday be careful what they say larry larry

right so great to have you guys here let me start off with this what's what's knit we were last on in november seventeenth the twenty seventy what i think it's the big new thing is we're just starting to get into their is that the entire conservative establishment is lying for donald trump
when tom cotton the senator and who was at purdue the other one day were in the room when he said she had and everybody heard shit hole and we all know he said shit hole and they mountains said they didn't say shadow
the homeland security person perjured herself said you didn't know they were white people and norway
his doctor lies for the six foot three grow and edge
he's thirty nine pounds got to lose a little way but he's lying as as well
the corporations are doing at walmart
says thanks to the tax cut and then we find a sad thing to the tax cut that they're raising wages the economy is great they have to compete
a vast right wing conspiracy it is i mean i feel like he's got them all in a sunken place
i mean
this fascinating with he said people are scared to leave like like charlton pincers that people white couple of republicans are those thirteen kids or something
i'm not but you know i know but it seems apt analogy know why are they have a
and the fact that they would twisted and turned into like the woman the norway thing built to norway thing she can understand that it's made of a mostly white people let me know there's no way this running around
that language on my show i i can
i can understand i
it's a function of two things it seems to me
it's both he has to lie because he needs to cover up what's actually happening them number one no one i know and they have to follow they have to follow because it's a cult and he's the cult leader and in a tried and in a try if you stand up against the leader who everybody is supporting then you ostracized
and it's amazing you think washington to be a little bit more grown up than this but they want and it's so scary because because now the know a guy is the one that their me
really scary know he starts more mainstream the latest one is this hawaii threat really shocked me
go there around that time
and it's over this said well you know it was obama wouldn't be but it now that president stable genius
she's threatening north korea mean that really happen and the names this is getting mainstream change by i see this david french you know we've had him on the show he's a guy that bill kristol want to run last time he's in the national review he says you have to understand that the odds are overwhelming that you'll survive and initial
blast that's a little league live below the knee have three heads but you know
he says it to hollywood miss that a strike will vaporize and entire american city much less the suburbs
we're out in the sticks we won't even notice it with this is scary stuff and forty six percent of republicans want war with north korea
this is what i worry about when the funny then becomes the not we've always live with nukes right i mean that was what the iraq war allegedly was a pout remember we live with nukes
we've we've struggled with nukes with iran i once asked to
the last president what was he is well kept him awake at night the center pakistan's they
everywhere i think the difference is that we don't have some on in control now that we just to have the composure con and reticence to handle a crisis and so therefore we so much more frightened and we have reason to be my guild and
one of the moment
when this went from unthinkable to think about yeah we're moving into think a bullet i don't want to never seen anything like this remember how people were scared of reagan and that seems gets now admit yeah
how can people be afraid this single time for this the same time there is a dictatorship with access to nuclear weapons that could possibly attack the mainland the united states and it's not like they are out of yeah yeah the like maria and entirely so little to do that
it is so when they ask about any nose on the down
voting now okay were exciting live tv
so emigration so it looks like it's a base vs base right
the democrats know there's a bunch of the running for president already
and this is an issue
you know some people would say this is what losers democrats election identity politics
you would say that yes i mean i don't think i think really dicey for the democrats i think if they shut down the government because they want to protect the dream is you some people will call illegal immigrants and because they want to prevent the wall
they're going to look really bad in middle america they going to look like they'd rather shot the government down don't get serious on immigration control and that's not a good position for the democrats to be in here but i get tired of the democrats being afraid to play hardball the way republicans play
mitch mcconnell i think scully it was murdered by that pillow like a whole year right he was day absolute held out for a year
gossage that's playing hardball and by the way on our support then how important is that supreme court pick how yeah
well as they weren't afraid to do that
i don't know how hard overseas horrible it escalates you know like a nuclear conflict and at some point whoever is in power is going to have to govern the whole country someone at some point is going to have to bring this country together and unfortunately those kind of tactics only deep in the divide and make everything harder and that's what i'm concerned about
they're getting polarize on both sides the bases a race is less and less in the middle and reasonable debates are now being swamped by personality cult by reality television
the player
is there was not one day and eight years that republicans said i will work with barack obama not one there was one
i know but but is it going to help us just go back at it and the same way know
to do the same thing but you can learn how to fight properly for the things and important but like knowing for the dreamers let's go dreamers how about undocumented americans which is what they really are i mean people have been here for their whole lives would have them do
you know i mean
look i'm for them staying too but i see a lot of footage on t v of people crying
and i think the addresses this is what you're talking about i think this is what people go well this is the democrats this is what this is what they care about people crying i got me my y is no excuse me for asking a really personal question but why not give him the wall
the pete sake why not first my and tell you want because it seemed like these it did not feasible in which case it's not going to get built right it's going to take way longer than even to trump terms give it to him not only that but when you give it to him you get the dreamers you get more people to stay here who are already illegal you can use that leverage on the other issue
and you can credentials yourselves with america by saying we're not against border control and did that would work in he knew what he wanted the he doesn't know what he wants all he all he knows what he wants is true but it's a narcissistic sociopath he's only interested in a feeding his ego is so there's that
i interject from the here
if somebody would actually injured
introduce facts into this an immigrant i'm not a awesome and onwards
we are
weird to the to the west of canada on this usually when an issue in canada people say oh you know their health care system or i pod or game they're always have the last of us good liberal kind of canada allows twenty eight percent of people in through family we allow two thirds they have a point system and
canada it's much trickier it's it's that would trump with gold chain migration family it's education you speak english or french work experience you have a job offer age adaptability
he admitted they many unemployment skills america irritating percent canada fifty eight percent build all with rules for immigration that i'm a little more cynical about the money that fighting against adnan and here's what the real fight is but that maybe what they're fighting against the republicans are
fighting for as a fill immigrants especially low skilled workers are actually democratic voters and with a demo got to do and are importing voters
it's job they say that themselves you look like why is it really doesn't matter
why is it a crazy
to say we want anybody from anywhere in the world but you can really contribute something we don't have the games i wish he would say we had an old dungeons don't make to
i like this diversity lottery he goes on about why does not exist i mean do we have to have their own every single country they represent representation the it's crazy why not just get rid of it this so this is so easy to deal with could aid three minutes but the base is the bidding this from have put it in another way the
public are seeming to betray their own eat those an ideology and the things that used to always stand for they used to be that party of hey you can come from anywhere and you can have the american dream hear the republicans held that up as a badge of honor in their sleeves and they're going against that they're saying no you only can be a certain station in come here
the upward mobility has to start here it can't stay here and he says of you individually
let's get some good news though trump had his physical
any is the healthiest man whatever to live
you know which is the kitchen he such a city road
right
but that the person
jurors who is done in such great shape is chris christie
from my home state in new jersey and he just retired as the governor and you know here in the comedy business
tap when a guy like chris christie retires it is it's a very dark
we have been dining out on his fat jugs for a long as
and we will have more and that's why we put together this little shrimp
someone as the poll chris christie aside and tell him the lap band goes on the inside
mccain things megabytes is the secret service code name for chris christie andre three thousand
first time he's ever won our lands why he's caused a few
it's been a long time since we've seen as balls
one thing he's good at it is clogging major artery
only exercise prosperous begets is pumping the nacho cheese dispenser
first birthday is handing out candy wrapper
the reason we only get the grid want to hear their skeletons in his closet of cow

they said center united on the director the food labour research center at u c berkeley please welcome sorrow german
the same way
you are so great the first time to have your bag
and more relevant the numbers on the things you're talking about you've always been a great tribute and flow of the restaurant workers of america let's first before we get into that connection to the harassment
around let's talk about tips because this is very relevant to a country it's always debating minimum wage
this is one of those areas where america
pretty unique right
we still do it by tips
where are so unique because actually tipping originated in theater yeah it was like aristocrats giving something the surface and vessels when it first came to the states rich americans brought it and actually it was around the time of slavery around emancipation and the restaurant industry at that time demanded the right to hire newly freed slaves not pay them anything and let them live on
customer tips and so the idea of a nothing wage then zero now two dollars comes from slavery comes from the idea that mostly black workers could or nothing and live on tips and now we here we are one hundred and fifty years later with a minimum wage of two dollars and thirteen cents an hour and millions of women across america living on tips
industry were like one hundred twelve people in the country went out of eleven people right now totals thirty million workers own yeah
tell us why it is connected to harassment when there was no tipping system that situation would get better
you know right now seventy percent and the millions of women are millions of people across america who live on tips who worked on the tip minimum wage of two and three and four dollars and are seventy percent of them are women and they live working at i hop and an apple bees and olive garden and their median wage including tips is about nine bucks an hour they suffer from three times the
poverty rate of the rest of us workforce but worst of all they are having to put up with anything and everything from customers no matter how they touch them or treat them or talk to them because that's where their income is coming from that's how they're getting paid that's how they're feeding their families not from a wage the wages so low it's going to taxes so they're having have drummers your her the customers are
harassing them but but get this the customers are harassing them because they live on tips but because are living on tips their manager says dress more sexy show more cleavage were tied are living in order to make more money in tips would you believe when we were doing was only a theory it's just fun go to an invitation exactly well not just that the coworker and management exactly well speaking of hotel
when we get out this research would you believe the industry named a new segment a recognized segment it's called the restaurant the restaurant is a new segment in the restaurant industry and it's not just hooters and tilted kilt and twin peaks it's olive garden and apple these and danny's where women are told show your breasts but the
thing is full
no but show more breast cancer
oh yeah
how do you the number of workers we've had from denny's who tell my boss tells me go home and dress more sexy and schumacher schumer cleavage and come back so you can make more money in tips for good
and nobody else does that just as it was because of on the totem pole too old or longer her oh i mean things that chimps on the unknown addressing the situation they won't journal seems to me
the tubes is it doesn't sense of was good service
it's a way in which it cost him within reward good service well there's a don't do that with lots of other servers and survives you know your doctor your lawyer your teacher mean these are hard working your with many of them are immigrants by the way really hard working and i rent but there are we don't tip anybody else is the only industry where the
actual bosses say we shouldn't have to pay or on workers you the customer should pay our workers for it was i've read recently about a lot of these high levels chefs who went down in the mood to
it's interesting it's a theme that runs through it for me was that when they weren't harassing they were screaming yeah well as we both the mood to the first thing that always comes to a minors i hate boys
of any kind

wondering what do you what other industries you think have not been talked about you were told me about restaurant yeah i mean farm workers face this on the job of workers face on the job pretty much in every industry women who don't have power and you know they don't want to have hundred and i'm going to get in trouble for pursuing
cop
pokemon cop
every woman i've ever known has the story about you know well they lacked hours day has exactly ultimate power but when you change that dynamic you know their seven states for example in our industry that got rid of the lower wage for tipped workers and they have half the rate of harassment as the forty three states that have this lower wage
and it's because in california which is one of the seven states a woman doesn't have to put up with anything and everything from her boss she gets a full wage from her boss you know
she doesn't put up with everything from the customer and that's why thanks to the me to moment new york is about to follow governor cuomo actually just announced thanks to leadership by women
that we're actually going to get get rid of that lower wage for tipped workers in new york and to keep the tubes absolutely well that one was on worried about i think you should be own reward your winter tips and is going on there is a great and suddenly actually ten better in california than most other states but the thing is
workers women get a wage that grown and get an action
it's a little like making someone job
it's a little
it's it's it's an anachronism loses let this one go
i'll give it a
eric schmidt everybody wants to the new they'll go a baby
and i had virtually to new to that would be fine as long as again
a weapon a you know i have one thing i have a people love when you give the moment it
what it is jay
there is one prefer going to do it was one version of this will work to make a personal pollute to join
maloney of drawn because you know she had to live through the hollywood actress
top
the reports of known team accusers
donald trump now yeah no stormy daniels
come on millennia
this is your me to moment

said value for money with divorce really
i realize that you would be welcomed our in our moment man
would change a lot of the fact of the manor is a trump trump is just such to me
here are you getting this know know the thing when he's finished you know being president went over that as americans are going to say me too

is a restaurant owner
he's trying to pocket his worker
the money exactly and now he's proposing a rule that would make ten the property owners rather than workers so he's trying to given self another mountainous yeah and he's talk about harassment when he walks into a restaurant and women recommend retina
so why do all these
white women fifty two to forty three vote for him though
well that's a good question yes
i mean a lot of our folks restaurant workers feel really really disillusioned disgusted disengage from the political system in general from both parties they really like nobody's been standing up for them a lot of them voted for trump because they thought he didn't represent the establishment and a lot of them are telling us they are disappointed he does rep
present the establishment he represents the one percent they're not finding he's standing up to the the last year has shown strong gains for working class wages in this country for twenty years will rub that signals a little bomb us

but do you think that's what he's voters a going to think you guys keep talking about his voters like there's some modern mean it they can now giving him a forty percent higher than it had in a very long time he's gained everyday since the attacks go in through the economy's booming people
oh trust me people are dumb enough to think well he's it in the atheists recovery when it really does help people with low and always does have a very and he will turn around and said don't think about the i did it and you know circumstantially that's when it began to happen that's my concern in terms of real acting trump the the economy is working very
much more stable to the very people the working classes it be working now but i've seen this movie before what happens when the republicans juice up the economy just like they did with the tax could remember what comes next the crash
no i thought it would have been mostly more the war is virtually or usually helps the economy
that's what he'll do need it was the was interesting hears that this is a real time to and every other major part of the developing world is growing together there's a lot of momentum behind this current growth rate now more the new thing i'm sure you may be right i'm certainly getting out of the marquis pretty soon
retirement savings but it may not happen the it didn't happen it's been eight years now
the gold will also cover the an indie band it's not it's not happening for everyone we have the highest rate of income inequality since the gilded age people are struggling across the country i was in michigan in minnesota this week people are struggling that wage of two and three dollars is not going up so some economy donating really were som
that or lot well
all going wrong you know wages are not going on and look at the data level good the day
there's more branches than any other store the dollar store they have like twenty seven thousand dollar stores and dollar generals more than anything else i use it
oh you don't think they'll build the the appearance whether some people are not making it as you say you know but i have to agree with andrew in the sense that the appearance is for the most part that there is a robust economy right now in his or his own home but history has shown that we do not throw out a president during a strong economy the
he turns yeah there's a chance but i'm one of those people that think from get reelected the strong economy and his personality is tertiary at best
it's what i know i don't like in my mouth as states
i don't like to believe are no no but i have to agree with personality this is all about personal it is a cult of personality that's what we found out in michael's book when steve ban and thought he could go up against donald trump he thought he could actually steal the trunk voter because he had the ideology when the trump voters like you're not a star
we like this guy with he's got the plane and the hot why he's the president he's the star steve steve than it was like come on guys who are get outta here
hey guys
stuff
they don't care when sarah huckabee colonel say they comes out in lies everybody out
i don't know
turner said it's very day
says the earth is flat and she comes as a now i'm a liberal ideas twisted is where he says
i hear you better result
reality tv star yes he shouldn't be there yes but he has tapped into certain yeah trade immigration and low wages as as saying that one in this election the last election and they refused but the fuse that civil can't see the you just said mark from yeah but it doesn't matter what the issue is he has proved that because
if i told you two years ago that the conservatives in this country
would think russia was their friend and the b i years their enemy these people i'm sorry republicans i know i'm hard on you sometimes but their sheep and it's so easy to drive
it
frighteningly easy to drive them to a different meadow that bill cute
i mean by law enforcement that was always there thing you could never say a bad word about the f b i the c i a another a hotbed better liberals and now they're corrupt and we don't like them but we're foot see with russia

maine and training as his hard bait and he has handled the african american the up to two

monday and whenever this holiday happens all the republicans they talk in such glowing terms about dr king
march with and like what would they be saying about him on fox news if he was allowed well we know with a radical how they would have treated him article would be the kind word well we know we saw how they treated him when he was alone which is where he's alive right now
the
democrats say them
surely they would look at him and see this christian fundamentalists this person is driven by religion more than anything else and he would have no role in the current democratic coalition well the democrats in dixie i'll bet they were more races it is anybody
martin luther king would do it here now right now i'm you know it's crazy idea that crew democrats be like who is this faith
hey what do when you're getting the democrats aren't atheist the
is this long
on an issue that i've done all the heavy lifting
democrats are perfectly fine to say they're christian almost all of them how about how he respects him now let's talk about the present most presidents you know as i'm not even as a true eat it but what they do is respect they do dave service and okay that he chews i played the white sport ross

father long hi

sadly no role in twenty eight team it's more important than ever that we all keep laughing


nothing is funny people are trying to take over the world and we can't let them

which is why i originally posted this picture of me pulling and al franken
sleeping bob sank
it's a joke a joke about another joke
so i'm just saying here at the beginning of the year if something like this is to receive you don't watch

i'm also going to admit something right here up front that may influence what i'm about to say tonight
i have a penis
and why admit that having one does predisposed the human being aggressive and over sexed i don't concede that it makes me automatically wrong about everything and i say that as a true supporter of the me to movement ivan or black during the golden globes i was home watching tv but still
i wore black but that was also morning the ability to think rationally
i'm down with me too i'm not down with me coffee isn't
something is way off when senator kirsten jill a brand can go unchallenged saying when we start having to talk about the differences between sexual harassment and sexual assault and unwanted groping you're having the wrong conversation
can we just be having an additional conversation

hanley only have one thought now i get it that al franken had to become road kill on the zero tolerance highway
a highway it seems only democrats have to drive on
what do liberals really want to become the distinction dinners the people who can't tell or don't want to see a difference between assault in a van and a back rub by the water cooler
masturbation is normal and healthy but not in the park
giving up on the idea that even bad things have degrees that is as dumb as embracing the idea of alternative facts

i get it when trump side doesn't want to talk he only knows eighty eight words
but we're supposed to be the conversation people just just requires weighing things that's why lady justice is holding a scale and not a sawed off shotgun
senator joe lebron went on to say you need to draw a line in the sand and say none of it is ok
yes agreed
but we can't walk and chew gum any more we can agree that groping and rape or both unacceptable
and one is worse

apparently not because when matt damon said there's a difference between patting someone on the but and rape or child molestation right
liberal twitter responded know there isn't jason bourne yesterday

you think he ate a lot of shit in the martian

yeah
many driver responded by saying you don't get to tell women that because some guy only showed them their penis their pain isn't as great as a woman who was raped
this is madness no woman in the world she actually had to pick would choose rape over merely seeing a penis so why do we all have to pretend many drivers statement is noble and matt damon is crazy
we are losing the thread back to thinking itself
you know the declaration of independence starts with the words we hold these truths to be self evident self evident as some things are such obvious indisputable no brainer years that we start from that point
assuming role generally on the page that shit is measurably chemically different than china


but it seems that now building blocks basic building blocks of thought like there are facts
and things have degrees are being tossed aside mike pence and isis are both homophobic but mike doesn't throw game and off the roof so he is better
this isn't that hard
that hard i know it
because we do it with other stuff every millennial i know thinks it's ridiculous that the government lists marijuana as a schedule one drug along with lsd and heroin
because it is ridiculous because things have degrees there are four degrees of murder three degrees of burns six degrees of kevin bacon
show you
