when experience over dallas every second counts see the life administering the locks on learn how to get the locks on a visit and that path
back backlash
it's paid for with pennsylvania taxpayer dollars
welcome to h b a passed from h b o maintenance real time with him
jack

right




why
because
marriage
were three republicans found a little backbone this week
we are going to have an investigation
bring the investigation by the the i was going to last week so put that on your fucking calendar

the two ladies in the senate the republicans and just like of arizona
they this
it has turned around because he was confronted when he was getting on the elevator
what better that
who had the good that you're you're telling me right now
me when you're telling me that i thought that it matter

that guy take it in the elevator like that
fiance say sister kick
oh
oh and then they tried cornering lindsey graham but but he got away because he's familiar with the back door


republicans up a lot of trouble with sausage party a republican
so you don't they did they hired a female prosecutor to ask the questions to professor ford
a mobster thinks there's a bomb under his car he makes his wife started
they're doing
but her testimony when someone's being real
shows it reads even conservatives had to admit it was compelling and credible it was so compelling and so credible during a red cabbage tried to turn up the music that

but this was a very different bread cabinet he came out swinging like his penis at a college party
well that's that's that's why there's a sexy happened so fast in this last week remembered the beginning they would get a second accuser
also rather credible who said this was it yeah
he was at a party there and she was drunk and he dropped his pants in front of her and exposed themselves i mean imagine you open your eyes and seeing that dick
and then he pulls out his penis


this was a totally different bread cabin on than the one tested running like a week before totally different angry volatile bitter belligerent because nothing says i'm not capable of violent assault like flying into an unhinged rage
good
it gets that supreme court will now be a bookish law nerds and the hulk
but really if that was a divorce hearing she would have gotten the kids that's how i

why did cabinet suddenly act that way because trout
told him to
trump didn't like that he was being make and you no good bread he likes bad bread he wants someone in his image so we gave him a whiny little bitch lasted

know what we have the evidence is year book and everything this choir boy yeah cabinet know
i split my high school years concentrating on my my friendships and church
that church you know what defense doesn't work so great any more i can't be a sex criminal i'm a catholic

it's like saying i couldn't have met russians i was it trump tower
going out about it as many friendships with women is helped many women and supported them and help them with their careers
and he also says he's a big supporter of me to in fact when someone is ordering drink your he says give me too

i don't know if we could say he is definitely a rapist i think that's too far but is a fucking liar and a drunk
definitely
but even in this testimony he mention beer all lot
lot i like their do you like beer i just finished be are you have any
i thought he was going to write out on a clydesdale
half of this year book entries
drinking getting shit stacey
didn't keg club and rounds club and gets on the court skip the rope give them a toga this guy
but he might not might not get on that's at least a glimmer of hope

wait you can look at kids in the eye and say america is not a country that puts a predator on the supreme court in the white house sure but not theirs

looking good for nail the grass tyson

i know you're not for this guy but be nice it is one of the most influential person around today is the former white house chief strategist for president trumps stay ban and his own

well it took a lot of property they get the audience to be that nice
but i'm going to say to you what i always say that conservatives when they come here first of all thank you i appreciated it says while humans why the republicans are in power and we have none hillary clinton never came here maybe she'd be president of and more consonant victim yet so
and i know that
you had a little event there at the new yorker they had a festival and don't want to read mouth i'm glad bowls quote because they were going to interview you and then you are disinvited i've been disinvited many times by the way it's a good club
and malkin glad well said call me old fashioned but i would have thought that the festival of ideas boost to expose the audience to ideas
the only invite your friends over it's called a dinner party what are your thoughts on that while they changed me for david remnick chase me for a year to be honest pond kiss and he came to me and said hey we be honored if you were in this festival ideas i said fine i don't want compensation but i like going in the hostel audiences with tough interviewers i mean i do very little concerned
median do c n n b c
the economists i go to the toughest places tough as tough as interviewers and say hey no holds barred roster audiences let's get it on and again that's why the republicans are in power so let me ask you about a does sharp and sharpens the blade it does let me pick your brain about the democrats because you're a strategist and you got your boy elected but no one said that could happen
second sofa like that
just just showed up
you know and i don't want to get on this but first you were crazy about sarah palin and then you are crazy but donald trump i think you look for more ons who are empty vessels

every single person and it administration has called in an idiot
that's what you look for i get it no
by the way by the way it's will get into as you get into his economic war china it you see what he's doing to realign the world's economy look that it didn't go to harvard kennedy school does he speak in the vernacular of the elite to this world know he speaks in a very plain spoken vernacular but he's incredibly small hideous i'm not it's not send texts that i'm worried about
his press conference this week he says crazy shit that no one thinks is true you don't think but now but here's the power the press conference no other gutless republican would go into that lion's down for an hour and twenty minutes and take all the incoming he stood up for calvin i'm more than a these guys did and i think it's one of the things that and power
kavanagh to go into on thursday and to take on the democrats have trump had not done that
the way he did have some he did have some answers that we're not the standard answer is but look he's got he's got know of has a standard on it's about reality he has his own how divorced from reality

they must have done your nail digress their work and are you do to fight against the anti intellectual movement in america i i blamed some of that on the the attitude that so many intellectuals had towards those who were not as smart as they were
we have a long history of just smart people discounting the views and opinions and feelings of those who are not as well educated and that can really piss off an entire demographic so at least eyes and educator i try to not distinguish one for i just bring everybody with you together to empower
their critical thinking that they're other people don't wanna learn know you have to admit you sound like the teacher who say be students don't want to learn rather that in your own teaching habits as failing okay
you can't let everybody off the hook it's like everybody's a good person and try harder with them i mean i i don't i can't as an educator i can accept
donald trump something you know i can
i mean that's that's because it's like guys and dolls and tibet
anybody
don't bet you one thousand
not teams donald trump that the stealth bomber is not literally invisible
wilmington at least of all people are thinking that then teacher is handing someone information to replace information that they had that is false correct and aspect of teaching but it's not the fundamental dimension of it it's getting a person to understand why the
thoughts are wrong to begin with and then it's their own epiphany good luck
yeah i don't think he's not going to have an epiphany because anyway
i would say doubt
innovations in science and technology are the engines of tomorrow's economy
and they will drive our health our wealth and our security if you invest in science
that will be the country that you always wanted to be here say that's one the abolishing obama
yeah that's the forest and the thought about me yeah
it's not anti intellectual as and i think it's anti science anti empirical true fact that they hit the major danger because because
what science is and how and why it works were taught is a sexual effects and spit it back in the test and you move onto your next class science is a way of carrying the world it's a way of knowing what is true and what is not and establishing the objective reality in which we
almost function if you don't have those capabilities and you but gain power oh my gosh it's the beginning of the end of uninformed democracy here is a large chunk of this country that is not
interested in objective reality again
and then not critical thinkers as well and you have to release them winning in our and sometimes i watch out
oh boy
i have landed on
he just says bellies and okay
one of my two books
that are on the best seller list right now has been on the best for seventy one weeks
having tide waters of trump books that have come and gone how can i get my god i can be
science book on that so that gives me hope somebody cares about it

how many copies because of the solar cell it's highly variable so just about how many copies
scientology best yeah i know the total number is not what the hell me how many copies the book has in total yeah a million can change a million know yeah have a country of three hundred and twenty million okay so it's still not a lot of other people meaningless we were other people in other countries read english yeah i know but
we're talking about america
i want to showcase kind of sixty translations also and i don't a well but it doesn't about america
it is in a sea of trump books they come back and forth should be going to talk about popular books it's sitting there in the middle of one words book on fear and and at all there's always a small percentage of people who will be bright but million
i'm like in the number million yeah i like it too but it's one three hundredth of the country
april ryan
now the science that was man
do you think we should bring back the equal time rule yes
yes and what is that equal well first of all let me break it down in science
hi my brother
so say
are you a that tender line on
oh okay so cellphone for you so those of you don't know i remember when president trump the in canada trump was calling on morning joe when he liked joe sky as i do either
her other networks while you didn't hear the other candidates colony they could have because the equal time rule is gone it's gone
yeah if he if he they can have done it is well if there was a will if there was the world still in effect right
president trump would be on they would have to give be equal time to other canonized that is no longer effect and that's one of the reasons why do you want down shot one that free advertisement
each other then he only my question is bill why didn't the other candidates have the chutzpah to go in and say around and let me do that it was a scan donald trump played the streets on he won and you're right they were into this does down there are were for this this is not how sit for the plane the street game
wow
evelyn how should america deal with russia post trump oh my god
if there is a post drum i mean i think the way that his administration that is to say everyone that hand and our government is it didn't address that yeah it is firmly spelling out to russia that if they continue with this really horrible behavior you know invading other countries occupying than messing with our elections continuing to mess with our sense
poisoning and killing people in other countries
munich i can gone on it there's a list of like twenty things if they keep doing all that stuff but mostly are kidding man mostly our election and much were america and ukraine and happy but i don't care as much about ukrainians i do about fucking with our election i'm windsor major that's like way up here and then the rest
sorry about the coin
that's a yak on our country yes but ukraine is also an attack america and is max's as it's an attack on the right of a country to say i'm a sovereign country we sovereign ukrainian people want to be associated with nato and the european news and the west and we want to be democratic and we don't want this guy in the kremlin telling us how to live our lives
you know the answer to your question as wouldn't and troops for it but we should be stronger and we didn't occur to train them and i think so where do we do so we need to do more of the from stuff because they won't cooperate with us until we are sufficiently across the board consistently from all the way up to the president was cooperating russian and american ass
astronauts in when they should get the current
they got the orange out
they will see okay claim without casualties are going
over there threaten the flow
i will tell you that i can't go too far on this
email or that
dr needle
them that they aren't they are that it is a troubled world up in space with russia and china i'll just leave it goes base station is one thing and commercial space is one thing to lead morality into the future
jos joke
yeah
max what do you think people are fascinated why do you think people are first and that with doomsday just dopey and futures lot i mean i think there there's always this fear especially in america because i think there's something very deep about our isolationism and were always remember we most of us came from someplace else
and we escaped a lot of us escaped hardship our ancestors escape hardship to come here and there's always a subconscious fear that what we escaped will one day find us and i think that's why there's always this terror particularly because when times are even good you have an explosion of post apocalyptic movies tv
video games so many movies about after the bomb went off right and it's horrible and scary because it is a movies do come true it's always there and if i can go back to what you said about russia i think something happened recently that we need to be very aware of is that the russians just rioted because couldn't
raised the level of retirement when you can retire i think it was sixty five average russian man dies at sixty six and what that did is it exploded the myth that russians will be able to sacrifice for the motherland and pay any price and that's been the idea that oh no no we can take the pain
russia will be invincible and that's bullshit we can hurt them we can make them bleed and the russians have been fighting in the gray zone they've used economic warfare information warfare cyber warfare we don't do any of that we used to do air right and it's time to get back in the game and it's time to make i've bleed
