
some news times ah michael horrible nice is the
today
this weekend at the opening ceremonies of the two thousand and eighteen winter olympics one hundred and sixty nine cleanly dressed athletes marched out in drab grey coats and bleeds competing not for our country but under the name olympic athlete
from russia
russia
in the last winter
to on them that punished

it's one of your marriage well
mr president
members of a
ladies and gentlemen the summer of two thousand and seven and five them are prudent it personally lobbying to bring the winter olympics to russia for the first time or becca release is an investigative reporter at the times he gives and passion pitch
sang so she has a unique place
all this you sure you can enjoy your flair in spring day this is the place for them but up in the mountains
i went skiing six or seven weeks ago and i know a real snows guaranteed this is where the you want the game to be our national police do you is
they chose of torture is are the best years he even seeks to connect the origins of the olympic games to sochi the ancient greeks believed their own it lots of centuries ago the last tiles at the games had been in the country was in nineteen eighty in moscow games that the united states had boycott
middle of cold war yes
they point out that us the break up over the soviet union
russia has lost all sports the and you in the mountains
so this would be a russia's first time hosting the games as russia would rather than the soviet union and the first time that the winter games had ever come to the region and to show be happy headed to see you in russia and in such it as our guests so it sounds like this would be a very big deal
for a post cold war russia gets and one more special privilege north face it jumps aprons
so after the sales pitch and office lobbying what happens
russia olympic committee
auto
announcing that the twenty second olympic winter games are over forty our orbit to the city or structure
olympic officials grant more prudent his way
the two thousand and fourteen winter games can be alive look at the olympic torch burning bright the heart of sochi russia wins the most medals of any country at the olympics or thirty three medals thirteen of them going
when saddam was team russia coming out on top of the by one really buy at the lawn cross country skiing a one two three gold silver and bronze they completed the podium in the men's cross country ski bob's play
said
so she is hailed as a huge sticks pass rush as an analyst getting a big new park after the olympic games and searching country is giving a mercedes to every one of us athletes who metals are in the games thirty three luxury cars for those meddling still aren't old enough to drive
their cars come what the driver russia celebrating its olympic high for the better part of thousand and fourteen but that same year and explosive report heads
this was you really just a part of her her husband vitali and are small son robert a german broadcaster comes out with the report they don't feel safe anymore in their native russian
by a former russian runner and her husband who worked for russia's drug testing agency i wanted to fight don't green
i wanted to makes for its
cleaner
more honest better the documentary says nothing about surgery but what this couple said is that all athletes in russia and open russia has been systematically dumping for years and that these plots extend to the top at the government is involved and dumping it athletes and
in extorting money from leads to keep quiet about their drug violations cannot achieve results that you're getting kidding
in russia
dopey and this is how it's done than russia
so those claims in that documentary prompt international regulators to react
there is no member twenty fifteen russian officials athletes and coaches are embroiled in a dope being scared and i am in switzerland covering this press conference that is announcing the results and then investigation that looked into what that german documentary had reported the commission
castigated allegations made a job a documentary last december which accused rusher of states opposite don't pick and indeed that investigation concluded that there is systematic dropping in russia in the swiss sunshine a dark day for the sport about politics the while are
has a core programmer have suspended from or graphics competition it's pretty opaque
but there's this name that keeps coming up of this person who investigators tried to talk to who didn't cooperate with the investigation and he seems pretty central to whatever was going on and his name is doctor agenda
who is doctor a off grigory read chunk of is the director of russians national anti dope in laboratory he is the top chemist who works with russia's athlete
to test their urine and blood to make sure that they are not taking any band performance enhancing drugs so i emailed him an address that i found online and to my surprise he not only replied but he engaged and he says i know so much it's going to
to be unbelievable when i come out with my full story it's incredible what i know and the levels of involvement of my government wow
and he sends an email
at what would have been three or four am moscow time and i commented on the time and he said well i live in los angeles now her he came to l a
because he was fearful for his life in moscow because two people who worked in russia's anti dumping efforts and sports died abruptly one of those people was his close friend and colleague nikita come i have and he had been in the middle of writing a book about his life and was planning on a tell all of what
had done in his work sure kinda feared that he was going to get killed guess and he feels that if he goes out there fully with his whole story then he is better protected because he will be seen as a public figure who version of offense has been established in the new york times
he thinks that by telling a story and becoming a public figure
he would make it too risky for anyone in russia especially and one type of the government to come after him and to do harm exactly so it's spring of two thousand and sixteen i fly to los angeles and he says
everything you saw him that german documentary everything that was announced as a result of that follow up investigation it's all true huge cheating across nearly every sport going back years and dictated by the government
what life is oh and by the way guess what we just did and jay
so over the course of three days in l a he tells this amazing story he details with pride
this inconceivable sounding scheme
that he helped design
no no got old
so weak
so it it will go
well youth can do in sport
states also be so it's a little
and just be clear the russian government the government of of her claim is involved in this or aware of how involved are they read chunk of says but this is all stemming from britain he is saying that he is taking his orders directly from his boss who is a deputy sports minister
and he's meeting also not infrequently with a minister in pollutants government who reported to president bush himself
to they're asking the leading authority and the country in stopping building to to start over
that's exactly right they turned to the person who has knowledge of everything that is prohibited of all of the way is that those prohibited substance as are caught in laboratories and they're saying to him what can we do to enhance our athletes performance and give them that extra edge that they might need while not
on
he spent all their lives in essence ages
see did you kill it so disgusting
sixty minutes
if you kill cheat to nineteen and is
whoa eighty for also you should we host
you
two in the months before the games
what stock much and cough actually do so he immediately snaps about his work and he experimented with drugs he talks to the top purveyors he sources steroids and he begins to stay this is the for me i am devising for russia top
olympian he creates a cocktail and he calls the duchess cocktail duchess cocktail and he produced is it in mass and handed off to russians sports officials and he begins to notice some people hanging around his lab in moscow who are particularly in
interrupt ed in the squat glass bottles that are the gold standard for drug testing samples and keeping them secure in international competitions they have these interlocking metal team they're like jaws that close and they are widely hailed as tam
for proof you cannot get into this glass bottle went to the field without breaking its cap in a telltale way and he begins to see that these people who he says work with russia's federal security services are collecting hundreds of these little metal rings sit around and
neck of the glass bottles they're particularly interested in how can one get into these bottles he says you can't it's like fort knox they're impossible to penetrate and yet they keep collecting these rings or scrutinizing these bottles and lo and behold the is federal security service staffers huh
have devised a way to get into these bottles undetected when i first time so the all
because
believes this is safe to the plan comes together in which it's determined that read chunk of is going to distribute his cocktail top athletes will take it and they will substitute out their dirty urine for clean year and that they will say
stockpile month
head of the olympics
while they're clean while they're not using any band drugs
your your goes of the push of the tamil off the solo so that we will then freeze at stockpile pilot transported from moscow to snow
at the olympics when nobody is watching their urine samples that will have been spontaneously collected through the games will be substituted out surreptitiously using the federal security service which has devised a way to break into the glass bottles
so how does all this
once the olympics start insulting and only fourteen
chunk of land and he inspect his lab the lab he's going to oversee and he also inspects this building that is adjacent to his lab that is run by the federal security service that has all of this clean urine stockpiled and he has a spreadsheet
it has been sent him by his boss the deputy minister
just before the games begin with the final last of which top russian olympians will be drinking his cocktail and will need to have their urine and substitute here
lease or is
the essence of your limited release those are all grown and then the games
lots
what happens if he has an office in this laboratory and nightly he waits for a staff of around one hundred people to leave the lab or tiny these are international chemists experts flown in from all over the world
and he changes out of his lab code he put on a russian national team sweatshirt and he heads downstairs and goes into a storage closet
that he and his team have rigged up to be his shadow laboratory and he takes the locked bottle that he can't break into and he passed as it through a small sort of hand sized hole in the wall
to a member of the federal security service on the other side on the other side who takes bad bottle and outside of run chunk of sideline manages to get its top off and he passes it back in then dumped out the steroids last year and rinse the
bottle and he also receives through this small hole in the wall that very same athletes clean urine stockpiled months earlier and he puts it in to the right battle and he makes sure that this the urine sample matches
and so he uses things as basic in crude as table salt an instant coffee grounds to make sure that the year in matches
the sample that was given by that athlete that very day
as a cool so i eat with all due to the unions and so is a week or a see or for groups or instant of it
see but
he's doing chemical experimentation on each and every one of these every night but that is exactly where exceptionally hard work it is and he's exhausted is complaining he's getting very little sleep he is working not just during the day in running this huge testing operation and
rather than have his day conclude when the normal drug testing and for the day it ramps up overnight
take the dirty or and pass it through the hole in the long get the bottle back down bout the dirty harry swap in the clean urine stop for a cigarette have a drink of whiskey tend to another sample tend to another sample tend to another sample yet
and he did this every single night for nearly two weeks
i mean
it's it's why of by day he's legitimately testing russian and non russian athletes for signs of dropping by night is systematically subverting that system and eliminating any signs of dropping but only for russian athletes correct so doctor or chunk of tells you to
incredible story
bowser reaction
we were incredulous it was a hard thing to believe
sort of major international scandal breaking today over to allege state sponsored bring scheme for pro russians athletes to go during the soldier gives what was the reaction to your story what was the result of that the president of the international olympic committee calls this
story if true and unprecedented level of criminality
and he says it's a huge attack on everything the olympic stand for but we need to see a thorough investigation and find out if indeed this was carried off and so the investigation happens
born out of russia says that russia operated a state sponsor drug program that benefited athletes who can that investigation confirm everything road chunk of says the international olympic committee has open investigations at the top russian sports officials and may borrow them along with all russian athlete it consults with him frequently but at all
also draws on other witness and scientific and forensic analysis it inspects these very bottles these glass bottles that had rational libyans urine in them and it finds microscopic scratches on the next obvious glass bottles were these in
locking metal jaws had clearly been manipulated to allow the cap off in a way that had gone undetected
the committee is suspended was too
we'll clean the russian else lives will be able to participate under strict conditions
the winter games through two thousand eighty
from the international olympic committee saying rather bray blankly and there was an unprecedented attack on the olympics
accusing the russian athletes and the search games so essentially being dirty and they are not punishing them in the next olympic games five banning russian athletes they say clean athletes will be allowed to compete but not under the russian flag though have to be neutral all of this no doubt getting him
reaction in moscow
the story that you're telling here
is a story about russia on the sport stage but i'm struck by how much it reminds us of russia on the political stage as well
in both cases the same country is taking extraordinary risks to get what it was there are absolutely strong parallels between russia meddling in the twenty sixteen american presidential election and russians meddling in the olympics in
fact american government officials have called them connected pal they have really is and intelligence report stating that they american intelligence officials believe russia meddling in the american presidential election to have been motivated in pa
part by the olympic dropping a scandal which they rode couldn't viewed as an american led attack while he has called is a year's worth of investigations revelations whistle blower accounts and effort to undermine russia attack
back on russia by the west so he's he's calling always investigations and americana attack on russia yes attack on russia and he has said and american attempt to meddle with russia an election his own election which is due to take place in march
so in that case these two episodes of essentially cheating on political on athletic they don't just look a lot like it showed interest parallel each other they're actually intertwined air related according to intelligence officials yes one has in some ways and
inspired the other and in some ways it's rooted back in the search the olympic laboratory
like to thank you very much thank you so much

and what about after a check of what happened him once your reporting was published
he was hoping that i talk came to us he would be afforded a level of protection but he has that he has continued to feel unsafe
the
oh
he is living under the protection of federal authorities in the united states and we don't know where he is so he's essentially in in hiding absolutely some in the country yes

as part of the punishment imposed on show by olympic officials for the national dumping operation the russian team was banned from competing in the new england decks
but one hundred and sixty nine
after being screened for past to accuse are being allowed to compete independently as olympic athletes from russia
they are wearing a new tool uniforms bearing no flag
the official record books
two one zero medals
special thanks to brian fogle and code the makers of icarus a documentary about doctor can

we'll be right back
