these
today
president trump is calling on the justice department to open an investigation into itself
instead the justice department is giving the president's team access to evidence being used in a special councils investigation
why would it do that
it's tuesday may twenty second

the present really using twitter this morning to slam the new york times and air their grievances and frustration meanwhile the new bombshell new york times article there's a big debate raging and more follow continued from or the president is back on twitter he's a lashing out at the justice department and also the new york times this were a new report about a previously unreported
meaning a trump tower with a foreign country
so the times published story over the weekend that looked at and different trump tower meeting and the one we've all become familiar with were donald trump junior met with russians you are promising dirt on hillary clinton julie data is covers the white house for the times this time the meeting was with officials from saudi arabia and the united arab
emirates and they are discussions with the trump campaign officials about potentially helping out the campaign the reason it matters is because it's the first indication that we have that muller is not just looking at whether the trump campaign worked with russians during the election season but
also whether they may have worked with other foreign governments you are either offering op or actually providing help to donald trump and whether they were also coordinating with the russians so it just gives a sense of an avenue that we weren't really aware existed in this investigation of the entire russia meddling picture so this is
the latest sign that the muller investigation continues to expand its scoop and this time it's literally expanding to entire other countries that's right and it may well be that mahler has been looking down this avenue for quite some time but it's just now that we're getting wind of it and every time one
these things becomes public the president gets another a little bit of a glimpse of how big this investigation really is how much smaller and his team really know and you know it's just continuing to go on and on and that makes the president extremely angry and it makes them want to lash out let me read your what
he has just treated things are really getting ridiculous the failing and crooked but not as crooked as hillary clinton new york times has done a long and boring story indicating that the world's most expensive witch hunt has found nothing on russia and me so now they are looking at the rest of the world but interestingly
he didn't take issue with anything in the story he didn't call it big news and there's a pause of a few hours and then he tweets again and he says here demand and will do so officially tomorrow that the department of justice look into whether or not the best the slash deal infiltrated or veiled the trunk campaign for police
typical purposes and then if any such demands are requests were made by people within the obama administration to tell me more about this incident the trump is asking his department of justice to look into what happened
well for a long time now he has been complaining about the fact that we know that several of his campaign officials were wiretapped but the more recent factor for the president that has hand talking about whether his campaign was infiltrated his some information that we reported on last week that the f b i actually
he had an informant the new york times and washington post reporting that the the i had an informant go talk to a couple of members of the trump campaign according into the report the f b i did indeed said an informant to talk to three trump campaign advisors after receiving evidence that they had suspicious contact with russia the informant who according to the
washington post was a retired american professor interacted with trunk campaign members george papadopoulos quarter page and zoom clovis when this first came out the president was really angry and talked about how inappropriate it was and he alleged that the person was spy out it was planted in his campaign we've come to learn through
shorting of my colleagues here in the dc bureau that the reason that these informants were sent in was because they had uncovered contacts that champ campaign officials had with russians and they wanted to look into what they were and further there was a sort of political timing motivation here not in the way that the president is representing it that they were out to get the campaign but
they were close enough to the election that they didn't want the spectacle of doing a big f b i interview of these people than it would be you know they thought a more practical way to go about it to you have an informant ask them questions and see what's there really anything to this or were they going down or wrong path but it's not as if they were double agents
when applied for jobs on the term campaign so they could spy on people they were doing the work that an fbi informant often does where you know you get a meeting with someone you go to dinner with them he talked to them you try to get information out of them and the leftover way than you would in a face to face interviews saying hello i am julie davis from the f b i plead dance
he spent question and is there a reason for the president to be outraged by this arrangement given that this was happening under a democratic president and in the middle of a very heated presidential campaign as he's running against hillary clinton
i think this president is very paranoid about this whole investigation so he believes there is a very good reason to be suspicious it happens while obama was president so he then believes that it was somehow directed by democrats but it's very typical to have an informant and a big investigation like this are several him
formats this is not necessarily considered a huge deal it's not necessarily something that goes all the way up the chain of command and certainly not to the president himself so the notion that barack obama was sitting at his desk saying i see we're going to help hillary clinton by sending a spy into the trunk campaign it's just not the way these things tip
working but that's clearly the way trump season and that is the way whether or not it's true he is representing it to the public and i think he's trying to undercut the whole investigation which has been doing all along but i think is also trying to set up this narrative where the public and particularly his own supporters say
see the mother investigation as a democratic partisan motivated witch hunt hoax just the way he does and that there's two different sides basically to boil it down into this fact free partisan spitting match between him and his democratic detractors but
the president in this treated is asking his department of justice
to look into this and determine if it was in fact a political act intended to hurt him and if the obama administration was somehow involved
that's right and you have to understand that this is not just any old matter he's asking the department of justice to look into there is an ongoing special counsel investigation into this issue of whether and how russia medals in the presidential election so by asking for this other investigation he's essentially intervening in and
ongoing investigation he saying hold up i want you to investigate the very basis for that special counsel probe right he's asking for an investigation of the investigation of him
correct
julie could this be construed as the latest piece of evidence that this president is trying to obstruct just when it comes to the special counsel investigation
absolutely he has basically dispensed with any idea that he is not trying to use his power use his office to try to influence the way this investigation goes he's called for an end to it he's fire the f b i a director he thought about firing the deputy attorney general and
and this is just the latest example of hamster of throwing all the usual standards out the window and saying i want this thing over i don't think this thing has a basis and i am going to use my power to try to act on that the irony here is that the more he tries to influence the muller investigation the more he tries
speed up its completion the more he seems to be contributing to and prolonging it and giving the special counsel more things to look into

all the way back
so how of the justice department respond to the president saying that he was going to issue this order and demand that it investigate itself
so there was a several hour lol on sunday after the president made this demand by tweets and wasn't hearing anything from the justice department i wasn't hearing anything from the white house about how he planned to carry this out
in the intervening hours i spoke to a number of people who are very concerned about how rod rosenstein the deputy attorney general who is overseeing the special counsel investigation it's going to react to this they felt that you know it's pretty clear that the justice department can't just say how high when the president says jump and that is
inappropriate and that rosenstein being a career justice department person would not be willing to do that and again he made this comment recently that the justice department won't be extorted so the question was what are his options that is not willing to do that will resign instead of doing that will he say no and be fired by the president for not do
and finally on sunday evening rosenstein put out a statement and he found this kind of middle ground where he said the justice department's going to ask it's inspector general to look into the question that the president had raised and he said you know of course if there's somebody who has
infiltrated or surveillance a campaign for political purposes of course we would want to know about that and act on that but in doing that you know the subtext of that also is and while that goes on the special counsel investigation is also going on uninterrupted we are not opening and justice department investigation were not devoting justice
department resources and investigators in layers into essentially carrying out what is politically motivated investigation into whether there is an already existing politically motivated investigation so he's essentially avoided either extreme and kind of came down somewhere in the middle and in the
process issued this statement dad in essence legitimized what the president had asked for without accepting it
but it's kind of like having your hr department look into the question of do we do something wrong here can we improve our operations right it's inevitably not as flashy as an outside investigation
well right and in particular because the inspector general doesn't have prosecutorial power if he found something wrong he could write a report and that might force action by congrats are five someone else in the administration but it would not lead to criminal charges and then that is clearly what the president would like to see
if something was done wrong so given the term knows that do we know if the president is satisfied by the compromise that rosenstein took here
well rosenstein and christopher re the f b i direct our were at the white house on monday talking to the president and i would have loved to have been a fire on the wall but i was not in the meeting but afterwards the white house did put out a statement that seem to suggest that the president at least for now is satisfied with but there was a second line of the statement that actually
was a lot more significant and that was that they said that john kelly the white house chief of staff will be convening a meeting with the f b i the justice department intelligence community to review all this information about the investigation
and for such a long time they've been resisting the treaties from the white house from the president himself from republicans on capitol hill to cough up some of this information potentially including the identities of these informants that the president is concerned about and they've said no and they've pushed back and they found ways around it and now there's
don't be a process where in some of this information is going to be furnished to the white house
so the justice department is agreeing to give the white house access to what it has the sort of evidence and the sort of information that the murder investigation is built around to at least some of it and you know the interesting thing here will be you know now they're going to have to kind of all go back to their desks figure
out what they can share and agree amongst themselves what are they going to show to the president but essentially what you have is the justice department pushing back and saying we're not going to let you intervene in this investigation but we are willing to give you some degree of access to what it is but working well
then why would people in an apartment just as why does rod rosenstein do them
well i think you have this immense pressure by the president of united states you have pressure from the oversight committees on capitol hill it really create this potential confrontation between the president and zone justice department it's really untenable and so the way these investigations work some of this information is highly highly classified as
others not so much so they may be thinking if there are things that we can tell them if there are ways that we can lay out what the basis was for this decision or that decision it's better to do that than to get ourselves down this road of a confrontation between the president and the justice department
so they have to figure out short of resigning and leaving this to someone else when they think it's a pretty important and vital and of the justice department how they can continue to operate how they can continue to keep this thing on its tracks that's but they're focused on and so they have to figure out
ways to maneuver in this new reality that the president has presented them with and i think that's what they're trying to do it sounds like rosenstein is trying not to have to resign or to get fired
perhaps helps explain why he's been such a difficult to decipher figure on the one hand we know he wrote that letter that became a justification for james komi being fired
as the director
on the other he has allowed robert mahler to run this investigation despite how infuriating it is the president and now back on the other side he's giving the president access to justice department evidence right i think that he is trying really hard not to resign
nine and not to be fired but he also has an attitude of i am going to do my job the way i think is appropriate and i'm not going to worry about whether i'm gonna get fired or not i'm going to worry about whether this investigation can run it's legitimate course even as he is doing these things giving questions that the president raises to the
inspector general trying to have this middle ground on information that they're showing the white house he is also approving lots and lots of different requests from muller who investigate this to investigate that i mean he oversees this investigation mahler can't look into questions arose and stand doesn't think are know an avenue that he should be pursued
so he's kind of got a very bifurcated role here and i think he is china play bone at the same time and so that sometimes why it looks from the outside like he's whip sign between one thing and another i think he's got to really important jobs here and he's trying to give up
so presumably rosenstein would have also approved the decision to investigate that second meeting a trump tower and the one that so infuriated the president when he read about it in the times yes it's definitely the case that if there were a moment where mahler presented this to him and said hey can i look at this he said yes because this is clearly
now a point of investigation from our
thank you very much
pleasure me



here's what else you need to learn all the morning everyone two weeks ago
president from terminated
search participation the jury comprehensive played eventually no family may be wrong
president who withdrew from the deal for some reason
failed to guarantee the safety of american people from the risk polluted by the leaders and islamic republic
no one in his first major speech as secretary of state might pump hale said that despite the us having pulled out of the iran nuclear iran must end all its nuclear enrichment programs and in a direct appeal to the iranian people suggested
they reject their clerical government next year
mark the fortieth anniversary of islamic republic revolution in iran
at this milestone
what is the really real illusion given to the really
the regime roofs to harvest of suffering and get in the middle east wall pump hail did not directly threatened the use of military force he hinted at it if iran we starts its nuclear at all
ronnie
other were waiting
understand your current activities will remain with really
