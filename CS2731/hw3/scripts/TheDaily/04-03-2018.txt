today
the second amendment is just twenty seven wards law but post twenty seven world are among the most cryptic and controversial in the us constitution
why the supreme court is reluctant to better define
it's tuesday april third

adam can you set the scene of this nineteen thirty nine supreme court what's going on time
so it involves a guy named jack miller who was a small town
bug in a day of midwestern bank robbery in the al capone era in the great depression who was a member of a gang that rug a lot of banks
he turns government informant
he goes kind of straight for a little while
but he's caught between oklahoma in arkansas with the slide off shotgun and he's prosecuted by federal authorities for violating again recent gun control law called the national firearms act adam lip tech covers the supreme court for the times so miller charged with this crime says wait a second isn't there a second image
don't i have a constitutional right to keep and bear
on any challenges the prosecution on second amendment grounds in this case makes it up the supreme court which in nineteen thirty nine for the first time ever tells us something about what the second movement means and what question is the court trying to answer in this case out of the basic question for the court
it's how to make sense of the second amendment which has two competing ideas and it let me read it you and you'll see what i'm talking about this got too close the second amendment says a well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state so that announces something about what the amendment and wants to accomplish is it the only
it wants to accomplish is it just an illustration of what it might like to accomplish and then there's a much easier part of it to understand where it says the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed if we only had the second clause that would be cleaned that would be like the first amendment congress shall make the law abridging the freedom of speech
but the introductory claus has caused people to scratch their heads for centuries about exactly what the framers of the constitution meant to accomplish whether they're right to bear arms protected but the second amendment protects a collective right concerning state militias or an individual right that every citizen has it just so
what exactly is the tension between the two causes a kind of collective claws and the individual and one way to think about it is the first cause it gives an example of a reason why you might want to have a right to keep and bear arms it's in order to have a well regulated militia but maybe not the
exclusive reason to have a right to keep and bear arms the second way of thinking about it though is that the first clauses limiting the first is this is why you have a right to keep and bear arms the only reason why and that is to participate in a government run militia and so in this case
of miller and his sort of chalk on and the question of which clause and a second then that should prevail what does the supreme court decide it doesn't directly answer the larger question of is this a collective right or an individual right rather it says that because shot guns have no reasonable relationship too
the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia we cannot say the second amendment guarantees the right to keep and bear such an instrument in other words it's saying all we need to decide here is sort of shotguns have nothing to do with militias and therefore you don't have a right to have one now many people think that's suggestive
it's buying into the collective version of the second amendment but it doesn't say so stone so many words it just says to the extent the government wants to regulate kinds of weapons it has to be the kind of weapon you conceive of being used in a militia understand so in practical terms the court has imply
wide that the second amendment is a collective raid the miller case cryptic an opaque though it was did sort of set the tone for the conventional wisdom the consensus view for decades and decades on in the public consciousness and in the legal academy that the second amendment doesn't protect an individual right to
keep and bear arms but only a collective one
and how does this impact the american conception of guns and gun rights
the next several decades people across the ideological spectrum including law and order conservatives really believed in the second amendment has nothing to say about gun control laws being those in only pretend to collect the right
the best example of this really is a comment by just and burner
no
nixon a point in a law and order conservative who goes on television having heard the view that the second amendment like conceivably protect than individual right
that was one of the greatest
and
special interest group have originated
even in conservative circles where people may relish their guns and their right to own guns they interpret the second amendment to refer to a collective bright own guns related demolition that's right that's not to say that people didn't want to make sure that gun rights are your they just started with something you do in the political
prices in legislature that it wasn't a question the constitution was going to help them and
that makes sense because the only supreme court case that has touched on this implied that it is about a collective mind
exactly right
and when when things start to change in the late seventies early eighties you start to see the and are a exploring whether there are arguments three made on behalf of an individual right to bear arms and they get some surprising allies some fairly prominent law professors sanford
levinson synod texas akira amari ill and lawrence tribe perhaps the most prominent constitutional scholar of his day start to grapple with the second amendment in somewhat to their own surprise find that it's a part of the bill of rights that should be considered a real right
second amendment provides a decisive response
the government is not constitutionally incapable of disarming everybody we may not like what it does but we need to take seriously every part of the bill of rights we have expanded first amendment rights by taking the first man seriously and to be intellectually honest we should also look seriously at the scope of the second amendment so how does it
this idea improbably shared by the ira and these men in the scholarly circles make it into the real world through litigation
litigation the great engine of american progress
a rich libertarian lawyer named robert leave he picks up on these ideas he's not a gun owner but he has ideas about what the constitution means i don't live and a dangerous neighborhood and i don't feel the need to have gotten for stuff and i do feel very much concerned about those people who do live in a dangerous neighborhood including the plaintiff in our case park
and he launches a lawsuit in a case that he hopes will get to the supreme court and revolutionized second amendment law to leave he doesn't even own a gun so why is he interested in the second amendment he told me i read and some years ago he told me that he's not particularly interested in guns but he pursued the case to vindicate his libertarian principles or what the
confrontation the weather it's the first amendment or recommend it set up a presumption that we have labored it doesn't mean that government cannot trunk hate are right but government had to jump through some considerable hoop in order to do he believes in free markets private property individual rights strictly limited govern
mint and this fits into that libertarian conception of if the constitution gives you right to have a gun he wanted to make sure that the government couldn't impinge on that right we feel that this is a violation of the second amendment to be your constipation so how did he go about building a case that he hoped would make it to the supreme court
he first of all identifies the strictest gun control law in the country which use in the district of columbia
and then he starts interviewing plaintiffs and it's like a casting call he said he wanted gender diversity racial diversity age diversity income diversity
the robert levy recruited six people and a lot of people would find their stories very sympathetic one of them was a woman who'd been trying to rid her neighborhood of drugs and wanted to keep a gun in her home to protect yourself because people were breaking into her house
a second plane was a gay man who been accosted by a gang using ugly language about him any wanted to have a gun to protect his own life
so these are to a lot of people's minds very attractive candidates for such a suit but one by one they get knocked off on various technical legal grounds but he managed to maintain one plane if one plane of survives a security officer named dick heller i moved into washington d c and nineteen seventy six and in october
dc city council passed a law that said you were no longer allowed to own any kind of a firearm and d c but you could be grandfathered in by coming down to the police station and registering your firearm and who is this guy heller
he was a security guard who carried a gun on the job in federal office buildings but was very frustrated because he wasn't allowed to have one in his home so i said why would i want to register it is because they want my address why do they want my interest because they want to come and get my gun and for confiscation and i said no
the us supreme court might be hard to believe but not once in the history of this republic has the court ever said what the second amendment right to bear arms means in there the first time in seventy years behind hormones he kept the constitutional right to bear arms so what happens with this case
at his name becomes attached big get the supreme court
thousand and eight each the biggest case on the right to bear arms ever heard by the supreme court
one of the most closely watched highly anticipated supreme court cases it's one of a half dozen huge gazes will be your court led by chief justice john roberts has the case that decide that the first time ever buy the second amendment guarantees americans a right to own a gun him people are very focused on whether the court
dominated by five conservatives will revolutionize second amendment blog by finding an individual right to keep and bear arms aligned to get into the court according to the associated press began forming two days ago we will your argument today and case do seven to ninety eight district of columbia versus helen
three downs are good morning with the chief justice at least the court
so how does the court ruled just discreetly also his opinion this morning and case zero seven to nine the district of columbia vs calories
the court rules five to four with justice antonin scalia writing for the majority this case is here on reddit tertiary to the united states good of appeals for the district of columbia cirque that there is an individual right to keep and bear arms at least we're self defense in the home by law abiding citizens we all with the second amendment
antes an individual right to have and use arms for self defense a little and that the district's handgun ban as well as its requirement that firearms in the home be rendered in operative violates that right
so in this rule and unlike the lying in nineteen thirty nine the court finds that it is an individual right that's intended by the wording of the second them rather than a collective right that's right and if the hundred thirty nine decision was a little hard to understand this point in justice
his opinion was crystal clear so what happens as a result of this ruling to the surprise of many almost nothing the lower courts read the heller decision people challenge various gun control laws on all kinds of topics background checks waiting periods assault weapons and the lower courts almost universally
sustained those laws they don't think hillary is made a difference in how you'd have to treat those loans hundred the second amendment so the lower courts in a sense kind of ignored the fact that the court seem to confer on the whole country the individual right to bear arms which suggests that they would be ready to invalidate a lot of these gun control laws
well they certainly treated differently than other provisions of the bill of rights laws that violate say the first amendment get a very close look and not infrequently are struck down laws said to violate the second amendment don't seem to get quite that level of scrutiny and seldom get struck they're so what then was the effect of this wrong
if the lower courts are not applying it to gun control laws around the country
good guy shouldn't be forced to break the law to exercise their god given cost there is no right to protect themselves and their families
the effect of the ruling in public consciousness in public debate was to allow proponents of gun rights they start making arguments that one about policy you're not only about policy
protecting a part of the constitution it's always been we the people all the way back to the founding of this country the founding fathers were not afraid to trust the people with arms it was the people with arms who had ignored the freedom of the new nation
guarantee if the founding fathers had known this kind would have been invented they wouldn't have rewritten the second amendment they would have to find it in stone
and that cast this kind of glow in oran around gun rights arguments that really is a gift to gun rights proponents from the supreme court the founding fathers agree and armed citizens make good government history clearly shower is that our interpretation of the second amendment is the same as what
americans have always known and the founding fathers intended i think that they be proud of us for staying the course and disgusted by the politicians and media personalities who are so eager to deprive us of our rights
so in a sense it's bringing kind of ability to the whole gun rights to be
think how far we've come michael in nineteen thirty nine the poster child for gun rights was a hapless stoke gangster in the great depression and now the energy use able to argue that what they're protecting is something that was handed down to us by the framers in the constitution and what's happened on the supreme court since this
rolling back in two thousand and eight almost nothing in two thousand and ten they said the second women also applies to state gun control laws in addition to federal laws like the one in the district of columbia and then the supreme court got out of the business of telling us anything about the second amendment turning down case after case after case to the great frustration
of the more conservative members of the court justice antonin scalia while he was alive and just as clarence thomas now will fairly often right we don't understand why you're not taking these cases you're treating these constitutional right as a second class right and it's our duty to tell the nation what the scoop of this right is bike
comparison this term the supreme court has five first amendment cases and it will routinely explain in refine the scoop of first amendment rights and you might think with so many unanswered questions in the second amendment irina the supreme court would get into the business of explaining what the scope of this right is
it's simply has not in doesn't seem to want to do it and and why hasn't the court taken a second and then the case's what's behind that the court doesn't explain its decisions to turn down case is so we can't know for sure but i guess i would suspect that at least some elements in the court justices in the middle
voted for the heller decision but maybe a little warily and i'm thinking of justice anthony kennedy and chief justice john roberts may well have gone as far as they're prepared to go so this court which has told us that the second amendment gives us an individual right to bear arms it seems like
they have moral and legal reservations about taking that to the next logical place which would be refining and explaining all the ways in which gun control laws might be illegal
this inference and speculation but that is what i believe they've gone as far in this realm is they are prepared to go even in hell are they carved out all kinds of gun control laws that they said they didn't want to cast doubt on and that they're not going any further at the moment at least with this composition of the supreme court to expand
second amendment rights no should do one or two members of the court leave should present in trump get two points and new people he certainly is constantly pressing his broad conception and the second amendment we might start getting some different answers


about a week and a half ago
hundreds of thousands of people especially young people flew into the streets
to protest in the march for our lives

and that gets the attention of justice john paul stevens who wrote the descent inhaler who's retired from the corridors ninety seven years old
and i get word the supreme court that he's interested in submitting a letter to the editor
i provide the court with the right email addresses and and even as i'm doing that
i get an email from our opinion pages saying we've just kindness submission from justice stevens by fax by fast i got an email from somebody they're saying this thing came over the facts it has no contact information where do we do with it how do we get in touch with justice stevens this is great but we just discovered we had a fax machine
and what did this faxed submission from former justice
stevens say he is clearly not done regretting what the supreme court did in the decision but he's no longer talking about tweaking email or decision or returning to a collective rights view of the second amendment but of repealing the second amendment entirely why would a supreme court justice of all people
call for the repeal of a constitutional amendment
well it's a sign of real frustration supreme court justices of course are in the business to interpret the constitution not encouraging wholesale changes to the amendment process and the fact that a former supreme court justice a very sophisticated demand somebody who's studied this question quite deeply thinks the answer is to throw a part of the bill of rights
org tells you that word a place in our national debate where people are trying like crazy to find a way out of what they perceive to be a terrible terrible court were terrible harm is done by guns and yet our nation's founding document
protects or right to have them and limits the ability of society to address this question right i mean if it's possible for nine people to stare at the same twenty seven words and come to diametrically opposite conclusions about what they mean that might be some reason to think that it's time to take another look
him to clarify what we
adam thank you very much
thank you
we'll be back

huge what else you need another on monday the chinese government follow through with it
impose tariffs on us goods
in retaliation for us tariffs on chinese steel and aluminum the chinese parents which will affect one hundred and twenty eight american made products including wine

and british officials investigating the poisoning of a former russian spy surveys couple believe that the nerve agent used to attack it was smeared on the door handle this
the plot was so complicated and risk that officials have concluded it had to have been ordered by the government of flattery uprooted which has denied any involved

that's it
