
from the new york times on michael barbara this
a government hearing gets overtaken by the fight over whether the president
he is reported to have used why it matters so much to members of congress
and steve then becomes the first member of trumps inner circle to be subpoenaed in the mother it best
it's wednesday january seventh
so on tuesday morning there is a hearing scheduled in the senate judiciary committee to talk about the different options for a border wall julie davis watch the hearing on tuesday by it came at sort of a tricky time are you saying the president did not use the word that has been so why are they report
because you did not use that word george and up till and it's are gross misrepresentation
so to the last few days have been consumed with this debate going on between the white house and republican and democratic senators about what was said by president trump in the oval office meeting last week and i'm not here derogatory comments i sent out about individuals percent sheet metal when he has reported
have said that african countries to send a immigrants here are shit her countries
really
and so do your first of all your here before the community will be food for nothing
what's happening in this hearing chairman grassley ranking member feinstein in members of the committee thank you for the opportunity to testify before you today the protagonist is christine neill nielsen she is the somewhat new homeland security secretary and she is a top official at the
apartments there she would naturally be there to talk about border wall but she also happens to you have been one of the administration officials in the oval office last thursday when the president made these remarks that have caused so much ruckus an instructor hope you remember me almost immediately we were together to meetings worst week
it would like to urge to about one of those meetings one of the senior democrats on the judiciary committee is senator durbin who was there for that oval office meeting and has now spoken out about what he heard people across the united states and around the world want to know what this president believe should be are priorities when it comes to immigration
i'm going to ask you as best you can do recall what you heard the presidency
when it came to those berge right germans actually the democrat who was in the room at the white house proposing this bipartisan immigration deal with republican senator lindsey graham that's right and senator durbin has been working on this issue for more than fifteen years but now he's also become
a key player in this kind of back and forth over what actually and fall it at the white house and what this says about how the president views immigration and immigrants do you remember the president saying expressly i want more europeans why can't we have more immigrants from norway
i do remember what he i do remember him asking about the concept of under represented countries he basically says to her you were there i was there and essentially dares her to deny what they both heard should on fox news that the president you strong language what was that strong language
let's see strong language there was so secretary nielsen says that she did not hear that specific word i apologies i don't remember specific word what i was struck with frankly as i'm sure you were is well aware it's just the general profanity that was used in the room by almost everyone in burma use proof
no sir neither did her so she says that tough language was used in people were impassioned a lot of people were using profanity what do you remember the president
about immigration from african countries to the united church that when durban presses her on what specifically the president said she says what i heard him saying was that he'd like to move away from a country based quota system to merit based system and she also claims that she can't really remember
any sort of characterization of african nation which was in the context in which everyone i've spoken to you about this meeting says this remark was made out of the characterized those countries in africa
in i i don't i don't specifically remember categorization of countries in africa i think what he was saying is as far as best i could talent is you now there were about a dozen people in the room there were a lot of cross conversations there was a lot of rough talk by a lot of people in the room
but what i understood him to be saying is let's move away from the countries and let's look at the individual and make sure that those we bring hair can contribute to our society
president saying
i mean julie would she seems to be describing is kind of this previous locker room and of the president and members of congress talking about immigration it was the sort of everyone is saying it's a big shouting match and it was actually somewhat surprising to me to hear
the meeting described that way by her because she is in effect conceding that this devolved into not very high level of discourse about this huge issue that they're trying to solve
this has turned into a show just to complicate things for this hearing and we need to get back to be in a great country another member of the judiciary committee who also gets his chance to chime in and ask questions is lindsay graham who was the only other republican in the oval office
offense at that meeting to have come forward and said publicly that there was an exchange that he pushed back on and he's defended and continues at this hearing to defend senator durbin his account i think dick durbin
people you could ever hope to work with that he's a decent honest man and graham is actually turbans cosponsor on this bipartisan immigration plan that's what they were doing in the white house in the first place
right thursday
are you aware that senator durbin and the pros that talked ten o'clock around that time thursday morning only through news reporting african to fabricate and senator graham sort of recounts publicly what i and others have reported happened in the run up to this extraordinary meeting which is the key and senator durbin
had gone to president trump with the foundation of what they thought was a bipartisan compromise here are you where the government call me and said i had the best conversation or the pros that we should follow up on it
ham now okay so that body else that the president was actually quite upbeat about in phone conversations with them on thursday morning or are you aware of the great girl called the lot else and super we can sort of a moving your now yes sir only to then find when he got to the white house that wasn't actually that simple and that he describes that the
president the he confronted in the oval office was a very different person from the person you talked to you on the phone that morning between ten o'clock and twelve o'clock
we went from having conversations between sooner drug urban which i believe every word and the president that was very hopeful and by the time we got there something had happened so what happened between ten and twelve it sounds a bit like a rhetorical question so what his nielsen's actual reply to ground question i don't know since i didn't i don't know
i'm going to find out i'm not she basically says she doesn't know obviously what senator graham is driving at him like he said after the hearing tests and reporters in the hall is that he thinks the president has been poorly served by his staff like steve miller senior policy advisor who is very much been a hardliner on these issues and potentially even neil
send herself though he doesn't name her are really constraining trump from the position where he keeps trying to get or a were at least graham would like to see him get who's the we had a president that i was proud to golf with call my friend who understood immigration her to be bipartisan you had to have order sir
security is a search or you airport security or the wall but he also understood the
with conversion
now i don't know where they're going nowhere
i want him back
i actually think that senator graham in some ways was trying to talk to trump through the hearing testimony or even questioning process in other words china in and say to ham sir you're the president if you want to do these things it isn't as your position you should do then don't let these
people push you around the present watching i'm still on the phone book don't give my number of gone
so let's take a step back why is whether or not the president used this word dominating this homeland security hearing on tuesday morning why are these lawmakers so fixated on that
you have to understand that the government funding is that to run out on friday as part of a gear and spending deal that republicans and democrats may of last year they need to vote by friday to replenish government spending and keep the government open and democrats and republicans thought that they had reached a deal to address
doctor before that happened that they could have presented to the president that they could at least be on their way to getting that voted on and signed before they made the commitment to in fact support a measure to keep the government open so they went to that meeting thinking that this was the path forward at the white house with graham will has with graham and with
well what they stand instead was an exclusive meeting where the president use this charge term and ran all these days that followed of bickering over whether he senate or he didn't say it and what it has essentially done is pulled the extremes of both parties away from a place where they were ready to deal and instead
given democrats pause about whether the president and serious about doing something for this population and for immigration in general and given the republican hardliners a reason to point it democrats and say they are making this big deal out of nothing and they can't be trusted to cut a deal with us that is going to have the kind of immigration restrictions that we think me
to be in place
are the democrats the ones in power here for once the budget can't get past without them it seems so good they now have a leverage on this issue that they might not normally
they do have a leverage if they're willing to use it that even now even after these comments there is a big question about whether all of the democrat and they only need a few to though with republicans to keep the government running are really willing to make the stand and say we're shutting down the government over this issue
do you agree with me that the throes to the notion her
or pretty severe and if we should remember government that be a good idea
yes sir
finally julie i want to ask you about something else the republican senator lindsey graham said in this congressional hearing on tuesday that i found quite interesting and i wanted your take on it does the president in to extend dhaka past march fifth boat executive or not that
i'm aware of do you think has the legal authority to do so i believe the attorney general has made it clear that he believed such exercises unconstitutional for congress to fix so i agree with the frozen can extend his are good order in march fifth a lot of bad things begin to happen
seems to me were try to avoid can do you agree with the yes sir what's your take on that
well thinner ground with things something important here because donald trump has actually intimated in the past he did when he rescinded doctor that he could revisit this that he would somehow have the power to go back and if congress didn't act he was going to fix it himself senator graham is basically saying that's not possible right grim saying
he is in rescinding this you've basically said it's unconstitutional for you to deal with this so it's congress that solves this or nothing and when he really seems to be saying to the president through his homeland security secretary is let us solve this and stop mucking about
right let us do this for you president has said repeatedly that he feels for these kids he calls and even many of them are not kids that he has compassion for them that he wants to do something that's full of love and essentially senator graham is saying if you don't allow a deal to go forward in congress if you mess with that if this gets derailed
we can't help you address this you will be responsible for having ended this program and it will be over
thank you doing
thanks michael
we'll be right back

that what are you reporting
today we reported that steve banned in the president's former chief strategist had been served a subpoena last week by bob mahler to special counsel breaking is today though in russia investigation for the first time the thing here that was interesting new and different is then he is using his
brian subpoena power than your dad and is the first person in the president's inner circle to get a grand jury subpoena everyone else did has talked to former white house chief of staff rinds pretty boss of was can't we know about a former white house press secretary shaun spicer has been interviewed by has gone soon the informal
setting of use officers in downtown washington white house communications director hope he spent the last two days meeting with special counsel robert mahler's to the curious thing was then banning someone who at least publicly the image of being close to the president in certainly was around for a lot of things wasn't among men were either we kept on wondering
if muller's investigation is coming to an end as the white house has tried to say it is why hasn't he talked of man and
the mouse among about the term campaign and administration is now available for everyone to read it is the timing of this subpoena meaningful because it came just a few days after ban and got himself into a lot of hot water with the white house because of the commons and he made in michael wolfsburg fire and fury about
donald trump junior a meeting with russian officials which he called treason us we don't know been timing is certainly funny and the book's publisher moved up the schedule release of buyer in theory to today after the trump administration threaten to sue to keep made from coming out in the book comes out in the first week in january in the books the ban in the press
those former top advisor calls the president's son unpatriotic and treason as you have banned in out there saying donald trump son's decision to meet with russians in two thousand and sixteen who were promising dirt on hillary clinton was treason is he also said the ongoing russia investigation is a category five hurricane for the administration you have
him saying that there was almost zero chance that trumps son didn't bring the russian to meet the president extraordinary war of words breaking out between president and his former top strategist steam ban and a clear bring between ben and and the president and on wednesday the president excoriated ban and saying he lost his mind
in losing his job a top or a part in last week as this split has become public mother moves in in serves them with the subpoena
she doesn't council has many reasons but many of them related to the book to now talk to steve of the book created these features in trump world that exposed breaks that had gone on between people between ban it in the white house and other white house officials
were bandaged hatred for a vodka and jared was very public it expose these things and if you're mahler and you see these things sort of fracturing in front of you you want to go in as quickly as possible and get banned in find out what he knows the other thing here that mother may have been doing is trying to give in cover there's two ways
mahler's gonna try and talk to people there is the interview in his office with his investigators which is more informal or there's the grand jury appearance which is as formal as they get its transcribed you can't take your lawyer in it's a much more intense setting so what this does for banning is it gives him
sort of a way of saying look i'm not a rad it's going to give up stuff on the president voluntarily i'm being compelled to do this i'm being legally pushed to go before the grand jury in tell them everything that i know so one way of looking at this subpoena from the special counsel is that they're giving ban in some cover
another way of looking at is that they're forcing him to talk after he probably regrets saying what he said in the book and having this followed with the president
well at the gay mahler's going to compel who he needs to to get the information that he needs in whether that means nicely asking for you to sit down for an interview being a little more stern in compelling you with a grand jury subpoena or going to court to enforce their grand jury subpoena actually getting the f b i t go out and get you
molly's can get what he needs to get to the bottom of this in were just simply watching that process point yeah
thank you michael things family



here's what else you need to know in summary the president's overall health his of this earlier performance during his physical exam was very good on tuesday afternoon the president's doctor ronnie jackson held a news conference to describe the results of his first physical exam of president trumps since taking off
office he would benefit from a diet that is lower and fountain carbohydrates in for a routine exercise regimen during the exam jackson said he performed an additional test the reason that we did the cognitive assessment is several because a president asked me to do he came to me he said is there something we can do a test who were some type of screen that we can do
to assess my cognitive ability in so i looked into the president jackson said got a perfect score the president exceedingly well on it so there was no i've driven it all by it serves i have it was driven by the president's wishes he did well

that's it for the day
i'm a warmer
