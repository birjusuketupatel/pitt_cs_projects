
from new york times i'm michael moore
entity
today
in a marathon session before congress jeff sessions denies lying about ties to russia and sidesteps questions about pressure from president truck to investigate hillary clinton and uranium one and what is iranian one
it's wednesday november fifteenth
today we welcome attorney general jeff sessions
the judiciary committee's annual department of justice oversight here and madame tussaud's wait a week for jeff sessions to go before congress
what was he doing now
the regular oversight hearing the house judiciary committee conducts with the attorney general and has a chance for lawmakers to say how's the department running and ask questions about petty issues whether it's immigration are violent crime drugs civil rights but of course your first year leaving
apartment of justice has not been without difficulty everything is overshadowed by three things there is jeff sessions and is misstatements about russian connections with the campaign there's a campaign going on for jeff sessions his former senate seat and jeff sessions made a little news ahead of the earring and
hinted that maybe the us was going to get a special prosecutor to investigate hillary clinton and the clinton foundation and the obama administration do you solemnly swear that the testimony of your about should be the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth so help you god
and that the record show that the witness answered in the affirmative let's start with russia sessions as attorney general has recuse himself from the russia investigation that his department overseas because of his own role in the trunk campaign last year so what did the committee want to know that russia from jeff sessions
well to understand today he can go back to his confirmation hearing he testified that he did not have communications with the russians had the correct that and say actually no i did meet with the russian ambassador and so he had to go back up to the hill
round off the edges on that and just last month he was back up before the senate was asked you said under oath in front of the senate judiciary committee quote continue a change of information between trumps surrogates an intermediaries for the russian government did not happen at least not to my knowledge and not with me
in particular the special counsel files paperwork in federal court showing that jeff sessions shared campaign round table in which a campaign a church papadopoulos made his pitch that he had russian connections
and suggested that he could arrange a meeting for donald trump and russia yes or no did mr papadopoulos mention his outreach to the russian government during that meeting he made some comment to that effect
remember having
piper and so now he's back up on the hill and he's eyeing the answer once again did you lie to congress
i had no recollection of this meeting until i saw the news reports either now or that the march two thousand and sixteen meeting at the drop hotel
the awkward op was attended but i have no clear recollection of the details of what he said at that made him so he's saying it will not lie because it in remember it but i remember it now soda i don't exactly remember what was said but i definitely remember that i said that he would not authorized
to represent the campaign where the russian government or any other foreign government for that matter not to get to clinical but that's the kind of complicated positions for the attorney general to take he's claiming that he didn't remember meeting that involved a campaign he talking about communications with officials
from russia who represented and interests but he does specifically remember telling someone in a meeting not to set up a meeting with the president of russia doesn't that feel a little inconsistent right so let me look is is not a good day read this is not a good place for the attorney general to be in
i want to be as fair and accurate as possible to the attorney general position because we all forget things but certainly the attorney general united states was not expected to be in a position where he's making a third trip to congress to explain the nuances of russian interactions and that's the
whether anything ever came of this the problem politically is largely self made it's just not a good position for the change for the term campaign to be in right now mr and you're not go improper occurred at all why was it for all can we answer the crime once and for all and
the credit cards from i don't understand why you want take my answer or we were on the third edition mr attorney general so frankly if you're at the white house that's why this hearing is so frustrating as why your your patient with jeff sessions is is really low this is supposed to be hearing where you go up and maybe take some shots from democrats of course but you go out and
you are laying out your vision for the just permanent and your vision for the donald trump law and order presidency and once again because of jeff sessions were talking about russia and taught talking on the trunk campaign again and that drives people at the lighthouse crazy
so let's talk about what came up with the controversy around boy more the republican candidate for the alabama senate seat that sessions vacated when he became attorney general
republicans in congress came out and denounced more on monday as all these allegations of sexual advances and even sexual assault have come out but the trump administration as of tuesday hasn't really said anything about more and sessions in this fascinating position because alabama is his steed and
his old seed but he's also now representing the administration so what happens with that before the judiciary committee will he was asked do you believe judge more should be seated in the senate if he wins and would you introduce investigations by the d o j regarding his actions
silly question because the just armin doesn't investigate stay crimes for the most part but it was away and that's the that's the way in to say what do you think about ray moore and jeff sessions bet do you believe these young women
i am
no reason to doubt these young women and that kind of echoed mitch mcconnell a majority leader's comments earlier when he said i believe the women in so like jeff sessions is a long time alabama politician and this is him weighing in on a pretty controversial
full senate race for his old see in his home state
so that now the big one
the night before sessions comes to capitol hill the times reports that his justice department is looking into the possibility of appointing a special counsel to investigate president's former rival hillary clinton
was the timing of that a coincidence
given this hearing now definitely not as you're aware i and a majority of members of this community have on multiple occasions requested a special the hassle to investigate former secretary hillary this is a hearing with republicans who have been clamoring for the just aren't meant to do more
or to investigate hillary clinton and to investigate the obama administration
and the night before
sessions is due to testify this letter drops in which the just parliament says hey you know what actually we might do that thing that the president and you republicans on the committee have been as community do we actually my do that
it gave the republican something to talk about if been as much evidence in my judgment
against the president as we have against the obama administration mrs clinton i i'm afraid mr trump would have been burned mistake by know there's a clear and equity allowed kind of a counter narrative to the trump administration in russia that the democrats are really pushing and yet under questioning by those republicans
sessions didn't exactly sound like a person who is a either to appoint a special counsel to investigate clinton and all the issues surrounding her reign
ray i mean sessions is trying to slice thin here because i'm the one hand there have been lots of calls for somebody to investigate hillary clinton including from his boss donald trump one of the republican congressman jim jordan
said what's he going to take to actually get a special counsel what's the holdup that looks like there's already enough evidence to open a special counsel association and the attorney general shot that was a well trained you sorry i'm our mascot for a time and gentlemen our it works like is not enough basis to apart a special counts
and so he didn't totally jump into the pool with the republicans but on the other hand he's taking serious criticism from democrats that he's just a puppet for shop and down from says i want a special counsel knew that he clinton hill and do that their sessions who do you work for the work for the american
the worked for the present a united states well i'm a member of the executive branch and i work for the american people and a certain amount of that comes with the territory every attorney general gets accused of that at some point in their tenure but he is the significance president trump has inserted himself in
to the justice department and the criminal justice process in ways i have not seen my career and nobody i've talked to has seen before he openly calls for investigations into his political rivals like he opined on on
going investigations and if they're just farm and does a completely fair and impartial review and decides to open investigation it's going to look too many people like jeff sessions did it because the president told him to do it and because you don't want to get fired from his job so how does sessions in this hearing on tuesday
explain this perception and this conflict he says
that speaks his mind
bowden direct about what he says
don't want him back to them but are we do our duty every day
and that's kind of all he can say because he's already on thin ice with the president as of this we will not be infected by politics are boss
away though on make only decisions we believe are right and just and
we're not going to use that apartment to unlawfully advance so political agenda on tuesday both the democrats and republicans agreed that the just apartment needed to be entirely politically independent
but they just come down and totally different sides and the democrats say you need to be totally independent how could you open an investigation or even toy with opening investigation into hillary clinton just because donald trump says so in the republicans say you need to be totally independent in politics aside and right
the wrongs of the obama administration that was so political and let hillary clinton get away with everything for eight years and so they both agree that experiment should be entirely political and do what i want
thank you that you're always welcome
the
he will be right back
mike schmidt what is the thing that this special counsel would be investigating if a special counsel is appointed by sessions the republicans would want a special counsel to look at a wide range of issues related to the clintons emails the foundation and what's known as the uranium
one deal during two thousand and ten when hillary clinton was the secretary of state the state department approved the sale of a company called uranium one they had also donated a lot of money to the clinton foundation and which had rights to mine uranium in the states to are rushing
nuclear agency got it it's really hard to unwrap for the average person but it's also easy for folks to exploit because it's so confusing the can take the uranium one issue throw it out there in it's really hard for the other side to refute it
unfortunately their hand like a guide
like so many things right now it feels like your understanding of what happened here in this case can vary so dramatically based on where you get your news if you're watching or listening to conservative news what their version of the uranium one story this is beyond insanity inexcusable
the rain uranium one he's just the latest example of clinton and corruption how on the to corruption they go back and dream one
related to the clean where there's smoke there's fire and when it comes to the cleanse king you're coughing from all of us now coming where he time donors to their foundation get state department approval when hillary clinton and secretary of state cheap personally signed off and giving up to twenty percent of america
occasionally raining out and how you know this stuff we used for nuclear energy and bombs and it's the united states giving away his precious material
this foreign power on russia let's talk about russia let's talk about the sale a quarter percent of our uranium to wash it and they already clinton signing off on a daily encompasses all the parts of clinton conspiracy theories in allegations of the past twenty five years i mean what isn't going to take to put
woman in jail
and what at the rest of the media t extent that they've been covering the uranium one saga how have they been covering it in the liberal press uranium one is something donald trump uses to distract from his own problems now we're seeing the uranium one hoax from the bulk resurface in white house
press briefings and in conservative media this week and what's sure does look like a coordinated effort to re brand the phrases russia scandal and collusion a waif novels amp and onto republicans favorite target hillary clinton he has in russia investigation that is intensifying in front of him three of his campaign officials had been
charged and he's trying to divert attention and see look look at what the democrats did it's far worse than anything you allege against me he now trump is being accused of colliding with the russians so therefore let's turn the tables and say no actually hillary has not even quite so to i'm already agenda
are you asking about that so some people are calling this a conspiracy theory and fake news other people think hillary clinton should go to jail for this what is reality what do we knew to be fact in the case of uranium one and the clintons yes it's true that uranium one was sold
a russian nuclear agency yes it's also true that folks associated with uranium one donated money to the clinton foundation
and it's also true that hillary clinton was the secretary of state at the time but the story is far more nuanced than that there were many government officials who were part of approving the deal and there's no evidence of a quid pro quo in which the donation was me to the foundation in exchange for the
approval of the deal the justice department has known it down his since his for bankers two thousand and fifteen the f b i he has looked into it and did not think there was enough to bring a case suggesting that there's not a lot here so why is it that we're talking about this now nine
months into the tram presidency why would jeff sessions be looking into the possibility of appointing a special counsel to investigate this our colleague maggie haberman reported dead jeanine pirro fox news hello and welcome to a very special to our edition of justice are jeanine pirro had been in the
the oval office recently to meet with president trump and push the idea that he should appoint a special counsel to investigate uranium more what do you do yeah i wanted to that i'm going to do about it why is jeff say what look when i'm i'm in eleven days ago before donald trump was leaving for he's trip to asia he spoke to the
grass and expressed his deep frustration with the justice department and attorney general jeff sessions for not looking into really not involved with the proper that like the let it run itself but honestly they said they look at it the democrat
but i've been wondering about something here critics say sessions is looking into this because he's feeling the pressure from those conservatives and for president trump but if his investigators don't find the evidence to support the appointment of a special counsel it seems like that could end up popping the bubble of this
more than if he'd never looked at it in the first place and maybe make the president even more disappointed
so there's a risk here there's a risk year for the president because the justice department prosecutors could come back to the attorney general and say hey there's no reason for a special counsel there's nothing really here and that would really pop the president's balloon on this issue and take away something that he has repeatedly return to when he his face
faced intense criticism himself
russia as twenty percent of very rare for whatever reason and a lot of people understand what those reasons maybe i think that your rusher story that your real rush mr
not a story where they talk about collision and it was not
post
michael thank you
thanks for and

here's what else you need to another day
the senate republicans say they will combine their plan to overhaul the tax code with their fight to undo the affordable care act were we're optimistic
and certainly individual mandate
would would be awful
obviously of view that been committed were both into the senate majority leader mitch mcconnell says the republican tax plan will include over appeal of the obama care requirement that most people have health insurance a long standing goal of republicans and a move that
save hundreds of billions of dollars over the next decade freeing up money to expand middle class tax cuts or help pay for the overall cost of the tax bill
but projections from the congressional budget office say it would result in thirteen million fewer people having health insurance
and could drive up insurance premiums for many americans by about ten percent
that's it for the day i'm like michael rubber suitable
