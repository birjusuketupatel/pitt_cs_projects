
from new york times on michael barbara
the day
today she was the most famous black woman in america who exposed the systematic lynching of blackmail
when she died the times failed to write an obituary
how the paper of record is trying to fix that
it's friday march sixteenth

and
so how did the two of the mood to know
etc about ice i think that's why people love so much they're related their interest a little nuggets of history at a concert with dreams bro
often about things he never knew
the cause of death was cancer
the winner work and it's almost as though your have to be part sarah interest when he talked to families oh boy
back what you're hearing was this sudden or was a feeling for a while and almost consoling ma'am in some cases may get very emotional are you my dead
same thing i know good stuff you trying so hard to understand every detail about this person without ever having that
what do you do and it's a difficult thing to do when you're talking to somebody is breathing so i feel like you have to wants a job like this
thank you okay a good good old jews
bobo
i think who against remembered and how inherently involves judgment
it's news judgment
awesome farm judgment
and so look back at the obituary archives can paint a picture of what society evaluated and
no
amy pod nano he works on the old it's desk at the times where every morning dozens of submissions pour into her inbox candidates for a new york times obituary
so here we have our unless at the top we have the people we know are definitely going to do we're just waiting to sign ma'am we have her order free and then underneath our we have a less have to be added and in this case this morning i heard about ethel stein who was credited with getting the patent for a sock puppets so we decided to his side
on that one right away
the
i'll ask each other questions let make each other's brains about wow they really do this wow are they in the first to do that well islands are good story it now i think approximately one hundred fifty thousand people die between one edition to the newspaper in the next of course we don't hear about all of those in here about a sliver and then of those we have to pick three
three it's difficult job for sure
shortly after she joined the team she started getting emails from readers who are noticing the people left out why don't you have more women and people of color in pages you focus too much and white men
and as a woman of color this resonated with me and i wondered about it too and unkind and tucked it in their corner my mind
then one day amy discovered that the woman who brought tennis to the united states never gotten an obituary center i that away and corner of my mind and it sent her on a journey to see who else to new york times missed we often say that obituaries are kind of a review look at this i
yeah i'm representing society as we see today they're representing couple of generations ago and a couple of generations ago
women and people of color we're not really invited to the table to make a difference the way white men were so we thought maybe this was the perfect time to tell their stories the list was law there are a lot of big names spend surprised sarah's diane as brilliant photographer sylvia plath up
oh it fair
charlotte bronte the writer who wrote jane eyre another one whereas i'd be wells she was a journalist and sephora just who pioneered the anti lunching campaign she was one of the first people to create a newspaper i a black person or a black people specifically
and she is considered one of them most successful black all alive at the time and oddly we had a notice on the front page of the new york times when she got married but we had absolutely nothing about her death
when the editors came to me with this project i can't say that i was surprised to learn that the new york times didn't write about i to be wells death
but it was very very striking kill him dickerson is a national reporter for the times
be wells was born a slave in eighteen sixty two and holly springs mississippi this is the heart of the deep south
and the next year slaves are emancipated so she grows up during this period of reconstruction where you see dramatic black advancement black people go from being slaves to being able to vote including out to be wells father knew even see some being elected into state legislatures my earliest recollections
of reading the newspaper to my father and and admiring group of his friend he was interested in politics and i heard the words ku klux klan long before i knew what they meant i knew dimly that it meant something fearful by the anxious where my mother walked to the floor at night when my father was out to a political meeting our
job was to go to school and learn all we could
and then when i to be wells is sixteen years old her parents and a sibling she's one of eight they die of yellow fever so she takes on caring for the rest of her siblings she starts to work as a teacher after she drops out of high school and she finishes her own education at night and on the weekends that i think there's experience as hard as it
was it really embolden thing for her more than anything else right she's sixteen years old a black girl in the south but it gives her the sense that she can do a lot more than i think another woman in her circumstances might have even been able to fathom
and she applies bat boldness almost right away because there's a dramatic whiplash in the south almost all of these advancements that come out of reconstruction are reversed in the form of jim crow this is where you see racial segregation codified into law and with jim crow
oh comes a kind of cultural acceptance of violence against african americans and the worst example of this is lynching
so there's a period from the eighty nine used to the early nineteen hundreds when lynchings number in the thousands and you see crowds of people gather to watch these murders take place in cold blood
arriving here at twelve o'clock the train was met by a surging mass of humanity ten thousand strong a chair
and celebrate almost as if they're watching a sporting event
the nigger was placed upon a carnival float in mockery of a king upon throw so a is a journalist at the time she's moved from mississippi to memphis and she's watching and covering and watching and coverings lynchings here smith was placed upon a scaffold six feet square and ten feet high security
round within the view of all the be holders
here the victim was tortured for fifty minutes by red hot iron brands the rust against his quivering body commencing at the fee to brands replaced upon him and to buy and then so they were thrust against the face he played in rise in bodily and mental pain
then kerosene was poured upon him cottonseed halls place beneath him and set on fire she's observing these lynchings take place and she views them as what she calls a violent form of subjugate mission to terrorize black people so much that they become scared into submission
his clothes were torn off piecemeal and scattered in the crowd people catching this reds and putting them away as mentors and even when it's over people mutilate the body is they take fingernails and pieces of rope as souvenirs it was horrible every grown from the fiend
contortion of his body was cheered by the sickly packed crowd of ten thousand persons hundreds of people turned away but the vast crowd still looks calmly on
killing this sounds like an especially could have an awful
be data of covering lynchings you have here an african american journalist and editor who seems to have made it the focus of her journalists and how did she handle that how she react to it
i think it's hard to overstate how difficult this coverage must have been for her as a journalist and in fact there's one lynching in particular that really changes everything for her that's when a close friend of hers name thomas moss is himself lynched it was part of a grocery store
since i've been killed over a fight breaks out between black and white children and were playing marbles he's arrested over this fight brought into jail and then in the middle of the night a mob shows up at the jail they drag him out of his jail cell in his pajamas and they murder him in cold blood
after thomas masses killed to be wells changes the course of her life
february seventh william butler hickory creek texas july fourteenth allen butler lawrenceville illinois october twenty fourth two unknown negroes next point louisiana november fourth she decides to take on the issue of wrenching in a really aggressive way january twenty first
robert landry chicken georgie richard davis st james parish louisiana september sixteen thousand julian dazzle junior college
john wall generals


we'll be right back

the free speech memphis tennessee may twenty first eighteen ninety two eight negroes learned since last issue of the free speech one little rock arkansas she sets out on a reporting mission across the south and she chronicles dozens and dozens of similar cases to find out what's really going on
she conducts extensive interviews she pulls official records she does data analysis august thirty first or yarborough taxes and on september nineteenth as houston a call it man was found lynched but so little attention was paid to the matter that not only was no record of made as to why these last two men were lynched but even their name
we're not given i mean in in many ways wells comes up with blueprint for investigative journalism that we still use today
and she doesn't because remember she's a black woman in the south who was born a slave
she doesn't have any inherent authority says she has to create it and she does it with evidence so this whole genre is kind of created out of necessity
through because of her position her status as a black woman who is probably didn't have a professional networks it sounds like the that's what forces her to be so thorough to be so enterprising and so dog it exactly to come up with these airtight arguments
that why people who may not have otherwise listen to her can deny and
what kinds of cases she find who was lynched and what was the reason given for the lynching rate attempted rape alleged rape suspicion of rape and the vast majority of cases she finds they begins with a black man who is accused of raping a white woman and said that particular allegation she
really is euros and on she decides to question it
and she does a systematic study in which she finds that there is very rarely any evidence of a sexual assault having taken place
and instead in fact she very often finds evidence of what was it consensual interracial relationship and she publishes her findings in a series of editorials and the newspaper that she compiles under the title southern whores and her findings are really upsetting to people not just because of what
she says but because of how she says it she writes nobody in this section of the country believes the threadbare old lie that negro men rape white women and then she really does not pull any punches at a time when it is not accepted for black men and white women to be together so
she's through were reporting showing that the rationale for word is already kind of shockingly unjustified act is bogus
his fiction

killen why was this important to wales why did she feel the need to document these lynchings in such fine detail she writes about how the people who are lynch
sort forgotten there very often nameless faceless no one knows their stories and said that becomes really important to her shootings it's important to remember that these were of real people with full lives with families thomas mass had a two year old child and his wife was pregnant when he was killed
my eyes filled with tears as outside of the list of unfortunate they had no requiem and like many a brave union soldier their bodies lay in many an unknown and on honored spot
she writes that if she didn't tell the stories her subjects would be forgotten by all save the night wind no memorial service to bemoan their sad and horrible fate
how did people react to the third uncomfortable line of reporting very aggressively very violently stories are written about her that call her a harlem and accord is on in the press and she's seen as this sort of time
packed less aggressor the likes of which people really have never seen before and they don't know what to do it
her newspaper is ransacked and she's lucky that she wasn't there are many people think that she would have been killed her life is threatened and she actually has to leave the south after these editorials are published and she never goes back because she's not safe anymore
who
then what happens to her
she moved to chicago where she continues to work as an activist she helps to found some really prominent civil rights organizations including the n double a c p but it doesn't last she's soon edged out of the leadership of this organization and others by names you know like poker to washington w e b two boys people who
we're much more conservative in their tattoos who were much more willing to be diplomatic when it came to the way that they communicated their causes and she just wasn't diplomatic with the white community exactly so her popularity really ebbs pretty dramatically later in life she runs for the state senate in illinois and but cheap
loses pretty badly
and then she dies when she's just sixty eight years old of kidney disease and nineteen thirty one in even though she is arguably the most famous african american woman of her time
her death was barely notice that a public she doesn't even get an obituary in the new york times


it strikes me is painfully ironic that it was her life's mission to document this era
and these injustices but then she herself and her life
didn't get documented
it is ironic and she's left out of a lot of black history so you know i think she came so far before her time
not just as an african american but as an african american woman
for his much of an impact as she was able to make she was one person so she knew how easy it was for this kind of thing to happen and that's precisely why she focused so intensely i'm keeping records and proving the humanity of african americans proving that black people are worthy of the same treatment as whites
and in fact she writes the afro american is not a beast your raise if this work can contribute in any way toward proving this and at the same time arouse the conscious of the american people to demand for justice to every citizen and punishment for a law by the lawless i also feel i have done my race of service
other considerations are of minor important


the writings of the wells were voiced by michelle duster
who for ten years has been trying to dedicate a monument in chicago in recognition of her great grandmother to be wells
