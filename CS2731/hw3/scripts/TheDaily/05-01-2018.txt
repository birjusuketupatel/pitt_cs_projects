
from the new york times ah michael barbara
this is the deal
today
forty nine questions
the times obtained the list of what the special council wants to ask the president of the united states about what happened
and why
it's tuesday
may first
number one what is your knowledge of calls the general fund made with closely act in late december of two thousand and sixteen
number two what is your reaction to press accounts on january embers flying do thing and in what do you know regarding sally is number four hours a decision made to request the resignation of general i've learned a professor at a meeting with jeans and me on february did you say ankle in what did you do about that
president do attitude general cleaners i learned what he calls or efforts made by reading the intelligence community assessment
number eleven and number sixteen number seven twenty what was special occasions after the january twenty
mice that tell me about these questions that you got your hands what we have is a list of forty nine question that robber mahler a special council wants to ask donald trump about where are these quests
guns come from if you can say these questions were written down by trumps lawyers in a meeting with mahler's investigators in march mahler really wants to sit down interview trump trump actually wants to do the interview as well
but the president's lawyers at the time led by john down thought it was a very very bad idea
and what was going on was that mahler's folks were trained get down to come along and agreed to let trump do the interview
so what happened was his they brought down over to the special counsel's office and they said look here are the questions we want to ask and they started rattling them off
down the other lawyers their took it down and created this document these forty nine questions that they knew mahler wanted to ask trump
it was an effort and transparency and never did trying to win them over for the interview now you have to understand is that dowd looks at these questions and says this is not good this is not a good thing for the president this will put the president in a very difficult spot he doesn't have the
confidence in the president to give the interview without making a false statement are going off on a tangent
dad tries to make that argument realizes the president is not going to listen to him that the president wants to do the interview and down says i can't have a client that's not going to listen to me i think him going in as a terrible idea
i'm going to resign he leaves a team
so let's read these questions how do you break these forty nine inquiries from the special counsel down how do you organize them
the lawyers terms lawyers broken into four categories
general mike flynn
the former national security advisor who was fired less than a month into trumps presidency after it came out that he hid misled the vice president about the nature of his calls with the russian ambassador during the transition get every one category to call me former f b i director james call me the third
third category
is the prisons relationship with his attorney general jeff session
the fourth one is about russia
connections between trumps associates in russia
if you step back and look at it it's interesting because what began almost two years ago
as a counter intelligence investigation into rushes meddling in the election and ties between trumps campaign in russia
is focused almost as much if not look three or four categories on obstruction
let's start with the first set of questions about michael flynn what is the focus of those questions
flynn questions are fairly straightforward and arrow along the lines of questions that have been out there in the public since flynn was fire in february of two thousand and seventeen what did trumped know about flings calls with the russian ambassador how is the decision made to get rid of flynn
one that stood out at me with question number eight which said after falling resigned what calls or efforts were made by people associated with you to reach out to general flynn or discussed flynn seeking immunity or a possible pardon
this gets it his story that we had written last month about how the president's lawyer john god had discussions with flings lawyer about a possible pardoned right well the question is was the president or his associates her lawyers trying to use a pardon to
stop flying from cooperating so here you have mahler in march telling trumps lawyers about this question even before we made a public in april showing then mahler knew about it before we publish the story
let's turn to the second bucket james call me call me what the questions are under the same ones that we have saw did trumped ask call me down the investigation what were his motivations did that happen why is it that trump asked call me for his loyalty
dinner what were the president's motivations behind this war we're all of those trump call me interactions about we've obviously heard a lot from jim call me right out how this went down in how he saw it all but mahler wants to know mr president what was the purpose of the january two thousand and seven dinner meeting you
had with komi was loyalty disgust did you communicate with comedy concerning his status at the end of the dare those are the questions them mahler wants to ask trump to understand his side of this right so much of this is about true men and a room and we've always had that his element
factor and so now we finally get the other person's take flights but mahler's also saying okay what did you mean regarding your statements to leicester hold about call me in russia this is the famous interview that trump gave to leicester whole right after he fired call me in which he said he had rush on his mind when he did it right what does he mean by that
correct in what was the purpose of the may twelfth tweet they call me better hope there are no tapes that is the tweed they call me says led him to have his friend leak the memo about the february fourteenth interaction the oval office when call me says trump bass in the end the fun investigation so mother wants to know what present rotten
meant when he wrote that tweet correct okay so that's one two three was about attorney general sessions what are those questions emphasizing from other the long tortured relationship between the president and his attorney general jeff sessions
what did you thinking what did you do regarding sessions is recusal disease in february of two thousand and seventeen there's reports out there that sessions may not have been forthcoming with congress about his meetings with russians during the campaign the president goes nuts as the white house counsel dawn began
try and lobby sessions not to recuse himself
the president looks at the person running the justice department is someone who should be loyal to him that the most important thing to him he's very upfront about that
the question mahler's trying to get at here is what is it that was motivating the president to have someone so loyal to him run the investigation did you have any discussions about whether the age he was going to protect him what efforts did you make to try and get him to changes
minding reverse about to accused or and what of these questions from mahler about eight sessions or do they driving at legally and and that's totally what the question is was trying trying to replace sessions to get someone in place who would and mahler investigation would it be someone that would
not be were cues from the investigation and one new guy actually oversee it and could do with the president wanted with the russian investigation right and this is an ongoing situation because jeff sessions remains attorney general and his estate to recuse himself from the russia investigation and all that has happened as a result of that continues to infuriate the president it is
in issue that has not gone away and it has been something that people around the president around sessions say all continued to get worse if the russia investigation intensifies the fourth and final bucket fourth and final bucket russia question good old fashioned collusion
the original question of the investigation interestingly mahler wants to know about the two thousand and thirteen trip to russia this is this trip trump took to moscow when he on the missed the universe pageant they had the miss universe perjury in moscow what communication or relationships do you have with the aga laura
you were paying trump to have the miss universe pageant in moscow in any russian government officials there were discussions did you have during the campaign regarding any meeting with vladimir potent what discussions did you have during the campaign regarding us sanctions towards russia
what involvement did you have and the communications strategy regarding the june nine thousand and sixteen trump tower meeting in the release of dawn juniors emails concerning the same this is how did the white house train explain the june two thousand and sixteen meeting when don junior sits down with the russians promising dirt on hillary clinton right
what interaction and communication is that you have with michael cohen whose office in residences were raided in manhattan
earlier this month is part of an investigation into his work for the president cutting deals with women who had made allegations against the president and a guy named feel like seder and others including foreign nationals regarding real estate developments in russia during the period of the campaign
another one which is sort of a central question of the entire russia investigation what knowledge good you have of communications with the regarding roger stone person's associated with roger stone julian assigned your wiki leaks the question being what did the president no of the release of the russians emails they had hacked from democrat
did the president know anything about there
and this final line of inquiry is as you said mike about that sort of foundational question of the mother of investigation which is russian meddling and the election
a subject that has of course expanded a lot in the months since the investigation began i'm struck that this final set of questions is much more fast paced what happened
what did you know when did you know it or as all the other questions in the first three categories about what's happened since the campaign are much more about the president's motivations and feelings this comes back to a discussion john down had with robert mahler in one of the meetings about
the interview
john god says look will answer all these questions for you will given que and writing you need this information we will give it to you
in mahler says i need to question the president to know whether he had criminal intent what was behind the decisions what was truly motivating they're looking at how the president pulled the lever of power since he came into our
office how did he wield his power why did he wields power legally the president can replace his attorney general he can replace his f b i director he can even trying and in investigation of you thinks it's a real problem for the country
but the question is what or the motivations what was the intent i'm curious though when it comes to a federal investigation it's easy to prove that someone is lying about whether something happened right either a did happen or it didn't happen and the person was honest about or they warn isn't it hard to know if someone is telling the truth about how they
fell about what their motivations are can't they just inherently fig that because we can't know someone's head will you touch on one of the difficulties year proving and ten is one of the most difficult things prosecutors investigate and unless you have someone at the time seeing yes the president told me i did
this because of acts
in the person can hide their intent if you did something and never told anyone your intention no one will truly know why you did it and will mahler saying is then i need to question him directly about that simply getting written responses to this is not enough i need to understand directly from him why he did
did the things he did
at this point does the president planned to sit down with mahler's team and answer these forty nine questioned and any other questions they have the president wants to sit down and do the interview and the president has lawyers now that will go along with that john down was not one of those lawyers and that's why
would i do you think anything changes for the trump team or the special councils team now that these questions are public because of your reporting
no i don't i don't think so
maybe they can send me answers to the questions would be good or a better idea
our colleague matter puzo had was trying to get me to interview trumpet only ask the forty nine questions that isn't intriguing maybe a good prop open golf course and say hey and hope that he says yeah i can do the interview
finally my whiny you think that these questions are being made public now i recognize that's a tricky question for you since you are part of the recording process making a profit but why do you think that someone even if we can never know who would give you these questions to make them public i think there's a lot of people in washington
who are our nerve by the president and believe the more sunlight and attention that anything related gets is going to be something that is good
and they feel bad pushing information out he is a way to do this and to keep the public's focus on the issue bud light bulb mahler i don't know everyone's intentions and was this more or less what you expected these questions to be a questions that mother would be that we were
kind of sort of laughing about him a bit thing
these sat us down and say hey come up with forty nine questions they asked donald trump about the rush investigation they probably be very similar to learn a ton new here but
the depth and breadth of it is deal something that strikes me you sort of cover this story different angles and narratives pile up and then you can have a bank in your readers go wow there's a lot of questions about the president's time and office and of stuff that went on and the campaign
doubt we still don't know the answer to that the president still has not answer
and we still don't all the why correct
you know sometimes the truth takes so long time for us out
twenty six did you have a discussion about whether he directly the purpose of wasn't even sure if you don't mind going to have a nice it out
national cancer
he says she has raised
three
give us a losers an obsession
the two thousand and thirteen
our town meeting real estate development and in russia or any meeting with me
yeah
he like
thank you mike
thanks for all be right back
here's what else you need to know
tonight we will present the world never before exposed information
on the television achievements one of the biggest israel
no in a theatrical televised presentation on monday night
the prime minister of israel benjamin netanyahu accused iran have repeatedly lied about its nuclear program just days before president trump is set to decide whether to pull out of the nuclear deal with it
going to show something like a world of never seemed to an art gonna review no conclusive proof of the secret nuclear weapons program
iran has been hiding for years from the international community
and it's a comment on netanyahu presented viewers with a massive archive of records stolen by israel from a secret warehouse in toronto that he suggested undermined the nuclear is what the files and crowded
nominated and documents
prominent in charge comment
president urged me how many parents
edit photos
and video
but netanyahu did not provide any evidence that iran had violated the terms of the nuclear deal since it went into effect
raising the possibility that his real goal was to give president trump rationale for pulling out of the agreement later this month
as trump has repeatedly threatened to do in response iran deputy foreign minister called netanyahu's presentation quote very childish and a prearranged show with the aim of impacting trumps decision

that's it
i'm like obama seat
