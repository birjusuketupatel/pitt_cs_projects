
for the new york times i'm michael moore wow this is eddie
today
steve ben has declared war on the republican party he may be out of the white house but that he says
only makes him strong
his battle plan for the soul of america
it's friday
november tenth

you are behind enemy lines headquarters of the opposition
i don't regard
jarvis and or
and the job search
sure
if it wouldn't
jerry peters why is steve tanner and so significant at this moment this is the man who led the trunk campaign to victory now he's waging his own war on the republican party to defeat and this place as many sitting republican senators as he can he views as too cozy with the political or
that was from now the outcome of that by whether or not it ben and right wing if you want to call in the party emerges i think answers the question of whether or not the american to party political system as we know it is blown apart
so love him or hate him there are few people as central to american politics right now as steep that
i was very up front when i left the white house that was i thought the republican establishment was starting the president's agenda
in fact are very for i said it's almost like nullification they're trying to nullify the two thousand and sixteen election so why does have to be a war they just like return over power go in and say hey we have a better idea we have better ways we want to run things are just start going i gotta give it to you know if you seen what much macau of i have been going after each other his henchmen
i've been going after me and said some very unpleasant things about mitch mcconnell not personal things but professional things war of words a war of ideas them excessive force is definitely other me i think i've already discovered a few different ways
awards or revolution
could be a civil war within the republican it is a i think a revolutionary movement reform movement or civil war a war some of the rudder gets a little heated because i think also it helps to have a sense of drama of this that these are big historical moments and a very big historical moment in your seen the exact same thing on the left and because the law
does not have a bright but there's not really have a news organization
that one of its principal focuses is turning the spotlight on the corruption and incompetence of the democratic establishment i think that's more the reasons that the revolt by the democratic left and the progressive left against the wall street ownership of the democratic party and the corruption that they have been many years and coming
i get you can see it coming it's going to be just as vitriolic because the stakes are very high it's gonna be just as vitriolic as as the one on the right so just in a couple of sentences
paul brevity is know exactly how old the history books describe this war is a populist as a populist nationals revolt against the global elite that ran the republican party and really part of the global elite that runs the country this would be looked at as a revolt of working class people of both
both parties
okay at a time that really rejected the permanent local class that is inextricably linked both republican and democrat in washington dc and try to take back their government and had it have more responsive themselves face or one is trumps selection his face to the conservative populace takeover of congress yes absolutely it's the now
start to take over these institutions now why mitch mcconnell because the institution of the majority leader has so much power and he is used that power trip quite frankly fourth president trumps agenda
right in one of the ways they've done it with paul ryan and them because they have three committees on the hill they're investigating collusion so you see from a condo it's been no supports been it's been allowing these committees ago failing miserably to get obama care of to her place where yet to see with their
to do on taxes but this is not fundamental tax reform i mean it's gonna be a tax cut with a tax reform but it's certainly not what people invasion at first and i hold that to mitch mcconnell feel that his greatest defense is not supporting the president or our greatest offense is not supporting the president enough as of now
mcconnell has to go do you think mitch mcconnell will be majority leader at this time next year i actually do not think will be majority is that your personal mission to make that happen
it's not my personal mission but i have a objective that mitch car will not be majority leader and are believed to be done before this time next year


so i know you watched the speech and i wonder what you thought when you listen to him denounced the president and say our children are watching what what we tell them if we don't speak up now i think some people saw that as a man speaking truth to power of that something i think you understand
know that the gimme a break one is what his children looking at is a country that flake was while the guys that looked the other way in allowed this country to start to lose its sovereignty by unlimited illegal immigration in particular in the state of hers are what they're looking at his lack of job opportunities because we have shipped all of the manufacturing jobs virtually in this
china that's what jeff microphone so when he gets own these guys get all high and mighty and i see with donald trump said and will how he represents working class people and how he's trying to make their lives better jeff like is a total incomplete phony okay everything he says everything he does i have absolutely zero respect from a be such a picture
tell him to step down and run against kelly ward in a primary let's see what the people of arizona have to say let's see what his constituencies have to say about him go back to arizona a convinced the says arizona that you stand for something trump doesn't always agree on everything doesn't agree on everything with you so now trump isn't this having on
a
trump isn't this interesting position he was the ultimate outsider you have captured the press yes now he's on the inside is he an agent of yours in this war or is he an enemy or is he now he's a he look he's the leader of this movement he's he's is embodied because we you go back and look at him over the last twenty five or thirty years i mean he is pretty
this day in a day or so he embodies it he's also a charismatic leader some ways galvanized people remember think in the washington post that said about a month ago i'm the only person in the inner circle of trump that truly believes he's a global revolutionary figure and he is i believe in his greatness
wow trump his greatness with any if he just sticks to his plan if he just sticks to what he promised the american people if he sticks to that he's going to have to walk through fire right going can't be a lot of bad days and they'll be more bad days and there are good days but at the end of it at the end of it he's going to win reelection or four hundred electoral votes and he'll be he'll be considered the
pantheon of reagan in lincoln and others as great presidents about you have to stick with the program where you know better than anyone you work with them you have to corral him you had to keep and disciplined and our message this is not an easy thing to do how does he stick to the program
look of i didn't have to crow and he he's he's actually a very self discipline the media does the him credit to run their can a campaign we ran
gonna say something else he understands mass communications to the populace much more sophisticated than i do and i think i'm pretty good i'm a junior varsity compare to him that he did things are the campaign he'll do that
the twitter of the way you phrased things away wants to see things so this is hard to master planets and i just impetuous i think that you know certainly as he has different voices around him and i think why the the things for the struggles we've had in the ministrations and one of the struggles he will he will have going forward is that there's one school of thought
that says yes the program you laid out the american people is a program of disruption
it is to go after certain central institutions in american life to change them so that they work better for the working man or went to this country working class a middle class and eventually work better for the country itself
it's that that we're gonna be isolationists is not that we're going to be detached from the world is not that you're going to be some no nationalist country is the exact opposite but you're gonna have to take on the establishment everyday and they're not going to have their power easily okay but don't know but that that path is very torture
it's very tough you have to fight every day you have to take on the swap right is want some shooting we've got four but this industry link power structure of the permit political class which is not going to of their power easily because the great business model they have if you do that you're going to have some bumpy roads but there's suddenly
it uplands on the other side of that you have the bit now there's others say you have to moderate you have to bring try to bring people together right and the people in the administration that you had some very strong differences
that you will be online later to you will be light you will be light right my thing is do what popularity now or do you want to be loved it you want to be beloved in history by your country because you did the right time trump viscerally connects with a large part of the american population just like president obama did can
with a large part of american vote for the longevity of your movement for the survival of it
you can't replicate try and so would were not what do you do without him when he have to either have to build institutions or were trying to get think tanks build the the one of the first thing is though is almost institutionalization of this of this coalition of all these various grassroots groups to actually get now engage in vetting candidates right to vet can
as for the senate to look at how they put together grassroots army maybe they were collectively the institutions of this have to be built and you're absolutely correct donald trump or sometimes leave the battlefield i think you'll leave it at the end of his second term he may stay on as head this movement after that but there is some point in time that down from you know is that the
person by the way the democrats had the same problem after obama guy barack obama guys i doubt probably come along once in a generation


you're aware of this caricature that exists of you in the media
i wonder if you want to meet inherited her
i'm thinking the grim reaper mask on saturday night live and let's go back to the person because i don't really address like i know i was always think the liberal media see what you see i think it's it's interesting because i was basically virtually unknown as of relatively small part of the conservative movement and now people are dressing up as you for halloween
have you gone from from being totally anonymous to behave a halloween costume remember what is that how you process i don't even think about you
have i changed in the time you've know me
no only thing i do is i don't wear shorts much as i used to when i think i new you for a year and i never wore long pants time
so so i don't care what they say at the i really don't care it doesn't matter people to say anything raising they can do is you know the desert trade your very self aware you are seen by a lot of people on the left as the white nationalist as the native this does that bother you
our program is so different than i think is actually a power as we power through and here's why i'm anti semite talk to master the way that the israeli says the most pro israel guy in the way how steep a second ana i set up by poachers long so the
so ridiculous that the facts come out and actually make

oh for sure
what the however they didn't like the know so so if you prefer that it's just like the white nationalists have nothing further have condemned the some charlie rose the patient part ethnic nationalism is ridiculous right
it's absurd the guys there are quite frankly creatures of the mainstream media the left media there's a handful of them nobody takes them seriously
because they can't be taken seriously they're not serious people the economic nationalism and particularly as these ideas get around people understand it is the thing that binds us together what i mean by that it doesn't matter what your races what your ethnicity is what your color is what your religion is what your gender is
or what your sexual preference is what matters is that your citizens united states of america right you should get a priority right you shouldn't be the last guy in line and you should be paying for everything else that you know trade and illegal immigration are just two sides of the same coin
the unfair trade deals are just having unfair competition by foreign labor against american working men and women and illegal immigration is just letting the foreign workers in the country but the people have been most affected negatively by globalization in this country are the working class hispanics and blacks as country which really have taken up
his way that is why trumps economic nationals program of trying to stop illegal immigration with more importantly tell country to signal the countries overseas there's going to be tariffs and this going to be quotas right unless you start to major stuff here and you're saying business investment what up ten percent and you start to see
foreign business investment because people want to get here in the united states but if there's a certain segment of the population and amount and and significant one that sees that agenda as white nationalist that sees the president picking fights with black nfl players and saying don't turn on these confederate monumental a cow is that not detriment actions actions speak
louder than words you just have to be you gonna have to you can't wish that away because the opposition parties not gonna let you wish away it is a way to smear somebody is a fear tactic the only way you know the fear tactic is you have results
if you start bringing jobs back to the midwest if you stop illegal immigration and the black working class as back working class i said this from day one and our movement when we get to twenty five thirty percent of the black working class and stag working class and the black middle class and spec milk has voting for us we will have a realignment like nineteen thirty two and there's nothing to stop us from doing efforts have getting in power
supporting how do you get there though so many of those people minorities hispanics blacks or we have to be you as a white national when you have to have to just want you have to convey a when elections you have to continue to to implement your policy and he gave away our thinking sit there and talk your way through this you just have to show people everyday the actions we have
to change the system we have to go and get these trade deals to start to take care of the american worker not just the american company the american worker and that's when things were going to have to do about the way i know they'll do whatever time so there's no doubt though that that message of president trumps has appeal with white nationalists and
is that
reality and no consequence i think it's i think it's nonsense of the instances that he said he apologized them at all i think these guys grab on to anything and know the message is one of the guys at least races guy i've ever met in nothing in the campaign in nothing aged under date
oh that's all left point sms see nonsense and by the way you can't help but a couple of these guys are marginally a to marginally right so they'll grab on anything and by the way we can they say trumps name him after embassies get a camera in the new york times has an article on it right because you're obsessed with solution rather the day a fabric years after one hundred percent
the me semi fabrication and by the way because i realize that they think the only way they can run by scaring you to be a native us massage and this racist
homophobia just can't hear his name they're saying how trump
can't you can't help what they're doing that because they know the mainstream media
they sit around do whatever they do nobody covers all right because nobody cares because they don't have any meaning or purpose okay they're so tiny and irrelevant as soon as they try to start bringing the president also and the cameras are they are seen as they are the new york times there's a front page story they play the mainstream media to build up and it's still it's irrelevant nonsense something
got me work through this all bubbled over as you know
most i think detrimental way for the president and charles
did he handle that right
in the present handler perfectly the thing i talk to him on sunday he is the first want to say says where does this all and right which is always is taking our live the washington monument is going to end and taking down the mount vernon yeah but then he has an different was talking about they're very five you're both sides is that the people that were there for their legitimate first amendment rights
to say hey i support the stature of are really stonewall jackson and hey i think it's races and it should come down by the way those people you know if you worked at at at at the city council and the county commission in then your governor's race etc that's the normal process country it was the thugs on both sides of the worst element switch gears
the russian restitution
it's i'm really lucky so now gone into fake news
it sounded earlier like you said that you don't take mitch mcconnell should be allowed in these investigations to proceed do you agree with president is the russia thing just to look i think the collusion thing is i've said from day one was a joke we can we conclude we had a tough time colluding between the trump campaign in pennsylvania and they aren't say
right i mean all of our stuff is the ground gifts i think it's a look
have some marginal guys and they were definitely some marginal people early on in the campaign because this thing was a shaggy dog all the way through the campaign early on had some larger guys in you've seen them on tv these guys are potter
this man has his marginal though
man i met a man affords stuff is financial relationships he had with you know what i don't know about his money laundering and his tax they always been accused of by the way with mama i've never said more should be fired
and the guess a commission our i do believe that bob mahler's investigation should have some parameters on it if got to do collusion that's fine i also think that i have a duration on it to go outside the lanes into to start to look at people's all these financial transactions from years and years ago now i do not believe as the purview of
what the special counsel special prosecutor set up and i've been very vocal that these people that that is incumbent upon paul ryan and mitch mcconnell to one just put an end date on the states they have to get the work done by certain day and if it's going to on collusion issued star collusion it was worth of that it from your perspective what did happen between russia and the campaign
the and it's not relevant
zero that's not a local crimes are committed by members of the campaign
if anybody anything wrong
i'm alone or to get they did something wrong they should they should be prosecuted for my points different they're saying the election was turned by the russian involvement it's b s and i want any democrat to sit there and tell me she can give a coherent case a day while she should be president of the united states she cannot they tried to play this thing to know
fyi
president trumps election to nullify they try to come of this this hoax there was this huge russian involvement in russian collusion yes i think it's nonsense that he has been nonsense from the beginning but your time in the white house look at me you are somebody who articulate a very clear vision for where this country should be going and the policies we need to implement to get us there
if you could have would you have stayed for all four years of president's no time more than one i never had that never tend to stay never tell us why are you were you able to be more effective on the outside because again and get my hands on my weapons i may come on i just a much more effective i can meet with all the grassroots groups i can do everything i remember in the white house you are federal one
lloyd your version of what you do by the way you should be restrictions i'm not arguing that you shouldn't be it's just very your federal government employee is only a certain amount of stuff you can do and by the way in the white house it's all about in it's all about can you influence the present do this can be influenced his policy etc so it's important but on the outside i can have more freedom to
to kind of these things together and i think it's just for me is so much for i mean i left the white house at at noon on friday and i was cheering the body part editorial call it at six so it's just been everyday everyday is a say in the navy every day's a holiday in every meal is a banquet so i just i enjoyed so much
i'm sure what i'm doing i've dedicated my life to build this populace nationalist movement
and by way you can have good days and bad days but i absolutely am convinced that were on the right track and were making a big difference in the country a big difference for the back but remember the back but the key to this movement
if you go back in history as the american people the american people
have always made the right decision was in the revolution was in the civil war was in world war two of the great depression and when they have full information they ultimately to a decision so how long does this problem does this more last the wars for the republican party until we tend to the country i think you're describing a war for the soul of the country more yeah i think you would either way i think accuracy bernice
as those guys of the populace left off for i think it's great for turning of american history just like the other three the revolution the civil war v look from for these things start to when they finish i tell people it could be ten fifteen twenty years and if you're not committed to work as hard as you possibly work every day as a volunteer and a grassroots organization not just
new star trek shall be will november eighth muggy day
