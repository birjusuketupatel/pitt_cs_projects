
hi everyone it's michael there's been some questions about our decision not to run excerpts from a times interview with stephen miller the white house advisor as we had planned to do in this episode some further context my colleagues julie davis and michael sheer interviewed miller as part of their reporting for a prince
story on the white house is current practice of separating parents and children at the border
they had recorded it for fact checking purposes and it was only after the story was published with on the record quote from miller that the daily requested to air the audio as part of an interview with julie about her reporting the white house objected because the terms of the original interview had not included
it's use on the daily we recognize that the ground rules for the interview or not clear and so we made a decision not to use the audio there was much discussion about this decision and we took it very seriously
from the new york times on michael
this isn't it

today
president trump continues to blame democrats for his administration's practice of separating parents and children at the
so why is one of his top eight steven miller claiming credit

it's tuesday june ninth
i have put employees a zero tolerance policy for illegal entry on us out west or you the southwest or unlawfully then we will prosecute you said
children are being separated from the parents at the border at an accelerated rate because of a new a zero tolerance policy being implemented by the trump administration the associated press reports between april nineteenth and may thirty first nearly two thousand children were separated from their parents a white house says my goal is to deter a little bored
no crossings the democrats say family a separation is inhumane and want to
usually you talked recently with stephen miller present it trumps domestic policy advisor about this very controversial situation playing out at the border with parents and children being separated and we were going to hear that audio on the shoulder right
julie davis covers the white house and immigration for the times we were no i heard from the white house earlier today bad day were not at all comfortable with using that audio be when i went in the west wing to interview even know nowhere with night last year in high you're at the time
the purpose was we were doing a big deep dive story on my aberration brackets broken out all over the country and we didn't talk about any sort of alternative
the interview and when they found out that his voice was actually going to be on apart after disgusting have a were not happy about it after fun to use that
so instead of hearing that audio we're going to talk to you about the conversation you had with stephen miller and his thinking around this practice so how does to talk about how the immigration system used to work he eventually talked about it as an open borders approach where there was no i'm
essentially only immigration well as is obviously a law against crossing the border unlawfully but in the past it's often been charge as a civil infraction so you're taken into custody by immigration authorities if you claim later on that she were seeking asylum your health for a time
and given a court eight after which you have to show up and plead your case isn't a file and claimant others are put in immigration detention and if you're traveling with a child
you were treated differently
how so first of all there was a settlement decree and nineteen ninety seven known as as that essentially it's bad that if an unaccompanied child was apprehended at the border a could not be how of immigration detention indefinitely in fact they couldn't be held for very long period of time at all and the time
period that was decided upon was about twenty days
the immigration crisis is intensifying president obama today requesting emergency fund a mostly to keep on documented children from coming here to the united states and to help send them back despite his come from central america el salvador guatemala and hundred euro
where immigration officials are moving more than a thousand undocumented killed to this makeshift detention center this weekend more than two hundred and twenty immigrants have died crossing that us mexico border since october and more than fifty two thousand unaccompanied kids have been detained in that same time period at the height of the central america
and migration crisis under barack obama they were playing a huge amount of families arriving at the border
and they were holding them in immigration detention for quite a long period of time the obama administration is facing broad criticism for its handling of the serbs of undocumented immigrants crossing the border immigration lawyers are once again suing the obama administration over its practices immigrant family detention they were stewed and a fair
errol judge decided in two thousand and sixteen at this twenty day time limit should apply to you not just unaccompanied immigrant children but immigrant children who were accompanied by their parent in other words family so essentially if you are going to hold a family together you can't hold them for more than twenty days
an immigration detention
so essentially what you had is a flooded people arriving at the border believing that they could make an asylum claim it would be taken into custody temporarily and a would be given a time when they could appear back to leave their case and in the meantime they would be released into the interior of the country and this is what the president and even miller
referred to as catch and release and you're supposed to show up for your game before and immigration judge but in reality many people never do so
essentially a ban is the major objection here if you're asking that you have administration that effectively there was no penalty for crossing the border illegally because people never paid a price and a were allowed into the country

so are most of them
crossing the border to seek asylum or the trying to sneak undetected him the country and just been caught
some people of course they're trying to sneak across the border without being caught but the vast majority of people that were talking about are at least staying at a want to claim asylum they're saying they have a credible fear of returning to their country because of gang violence or be persecuted or for some other reason okay and an all those to do
relations whether they're seeking asylum or not under the obama administration these families would stay together
right so by the strict letter of the law crossing the border illegally is a criminal act on the books but in the past before present from it often wasn't prosecuted as a criminal act and the result of that was that by prosecuting it as a civil violation many people were released in
the u s and they effectively succeeded in crossing the border of the u s
that's right and the problem was compounded by the fact that there is a huge backlog a years long backlog of asylum claims and so essentially it would be years before they ever got around to eat even determining whether you deserved to be granted asylum
so from the perspective of stephen miller and the tramp point house for a whole variety of reasons unintended consequences of legislation and court rulings and some decisions made by past administrations it is now currently in the interest of someone crossing the border to
come with children right and that's to steve miller a problem if you're trying to crack down on on documented immigration
that's great and i mean i'll talk about how smugglers are bad people and they will do what they need to do to get people across and if that means having them cross with somebody that's posing as their child that's certainly not outside the realm of possibility and has happened before they also talk about the fact that you can't have a whole class of people for any
crime or any offense that it's just simply exempted from the laws by dint of the fact that there with a child at one point in our interview he said imagine if in the context of domestic law if you said that the speed limit doesn't apply to you if you have a child in the backseat you can you imagine what the consequences of that would be and one of the
things he says is a lot more child endangerment and that is in fact his argument that you're putting children in danger because you're essentially encouraging people to use them
as a means to get across the border which is a very dangerous trip it's a very dangerous crossing and then when they get into the country certainly it could be a pretty dangerous road ahead for them
so in his mind this is a humane policy i think you use the word humanitarian in his interview with you because it discourages people from taking a risk his trip with children across the border or using someone else has children
the masks to legally get to the country
right he says are as the humanitarian policy and i think that's actually for two reasons one is you're essentially trying to discourage people from putting children in a dangerous situation or using them as a means of breaking the law but then in another sense this is where even miller and the president make the sort of pivot to
the broader immigration system which they stay essentially is so lax and so insufficiently enforce that you're and essentially endangering american citizens to potential crimes by illegal border cross there's they talk about the fact that there's families separation when you take a child away from someone who is
i'm awfully cross the border but there's also a permanent am a separation when an illegal immigrant murderers and american citizen if you really care about families if you really don't want families to be broken apart you really need to fix the system and do all of the things the president has asked for including build a wall including make it more difficult to be eligible for asylum in this country
including cutting legal immigration and all of these other things that have really nothing to do with the current crisis so this is also an act of humanitarian ism according to stephen miller on behalf of the american people
indeed
so this does seem like a genuinely challenging problem for the federal government crossing the border is an illegal act but so many people crossing com with children and you can't kill children and you can't hold families for long periods of time and there's a true
mendez administrative backlog so it does feel like an impossible situation
well it is an impossible situation and that's why administrations have struggled with that for so long when george w bush first implemented and one hundred percent prosecution policy the there was quite a bit of discussion around what do you do with family is but ultimately it was decided that you know there was no way
you're going to take a child away from their parent you're going to keep them together and there going to be a different path but it was sounds like you're saying it was considered a policy of separating families and children
it's always been on the table there's no question that has always been on the table my colleague michael scherer talk to the domestic policy adviser under obama billion when us and she's dead you know he basically talked about it for about five minutes and thought we just can't do that that's not who we are but clearly presidents have understood that this is an option that you know it would make things a lot
it's simpler and more clear cut but no one was really willing to go there including by the way the trump administration john kelly then the homeland security secretary now the white house chief of staff said publicly in an interview early last year that he was considering doing this in order to deter people from making the dangerous journey from central america to the us
porter and there was a ton of controversy a bunch of senators confronted him about it on capitol hill and he ultimately that no no no we're not going to do that
but clearly debate inside the white house and the administration continued about it and people recognize that you know there was something effective about the idea of a black and white policy that we prosecute everybody and everybody gets treated the same way and to heck with the consequences

we'll be right back

usually what does that actually look like on the ground once it's deployed it's pretty grim i mean basically what's happening is you have people coming across and they're being arrested and taken in most cases to federal prisons and their children are being taken into immigration detention at first
have seen some of the pictures of these facility youth there in one case in a converted walmart
you know have cordoned off area is often times with and thing they have caught or mattresses the bond they have space blankets the many cases and it's sort of like a mini cross between a prison in a daycare center i guess
that
and they're held there and then you know ultimately the idea is that the government has to transfer them to the least restrictive setting as soon as possible and in many cases they're trying to place them with foster parents either family members were illegally in the united states they can go stay with or people who are willing to
to take them in until they can be reunited with their peers



so
hundreds of children in this country who might enter into foster care as a result of even though their parents are very much alive and very much here that's right and one of the issues here and then you know how people can find where their children have gone i mean we were told by the department of homeland security last week
in a six week period but about two thousand and children have been separated from families that we think of the scale of trying to find where each child has been spent and get them back to their parents their parents by the way or in deportation proceedings they may be deported
theoretically a weather department of homeland security has said is and the department of health and human services which is in charge of holding the children is that the child will be reunited with the parent as soon as their immigration case is finish that is theoretically what happens but in practice what we're hearing is that it's pretty difficult to make
that happened in people are having trouble finding their kids and and is not totally clear that they have a process in place to efficiently reunite the children with their parents at least not in a timely way
if the idea of this and according to miller this is the idea of it was to clean up our immigration system this does not sound simpler it's not simple or at all and not only is it not simpler for the immigration is that some but it's also much more complicated and some
the justice department which essentially now has thousands and thousands more criminal cases to prosecute every day because of the decision to treat all of these people crossing the border
as criminal charges
so they then have to process this people and they have to go before a judge and men there's the additional challenge of the fact that now because the border stations are so clogged the we've heard reports of people not being able to even claim asylum so theoretically what you're supposed to do if you want to claim asylum is show up at a port of entry
hey i fear for my life i have a credible fear for change my country
and that is something that under us law everyone is supposed to be able to do but people have not been able to do that in recent months and so you have people who are showing up in between ports of entry and being charged with a crime even though they're saying i'm fleeing persecution in my country even the people who are showing up at ports of entry or having
trouble claiming asylum and that just shows you what strain the system is underwrite i'm curious if the goal of this whole approach is to keep these families out of the country why not just deal with the administrative backlog that you mentioned earlier so that these families will be processed within twenty
days and not have to be released into the us when the be simpler than this very old a hybrid an emotionally tormented process that is now under way while it would and the administration talks wistfully about being able to do that but they also say that they need changes to the law and order to make that a reality
so as long as it's as easy they claim as it is to claim asylum
you will have a backlog because there will be so many people flooding the system and they want to change the laws that they are more people who are just inadmissible without even processing their claim that they don't have a chance that all you her jeff sessions
a couple of weeks ago argue that a master abuse is no longer going to be counted as a criteria and for asylum claims the asylum system is being abused to the detriment of the rule of law sound public policy public safety even drew the detriment of people with just climb
through a psalm they are trying to get at this problem and a bunch of different way as one of which is having more people processing the claims another of would just saying let's try to clamp down on the claims themselves by making them a lot harder to be eligible for asylum sewing a few simple words claiming a fear of return is now transforming
a straightforward arrest for illegal entry an immediate return and jury prong legal process where an alien may be released from custody faith and truly believe that it is way too easy for people to come here and just kind of put their hands up and say i have a credible fear i have to let me in and
so they're looking for different ways to limit people's ability to do that and so changing the criteria for whether you can get asylum is one of them
but this zero tolerance one hundred percent prosecution policy also connects to that because if you're apprehended on the border
halfway crafting and you say i want to seek asylum that goes second in line to prosecuting you for the crime of illegally crossing the border
so essentially whereas other administrations have treated all of those people as asylum seekers this administration is making that secondary to the crime of having a they across the border
so under previous presidents those people have been treated first as asylum seekers ride and now the trump of integration is treating them first as criminals that's right

outraged go the troll the administration's policy of taking migrant children away from their parents protesters rally in los angeles
okay to do think that the current administration predicted that they would read this outrage to practice of separating parents from children at the border i don't think that they anticipated this at all i think that they up through the message of they were standing and the
theoretical merits of a zero tolerance
and they didn't quite contemplate the level of outrage that it would spark when they started taking children away from parents
our
not suffered heart
got stale
as have a child
my god

do you think it's possible that didn't quite understand what the result of zero tolerance would actually be that enforcing immigration law sounds good but he didn't really know that the result would be separated parents from children but stephen miller did understand that i think that's
entirely past all that he said i one zero tolerance and it's a great will do zero tolerance and they didn't get into the nitty gritty of well that means zero tolerance for infants in their mothers zero tolerance for you know that our it is the case know about you it's and pretty clear now four weeks what
logical and resulted this has been contrary to what he says that he needs the democrats to change the laws than he could tomorrow instruct the department of homeland security just start making exceptions or parents traveling with minor children but i do you think that the president although he doesn't like to take credit publicly for it
tends toward the even miller school of thought that this is a tough love thing we need to get control of the system if this is what it takes to do it this is what it takes and would never want to predict whether he's going to pull back on this because i think that the level of outrage that we're seeing around the country is pretty extraordinary but i do think the he
he seized the utility of this and it's a debate the he relishes adding i mean he will turn this on its handheld turn it upside down he will blame and on democrats he will say it's an honor of his opponents flunking open borders and to endanger the american people and it's a contest between someone who wants to keep you safe
him and people who don't want to keep you safe either democrats it's about finding the terms of the debate in a way that advantageous to him so yeah if you want to have a debate with him about is it morally a good age
separate parents from their children at the border
he's not going to engage not but if he can turn it into is tough but necessary to do so in order to protect the american people from brutal gangs and criminals
i think that's ground he is pretty comfortable on
thank you very much england

on monday the united nations top human rights zayed rod all hussein called for an immediate end to the practice of separating undocumented immigrant children from their parents the thought that any student would seek to the term parents burn and flip to such
abuse of children
unconscionable



here's what else you need to another
if i might i just wanted to they can boost a moon
immigration and what's up happening on monday at a meeting of the national space council president trough opened like doubling down on his claim that democrats are responsible for separating children from their parents at the border before making an unrelated announced my administration has reclaiming america
his heritage as the world's greatest space faring nation
the essence of the american charge of these to explore new horizons and to tame new frontier the president called for the creation of a six branch of the us armed forces devoted to outer space we are going to have the air force and we're going to have the space
face force separate but equal
that is going to be something the pentagon including trumps own secretary of defense james matters previously opposed the idea of a new military branch focused on space calling it costly and unnecessary when it comes to defending america it is not enough to merely have been
american presence in space we must have american dominance in space so important
that's it for the day i'm michael obama special thanks to republika for letting us use the audio from inside a detention center
see you tomorrow
