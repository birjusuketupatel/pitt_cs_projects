
from the new york times on my cobra
he said
today
president trough conservatives and the and are are all again pointing to mental illness in response to a school shooting but how can the mental health system stop a shooting when most shooters are mentally ill
it's friday february twenty third
i don't believe that this the same monster should have ever been able to obtain a firearm
however i do not think that he should have gotten his hands on any kind of weapon
that's number one this individual was nuts
we don't know right now exactly why this deranged individual did is a man been on and a wacko came in and shut the five of us who were shot by this mad men and their homicidal maniac people like this with mental health issues troubled young man dealt with it rang the failure of america's
mental health system issues or mental health problems there was a mental have epidemic here would use computers for a gun problem this is a mental health issue this is not a gun and your common theme with these kinds of shootings his mental illness in this is something we should not be ignored

would you like me to code you like me to prefer to you
dr pretty nationally dr byron worst personally you can always come amy me about professional a doctor barnhart okay so doctor born hirst tell me about the day of disappointment
well it started out as to stay usual day in a busy crisis
oh i work as an emergency psychiatrist
in a crisis
that's adjacent to a impatience psychiatric hospital in california we see people who are acutely eller killing crisis maybe people feeling suicidal and depressed
maybe some folks who are probably because they were hearing voices and then the police brought this kid and he was a twenty one year old and his parents had called the cops because they had gotten concerned about some other stuff he'd been posting on social media
has person kind of gotten increasingly hostile but word generally vague up until the last few days where he had made some specific references to the columbine shooting and something about some death and destruction
and one of the things he referred to in his facebook page was a day of retribution
and when the police went to his house and spoke with the parents the brother mentioned that this patient had told him he was going to try to buy a gun and their brother thought he had done so but wasn't sure
and wanted the police bring him to your office they'd been told about this posting on facebook which is alarming
why did they bring him to you
well i really hadn't committed a crime
so they couldn't arrest him
but i imagine that the police were pretty worried about this guy he certainly had a lot of concerning signs and i think they brought him to us in the hopes that maybe the mental health system would be a way that we could prevent him from going down a bad path so what are you doing first what your role in this moment
it's my first thing as i get the chart and i flip through it and see what's gone on for this young man i probably would have had any records we had on him which was none and the legal hold that the police brought him in on which was just a piece of paper with a few lines may be something as simple as making threatening postings on facebook comma might have been
guns as brother
comma parents worried look in this case i had fairly a little accept that ominous information so i always build a picture in my mind of what people are going to be like before i meet them
but he did not really jive with my mental image that i had built up women if i met this young man
and he scanned for example like in a manic episode where he was impulsive where he was talking really fast where he was delusional and grandiose that i might be indicative that he was in fact mentally ill and then maybe this idea about threatening up at school
was secondary to your mental illness that could be treated and thereby we could prevent the shooting at act of violence
but in the case of him i mean he looks
not like somebody with a mental illness he didn't have any of those science
he was a nice enough kid not particularly angry to me although it was easy to see that he had some darkness and i think he was a little swollen and depressed
not happy with his social standing and how things had been going at school
he said that he didn't think he had a mental illness he didn't want treatment he didn't need treatment he seems more like a sad brooding kid who was hurt and realized he had done something wrong and really wanted to go home
so ultimately you're trying to determine if this post on facebook was coming from a place of mental illness
or possibly something else
yeah
some trying to figure out if he is going to meet criteria to be in voluntarily admitted to a psychiatric hospital
and in california in order to be admitted to a psychiatric hospital and voluntarily you have to meet one of three criteria
do either be dangerous yourself dangerous to somebody else are gravely disabled which means that you're not able to provide for your own basic needs like your food clothing and shelter
and you have to meet one of those three things because of a mental illness so even if this young man is angry or showing propensity towards violence you'd need to determine that these emotions are coming from a mental illness in order to involuntarily committed right
so this point i'm making a primarily clinical decision about whether or not i admit this young man for treatment but i also know that my clinical decision to have legal implications for him
because there's a difference between an admission to a hospital and a commitment as dr what i do as i make the clinical decision to admit someone to a hospital
the commitment is a legal process that has done by the judge or the hearing officer
and that's the checks and balances in that system that makes sure that some doctor can't just admit people willy nilly and hold them in a hospital indefinitely with no liberties
and so if he is committed than his name goes into a federal database of people who are prohibited from purchasing guns
and any time a federally licensed dealer does a background check his name will come up as a prohibited person and he won't be able to buy a gun
but he'll still be able to purchase from private party sales and from internet sales and from controls were in most states they don't do background checks and so this is how someone like you interacts with the most people think of is the federal background checks and yes that's use forgotten purchase yes
this feels very complicated what you're describing because so often people are expressing violent thoughts but mental illness is not clear and yet as dr you want to prevent them from carrying out these acts
i assume so how do you grapple with people who fall short of that glaring mental illness but who are expressing violent thoughts
i mean it's hard because we do see people every day especially in a crisis setting that we we want to help but they don't meet that criteria for involuntary help and then help and so we have to let them go and sometimes that involves people with the potential for violence
and it is a balance between people's civil liberties and their right to make choices that i may not think are the best traces it's really hard from the vantage point of being a psychiatrist to prevent violence since most violence is not caused by mental illness
about four percent of community violence is attributable severe mental illness four percent four percent so that would mean the ninety six percent of the rest of violence occurs in the community has nothing to do with mental loss cracks
you know how mental illness little leads to mass shootings specifically in terms of cause and effect and scale
yeah i mean so this is a tricky question we get into semantics a little bit here because it's hard to stand by an argument that people who make posts like this or that anybody who goes into a school and opens fire and students is some paragon of psychological well being i think everybody would agree that these people are not mentally well
per se
but
that is really different than actually having a specific mental illness like schizophrenia or bipolar disorder a major depressive disorder
a lot of the characters of these mass shooters
are similar and that's up to say that none of them have metal and because some have but a lot of them are just really angry resentful that are young men who have similar histories of social isolation they've been bullied they have harbored revenge fantasies
they have an entitlement toward social standing and towards attention for women
they feel like they're not getting the popularity the attention the recognition they deserve that they deserve so there's this idea that they're better than everybody thinks they are and they kind of want to show the world that so how would the treatment of someone like that differ from the kind of treatment they would
and if they were determined to be mentally it seems like in either case some kind of treatment
is needed so what's the difference
well one of the big difference is we do have medications for things like schizophrenia and bipolar disorder
we don't have medications for things like resentment hatred and anger at the world we can't fix that so well
so there's no way to admit somebody like that to a psychiatric hospital treat them over the course of the two weeks that we may be able to have them and then completely change the personality that they've spent their whole life building up and sounds like this young man who's standing in front of you fits that profile more than one have a clue
really mentally ill person absolutely he fits the profile of the angry socially isolated young man with no mental health history
so what's come to your head
as you make this decision whether or not to admit him
so in my mind
i'm thinking to myself this young man does not appear to be mentally ill to me
he doesn't appear to potentially be dangerous but that's not something that is going to be changed by many him to a psychiatric hospital on
and if i send him home then i'm concerned that i had my chance to intervene with the next mass shooter and i did nothing
and now he's back home has gotten

will do it back


so dr of on her you've spoken to this young man you've learned that he has posted on facebook something quite scary you've learned that he may have just purchased a gun you don't know and now it's your job to decide whether or not to commit him
first serious mental illness what do you decide to do he did not elect me like he had a mental illness
knowledge to me like he technically met the standards for involuntary commitment
but i really didn't want to be wrong and in the end i decided to admit him because there are some leeway in the statute so it's ultimately up to the judge to make the decision of whether or not he gets committed officially so i admitted him to you aired on the side of caution to get him into this kind of mental health
legal pipeline i did it sounds like you're saying part of you understood quite clearly that he might not be mentally ill but you are making a kind of civic as well as medical decision to keep him out of the general population i mean one of the principles are practicing medicine as that
higher the risk of the possibility the more certain you want to be that it's not the case
so if i'm worried that somebody might or might not go home and punch a wall
i'm willing to be fairly liberal in making a mistake they're much marceau liberal than if i'm worried somebody may or may not go home and shoot up at school
you can live you can live with one art dealer i am willing to let them a little bit of freedom if the risk of my giving them some free time and letting them go is that they might shoot a bunch of people in the school i need to be really really confident that i am rate and that is not going to happen
and what happened i admitted him to the hospital he went before the hearing officer a few days later and the hearing officer
yeah he was not dangerous because of the mental illness and then he's no longer up in voluntarily held use free to go to you had to let him go the system had a logo yeah we had a lot of go
so doctor does this man end up on the federal background check system given the latest has played out know because the judge did not certify his commitment in court
he did not land on the federal background checks systems list of prohibited person's but because i admitted him to the hospital he does meet criteria for a five year probation just with in california that prohibition will expire and a couple of years and were he to move to another state he would still be able to buy a firearm there in the meantime
do you think the this system failed this young man in this moment and as a result failed the rest of us
you know it's hard for me to say that this system failed this young man because this young man is not who the system was set up to help
he's not somebody that we have a treatment or care for
because he wasn't mentally ill
the unfortunate part is the criminal system
i couldn't help them either because he hadn't done anything criminal
so what do you think when you hear gun rights advocates talking now so much about mental health do you think there's an understanding of what that actually means in practice
i think there's not and i think it's important for folks to have a better sense of what it looks like played out in practice
which is it doesn't look very good there's not a lot that in actuality we can do for these people and the irony is i think a lot of the folks who point towards the mental health system has being less restrictive way of decreasing gun violence because they don't want to lose their rights to own firearms
the part about their missing because they don't see what happens in the real mental health world is that if we were going to really try to prevent violence and mass shootings
within the mental health system we would have to expand the net of who we were allowed to and voluntarily detained and hold enormously in order to find those one or two people in thousands that might actually perpetrate mass violence would we have to therefore expand the definition of mental illness
i mean it's hard to expand the definition of an illness but i think we would be talking about dramatically expanding their reaches of the mental health system
and largely the involuntary mental health system because mostly were looking for people who are not seeking treatment on their own so what that looks like is that we will lower the bar really far in terms of who we will be able to and voluntarily commit and it would be almost every angry young man who had a history of social isolation
boyd who had an interest in violent video games and collecting guns who ever made macabre sounding facebook posts are comments about wishing everybody his school were dead
that's actually a lot of people and it's easy and hindsight to look at max theaters and say they showed all the warning signs but when you look forward that's a lot of people that you would have to take out of their world and out of their lives and in voluntarily detained in the mental health system and probably to not much and
what do you mean to that much and well eventually we have to let them go is unlikely that we'd be able to fix them
so even if we were allowed to keep them for three weeks or three months
i don't know that we would be really solving the problem we would just be keeping them out of circulation for a little while

i wonder how often you think about this young man who he admitted and then who the court system of the girl and who now
rooms the world
i think about him every time there's a school shooting

thank you
much thank you

hughes what else you need to know please welcome me executive vice president of the national rifle association wayne la pierre
i appreciate this opportunity
with served discussion
serious issues that impact each and every one of us on thursday after week of silence since to school shooting in florida and the head of the and already spoke out at an annual gathering of conservative activists as you wish you all the opportunities waste no one second
