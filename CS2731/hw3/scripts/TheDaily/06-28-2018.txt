
from the new york times on my cobra this is that it
today
justice anthony kennedy announces his retirement
what it means for the court to lose it's only swing vote
it's thursday
june twenty eighth
june twenty seven twenty eight eighteen my dear mr president
this letter is respectful informal notification of my decision
the effect of july thirty one of this year to in my regular active service is an associate justice of the supreme court
for a member of the legal profession it is the highest honors to serve on this court least permit me by this letter to express my profound gratitude for having had the privilege to seek in each case how best to know interpret and defend the constitution
the laws there must always conform to its mandates in promises respectfully and sincerely anthony kennedy
animal what do you think when you read that letter from justice kennedy telling the world that he would step down from the card
i thought there goes my summer
but he had meeting
this is this is an earthquake
adam live coverage the supreme court for the ice this is the biggest story in a big news environment in a long time and in which will be an epic fight this is not an ordinary supreme court retirement or confirmation process justice kennedy has for decades held the
key to the most divisive and important decisions in american life
and in giving president dropped the opportunity to replace him
the supreme court will be transformative


can you tell me a little bit about how justice kennedy was first nominee it he was president reagan's third choice
great pleasure and deep respect for his extraordinary abilities that i today announced my intention to nominate the united states court of appeals judge robert bork to be an associate justice of the supreme court the first choice robert bork i'm very conservative
mr met somebody was voted down by the senate
mr by no second choice i am announcing today that in accordance with my duty under the constitution
i intend to nominate and ash the senate to confirm judge douglas ginsburg of the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit for the position of associate justice of the supreme court
douglas ginsburg never really got started because there was a scandal about marijuana smoking and so finally we turned to justice kennedy i am today announcing my intention to nominate united states circuit judge anthony kennedy
to be an associate justice for the supreme court who is not the hard core conservatives that the reaganite it's probably wanted but by then they'd been forced into going a little more moderate now i believe that judge kennedy as if you wish to share
thank you mr president
by announcing your intention to nominate me to the supreme court of the united states
you can for a singular honor
the highest honor to which any person devoted to the law might aspire and who did reagan and the concert is around president reagan
i think that they were getting when kennedy was nominated well they hope they were getting a reliable conservative judge kennedy is what in many in recent weeks have referred to as a true conservative one who believes that our constitutional system is one of enumerated powers that it is we the people who have granted certain rights to the gulf
not the other way around and was he that a somewhat reliable hoped for conservative once he was confirmed to the court
in a lot of ways and a lot of the time yes he cast the decisive road in some very big cases wrote the opinion in citizens united which amplified the role of money in politics joined conservative five for majorities in bush v gore which handed the president see the president george w bush join the majority and a five four decision in this
british columbia against heller which established a constitutional second amendment right to keep and bear arms in the home so in many cases in most cases he was what he seemed to be a republican a you voted conservatively so what reagan expected him to be and how you would be right
but
wow
a few cases in some of them very big cases he leaned lift he joined other justices to save the right to abortion in planned parenthood against a sea which reaffirm the core of roe v wade publishing a constitutional right to abortion
he voted to cut back on the death penalty
he voted in favor of affirmative action justice anthony kennedy writing for the majority argued for american education is need to reconcile the pursuit of diversity with the constitutional promise of equal treatment and dignity so he disappointed conservatives and presumably disappointed president reagan in a whole array
case
but nothing compares to the two thousand and fifteen decision in which justice kennedy writing for the court in a five four decision joined by the courts liberals established a constitutional right to same sex marriage thing was required by the equal dignity protected by the constitution

just moments go the supreme court and this landmark rural and court making same sex marriage
country across every state in this nation
there were tears in the court room
jubilation outside the courthouse
i was trying to find my story in so many people were on their phones that i couldn't get cell service it's the only time it's ever had
writing for the court jester anthony kennedy had a couple not to denigrate marriage but rather to live their life joined by
that was easily one of the most important cases in the supreme court history
he was the greatest judicial champion in american history of direct
jack kennedy
by boy harming gay right better the hot or that britain major your opinion of it
twenty years
reddit dot wedding game and be on equal ground


why do you understand the kind of kennedy level of unpredictability sometimes citing very deeply conservative sometimes citing very deeply with liberals is there something discernible all guiding him
a great deal of self confidence and actually no particularly discernible judicial philosophy kind of mystical judicial supremacy in which he thinks that judges can be trusted to divine the right answers from the somewhat cryptic language of the constitution and
very gracious not to use the term swing vote i hate
it has this visual image of the spatial generation
the cases swing i don't
thank you for not using one thing to bear in mind as people think that hamlet that he's the sweet justice that he's picking between one side of the other but that's not the right way to think about how personally we think about it when he's with his with you one hundred and ten percent so more conservative cases he was very conservative and the more liberal case he was
very liberal but he had an idiosyncratic jurisprudence that allowed him to have a foot and both worlds
adam how his kennedy's amorphous legal approach translated to how he dealt with his fellow justice what was his dynamic with them on the bench and off my sets the he was well liked but much more important because he had the deciding vote everyone deferred game and arguments when he started
to talk everyone stop talking and after he stopped talking everyone said well as justice kennedy wisely pointed out i understand the alternative approach which justice kennedy was referring to houston other way you think about the excellent point justice kennedy just made much and as justice kennedy question pointed up its and only includes everyone was angling for his vote because he was the key vote
asians that point it out by time justice counties question because if it can be deferred to him because they needed his vote to decide which way each case was going to go i'm sure they liked him a lot as a guy also very much cared about getting is bogus
given how unique kennedy has given his swing vote power in this court and how much his colleagues to to him
you think he decided to retire
he's eighty one years old i think in some sense he was running out of steam
and why now given that the president that will be pointing his replacement is not as ideologically nuanced as he is were partly because the next president will be either there's not a president who will be able to replace justice kennedy with a justice kennedy one way to think about it is
justice is like to try to retire under presidents who will appoint someone who will carry on their judicial legacy
justice kennedy would have been incapable of doing that under any president president obama would not have appointed someone who would vote like him in prison and trump all appoint someone who works like him because while most of the justices are fairly closely identified ideologically with the president who appointed him or her justice kennedy was in this
weird and therefore very powerful center spot
get into ever have a justice like anthony kennedy again somebody capable of any logical flexibility like this these days ideology is so closely vetted by presidents and the people they put on the court your robert selena
sotomayor kagan gore suture such reliable proxies for the president's were pointed them that we would have to have a very very different america
you produce another justice kennedy

i don't thank you very much

oh be right back
they're born or very pleased deficit
of the many powers and responsibilities that the constitution best in the presidency
fewer more consequential then appointing a supreme court justice
particularly want to succeed justice scalia more of the most influential jurors of our time sure where does this story start for senate majority leader mitch mcconnell
repertoire
what do you
our a while
oh sheryl stover covers congress for the times
armored
earlier
obama
are are or what could really are
and today
after completing this exhaustive process i've made my decision
i've selected nominee who was widely recognized not only has one of america's sharpest legal minds
but someone who brings to his work a spirit of decency
modesty integrity
even handedness and excellence
are we are any kind of a moderate amount
obama
i'm a republican
it is tempting to make this confirmation process simply an extension of are divided politics
the squabbling that's gone on in the news every day
but to go down that path would be wrong
i simply asked republicans in the senate to give him a fair hearing
and then and up or down vote
not that way if you don't then it will not only be an abdication of the senate's constitutional duty
it will indicate a process for nominating them confirming judges that is beyond repair
no mean everything
is subject to the most partisan politics everything

it has a presence constitutional right to nominate a supreme court justice
as the sun it's called social right
check on a president
and with whole is concerned
oh what a brilliant
who are
an underground
oh
oder where i would
i'm american people may well elect a president who decide for nominate judge garlic
presented consideration
an expression may also nominate somebody very different
either way
our view is
if the people a voice and filling
we are away
wait
i get an opportunity
let's let the american people
santa will appropriately revisit the matter what it considers the qualifications of the nominee
the next president
nominate whoever
that my be
our area
what the majority leader did to merit garland
by denying him even a hearing and a vote is even worse than a filibuster a
a court eight from obama
wrong when mcconnell deprived president obama have a vote on garland it was a nuclear option
the rest is fall out
why but had one
i'm kind to everybody
webber
a lot of
my own
somebody would be more are are democrats are furious with mcconnell but they're not really afraid that this is going to change much
right right
will you appoint are you looking to a point of justice who wants to overturn roe v wade isn't going to happen
i'm all in deployed for life the judges will be pro do you want to see the court overturned
put another two or perhaps three justices or and that's really what's going to be has that's will happen and dental have been automatically in my opinion because i am putting pro life he justices on the court so when do we see this mcconnell maneuver start to pay off not just be of stay
tell me but become a victory for him while our
a point now where we're going to a wider than any other m that are welcome your ram
or
promoting
millions of voters said this was the single most important issue to them
when they voted for me for president
i am a man of my way i will do as i say something that the american people
have been asking for from washington for a very very long time
we we are
and dominate corporate and i would like to ask a judge course which and is wonderful wife louise to please step forward
please louise judge
they are they

immediate return
or or it
it was clear that right
our on record right because if another seat opens on the court with a republican president and power no matter why it's good for republicans if it's a seat already held by a conservative things stay the same if it's a democrat they get a pretty rock solid six
the majority and if it's kennedy then they can replace him with a conservative who will vote in lock step which solidifies a five to four majority broccoli right
mcconnell
really are
iran while
there were no
nobody
from work going to be what he faced an atheist honest after just what do you learning
on some new years just coming across right now from the supreme court after the final day of the term and a few hours after some of those final decisions we have just learned that justice anthony kennedy will be retiring you are going to see twenty states
laws banning abortion outright just banning abortion because they know that there are now going to be five votes on the supreme court to overturn roe v wade and abortion will be illegal in a significant part of the united states
in in eighteen months there is just no doubt about that and that's why these seats matter so much roe v wade is do it is gone because donald trump won the election to your on the hill to infect worth talking you from the senate gallery what we said like there when the news came that justice
he was retiring
yeah and a particular yeah oh my god
i can react and one democrat party
and what do we know about what the democrats are going to try to do what the next nominee what mcconnell did to grow up
democratic return it or and cried
the republican way
i wouldn't have nominee or republican colleagues in the senate should follow the rule they sit in two thousand and sixteen
not to consider a supreme court justice in an election year
millions of people are just months away from determining the senators who should vote to confirm or reject the president's nominee and their voices deserve to be heard now as leader mcconnell thought they should deserve to be heard then
anything but that would be the absolute height of hypocrisy
burn up by a macabre game but i'm gonna have already you don't know a power play them a game
are not in control the senate
stand ready to fulfill its constitutional role by offering advice and consent
on cars and trucks nominated film this country and not were very quick primer we will vote to confirm justice kurdish successor this fall after that i would vote on a new supreme court nominee or the midterm term before the just bored of it
yeah and what's the strategy behind getting it done before the midterms well one in control
right now who knows what will happen after the camera
and grow up agreement
we are very different nominate from an echo
he would be unlikely to get an urban our money through a democratic government
and the other thing it become a campaign
you know any a cream court eye on apple will only write out a party
i'm that ended up
oh be very motivated over there
or motivated her from on it
game so if all signs point to this getting done before the midterms and republicans have control of congress is there a scenario in which this new justice nominated by president trump somehow is not confirmed before the mid terms as mcconnell wants and plants
a couple and could happen
parliament nominate buddy who
oh at a republican rather are you i'm nominating people who really haven't been adequately better
unlikely scenario about republican
and i'm going over with democrat
who walk and nominee and everybody know cupcake i am
what are wrote a wave by
a really high and quiet
what a republican there and now about roe v wade who want to abandon their party
over the other democrat
and you know whoever rendered
holland of main marco
so to republican senators who happened to be women who democrats believe my choose the issue of abortion over fidelity to their party and a moment as big as a supreme court nomination
right
i already had a a puppy
him or when he was bring her really impact and the armor or what
or at work out an hour he could have a but we'll hearing and have had been wanting to figure out how you were gonna bring them over by an era going to be a lot of pressure on a cure them and the great
it's interesting like justice kennedy in the supreme court
here again huge questions about the future of the united states
may lie in the hands of this tiny fraction of congress
still makes decisions that can still swing either way that has some degree of independence that's separate from the expectations of their party yeah and the women oh and out a are really rare rare bird and why
my wife
they are willing to break with their own party when they are higher calling

gerald thank you very much thank my

use those you need to know on this
guys are one hundred twenty one
three hundred one
