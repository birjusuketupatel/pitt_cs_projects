
few times i'm michael barbara
he's getting
today
domestic assault conviction should have stopped dead and kelly from purchasing the rifle he used in the texas church why it did and the president versus the courts
it's tuesday november seven
yesterday we learned that the shooter at the church in sutherland springs texas devon kelly was a member of the airforce what are we learning about the circumstances under which he left the air force so he wasn't in the air force for very long he joined in two thousand and nine diff
philips covers the military for the times and by two thousand and twelve he was in deep trouble
a been court martialed for assaulting his wife and stepson is in front steps stepson and actually broke the baby scope
what more do you know about the a song we know that he pled guilty said that he did it intentionally he served twelve months or at least was sentenced to twelve months of detention and then afterwards he was kicked out with what's called a bad conduct discharge which is next to the worst
you can get it one above dishonorable
so just to be clear after this alleged conduct towards his wife and stepson he is sense to twelve months within the military system and he is discharged with bad
add conduct did he have a different kind of criminal record
because this played out inside the military then it would have if it had been a civilian system
i think so i think to a large extent the civilian world doesn't really understand and communicate well with the military court system so in this case he was charged with one in the civilian world we would have called felony level solved and so the fact that this guy had a court martial conviction doesn't always true
translating so that people understand he's a convicted felon
that conviction also didn't get into the federal database that would have kept him from owning a firearm and so in that way it is hugely significant the fact that he pled guilty to intensely harming his wife and stepchild any type of domestic violence charge should have made him ineligible
give what do we learned about what happened to kelly after he left the military with this bad conduct discharge so he gets kicked out and it's finally finalized in two thousand and fourteen that is out of the military
during that time he bounced around a little bit he's very briefly taught at a little bible school damn near corpus christi just volunteering he got divorced and he got remarried in two thousand and fourteen
and we don't have a good track on what he was doing exactly but we know that one of the few places that he showed up anywhere in the public record
was that he registered to vote in two thousand and fourteen in colorado springs and he gave his address as this little ar fi part where he had lived in slot number sixty
this trailer parks only a few miles from where i live so i very quickly got in the car and went out there it's kind of shabby little trailer park right on the edge of the mountains just a gravel lot really with a couple pretty tired looking on trees around the edges
and at this point since it's getting on winter there's not a whole lot of trailers there but about a third of the trailers are kind of to decrepit to move and so i started asking around you know a juicy in this guy had using that guy the funny thing is when a reporter shows up at a place like one of those are the person we basically look like tops than are treated as such
so no one really wanted to talk about it if they remembered and it's a pretty trendy and place so maybe they didn't but then on my way back i happen to stop in the laundromat of the army park and found this one woman she gave her name is susan
she happened to live right next to spot number sixty where mr kelly lived with his then new wife his second wife in the summer of two thousand and fourteen
and i asked her what do you remember about this guy and she said you know not much he wasn't particularly friendly nor was he unfriendly there's just one thing that she said really stuck out in their mind and that's the dog that he kept
so this dog there was a puppy and he kept tied outside on a robe
and this v park does not have much shade at all and so susan with look out of her trailer and it is dark just sitting in the sun in august without water or with his robe tangled up around the bottom of the trailer there and she felt bad about it and went out and we'll give it water and untangle untangling and then one day neighbors
called the police because they saw mr kelly punching the dog repeatedly the police came and there was a stand off where he was locked in his trailer he wouldn't come out the police waited for over an hour eventually he came out and they sided him for animal abuse and
he pled guilty to that
a few weeks later he was gone from the trailer park and the next thing we know he's he's back in texas does the animal cruelty case that you're describing sounds like was adjudicated and the court system does that end up registering with the police or the courts in a way that
it would make it harder for kelly to own a gun know something interesting happens so this is a misdemeanor case he never gets the dog back but what happens is he's given what's called a deferred sentence if he stays out of trouble for twelve months
any record of the offense is erased
and so by two thousand and fifteen when he completed this deferred sends it was gone it's like it never existed
what do we know about the past few months leading up to sunday well we know that over about the past year so like everybody else he's got a ton of friends on facebook that are his old high school friends people who knew him back when they described him as as a nice kid may be a little awkward
but but kind good sense of humor
they all start unfriendly him because this guy who had been raised going to church who had worked as a volunteer at a at a bible school he suddenly started publishing all these anti christian or atheist streets in france and kind of picking fights with people on facebook to the point where
one after another a lot of his friends simply unfriendly them because they were offended yeah i haven't seen any of these posts is pages been taken down but over and over people say they were inappropriate or just boorish the types of things that were just meant to insult or insight the suit kelly developed anti christian use
why do we think he targeted this particular church in this particular town yeah this is about an hour from his house so it's a good question how we ended up their law enforcement is saying that their best guess is that this is because his current wife the one that he married after he got divorced but he is now a strange
to a woman named daniel levy shields it's her family's church she attended sometimes that so does your mother so did her grandmother the police are calling it a domestic situation but they haven't given us any more detail other than they are investigating threatening texts that he sent to his mother in law do we knew
if the shooters in laws were in the church when he went there and killed twenty six people what we know now we don't have a full list of who was in the church but it is being reported that his wife's grandmother was in the church and was killed
based on everything that you've told us about kelly's convictions from two thousand and fourteen and in addition this local animal cruelty case in colorado springs
how did he actually by the guns he was carrying and used in sunday's attack in the church
yeah we always talk about loop holes there are these ways that you can fly under the radar and buy a gun
that sidestep federal safeguards you can buy a gun out of the back of someone's car you can buy a gun at a gun show and it will never go through the federal database
but what looks like happens here is there was no loophole he went to the local gun store and he bought a gun and they checked his name and it was clear he shouldn't have been able to buy a gun with his conviction it should have flagged him and they would have said hey thank you very much
but we're not selling you anything today but he fell through the cracks maybe it's because the air force didn't communicate it's conviction into the national database maybe it's because for one reason or another the national database misunderstood what the military conviction meant but for whatever reason he got a
gun
in fact he got several guns
deep thank you russia
sure no problem
on monday evening the air force he admitted then fail to enter kelly's domestic violence conviction into the federal database
it was presented kelly from buying the rifle used in the attack in a statement the air force said it will conduct a complete review of devon kelly's case and of their entire data nice to ensure records in other cases have been reported correctly


we'll be right back


start with breaking news reports from new york say that several people have been injured in an incident in new york city a people are dead and eleven others injured after a man drives our rent and truck onto a crowd and bike path
details are still emerging was a deliberate and or their lives to terrorism
terror attack
six nine eleven
last tuesday about an hour and a half after say fool so you have drove a truck into manhattan bike lane president trump responded to the attack while president responded to the terror attack on twitter saying quote my thoughts condolences and prayers to the victims and families are the new york city terrorist attack god
in your country so it starts with condolences as you'd expect adam with tax spoke to our colleague sabrina to have uneasy about a pattern that is emerging with the president and then it takes a turn trump is calling for the execution of the suspect to authorities say you started
the justice system doesn't more treating shortly before midnight he killed eight people badly injured twelve should get death
just want to software here for a second because this is just so important
again we need to always if he's calling for the death penalty were someone who is not yet been convicted it it was cloaked in the presumption of innocence he has the potential to really prejudiced the jury for and make it much harder actually for his side to pick jurors who might be sympathetic to president drums point of view
a juror would be este have you seen anything about this case is there anything that would influence you about this case did you see person in trumps tweets did you vote for president from well i might think you're not qualified to be on the jury because you may have prejudge the case and adam how is that bad for the prosecution versus
the defense it's the trump voter in the trunk twitter followers who is more likely to be proved prosecution
it's those people who may be thought to be infected and bridges by the president's comments and those people who might be kept on the jury guy it so what we've been seeing in several legal cases is president trump making statements about pending legal proceedings that may will undermine his ability to accomplish what he wants
to achieve by letting people use his statements in opposition to his policies and in their own defense in cases before their tried asserting their constitutional rights had been violated by the president statements on friday burned avoided a prison sentence of fourteen years for desertion
and mistake here before the enemy sergeant and what about both berg bergdorf what did the president say about that case initially so as a candidate he says quite extreme things were tired of sergeant fact
who's a traitor
he's a freighter a good trader
who should have been executed
but he's only a candid he becomes president and he alludes to his earlier comments they're setting up sentencing show i'm not going to comment on it but i think people have heard my comments in the past the military judge handling the case indicated that the comments were problematic and that he was going to take account of them in
figuring out the rate sentence he was in the legal terminology going to consider the president's comments is mitigating evidence and he may well have done that sergeant bobo don't meet in court today in civilian clothes free but dish honorably discharged it's friday we learned that burger is not going to be punished beyond dishonorable discharge and some
reduction in pay and so on but he's not going to serve additional time so just to pause on that you're saying this is a case where he where it's had real legal power bearing on that sentencing the judge said as much and bear in mind that each of these cases it's slightly different in the case of sight of he is trying to
influence an independent branch of the government and that's a separation of powers problem and people may have issues with that in the burg case he is the commander in chief the military justice system reports the him and he may be trying to influence that system in a much more direct way which is problematic for its own reasons adam
i want to read you what bo bo dallas defense attorney said after the sentencing on friday he said quote president trumps unprincipled effort to stoke a lynch mob atmosphere while seeking our nation's highest office has cast a dark cloud over the case
every american should be offended by his assault on the fair administration of justice and his disdain for basic constitutional rights so that's a defense lawyer making the point a defense lawyer whose client may will have benefited from prison interim statements that statement is not keeping with have a lot of defense lawyers
reacting to the prison and statements even when they might get some benefit from them they nonetheless are very uncomfortable with the idea that the president of the united states is trying to intercede in particular legal cases so this reminds me of other incidents you've talked about adam like the travel ban
jake shop is calling for a total and complete shutdown of muslims entering the united states where our during the campaign trump called for a complete shutdown of muslims entering the country
countries represented
can figure out what the hell is going on they softened those work is president but if the original wording that's been used in a legal case against the ban is that right well president from statements and tweets about the so called muslim been have had a great effect in the travel ban litigation the administration
just trying to get a hold on the ban lifted the judges repeatedly brought up the president's comments about a muslim and during last year's campaign and courts said routinely look to what he said on the campaign trail and as president to interpret those travel bans which on their face may be neutral may be acceptable but these courts have found
i did in fact they were animated by religious discrimination why because president trumps it so would this be potentially and opportunity to anybody in the legal system well i mean in one sense yes i mean that people challenge in the travel ban have been aided by the president's comments goldberg though may
well have been aided by the president's governments for all we know side of will be aided by the jury he gets so perhaps even make the argument that they should take to the only off the table because you can't find an unbiased jurors so in that sense people have been aided the other sense in which the president's comments probably help him with his base there are people
who think that the justice system is riddled with technicalities did let people who shouldn't get off and those people may welcome these kinds of comments adam is an unusual for president to do this in what are the historical precedent for this where i can think of too
and we are you guilty have any burger are you guilty of having any murder
right now so president nixon during a terrorist realm of charles manson opined that he was guilty on his way back in washington
today because of a local stopped a number of meeting a wrong or the those government were in charge of show rose on trial for life in los angeles
nope it directly or indirectly a runner and that prompted man since lawyers immediately to move from his trial because of the prison the united states was influencing the course of the trial and president nixon himself a lawyer recognized his error and walk the comment back
later his press secretary call back and said retracting the price of a of because he had failed and referring to
earlier the a word around the trial and los angeles
velcro

right one and then you can look to the oklahoma city bombing now where president clinton in a dream journal reno
said that they would seek the death penalty for those convicted of the crime
the bombing in oklahoma city
was an attack on innocent children
and defenseless citizens
it was an act of cowardice
and it was evil
if death occurs the death penalty is available and we will seek it
that's sort of sounds like it's the same zone of is what we've been talking about but not really because they presumed that the system should work and then they said if it does work and someone is convicted the crime was heinous enough that they would seek the death penalty what the trump tweets say kind of leapfrog
first port and says this guy deserves the death penalty now and it's a pity we have to go through the regular role of an actual trial so insane in treating these things is the president putting the justice system through like a kind of stress test and mean that the justice system really is the institution at the heart of the democratic process and he's he's
think it in a way that's one way to think about it sabrina i think the justice he's attacked the legitimacy and credibility of news organizations he seems to be going after independent judiciary and causing people to think that it can't be trusted to get things right he is changing the climate
changing the tone these are important enough instances in themselves but they also may represent the beginning of a very big shift in the way we think about the judicial system
you know the saddest thing is that because of the president of the united states i am not supposed to be involved with the justice department i'm not supposed to be involved with the f b i i'm not supposed to be doing the kind of things that i would love to be doing and i'm very frustrated by i look at what's happening with the justice
thank you so much adam attack
great to be here sabrina

here's what else you need to know saudi arabia is accusing iran of committing an act of war increasing tensions between two of the middle east most powerful enemies and raising the possibility of armed conflict saudi or
maybe a blames iran for supplying a neighboring country yemen with a missile that was fired at the saudi capital riyadh over the weekend and intercepted by saudi anti missile technology
iranian leaders deny any role in the missile attack and accuse saudi arabia of called wars of aggression regional bullying destabilizing behavior and risky provocations and over the weekend it was reported that senator rand paul of kentucky was attack
packed outside of his home as he stepped off his riding lawnmower meeting him with five broken ribs and bruises to his long the times is now reporting that the altercation was with a next door neighbor renee boucher over a landscaping dispute involving their yards
aides to pour say that because of his injuries it is unclear when he will be able to return to work
that's it for the day i'm michael bob
