
from new york times on michael barbara this is the
today
earlier this month the us government announced it would withhold hundreds of millions of dollars in aid to pakistan
in the time since afghanistan has experienced one of the most violent and deadly periods in its sixteen
how the two are connected
it's tuesday january thirty
would you tell us about this past week of violence in afghanistan will do less attack was this morning new jean michel covers afghanistan for the times it was snowing this morning so cold morning know about five o'clock dark of the night about five attackers
got into this mode or university at the heart of kabul raking over night nearly a dozen kelvin a terror attack on the afghan an afghan military base just the latest assault and a surge of violence and the afghan capital walk to the crack of gunfire early monday the latest in a wave of deadly attacks after weekend agree
and they fought for about five hours and they killed eleven soldiers and sixteen
they are holding eight by ten o'clock know the attack was over but it shit much with the city
just because it was coming off the backers a couple weeks
attacks is old comes after a saturday bomb and in kabul killed more than a hundred people
a little you
families are burying are dead their been three attacks in the space of a week
so the deadliest of the attacks of the past two weeks was on saturday where the taliban packed an ambulance with explosives
they drove the right to the center city you're using an ambulance why an ambulance because the city is pretty militarized and there are check point
every corner there bomb sniffing dogs so it was a good disguised for them special young street where they detonated it there was a hospital there was a major hospital and subsequent interviews security guards said wall we looked at the ambulance at the first coined we thought it's an ambulance you know it's it's probably carry
a do though they'll person to the hospital
they pass the first checkpoint at the second ship orange they detonate explosives and out about least three people killed more than did that
was damaged so that was the biggest of the attacks but about a week before the attack there was a long season over one of the main hotels and cobble to situation or solving and afghanistan tonight after forgotten been attacked the intercontinental hotel and this is the largest hotel tell the capital there's held hilltop until very historical seen
close
gunmen entered and killed about twenty two people most of them pilots and crew blogging one airline stuff going on airline that's where they could up all their foreign stuff they're mostly ukrainians the pilots from venezuela stay there because they thought that was one of the few safe places
that remained city
the attack been so easily just bug a lot of people's minds at but three guys arrive in a fan full of explosives deprived of and they just walk right in three other guys have stayed the hotel already infiltrated possibly state days and they start shooting from the inside and then the support
eyelids crew members and dozens of guess they're just cut their some of them you know jumps from the balconies and use their bed she's as makeshift robe and there's one guy is greek pilots
who had his own mattress and of try to hide in there and leave the windows of his room open to act out that he had fled the room you know because this was a fifteen hour see people would try and everything
so it is just been two weeks of very very back to back violence to a point where the dead of the first attack have not been counted for people are still searching for family members when the second attack happened some bodies are the more that still haven't been identified just because that's
how badly damaged they were it's just been that kind of intensity back to bed it hasn't given the residents of the city
breathing schools
who has claimed responsibility for these three attacks or do we hold responsible for the first to tax your claim by the taliban the third one was claimed by isis
but i was going officials were saying nobody should be fooled by that that this is all one concentrated taliban violence
you're describing a series of attacks that sound deliberately designed to terrorize and terrified people in kabul is that how it feels now are people just terrified yes yes i think everybody i've spoken to tear
fight
after morning the dead their sorrow has tend to anger they're striking where they can create the most fear and they've done that many residents say they need longer trust the government to keep them safe and every time an attack like that happens a good part of the city just shuts down because ages
turns into for military zone the city already is very military i see if you roundabout you go to u c security forces
main part specially a diplomatic area or the government offices are aware the businesses are that area chokes for traffic or day because every round about their security for surgeons vehicles and you know they have narrowed the streets to slow down to traffic snake a church
and the fact that the government is paid turning the city into military zone
cannot prevent these kind of high profile attacks in heavily guarded areas is what kind of takes a toll on citizens and a reminder everyday how vulnerable you know everything in the city is we want justice for our people we want senior security officials to resign as an afghan citizen
i cannot expect explosions and suicide attacks every day when we go to work we have no hope to come home alive how much longer do we have to put up
is this taliban's way of saying they can strike it will at the heart as the city close to government institutions and the government really can't do anything about it except few even more heat from his own people
not being able to stop the attacks

can you give us a sense of what it's really like to be a civilian in kabul right now hopeless feel what it's like to be there what it looks like what it sounds like is there any joy at all in life in kabul despite all this
i think there is joy but there's also a lot of guilt gil guess that people move on very quickly
an attack may cause them during lunch
and they made toned down the volume of the music playing at the cafe as the bomb goes off
and as the answer calls family members loved ones friends to say they're fine they go back to their lunch
i'll be
i'm talking in third person or an now but i should talk about this is my experience on saturday
on saturday when the big ambulance bombing happened i was at lunch with a friend and during the lunch we did not hear the explosion but everybody around a started getting calls and that is a sign when you know something has happened in the city
and everybody started talking to each other the say about aware was the bombings and trying to narrow down so he did call friends in that area rather than calling frantically around the city
so the music at the cafe was turned down for a few minutes
and the food stamps for a little while but wants to cause him paid and once people found out that it wasn't their loved ones
it was a year is sort of normalcy and yet
hash pay through returning to the meal my friend and i looked at each other and you're like this is pretty strange
every other day
people die like that
you try to go back to a sense of normalcy but you know it is not normal
oh this is not normal say it's that when i say guilt and that sense of guilt
gilded even when the scale of these and the frequency are so big that you've become inured to in a little
yes yes
and guild also that is so in your face the violence and the loss and the people suffering
and yet you still try to draw moment of normalcy
you know how widespread the suffering is

these three attacks considered a major escalation of the violence
for i mean even for people in kabul who sound nom who can go back to lunch when the music is put back high and the food service has resumed even for everyone like that
was the past week particularly gruesome and terrifying
absolutely absolutely in the past i've seen maybe last year or two years ago it will be say one dramatic attack a month or one dramatic attack every two months or so right
but now it just feels like not only the attacks are closer together but they have just done wade deadlier in terms of casualties and in terms of size of the bomb and in terms of the locations also where people with think don't have confidence of security but how easily they construct those areas
tell us more about that someone who's been reporting on this situation in afghanistan for years what's actually going on here so a lot of the escalation right now the violence is in a way related to a decision president trump took in december
he inherited a war that had gone on for sixteen years
two presidents before him had put their fingers on the root cause of the war but they had struggled to do something with it and that route cause was pakistan
that's very important for the people in pakistan and afghanistan to understand that america respects religion i am gravely concerned about the situation in pakistan pakistan shares a long border with afghanistan pakistan gives the leaders of the insurgency in afghanistan a safe haven
their leaders can just sit there and they're away from the american airstrikes stay away from the afghan forces taken his plan and no continue and execute attacks because pakistan uses this insurgency to gain political influence and afghanistan we have been paying pakistan
billions and billions of dollars at the same time they are housing the very terrorists that we are fighting for close to decades as invested in this proxy force to try to gain political influence and afghanistan to create the government wants in this neighboring country exactly but that
we'll have to change and that will change the president in december
said i'm gonna go after pakistan and i'm going to pressure pakistan president trump is split pakistan or knows cut about a billion dollars worth of security aid in pakistan and he told pakistan to stop harboring terrorists today we can confirm that we are spending security assistance security assistance only to pakistan at this time
until the pakistani government takes decisive action against groups including the afghan taliban and the how county network we consider them to be destabilizing the region and also targeting us person now the united states will spend that kind of security assistance to pakistan
when he did that everybody who has followed and observe got a son including afghan officials were saying there's going to be an escalation of pakistan and will not submit to us pressure so easily we should expect for increased violence across afghanistan particularly in urban centers
because that is just easier it takes a harder toll and one attack one guy coming what a suicide vest in a city or capture more headlines and it will show the afghan government in kabul as much weaker so that is the escalation we're seeing right now so the town and with these recent attack
facts are trying to weaken the afghan government as much as possible in a way that benefits pakistan's position in the region and ultimately could therefore benefit the taliban's because the two are nurture each other
pretty much pretty there is a big picture go
the immediate it almost seems reactionary also just to show to be americans and to trunk
we're capable workers kinder reach deep inside a city where a us back government has been better for seventeen years and it cannot protect it so good the united states anticipate that the action it took against pakistan might trigger this kind of escalation and if it did does it
assume that that is the cost of a longer term defeat of the taliban and stopping pakistan from from harboring it a lot of people including american officials expected this escalation
and a lot of them knew that they would have to be patients for this kind of bloodshed first brief period at least him before we could get anywhere
tours a resolution to the war
they expected this kind of reaction from the taliban
who
is there a world in which this escalation shows that the us strategy which seems to be a long term strategy for defeating the taliban and making pakistan stop harboring them is there a case of me that these absolutely horrible terror attacks are signs that the us strategy
is in some way working as hard as that is to conceive given that so many people are dying
i think so because the escalation was expected it's just that question of how much of this escalation can a week afghan government absorb and how much american attention there is to make sure if falls clues and gets to see you next step of keeping the pressure on pakistan
those are very very big if
that is what is making your question kind of difficult the signs are that it is playing out like that pressure on pakistan escalation but what is it question right now is next step and then next step because of the death toll makes that next step difficult and by extension makes a bigger short
your strategy difficult present trump is expected to address the situation in afghanistan
tonight in his state of the union address what do people in kabul and in afghanistan
want to hear from the us president right now is there anything that they could hear from him that would make them feel secure in this moment and that there's hope
for this city in this country
i think an acknowledgement that
brutality
that has happened last couple weeks and an acknowledgement that is seen within that focused limbs
i started pressure and
i expected a backlash an escalation
the afghans everyday average afghans who may not understand the strategy and this grand chess game
are paying the price i acknowledge him but we're going to stay on in to make sure that one hundred and thirty people killed in two weeks
it's not just another number in the long casualty toll of this war
didn't get us closer tourism
and
thank you thank you michael

we'll be right back



here's what else you need to another day on monday the deputy director of the f b i and andrew mackay abruptly step down following months of accusations from president trump and his allies that mccain had led a politically motivated investigation into the trunk campaigns ties to russia
but in cave is telling friends he felt pressured to resign not by president trumped by the director of the f b i christopher rain and in a news conference on monday afternoon white house press secretary sarah how could be sanders we enforce that version of the fifth
say president not flair
yes
it wasn't hard of this decision making process and we would refer you to dave
yeah i have were first foray serves as the director which as i said last week and i'll repeat against today the president has full confidence in him and has put the decisions and the f b i is he
we had recently expressed his concerns about an internal justice department investigation into action to buy mccain and other senior officials during the two thousand and sixteen presidential campaign when the f b i was investigating both hillary clinton's email used and the trump campaigns ties to russia
trump again criticize him a came after reports in october two thousand and sixteen that my kids wife good run as a democrat for the virginia legislature had received campaign donations from a close ally of clinton's
and we need to restore the credibility to the american people to me if there's nothing no national security being breached i think the american people should have access to this information republican members of the house intelligence committee voted to release a controversial nemo accusing the f b i miss you using its
in the russia has to he wanted attained a secret surveillance order on a former trump campaign adviser in two thousand and sixty in voting to release the memo which contains classified information house republicans disregarded warnings from the justice department that making it public would be quote extra
ordinarily reckless and they have infuriated democratic members of the committee like adam schiff who called it a partisan effort to undercut the f b eyes investigation sadly we can fully expect that the person united states will not with the national interest
over his own personal interest but it is a sad day
when that is also true of our own committed because today this committee voted to put the president's personal interest perhaps their own political interest above the national interest
the president trump now has five days to decide whether the memo should become public despite the objections from his own justice
he has repeatedly indicated that he wants him with

that's it for the day i'm like of a him
