
so the times i'm michael moore is that
today
the driver in tuesday's attack came to the us seven years ago through a lottery program intended to diversify the country sound bites the president's it is not it is not good
it's thursday november second
michael shorts give us the profile of this attacker that you're starting to put together say follow say above what do we know about him and when did he come to the us we know that he arrived in the united states
jfk in two thousand and ten he had one with green card lottery which gave them automatic permanent residents in the united states before that he had worked at a hotel in his hometown of tashkent choose the capital who's pakistan he had finished a financial college their grew up in that town and
far as we know from the uzbek government he lived a fairly quiet life stayed out of trouble didn't have a criminal record never raced any suspicions and what do we know about his life when he first arrived we know that he started setting out to get a job he made his way to ohio to a town called snow where
he set himself up as a truck driver and got linked up with the local population is a large population and stowe he went to mosque or on fridays was a member of the community he got married there you know somebody described him as an average guy he didn't stand out in many ways other than the
fact that he seems to have had quite a quick temper which everybody described he was very argumentative at gatherings at the mosque people describe the mosque environmental place where people debate politics all the time but it was always civil now with him he would get frustrated and get angry and people knew and of not cross his temper
michael you mentioned a large population of these facts in this part of ohio what do we need to know about that community in the us
i don't know a whole lot about the community in the united states uzbekistan is a pretty repressive former soviet country it is also incredibly poor probably one of the most oppressive and was closed former soviet countries and like many other countries that are oppressive where they're limited jobs
i believe and look for greener pastures and that's the same i think with the uzbek community and the united states they come here look for jobs they're very many who drive trucks that seems to be of profession then has become popular among this population
and his business and a muslim majority country
yes yes it is a muslim majority country the the government is very very attentive to how people are practicing their religion they are very very attentive to any signs of possible extremism in the country and they move very quickly and aggressively to stamp out this has led also led people who would chafe hundred that kind of him
environment to to leave the country but most people actually pointed out most people described tape of as perhaps moderately islamic the use give their government seemed to suggest that any radicalization that might have happened with him would have happened in the united states interesting but even his friends and our i'll from when you first arrive
here described him is not even a very attentive muslim he would show up late for friday prayers he expressed kind of a rudimentary understanding of the koran and so very few people least early on in his time in the united states suspected that he was following the more extremists path well maybe you met a man
ask leader who encountered say path in ohio who did worry that he was starting to change train yes that seems that disables character began to change and i spoke to an individual who would be named only is of door because he didn't want to attract attention from from other extremists
who had net say both in ohio they had mutual friends have door was president sables wedding and eventually save have moved down to florida and the to work together down there also in the trucking business but this man was also a preacher at the local mosque where say both attended prayers and at some point
abdul began to notice a change and tape of and told me that he worried that he was following this pact or extremism and tried to warn him off from that he says he tried to tell them to read more books to stop expressing his opinion so loudly and to study the religion before passing judgment on others he didn't know that
both seem to be overly obsessed with the trappings of islam the beard the ankle high pants and not as much with the substance
was he doing trucking up until tuesday do doing know he was involved in trucking but he had also started working as an uber driver
and whoever says that he passed all the background checks that they make their drivers go through there was some evidence that perhaps his trucking business was not going as well as he had hoped he'd also someone had told me then talking about moving back to pakistan and this was in the last few months he would tell people that he was born
hard living here he was tired he could make any money here and was planning to move back but obviously that didn't come to pass the have you heard anything in your reporting that suggests anything at all about what might have taken someone who arrived in the united states eager to leave her repressive country and who bore no
evidence of radicalization how he gets to a point where he wants to leave the u s and then of course does what he does on tuesday and lower manhattan that's one of the big mysteries and i think it's still an unanswered question how does somebody get radicalized how did he get radicalize so far we've been digging in haven't
found a clear break in his life where things were going in one direction and then moved radically in another direction
there's there's a clue
something that abdulla of the preacher the mosque in tampa told me he complained about his young inherent spending more time studying islam on the internet then in mosque learning from their religious elders you know we do know now that say keep of was influenced by the islamic state he
he left to know basically expressing an allegiance to the islamic state and he shared a lot of akbar god is grades in the midst of the attack and the attack itself seemed to echo instructions that have been made available by isis in its publications calling on people to carry out these kinds of technically easy and feasible
attacks than a lone wolf attacker can carry out by themselves without any instruction and he seems to have latched onto that and when and how that happened i think we're still trying to figure out michael we've talked a lot on a show about the profile of a second generation american who grew disillusioned percent
reason and radicalize is and carried out and attack that's not it seems what we're talking about here though in this is somebody who you know when i asked people who know him
what he came to the united states for why he applied to the green card lottery what do you hope to get out of it them and everybody said money you know the one in a job
this isn't somebody who was looking for some kind of religious freedom it wasn't somebody who was escaping some kind of political oppression and in many ways it was well off at home and why he would then come here for for purely it seems anyway at this point of material gains and
you know so change his modus operandi is very rude mysterious
michael jordan thank you very much appreciated
thank you

we'll be right back

peter baker we've learned that say have the driver in the lower manhattan terror attack came to the united states to a lottery system for green cards what is that system was called the diversity lottery program it was installed as part of the legislation passed and nine hundred ninety by bipartisan majorities in both houses of congress and signed a law by
president george bush time honored in pleased to sign into law the immigration act of nineteen ninety and set up fifty thousand visas set aside for countries are underrepresented it sounds genuinely like winning a lot you apply and your odds seem incredibly low given that number fifty thousand but if your chosen you suddenly
have a life in the united states that's right fact about forty million people i think apply last year so think about afridi thousand and forty million now and only about five percent of the people who get green cars every year come into this program but we have about a million people come into the country legally on green cards each year so is only a small part of it but
this has been a subject of controversy for some time because you know it seems to be random as opposed to target it seems to be about whoever happens to be picked out of the drawer and he ran out of a dry had or something like that is not quite like that but that's sort of the impression that people get and because of that you have people like the present
i want to merit based system and our our system has a variety of immigration program some of them are based on job skills education things you might bring a value to the country some of them are based on family connections the question for the debate is what ballast do you want to have if any between these two ideals the ideal of know welcoming people who will support
the economic and cultural system that we have here and those who are welcome because they fit this were a statue of liberty model of you're tired you're poor you're right i'm started this program started before we were thinking about terrorism the way we think about it now at the time perhaps the idea of randomness seemed appealing and
important and maybe kind of beautiful whereas now it could seem menacing well at the time the motive is i understand it was really to make sure we weren't just taking people from ireland
senator ted kennedy and legislation nine nineteen ninety managed to put in a quota specifically just for irish immigrants and it seemed like audio wait a second how come they're the only ones were going to get and we better do something else make sure we get others it's wrong that countries like poland or nigeria can't get almost any immigrants into this country and the diversity
interests that the incorporated already very beneficial that's why they call it a diversity these program so that was diverse not just the irish and it was bipartisan bipartisan cooperation i don't think anybody thought we were going to get a bill that was reasonable sensible and and as good as which one it wasn't something that was
big controversy and in the light of day to day obviously it might look different
and we start a fox news or on the deadly terror attack in lower man and a diversity lottery program allowed this back to enter the united states diversity lottery
or how is president from talked about this program and was he talking about it that way prior to today
yeah me he has mentioned it before but it's it's in the context of a larger piece of legislation that's been proposed and that he has embraced called the rays act broadly his message is merit based system not who you happen to be related to not lock and so from his point of view but the very word lottery is what seems anathema to him
q ask congress to me
initiate work to get rid of this program he also point out you know he was asked reaction when you ask you to sort of volunteer
the i wish the title diversity sounds good he has it not that good it hasn't been good
and against it
you know you're trying to make the point that political correctness and his view has overtaken rationalize basis for who that in the country so he would get rid of both the lottery system which is very small fraction of the whole brought to us but also the more significant immigration system here which prioritize his family over there and yes he called the chain migration in the
he is i get in and i bring my brother any brings and his family and they bring their cousins and so for and so on and he said that his man that came in the fella arrested in new york yesterday had brought in two thousand three people are these try to bring in twenty three people since he guy here that's not acceptable so we want to get rid of chain migration
we don't know to be the case because in fact under this diversity lottery you would not normally be entitled to bring in anybody other than your spouse and kids so that seems unlikely that he was actually able to do that
broadly though there are immigrants who have naturalized become us citizens and do have the ability because their citizens at that point to reach out and sponsor others to come here through the immigration system that's the part of the system he would largely get rid of her at least reduce okay
so he makes sense of the president saying do away with this lottery system in relation to the travel ban and maybe even the wall and mexico is present from trying to plug all the various whores in our immigration system that bring people into this country that he sees as unwanted and a threat yeah that's right you had to put this all together
all that there's a law and the mexican border that air travel ban on certain select countries m establishing new vetting measures to keep radical islamic tears
out of the united states of america we don't want him here there is cutting the number of refugees that come into this country down to forty five thousand it's the third try and the travel ban this calls for definitely banning travel for most people from iran libya syria yemen somalia chat and north korea rockies will also face
increased security there is this raise raise act are a i see that would cut legal immigration in half the rays that will reduce poverty increase wages and save taxpayers billions and billions of dollars
it will do this by changing the way the united states issues green cards to nationals from other countries and there is this talk today about this diversity lottery program being eliminated i am today starting the process of terminating the diversity lottery
program in all these ways he's trying to basically raised the walls figuratively and literally to this country was legal and illegal and that's both on the base of national security so as he put it today but also on economic basis the idea that people coming into this country are taking jobs now opponents his critics who say is
the opposite that in fact immigrants are good for the economy that they take jobs otherwise wouldn't be filled and without immigration it's going to be hard to grow the economy as fast as a present wants to peter
thank you very much thank you
hughes what else you need to meditate on wednesday the f b i filed federal charges against safer save of in the criminal complaint officials say so he passed begin planning the attack a year ago to inspiration from isis videos and choose halloween for the attack
because he believed it would be more people on the street say path was interviewed by investigators in a manhattan hospital after being shot by a police officer following the attack and a way more
a horrifying terrorist attack
new york city just walks away from the site
the world during a cabinet meeting at the white house on wednesday president trump offer his condolences to the families of the people killed in the attack all of is praying and grieving for the families
lost their precious loved ones are black and denounced the current us system for punishing such as a quick justice
strong just as much much stronger
then we have right now
what we have right now is a joke
it's a laughing stock
and no one so much stuff
takes place trump was asked if he would consider transferring say you have from the civilian courts into the military system at guantanamo bay in cuba set up after the september eleventh attacks i went sure
i would certainly consider no one arrested on american soil has ever been sent to guantanamo bay and it's not at all clear that the president is taking the idea seriously given that the comment was not part of his prepare for marks

that's if the game
i'm michael barbara
see him on
