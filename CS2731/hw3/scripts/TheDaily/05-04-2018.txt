
from the new york times ah michael barbara
these are they
today
detective pong balls was on the verge of retirement having never solved his decades long mission to catch the golden state killer
then he had an idea to upload dna evidence to a genealogy
it's forty before
how i want to start at the beginning of your career what were you doing so nine nineteen ninety four i became a deputy sheriff criminalist with the contra costa county sheriffs crime lab and what does that mean
i would be out a crime scenes analyze knows crime scenes collecting the evidence bring in the evidence back and performing the laboratory work in order to try to figure out what that evidence meant to try to solve the case
the lab that i worked in had this amazing library of old old textbooks and old old forensic science bookie but there was this file cabinet tucked away in the corner it wasn't labeled it was just a plain for draw or file cabinet
so i decided well what's in here and i started pulling open those drawers and in the bottom two drawers where the series of manila folders with the tab on the folder labeled with this red e a r e a r e a r e or what is this this is weird look and so i learned opening up these folders
and in each folder was a case file
i started reading nice case files and recognized that this was documentation of a series of rapes that had occurred predominantly in the east bay in rancho santa the gal in walnut creek is said to be one of those areas where you could safely leave your doors unlocked when you go out to walk
the dog at night but to recent rapes said at least temporarily changed that attitude rapist
moved into contra costa county in october striking three times and just over three weeks trying and conquered want in san remo saturday night be pried open the back door and entered the bedroom of a thirty two year old and on this east area rape a series that one ear stands for bed is exactly what year stands for many of those involved with a k
say the east area rapist lives within the area where he operates that he picks up on blocks and homes within neighborhoods jumping from one to the other the police have one last bit of advice and that is don't panic because that alters your judgment and the way that advice goes at anyone in the bay area not just the people have conquered because with this guy an extra
could be anywhere it wasn't just in contra costa county or the east hey this guy was up in sacramento and down in stockton and then he came out to the east bay residents are restrictions on women general
a sleepless nights after a few nights they feel is really need a good night's sleep and and i don't know who have actually done it sound
just out of fear i believe so we had fifty attacks that had occurred between june nineteen seventy six and july of nineteen seventy nine all over northern california by late fall when the east area rapists began planning two and three victims a month citizens began buying everything they could think of to protect
themselves
local burglar alarm distributors report a run on alarm systems with technicians backlogged four days in an effort to keep up with demand but we lost track of them he just disappeared back in nineteen seventy nine

and at that point in my career i was absolutely fascinated with serial predators and cold cases and so those east area the series just hit home with me as i need to look into this and what i ended up doing

in nineteen ninety four
new fangled dna technology was coming into play and it was so much more powerful even though this was an early early form of the technology was much better than what we doing so i thought you
see if i can track down some evidence then see if i can use the dna technology to try to solve the series
since the statute of limitations had passed usually what happens with law enforcement property rooms is there's the destruction process where they no longer have to hold onto the evidence because the cases done it's a beauty gated so they go through a routine process of destroying evidence in
to make room they can't just keep everything forever as a routine aspect
fortunately the original investigators and laboratory staff that were involved in this back in the nineteen seventies recognized the seriousness of this offender and put non destruct orders on all east area rapist evidence in the property room contra costa
county sheriff's office is the only agency in northern california that did that so that was the only evidence
so i found three sexual assault kids also called rape kits from three of the attacks and contra costa county and was able to get dna evidence from all three cases at this point
i need to find some suspects to compare to this dna profile
and that's when i turned the to one of the original investigators and see if you had any prime suspects and what did he tell you he said you know though we don't have any prime suspects we always thought that this guy went down to santa barbara and possibly committed and attack down there
may have killed somebody down there
well now i kick into investigative mode by decided around on a call of santa barbara and ask them i spoke with a detective their saying no you know none of our cases are related they don't sound similar at all but you might want to call up irvine
that detective said yeah you know we've got two cases that we got the same dna from the victims
so he referred me to the orange county sheriffs crime lab to talk to the analysts are about the dna that she had but different lads were using different technologies it hadn't been standardized yet
we do a direct comparison it took us four years to get the new technology in place
so i ended up assigning a dna analyst to do the new dna technology he did
and few hours later he walks into my office
monotone way said so we've matched your samples to some homicides down in southern california
that things like a very big deal
oh now that's huge so they only knew him down south as the original night stalker
this was a merger of this east area rapist and northern california and the original night stalker down in southern california
and he became known as the golden state killer
okay see you need this huge discovery what do you do next how do you pushed this forward and try to solve the case i'm now actively communicating with the lead investigator for orange county sheriff's office larry pool
i am sending him everything i have access to the case files the evidence the photograph and we also ensured that the dna profile was put up in the f b i d dna database but the search didn't result in any identifications so it was obvious that the guy we were looking for just wasn't in the database and
this case centrally goes cold again candidates for like a one step forward two steps back thing where you you've had a big breakthrough and yet it seems like the case hasn't really move forward much at all that's exactly it
you see as the you know this case was moving through the decades there would be flurries of activity and then it would just die off and you push away i pushed away from this case multiple times going i think i'm done i just can't do this to myself anymore
yeah
he were starting to taking up hope when i would push away eventually you get that toga back to the case then i'm back for boar and i had established relationships with multiple victims and having seen in person the trauma that they still lived with to this
day you know there was an obligation to continue
kind of spurred me into my last phase of this investigation in terms of sitting in my office in two thousand and eight two thousand and nine and i'm working at the file drawer that contained all those original cases with the red eat a are on
i've got to start looking at that case again it's unsolved let's see what i can do and since that moment in time ten years ago i have been working this case twenty four seven three sixty five my office gets transformed into a war room on the case and so i have
maps for the attacks occurred pin to my wall i've got suspects he had their their photographs pinned to my wall my computer screen is constantly on one of the case files that i'm trying to read so somebody walking into the room would go now he's working the case again

we'll be right back

what's the next big thing that happens in he's so that's when i decided i need to do something different to advance this series and identify who this guy was and what wasn't that you decided to do differently
i decided to pursue looking for relatives of the offender based on the offenders dna
so how does that actually work
this technology using relatives can you walk me through it initially we have to be able to generate a dna profile that is compatible with upload into just an open source geological database
once we got that and searched that database we got a list of distant relatives and when we reach a group of individuals that meet the criteria that we know about our offender he was likely born between one thousand forty and nineteen sixty we know he had a sacramento connection
and those individuals end up becoming somebody that we will look at hand as we develop profiles of those individuals we start assessing which ones rise to the level of getting a dna sample from to compare to the offender can just make sure i understand you already have a dna profile
have a suspect
you are familiar with the fact that there are now databases all over the place that allow people to put their own dna profiles and to find relatives long lost cousin his grandmother's grandchildren that tripe
that's right and he realized that if you combine these two if you put the suspects dna profile into one of those genealogy websites or services that up my pop relatives which is the point of those sites
that's right so to essentially you have to create a fake profile and attach this dna information
create an undercover profile pardon me
is there an ethical question around that undercover take whatever want to call it of have uploaded a person's information you know under the pretense of law enforcement work rather than private citizen there's plenty of case law that allows law enforcement to pursue undercover activities to affect an investigation so this is
something that is lawful is something that is this frequently done within just about any type of the best vacation
and how narrow does the pool become as you keep investigating it became very narrow winnowed down to roughly five individuals to we're not really strong at all
and then we had one that we were able to lemonade and then we settled in on this town
side of the family you down to two members of the same family
yes
and so what do you do with these two potential suspects this
point we're looking at these two individuals one was not lining up at all in terms of his physical bags and terms of his height weight is complex and was not consistent with what we understood of our offender and so he fell in terms of priority and then we ended up folk
pissing in on the last individual
i've been on this case now for twenty four years
and my retirement date was coming up so i look at this individual i started talking to people who knew him back in the day and as i talk to some individuals
he became interesting enough to wear on my last day
hi drove up to his house i drove from the bay area up to sacramento area and parked in front of this guy's house
on my mind i'm looking at this going what's the likelihood he's actually guy it's probably not the guy i should just go knock on his door introduce myself to my typical say oh i'm just here to work and to an old case and you know do you mind if i ask you some questions and establish a rapport and then eventually asked for a dna
a sample and then move on and show he's not the guy but then i i just stopped
i don't know enough about him
and decided not right now and drove away
he said this was your last day of work at this stage when everything is kind of coming to a head you you decided to retire that's right and that was leading up to this that was such a tough decision to make that how could i retire in this cases unsolved
and as i told people during this time frame some of the victims that i even communicated with during this time frame as i'm retiring from the job on not retiring from the case so how does the team continue to pursue the sky and are you just kind of hanging back and letting them do their thing
no
i really had no change in terms of what my role was with the team i just don't change to a private email account and we were still communicating as if i were active so the f b i and sack sheriff's office formed a surveillance team and followed this individual around
around and i received a phone call they had actually recovered a discarded dna sample from him and the lab at analyzed it and whoa what does that mean a discarded dna sample so when when we're trying to get dna from somebody and we don't want them to know that we can follow them around and if they leave
leave their dna in a public location it's something we can collect and have analyzed and it may be chewing gum it may be the saliva from a drinking straw could be clean acts there could be you name it if they've left it we can grab it so that's what happened is there was a sample color
did during the first part of the surveillance and the lab tested the results and that's when i received a phone call while i was at p have changed
what are you doing a pm change i'm enjoying dinner had just put an offer and on a house
and your retirement home
my retirement home and yes exactly
so i excused myself and i went outside and that's when i had received a call telling me that the results came back couldn't tell a soul
but the results were consistent enough to say that this guy joseph de angelo was likely the golden state killer

an arrest team had been put in place just waiting for the dna results
and then when we got the dna results mid afternoon
and had an arrest warrant signed by a judge the team was already in place watching de angelo and then at a certain point the team leader
sees an opportunity to be able to take de angelo in custody
and he just basically told them go and then it's a silence
and then about a man and and a half later
he says suspect in custody
and then the war room he wraps at that point
there as high fives are looting and hollering because for so many years we finally got him
paul you you know this
you have been drawn to the power of dna throughout this process started out your career and you understand it's potentials
but in the time since you've been in messiaen his case we as a culture and society with kind of better understand that the any potential and we've seen how powerful it can be and a lot of people are wary and even scared of what we've learned about the power of dna and i don't want to you a little bit about those
concerns there are people who are beginning to understand that story and to look at it and say that it's wonderful that you him but at what cost and what do you say that well i think first one when i think about it for people who are scared i try to
those fears in terms of we aren't accessing anybody's actual genetic information we're just seeing how closely or how definitely related some people are too who are fender might be the thing about pursuing this stretch
prodigy is that everything we're doing his dna based in our investigation is driven by dna which we know is a solid science there was only one person that we had to go and talk to and get a dna sample from through this particular strategy
versus the thousands of tips that have come in because somebody looked like a composite drawn back in the nineteen seventies or because somebody was an abusive ex husband or boyfriend or even we had tips come in where somebody just was mad at a person and decided they were going to call them in because they want
fall under suspicion by this investigation it's almost like a form of swat he he using this is less invasive than that it's very much less face of we gather dna from hundreds and hundreds of people because of the tips and because of circumstantial evidence within the case file i absolutely
understand people's fears about privacy and fears of how this dna is being used by law enforcement but it's not what their visualizing it is very innocuous in terms of what we are actually able to see and it's obviously very powerful
i guess that's a little strange to think about as i reflect on what we've been talking about is that my aunt's decision to italy go on a website and upload her dna might eventually implicate me in something and get me sucked into the criminal justice system in a way that i never signed off on i never on website and
about it at the same time you're aren't could call and the police and say you know my cause it's kind of a strange guy why don't you go investigate him as the golden state killer which happens thousands of times in these types of the metal nations
so you're out of control no matter what right
i do think the academic debate and the societal debaters important and healthy
from the law enforcement suspect of hope to be able to see utilized so that we can get these types of monsters off the street
but i fully understand that there may be some sort of brackets put on how this technology would be utilized moving whore
paul thank you very much appreciate it
now has been my pleasure



here's what else you need another day in a series of tweets on thursday morning president trump confirm that he had reimbursed his long time attorney michael cohen
