
from the new york times ah michael barbara this is the daily
today
the cia is waging an unusual campaign to make gina hospital it's next leader despite her polarizing past why agents their see her most controversial quality as her greatest asset
it's tuesday me
john thanks your being and hair
honor and pleasure to be too i realized it's not often that you sit down with the new york times nodes not one of my preferred activities
adam goldman who is john that jon benet was one of america's top spies the also was in charge of our national contests time service the spire armor
hey when president obama ordered the raid on the summer bin laden compound and pakistan in two thousand and eleven
so how unusual as the someone of bennett status especially in such a clandestine world sits down and talk radio on the record in front of a microphone
it's something he has rarely done since he left the agency in two thousand and thirteen and fact i've tried to contact yeah huh
and he is now responded to then why is he talking to you now
like any good by john has a mission
he wants to get the word out about jena hospital who's been nominated to be the director of this yeah
and what do we need to know about can ask
i think it's important to know about you know as ball that she is a highly respected case officer who joined the cia and nineteen eighty five
he's been running a aggressive campaign get the word out about her they've been relying on twitter news release is giving information on reporters are brin month a stories about her and part of this public relations campaign is getting former agency employees people like jon benet to talk to reporters and why would they
have you do that or want to do that why do they need to get out the good word
hondas cia official
because there's really only one story that's been told about jena hospitals history
and that story is about a role running a black site where and are kind of suspect was tortured him and her role in helping destroyed tapes of these torture sessions
it has both seen as a very competent case officer prior to nine eleven choose the deputy station chief in ankara turkey but after nine eleven she began working and counterterrorism center it was a little sleep be prior to nine eleven but after nine eleven
it was infused with the agency's best talent and billions of dollars and to counterterrorism center was in fact in charge of waging war against al qaeda and interrogating detaining suspects
the prisons around the world
what do you know adam about has both specific war in the counterterrorism center after nine eleven i know when she joined a she was put in charge of surveillance teams while doing their job
i asked her to go to thailand to be what is known as a base chief she was actually put in charge of this secret prison in thailand which is about two hours outside of bangkok
it was an infamous side there were two individuals brought their one and now para suspect name ability of beta and another al qaeda suspect named up email machinery is debate was water boarded eighty three times at this site at this site the first go to a prisoner to be water boarded was abu
debate these enhanced interrogation techniques were designed to break the prisoners as a beta was to be the guinea pig abuse data repeatedly water boarded became completely unresponsive with bubbles rising through is open foul mouth he actually had to be resuscitated he actually died
on the water board wow but was revived both robot correct and after he was water boarded an exposed to these harsh interrogation techniques it's my understanding that has arrived and she was there for about six weeks and while she was running this secret prison and assure you he was born three
times and also exposed to some of these very harsh techniques
i don't know anybody who joined a to run interrogation center it's not a job we were trained for it's not a job we had the experience for but it was a job we were asked to do in the moments of greatest uncertainty and anxiety in the aftermath of nine eleven
so gina and others did their duty
as it was defined for them at the time i think bennett like many people in the cia realized that they needed to take action and had to be robust and they needed to take the fight to al qaeda that the thinking then they could be possibly facing another devastating and terrorism attack
they don't want that to happen
i thought they were certainly unprecedented in extreme measures but it was an extreme situation and franklin delano roosevelt interned thousands of little japanese americans abraham lincoln suspended table
corpus joan adam shiny alien and sedition acts american presidents when they've been faced with an extreme thread who'd taken extreme actions which often times in retrospect were seen as incompatible with our core values so i think this probably falls in that category it was an extreme reaction to an extreme event
when a personal level is something you would have taken part of his just something you would i would have carried up my duties as they were defined at the time
what a what a little harder to find that inbox water boarding i think that's where you get over the line
and why is water boarding the line that for bennett and maybe for others
cannot or should not be crossed what is it about water pouring water boarding itself simulated drowning so you're actually creating that sensation of drowning of death and that itself under international law is prohibited
bennett is saying is that he's conflicted about some of these tactics and least when it comes to water boarding do we know whether haskell is similarly conflicted about what she is doing during this post nine eleven period
one of the mysteries of passport what she thought at the time and what she thinks now has posed never spoken publicly about her time in this backside about her time overseen water boarding we don't know from has bowl or self whether she thinks this is in fact wrong but better
and i talked about that and i would say the fact they said gymnasts pool given her sound judgment in her balance emotional balance i think she if you're going to have that type of facility that's exactly the type of officer you want air not somebody who is a zealot or somebody who
has lost their perspective on what it is therefore i think it's unfair to assume that is somebody who's an advocate for water boarding mean that was one of the tools that was legally available at that site but it's not a tool that she invented or advocated so he saying that a hospital was brought their because she's
not somebody who's viewed as embracing the harshest possible tactics after nine eleven to deal with suspected terrorists i think she's brought their because she wasn't going to let things get out of control remember that individual who is water boarded under her time was only water bought it three times now for him
each one is an eternity but the previous individual albums a beta was water boarded eighty three times that didn't happen under her watch there is somebody describe get a job there as clean up and close up which they did in december of two thousand and two after thailand she returns to the counterterrorism center
langley virginia and she takes up a job as deputy to the chief of operations pushing rodriguez who is running the counterterrorism center that time thinks highly of her and what does he do he plucks has bowled to be his chief of staff and while he's running that clandestine terrorists which is a big
job and it's a signal to the rest of the building that has ball is highly respected and she's gone places she's she's going to move up the ladder after this to she has promoted after this work and thailand it sounds like correct and what does haskell do as chief of staff to rodriguez well know most notable thing that
haskell did his draft a memo that jose rodriguez sent to the station in bangkok ordering the destruction of these tapes of people being water boarded thin so to be clear the memo orders the destruction of tapes of people being water boarded including at the bar
aid that has pull herself oversaw correct but there was a problem with that order jose rodriguez was specifically told the white house counsel myers and by john rizzo the act in general counsel
a to not destroy those tapes who do not destroy those tapes
and yet and yet our day felt he had all the legal authority he needed and push the button on that cable and those tapes were destroyed
tapes are no ball jose rodriguez destroyed them they would have been devastating have they ever will become public but he remains unrepentant i am proud of the decisions that i took and green their destruction of the tapes to the will work for me
i have no regrets he had no qualms we made some al qaeda terrorists with american blood on their hands
uncomfortable for a few days
oh we did the right thing for the right reason
and the right reason was to protect the homeland and to protect american lives so yes i have no qualms i can tell you that i fully supported osage decision because i thought was necessary to protect their officers in the future there was no doubt in my mind that at some point in time
this material would get into the public domain aggressive reporters again and goldman would would never have couldn't have resisted the opportunity to oh you're right on that gap in
you know we weren't to protect our officers not just from al qaeda but from the public perception of what they had been asked to do it vanished and gina were supportive of us and russia draft yet well yeah she was she drafted the cable but let's be clear what her role was jewish the chief of staff she wasn't the command
gina had no authority to order the destruction of the tapes nor did she have any authority to counter me and hose a's decision any more than the chief the station who received that cable was in a position to ignore it so i think jose has been very clear and every occasion the he and he alone made the decision to destroy those
tapes
i think most people this order sounds like the cia trying to cover up something that they knew perhaps in their heart of hearts was wrong and destroying tapes
as a student of american politics and history almost always feels like the definition of hiding something when the new york times revealed that in fact these tapes have been destroyed it was a huge scandal what was on the state and war they destroyed and if so by home the tapes were destroyed and after the destruction one of the big issues
is that congress was not notified many members of congress say democrats on friday were calling for an attorney general investigation what happened what do you think was on these tapes in why do you think they were destroyed well if a special the courses at all
called enhanced interrogation technique are depicted tapes
that's very significant because of what it means about illegality of the underlying contact depicted on the tapes and also the reliability of the information that came with the result of health care gate
and there were real questions about whether laws have been broken in fact under president obama federal prosecutors looked at whether a crime had been committed and i'm certain that federal prosecutors interviewed hospital about her role in this and her actions
the right back
what effect adam did hospitals are all in this episode have on her career at the cia wants to torture program became public it certainly seen from the outside like this was a blight on agency was considered a black mark on
hospitals record inside
no in fact her career really took off and better and i talked about that the people who took on the hardest jobs it's the most critical moments were widely respected they weren't seen as tainted a not just you know
asphalt mean people's careers were certainly not damaged by having taken part in our most aggressive progress because those were the priorities
the president at the time and of the agency and we put stuff our very best officers into those programs because if it's your most important priority you want your best people working for
so the fact that hospital and others worked on the torture program it's as i didn't at all prevent them from rising through the ranks that it actually boosted them especially as correct once trump wins the election and becomes president she promptly named deputy director of this yeah which isn't and downright is an extraordinary
job of agency and she's at the highest levels of power and in the united states government's a big job and then president decided he wanted palmdale then director of the guy to become the next secretary of state and now suddenly she's nominated to be the cia director so now that has is a nominee how law me
curse thinking about these experiences that we've been talking about the water boarding at the back side and thailand and the destruction of the tapes documenting this kind of interrogation now that she's up for this far bigger job as these lawmakers prepare for a confirmation hearing on wednesday
hospitals going to face a tough confirmation hearing in particular from democratic senators and some republican once as well and she knows it and they know it and this is what precipitated a crisis on friday when has been one to the white house and basically said
good luck i don't want to put myself through this and the through this and damage both of our reputations
if you're not committed to standing behind me and she had second thoughts and she offered to pull out of this thing and she thought about it and and i think by friday night the crisis had been resolved and she said okay i'm going to do this i'm going to go forward with this and in fact just today on monday she was spotted on the hill walking constantly meeting with senators so the cover
nation is on track what's at stake from the point of view these lawmakers who are going to be sitting across from hospital and asking her these questions for them all what is the point of this hearing
think for some senators it's simply about electoral politics some lawmakers want to send a message to their constituents that this behavior was okay and we supported maybe their constituents actually believe that torture works or this program was effective and then there are other senator senator from california die i'm fine
then who's running for reelection this is her legacy she actually led the investigation into all the bad stuff that happened during this program for others i think they have bigger concerns such as what message and they want to send to the rest of the world
are we going to support and can farm an individual who participated and what many people believe was torture right what message do we send by confirming has power is the next director of
that is the big message and i think our position as the leader of the free world we set the tone and has a of going to react to that they're going to say well i guess is that okay
can you imagine these people these animals over in the middle east that chop off heads sitting around talking and seeing that we're having a heart problem with what about it we should go for water boarding i wish you go tough and they asked me what do you think about water boarded with that dropped by said i love it
and i said the only thing is we should make it much tougher than water boarding it feels like the critical question at house confirmation hearings will be whether as the top official yeah
not just a subordinate anymore she would be willing to walk down this path again because even though she would be running the cia she still answers to one person and that would be the president and this president has himself advocated for the most aggressive forms of interrogation he seems quite comfortable with them
and so would she say yes again now bennett said she wouldn't be the agency down that path again asked to i think she would certainly be the type of director who would not be afraid to tell president this is wrong
it's not smart
and we're not doing it know they might have a new director the next day
but i think she would certainly be prepared to pay that price to do what's right
so a bennett is saying is that if president trump or to ask her to do this but the president might be very disappointed by her answer that and she would say no based on the lessons of this era that's right but that would open up to some pretty were questioning about whether she thought it was wrong and if she thought it was wrong why did she go through it in the beginning
right if it was ok once when she had a very large role and could have stopped it why should we believe that she won't do it again when she's the head of the entire sky
and i think she's probably gonna have to answer that question in various forms of many times when she faces some pretty tough senator
do you think that one of the reasons why jon benet this top spy who talks to no one said yes to your area
always to deliver this very message that hospital would be a check on the president that she would say no to anything resembling torture yeah i think bennett and others who have spoken to me about has ball day believe that she would be a check on an erratic pressing and right and i think they were
the american public to know that she's a safe bet she's a safe bet in a chaotic time what ben and others would say is she not stopped across certain lines rain you get chalk on your cleats
but you don't go over the line and i think ben and others believe that she will guide emergency through is very chaotic period in american history
have possibly because she wants cross that line because she has so much talk on her place there's no doubt that has ball has learned a few great lessons from being a involved in the interrogation program and destroying those tapes and one can assume hospital doesn't want to remove this moment
thank you
thank you
few more questions what makes a good spy what makes a good case off to me one of the real qualities that you need is an ability to deal with ambiguity because it's a very gray world it's a world where in essence didn't have to just find me
to mean you're dealing with some very in many cases unpleasant people are corrupt people or people you were necessary want to take home for thanksgiving dinner that's not always comfortable so if you're a person who sees the world in terms of black and white good guys bad guys right wrong and you're not there's not an ability to deal with moral ambiguity in turned to the greenest
espionage i think you're going to have a hard time
hospitals senate testimony is scheduled for tomorrow morning

he was what else you need to meditate in a highly anticipated announcement this afternoon president trump is scheduled to declare whether he will pull the us out of a historic nuclear deal with officials familiar with the president's thinking tell the times
he's inclined to scrap the agreement and we impose sanctions on iran despite please from allies including britain germany and france who have argued it would be a major diplomatic air and the attorney general of new york eric schneiderman resigned on monday night
hours after he was accused of physically abusing for women
the women told the new yorker that schneiderman the state's chief law enforcement officer and a prominent critic of president trumps choked and slapped them in a statement schneiderman disputed the allegations but said they would prevent him from carrying out his job

that's it for the daily i'm michael barbara see them
