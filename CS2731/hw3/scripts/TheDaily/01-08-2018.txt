peter beacon has been covering a white house media blitz this weekend defending the president's mental health starting with a series of tweets by the president on saturday morning would we
david attenborough
ordinary everyday we broad argue about how the media will going

in your a wet
rigor example accurate
given that we now know to yeah absolutely
while you're there so it's a bit of a curious examples for the president to be used well at it right
an idiot or watergate to be a real scandal in with reagan there were you it
about what
he got older
through these comments about leak the president now infamous lead into the series of tweets by seeing he's actually a genius a very steep genius
and then a few hours leader on saturday afternoon he elaborates on bad camp david where he has been spending the weekend what happened there
what do you get by a reporter why or why did you tweet about your met or out because i went to college in college
i went to had a situation where she was excellent student came out made billions and billions of dollars became one of the business people went to television fiction use the tremendous success as you probably have heard the ran for president one time and one
funny
we're going through a o
really an area where do where we about it a weird
we evaluate
oh
art suit then
finally steven this top aide to the president being snow on the sunday talk choose to food or defend the president's intelligence and his mental health and he has this exchange with jake tapper that ultimately ends with miller being escorted off the televisions and what happened
well yeah
go to make
a millionaire revolutionize reality t v and happened there's something magical it's happening in the hearts of this country the people that has approval rating all the thirties i don't know law that people that you don't connect with and understand the people whose manufacturing jobs have left who have been besieged by high crime community
is and who have been affected by a policy of uncontrolled immigration those voices those experiences don't get covered on this network
i was booked to talk about very issues i'm just describing you're not even asked me about because they're not interesting facts true that's true have plenty of questions and their grades and you have sounded a little a busker by talking about your flight no i'm not not want a question because i don't know totally gonna send on jay china even j present and the reason why do you earn
actually the media that everybody back and pretty
that's what i've seen with him traveling to meet dozens of foreign leaders with his incredible work
are still have twenty four hours a day of even area you're not going to give three minutes for the american the better the real year long as one viewer that you care about right now and you're being obsequious being a fan out and the urban them oh no
these are cute and coming on the show steven miller to speak just to the president
i know you have an audio equipment
it will in tapper wasn't wrong because not long after the president tweets cool jake tapper have you seen in just got destroyed in his interview with stephen miller of the company station so the president was watching this performance by miller
defending his intelligence tapper had it rain
well i'm up early while
it what you write
what you know
oh
you want in your a what the other guy back on your
it will deliver
what does all of this have to do with the book just came out my goals account of life inside the white house as told by steve bannon and others what does that have to do with this defense by the white house over the weekend of the president's mental health because
the book seems to somehow have started this campaign of theirs or my bottle opener
they currently of it
ball around
either girl ran questioner proper want to get it going to be that are under program
around him
or opera
art your address out over
and earned among the people around him
all really sticky stuff raid the question of mental health contrary to what the president says in a tweed and the defense is mounting the media has really sort of avoided the subject for that reason but it is true that democrats in washington have been increasingly trying to mobilize some kind of action around
this rate is that part of what the president is responding to as well
right right
but i've got a bad rap were we a regard
yale medical editor of a new game out your lightning
oil in about member out
democrat water
oh and orbit
i didn't wait a democrat
right on your urban art democrat
get up at all i would evaluate accredited go out for had written by a member

oh yeah
a bit
ordinary one year and a europe
over overweight and when you mentioned the twenty fifth and then what does that actually say and therefore would this legislation that he's democrats are envisioning do remember my mother being a ride or an hour away

another way that happen
adam mckay of a body created by genre

that apparent democrat
that body
it would be there
i'd get up and despite a psychiatrist from yale meeting with the democratic members of congress the mental health community largely has been divided on whether to wade into that's right with a lot of professionals coming forward with opinions but a lot of other psychologist
interest saying it just incredibly dangerous and irresponsible to diagnose someone from a distance yeah and regret

you regarding
why
walking his dog
jesus
the issues last year


some breaking news while you're in commercial see ben and apologizing to president trump i want to work backwards from the surprise apology on sunday we've just heard from her called peter baker
what's going on with the trump team in the time since this book was previewed were leaked what's been going on with banned since then the lead to this apology will denim has been increasingly isolated past week has been one indignity after another donald
trump has launched a scathing attack on his former chief strategist steve ban and first of all you have the president basically saying steve who never heard of the guy jeremy peters has known and reported on steve then and for years he's a credit stealing blowhard steve was a staffer who work for me after i had already
he won the nomination by defeating seventeen candidates often described as the most talented field ever assembled in the republican party and you should write him off just like i have that was essentially trumps message to republicans in the conservative movement which is crucial for steve because here steve is trying to build
old a political movement off of trump goes on and recruit candidates and run them kind of in the mall of trump
the blow it continues against mr benn and there are multiple reports tonight then you have the next day the mercer family is distancing themselves from hand they are among his most important financial backers rebecca mercer who
ben's political patronage has funded much of who's activity and also a major donor to trump same or my family and i have not communicated with the banning in many months and had provided no financial support to his political agenda nor do we support his recent actions
and statements i'm sever ties with them he will not have any more of mine financial today president wait in the a tweet merce your family recently dumped the leaker known as sloppy steve banning smoking exclamation
but it's not just trump and the murderers who turned on ben and it's some of the candidates the ban and has been campaigning for and supporting who are going to challenge republican incumbents in senate races across the country you had kelly ward in arizona and any park came in nevada
among others saying loving see the spokesman for a republican kelly war downplayed ban it is only one of the many high profile endorsements doctor ward has received steve is just one guy who supports mean i have the support of many other the conservative movement convicted felon michael grim who is running for his old have seen in new york said strongly denounced the comments by steve
and they are baseless attacks against the president's day and i fully support our commander in chief and i think ultimately the most painful and dignity for men and personally happened on sunday morning it's tragic and unfortunately steel will make these go comments so out of touch with reality and obviously south injected when steve
miller who was a costs associated
ally abandoned and going back well before they ever worked to get and i'm going from campaign basically went on national television and twisted benign and deep man and extend to the wire and the whole white house staff is deeply disappointed in his comments which were wrote so over the course of fourteen hours his political
capital drops like a stone
thank you but you're only been in knowingly participated in this book written by michael what he did a similar interview with vanity fair just a few weeks earlier and he talked to you a few weeks before that obviously he is being intentional it seems with his comment so what's going on here did he know
that this would happen or do you think he didn't expect this reaction this kind of anger at him over what he's been saying about the president you know michael it's funny i get that question a lot what was steve thinking the answer was really quite simple he wasn't thinking this was impulsive it was reckless and it was done as far as i can read deciduous
without any thought he was hopping what was on the top of his mind he was hot at the time the disclosure that this meeting had taken place with the russians in trump tower which such an obvious and avoid of ball self inflicted wound that in theory steve and it in fury
other people around the president as well so he's reacting there without thinking through the consequences now i think it's a question of whether or not those comments were ever meant to be on the record or not and whether the other took some liberties and putting them in the book but there's no doubt the steep said them
so what does ban in say on sunday what is his apology
it's not really an apology
a more of a clarification what he says the man is not that down trump junior treason us for taking this meeting with russians and trump tower in two thousand and sixteen but that the other people around trump you should have known better like paul manner for was the campaign manager at the time he should know
not have ever allowed russians and to trump tower and germ donald trump junior was there he was at the meeting but he says great patriot i do not believe that he is treason us here's more of what van and rides he says quote my comments were aimed at home manner for a season campaign professional with experience and knowledge of how the russians operate he she
should have known they are duplicitous cunning and not our friends to reiterate those comments were not aimed at dawn junior and did however say the he regretted how long it took him to respond
five days from when the news first broke to when we finally heard this may a copper so what do you do you make of that and especially the part where he expresses regret for how long it took him to express regret
i don't think it's steve i don't think it sounds like steve he watched his political capital evaporate he watches financial support collapse he watched the conservative movement and the white house turn its back on him and
steve being somebody who is hard headed stolen and unapologetic this doesn't sound to me like it was written by him but when you when you see that do you do you mean that somebody else literally may have written the steam and or that dependents heart wasn't in in what is your reporting telling you that that i think the people around
and wanted to mend the relationship with president trump and that the only way they were going to do that was to essentially put a gun to st helens that you've got to go out and say something and he i think that this statement issued under extreme duress and
ben and did not even today with all that happened with the denunciations on television by senior white house officials didn't want to apologize and display the weakness that he believes apologies do and yet he ultimately did apologize
if you read it the word i'm sorry isn't in there is a
do we know jeremy if steve den and route to statement we do now

thank you thanks for having me it's a pleasure is always going to

the

use what else you bitch unedited
manning gentlemen
i say are liars and they are honest and i welcome to the seventy fifth annual golden globes and happy new year hollywood
it's two thousand and eight in marijuana is finally allowed and sexual harassment finally is it
attitude and boobs on sunday in hollywood openly confronted a culture of sexual harassment
that was exposed with allegations of sexual assault by harvey weinstein and has since implicated men across the entertainment industry
in the audience actresses and actors were black to honor the victims of harassment
and cooled and gloom winners of both sexes called for a new era in a field still dominated by men what i know for sure
is that speaking your truth is the most powerful tool we all have and especially proud and inspired by all the women who have felt strong enough and empowered enough to speak up and shared their personal stories each of us in this room
are celebrated because of the stories we tell and this year we became the story near the end of the ceremony as she accepted own lifetime achievement award
oprah winfrey broaden the conversation be on the entertainment industry
and paid tribute to a young black housewife receipt taylor who in nineteen forty four was raped by a group of white men who were never punished for their crime she lived as we all have lived too many years in a culture broken by brutally powerful men for
to log women have not been heard or believed if they dared to speak truth to the power of those men
but their time is up
