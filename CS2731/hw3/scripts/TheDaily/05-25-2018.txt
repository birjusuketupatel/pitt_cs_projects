president trump abruptly cancels a historic summit with kim jong il
the world and north korea in particular he writes has lost a great opportunity for lasting peace
it's friday may twenty fifth



i'm here in north korea's nuclear test site kong eighty a place for journalists have never been a while before and we are here in north korean government says to witness the destruction of this site they say it will never be able to be used again thursday began with this carefully selected group of journalists who have been flown into north korea to witness the demolition the blowing
up of an underground nuclear testing facility
clinton or covers the white house for the times the north koreans had made a very big show of inviting this group of outsiders to witness is that we travel around fifteen hours to get here first by bush through the coastal city of one song
apartment seven here we are then some twelve hours by train they had to track them to a very remote site by plane by car they even have to hike a certain amount of distance to get to this place this viewing site where they could watch this facility buried into a hillside blow up in front of them
recall remaining right
grandma
meat
and why did north korea demolish this site and such a public fashion
this was meant to be one of a series of confidence building gestures by the north koreans halting missile tests releasing three americans who'd been detained in north korea gestures to the united states and to south korea that the north koreans were serious when they said they were ready to give up their nuclear arsenal
and all of this of course was aimed at building confidence in advance of the big show the meeting between kim jong on the north korean leader and president trump so yes thursday started off on a very promising know

welcome again to our of the us here in the united states and around the world significant breaking news on this thursday morning the plan summit the historic summit in just a few weeks between kim jong il and president child is now often it's coming in a letter so very soon after the end of this highly public exercise in north korea the demolition of this nuclear site
the white house puts out a letter and about nine forty five in the morning late afternoon in north korea from president trump to kim jong on in which the president essentially says are meeting is off
and did anyone know that this letter was coming know it came completely out of the blue and frankly even more so because president trump had recorded an interview with fox the which aired early in the morning on thursday june twelfth are you going to be in singapore we'll see what happened in which he spoke quite optimistically
about the prospects for a some there's a good chance and it will be a great thing to north korea if that happened general be a great thing for north korea
most importantly it would be a good thing to the world so we'll see what it really truly was a bolt from the blue and mark what is this letter from president trump to kim jong un actually say well it begins dear mr chairman we greatly appreciate your time patience and effort with respect to our recent negotiations
and discussions relative to a summit long sought by both parties which was scheduled to take place on june twelfth in singapore we were informed that the meeting was requested by north korea but that to us is totally irrelevant
i was very much looking forward to being there with you sadly based on the tremendous anger and open hostility displayed in your most recent statement i feel it is inappropriate at this time to have this long planned meeting therefore please let this letter serve to represent that the singapore
ur summit for the good of both parties but to the detriment of the world will not take place
you talk about your nuclear capabilities but ours are so massive and powerful that i pray to god they will never have to be used
oh yes
there was a lot to impact their their it and i'm struck by the line we were informed that the meeting was requested by north korea but that is totally irrelevant i was very much looking forward to being there with you
why say that as an introduction to cancelling this meeting well one of the points the americans have made from the very start is you guys asked for this we didn't ask for you came to us we didn't come to you
that said president trump particularly as time has gone on and he said more time to get used to the idea of this meeting and to look forward to it has become very attracted by the prospect and he's put a lot of time into cultivating his relationship with kim jong on even though the two men have never met president trump has spoken about cam
and very personal terms for quite a few weeks now so i think that this line captures both points one you came to us but to i really was beginning to have a relationship with you
this kind of an earnest sentiment here that he wanted this meeting to occur and is kind of a little crush that it's not that's absolutely right and in think one thing that's been very clear about present a trump particularly in the last two to three weeks is he really really was looking forward to this meeting his wasn't a show on his part
he wasn't being dragged into it he didn't even really have misgivings about it on a personal level he was savoring the opportunity he was excited by okay so then the present rights that the meeting is cancelled because of what he calls tremendous anger and open hostility from north korea what exactly
is he referring to well the most immediate thing he's referring to is a statement that was issued overnight by a top north korean official the vice foreign minister
and in that statement the official goes after vice president my pants calling vice president like pants quote a political dummy says that he misunderstands the north korean position and he is saying uninformed and stupid things so there is a personal insult that's being lobbed here at the vice press
didn't but beyond that the statement goes on to say that if you don't meet us in a room maybe you'll meet us on the battlefield you know maybe we will have a nuclear showdown while so there's actually a very serious threat here of military hostilities that's also being rolled out by the north koreans but why would north korea call
the vice president of the united states a dummy
so now to exclusive interview with the vice president starting with that meeting at the white house will vice president pants invoked libya you know there was some talk about the libyan
ashley
you know as the person and made clear
you know this this will only end like that libya model ended if kim jong un doesn't make a deal remember the libya model which we've discussed here before libya promise to get rid of its nuclear weapons in exchange for economic hell even though it will be a gave up its nuclear weapons or it's program that eventually
lead to an overthrow of libya kim jong un is likely mindful of gadhafi is bloody and as opposition forces in his country gained power i think what's at play here is that the libya model is a particularly provocative issue for the north koreans and so the fact that vice president pence brought it up
only a few weeks after john bolton the national security advisor first floated the idea may have lodged in their minds as a sign that the us was not getting this model out of its head and so they needed to push back hard on that so i think it's a combination of anger at the libyan model but a growing recognize
mission of just how much distance separates the two sides
personal trauma made it clear the united states of america
under his leadership is not going to tolerate the regime and north korea possessing nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles to threaten the united states and our allies
to trump ends this section of a letter that you read with a pretty explicit threat pointing out that the us has a massive nuclear arsenal and it would be a shame if we had to use it why would you do that
i think this goes to the second part of what the north koreans were saying in their statement which is this kind of threat that if you don't meet us in the negotiating table maybe you'll meet us on the nuclear battlefield i think this is the president reminding the north koreans you know we have more of those than you do it was really i think no more ca
complicated than that
it's a little in congress to have the president say how sad he is to not do this meeting he really wanted to do and simultaneously say we might nuclear
yeah no kidding i mean there's a lot of paradoxes but there's been paradox is in president trumps relationship with kim jong un from the start rocket man is on a suicide mission for himself and for his regime this after all is a relationship that began with i'm calling him a little rocket man rocket man should have been hand
long time
and then almost overnight things have changed radically from a few months ago
you know the name calling and a lot of other things turned into this very strange courtship he really has been where he wound up referring to him as a gentleman who had behaved honorably think very honorable from everything wishing there has been this paradox in how trump has treated came from the beginning and i think we do see it even in this letter today
so how does this letter n or you read the last two paragraphs trump rights i felt a wonderful dialogue was building up between you and me and ultimately it is only that dialogue that matters day i look very much forward to meeting you in the meantime i want to thank you for the release of the
hostages who are now home with their families this was a beautiful gesture and was very much appreciated
if you change your mind having to do with this most important summit please do not hesitate to call me or right the world and north korea in particular has lost a great opportunity for lasting peace and great prosperity and wealth this missed opportunity is truly a sad moment in history sincerely
yours donald trump president of the united states
what do you make of this second part of a letter
well i think there's a couple interesting things to zero in on one i would point out is his phrase that the only dialogue that matters is the one between you and me that may be a way of saying to can forget about john bolton forget about my pants and forget about the libyan model what matters is what you and i talk about across the table from one another that's what's important
then he goes on to say some day i look forward to meeting you and i'm thanking you for the release of a hostage is the hostages was a major gesture on kim's part it was something they gave president trump an enormous lift at home i think he was genuinely grateful for and then he goes on to say you know if you have a change of heart you know how to reach me which you know
again as an exceedingly strange use of language in a letter between two heads of state that have never met one another it almost feels more like a letter you might send to someone you had a fight with and you're hoping you can make up in the future but that's kind of the underlying tone of the whole letter this letter is a deeply personal one and it is worth noting
the president dictated every single word of this letter himself while yes this was not a letter written by committee or drafted foreign secretary of state using time tested language this was president trumps own language put down on paper
so
right back
it still feels like there's a little ambiguity around exactly what happened here there's the obvious surface theory that starting with john bolton and then like pence that language from the us spooked north korea and so they issued
turrets and that unsettled the president and he cancelled the meeting
but what do you think is really behind this historic decision to end this historic summit
i think there's a couple of other elements that are intriguing i'm not sure they're absolutely the main cause but i'll mention both one is the united states sent a group out from the white house to start making arrangements in singapore and they were in singapore for three days waiting for their north korean counterparts and the north koreans never show
they send it up the american group and that group included the white house deputy chief of staff joe hagan a man whose planned presidential trips going all the way back to george h w bush so that i think was seen as quite problematic quite a major snob on the part in the north koreans i think the second area that's worthy of exploration
nation is the role of the chinese president cheesy and paying kim jong un went out to see she didn't paying twice most recently a couple of weeks ago he went to visit him in a coastal chinese city on and as soon as he got back to north korea there was a perceptible shift in north korea's tone toward the united
states the big question and president trump himself has raised this is what happened in that meeting machine right i will say i'm a little disappointed because when kim jong own had the maybe with president xi in china the second made the first really we know about the second meeting
i think there was a little change in attitude from kim jong own so i don't like that did president she tell kim jong on to go back to pyongyang and take a tougher tone or alternatively did kim jong on say to president she you know i really don't want to do this meeting if i pull out well you have my back
don't know the answer to that question but i think it's a major part of what may have happened here
i wonder if there's some it was doomed from the start based on the depth of that's trust these very different goals of both countries the us demanding that north korea immediately the nuclear eyes north korea saying we can't do that we won't do that we fear that that leads us to giving up
are protective shield or was this a case of both sides the president and his people and cabinet and his people mocking this all up with their actions and their statements
i think if you speak to american diplomats that have been involved in previous negotiations with north korea they will tell you it was doomed from the start because the gap between the two sides was simply unbreakable
i think what president trump manage to do interestingly enough by sheer force of enthusiasm is kind of make people rethink their assumptions about north korea well maybe if the president of the united states can get kim jong on across a table they can do what thirty years of negotiators have failed to accomplish
they can actually bridge the gap to some extent the last week has been a reality check on that euphoria it's been a kind of an exercise in people throwing cold water on both trump in chem and now we emerge at the end of this period with even president trump thinking maybe i got ahead of myself maybe they're simply it
is too much distance between us for even a dealmaker like me to bridge and i think that's what the letter also reflects his conclusion that as exciting as a possibility as this was it's not actually a good idea and probably never was yeah that's right because the price of failure is high
hi once you've had that meeting at the leader to leader level and you fail to get to the goal where do you have left to go i mean one of the interesting things about what president from did here is he inverted the normal sequence of diplomacy normally you would have begun this conversation at a much lower level you would have met at a
ministerial level maybe you would have moved up to the secretary of state and the foreign minister and only then if you are making progress would you bring in the big guns to actually close the deal or president trumpeted here in effect is he said let's bring the big guns in for the first meeting and i think what he discovered is the risks of doing that are simply too high

mark there's there's so much going on here so much reading between the lines both with this letter and with all these comments from all these sides leading up to this latter being written us partly blaming china north korea is blaming john bolton what do you think all this is really about ultimate what does this letter really represent
i think for all of the complexity all of the different forces all of the agendas this letter really comes down to a relationship between two people and an attempt by one of them president trump to salvage the relationship with the other kim jong on to salvage relationship even as he
ends this historic summit
i think maybe the president's thinking is i gotta take this step now to preserve the relationship down the road

thank you
thanks michael
