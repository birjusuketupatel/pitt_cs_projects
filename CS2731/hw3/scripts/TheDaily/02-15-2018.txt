
from new york times on michael barbara this is the
today president trump is calling for an overhaul of the us immigration
to replace family beast migration with merit based migration
what counts as married
and the school shooting in floor
it's thursday february fifteen
it's not i'll watch the morning
the show of fraud
the boat dog
border sugar to enter or other
immigration issue
kill killen what's been going on in the senate this week
the senate has taken this really unusual step of engaging in a kind of unmitigated hashing out of all things immigration caitlin dickerson covers immigration for the tops and that's because in order to convince democrats to reopen the government last month mitch mcconnell agreed to an open debate that's what they're doing
our promised would clear other words with both which matters is what
i promised i would sure of a moment
which both thought that all closure or discussion a boat
everyone should be focused on finding a bill to protect the dreamers and address border security that can get sixty votes that's all good and the goal is to build a new immigration policy from scratch so something that deals with dreamers but also if the republicans get their way the deal
that involve a lot more than than it could in fact overhaul our entire immigration system
our legal system as well exactly
and what would that mean the change that republicans are envisioning of are illegal immigration system
well the biggest thing that it means is a shift away from the core of our current immigration system which is family based acceptance family ties know right now we allow about a million people into the country every year and about eight hundred thousand of them are two thirds are allowed and based on who they are related to
that's really what makes up the bulk of who he allow into the country and the idea that republicans are hoping to sell democrats on his to really lemon if not totally get rid of the says that are based on family ties and focus instead on employment skills and education and on fact
that they believe are going to clearly benefit the american economy we will have show many more benefits it will save countless dollars raised workers wages and help struggling families including immigrant families enter the middle class and they will do it quickly and they will be
very very happy indeed
so how does this system of family based migration has actually work so the system allows people to petition to bring family members into the country specific types of family members so young children but also in some cases adult children who are married
siblings and parents but it's not as if you just apply and anybody who falls into one of those categories his shirt in the sponsor has to prove that they make a certain amount of money so that this person who is coming into the united states is going to be supported that they're not going to be a drag on the economy and then each of those category
mary's is subject to limit so just because again you qualify as somebody whose family member has enough money and as a sibling or a child of an american citizen
you also are gonna have to wait in line and in many cases those lines are years and years long and they can even be decades long so it sounds like you're saying there are limitations on this it's not an open door system to family but in essence this is a system built around the idea that eventually you can have
a lot of your family maybe even most of your family join you in united states yeah absolutely and you know people have looked back at three and four generations and seen a single and grant bring in more than one hundred people
and and this may be responsible for the name the president trump likes to use to describe this system which controversial
jane migration team migration exactly chain migration my my great ending
migration
god
common is the system you're describing around the world outside the united states
it's not common at all i mean lots of other countries they do allow some people based on family ties but even in places that do the american definition of family is much broader than it is elsewhere in the world other countries don't consider an adult child necessarily and eligible family member or a sip
ling and eligible family member so we are the most generous country when it comes to family based immigration so why do we do it this way why would our immigration policy be based on anything other than what's the relic the best for our economy
that we will find a revolution
not affect the lives of millions
it is still one of the most important back to congress
and of this administration
what's interesting is that when family based immigration was introduced in one and sixty five it comes along with a sort of surprising goal in mind which is to keep the united states primarily white primarily european merger that we will find
we're really make us proud to our fellow over the country
it will rank and
unseen way before that we had quotas that are based on country of origin under that system
a problem to her
depended on the country
and those were then considered during the nineteen sixty civil rights movement to be racist man of steel him town
or denied and the call came from chicago
you are from one of the development and so we moved away from a quota system and yet created another system that was intended to maintain the racial makeup of the country the demographic makeup of the country but of course shortly after immigration patterns shit
and we see a lot more people coming to the united states from basically everywhere except europe and so you know as a result this policy starts to really propelled dramatic change in terms of demographics in the opposite direction that it was intended to when it was introduced so this is really interesting kill him when the press
made is no infamous shit hole it he was talking about doing away with aspects of our immigration system that result in people from poor countries or people without her
hi and economic value coming to the us and that's also it sounds like what he's thinking about with this shift away from a family be system to america system but it feels like what you're saying is that that's what the creators of the family based system
wanted as well when that system was created exactly it does the exact opposite of what the architects of the policy hoped or and as a result the country has become a lot more brown
so with that in mind would a merit based system is thing the present from says he wants what it actually accomplish his stated core of bringing immigrants with higher economic value than the family based system it would replace it could it
pens on what the merit based system looks like because all that means in general is that as a country you decide on factors that are important to you in terms of who you want to bring in you assign each of those factors some degree of weight and then you use that sort of rubric to decide who gets a ticket and who doesn't
but when president trump talks about a merit based system he's being a lot more specific than that he actually means fewer overall immigrants and then have that much smaller number of people we allow in a much larger proportion of them being people who have high skills doctors engineers
h s entrepreneurs more immigrants who can slide into the upper echelons of the american economy and of american society and so if we think about his definition of merit based then yes that will be the result so we've been discussing this kind of philosophical question of what
immigration is for and this seems to be another philosophical question what is married and having high schools is just one way to think about it but it sounds like that's how president trump is thinking about marriage
right i mean i think one thing that's actually getting lost in this debate is that there's research that shows that people who have family ties actually fare better in the economy because they have a built in safety net so if you move to america and you have family members here you have someone who you can stay with if you don't have anywhere to live you have someone who can take
due to the d m v who can show you how to file taxes who might help you learn the language and understand the culture so there's definitely an economic argument that says people with family ties are actually going to do even better ben somebody who's a ph year who has millions of dollars to contribute to the economy but who doesn't have anybody to help them on a rainy day
when things go wrong
so do the case to be made that family based immigration
the having family ties when you're an immigrant arriving in the us is actually a pretty strong fair of marriage
absolutely a strong case and that's something that could be incorporated into america a system we could offer points based on who has family ties just like with the diversity so that we've talked about you could offer points for diversity is are all things that could be incorporated into a merit based system in theory but that's not what president
trump is talking about doing when he proposes his version of a merit based immigration system
what we're talking about would be a massive overhaul of the us immigration system is this actually on the table know
it is on the table and it looks like it's going to have to be on the table because on wednesday president trump came out and said that if whatever bill the senate comes up with doesn't include this idea of merit based in immigration that hill veto it he's really putting pressure on them to make this bigger and a broader than just a bill that looks at dhaka and he is pushing them
to try to come up with something that looks a lot more like what happens in countries like canada
but here's the thing what president trump has described as his ideal immigration system it looks vastly different than what actually happens in canada
and it's not clear how this senate is going to reconcile those new and ideas
thanks my mom

when we come then what actually happens in canada

current outdated system the oppressors wages for our poorest workers and coach great pressure on taxpayers nations around the world like canada australia and many others have a merit based immigration system
kevin present trump has said two things about america based immigration system one he wants high school workers to be the priority and to he sees canada as a model is that how the canadian merit based system works does
prioritize high skilled work yes and no it's actually quite a complicated system catherine porter is the canada bureau chief of the times so there are three stream
immigrants to canada there's refugees about fourteen percent there's the family reunification scream similar to the american one
then as much as sixty percent as this merit based system and the system a super complicated and back like if you talk to people who teach that they'll tell you is super complicated because it changes all the time but it's basically a points system
where you get a certain amount of points based on your age your education your language skills with a language
and time they called adaptability it's basically the idea that you're calm and you'll hit the ground running
not just the federal government but each province in canada and territory also has their own system
breaking and they can rank at based on what skills they're looking for now on paper it says that fifty eight percent of our system comes that way people who are merit but really most of those people come with spouses and kids so if you take them out of that equation and really only a quarter
of immigrants coming to canada who are picked specifically for their skills
so it sounds like the skill sets that are used to judge an immigrant are not oh is what we might think of is high skills and higher education in the last survey so that in not just people who have i teach skills are getting in but cook like shorter curtains people on the catering business
oh because each province territory because there's thirteen provinces and territories and canada making this easy or but he i'm gets a look at their own job market and see where the holes are that they want to filter they also have a very large failing fifty percent of the say of which immigrants come in so yeah know if not necessarily
the only ph d's although the more education you have the higher your point from this marriage system
haven't you know why canada bill their immigration system
this way
hair is actually a really interesting story so before the sixties there was basically people will tell you that are a race based system here are a very race the system where they give preferential treatment to people from white countries the even have a quota on how many
people from sri lanka india were allowed in every year and in the sixties that i'll change they monitor system that with colorblind that was based just on merit and they brought this new system and gradually and by nineteen sixty seven they put em like this point system to make sure basically the
bringing people based on math and nod where they came from or what they look like so is interesting though it's being held the right now in the united states as this model because with the debate in the states being so polarized around race right now in canada this was like an antidote to that this was seen as something to try
treat people fairly coming in and give everyone a fair shot well it's also interesting because we just heard from her colleague que and dickerson that the us system of family based migration was also a response to what was seen as a racist immigration system in the sixties so these
two countries responded to the same problem in two very different ways
so is this merit based system that canada came up with isn't working in canada do people like it
yeah a super popular like immigration and canada is still seen as a nation building everyone sees it as a way that we grow our economy makes this more competitive yeah it's really i would say like an essential part of they can your identity of being a multiculturalism is immigration
part of that as care brings in a lot of immigrants like they bring in point eight percent of the population every year and at this point more than twenty percent of the whole canadian population
are immigrants so the still a real embrace of the idea that immigration is something that is good and i think the they're based system is the special sauce and to that it does really promote the idea that were getting the best people from around the world coming to canada and not just that they're so lucky to come to canada canada's lucky to have them
here so that sounds like a case for this version of merit based immigration both why if president or in moving to america be system
is to limit the number of immigrants coming in and to prioritize the high skilled why is he pointing to canada as the model
it's the head scratching for many people in canada and cry to tell you because the model here is about bringing in lots of people based on an idea that immigration is really good for the country that it brings them talent and skills and fresh blood fresh ideas that it builds the country up
where is where the president in the states since the thing is he wants few are immigrants which is completely contrary to the canadian experience

can thank you very much thank you my mom

on wednesday afternoon oh broad bipartisan group of senators announced they had reached an agreement on an immigration plan it is narrower than the one called for by president drop the compromise legislation would boost border security
and resolve the feet of the dreamers offering them a path to citizenship
but would not address family beast migration
peaceful lottery program
but the president's insistence on his hard line plan calls into question whether any compromise legislation can make it past his desk


what happened was the fire alarm went off so he was going outside like a regular job
when i heard two gunshots
i just see a whole bunch of people start running my direction and
the administrators and teachers taught us to start running so i was just running
wherever and just find the crowd
on wednesday afternoon in kirkland florida about an hour north of mainly a gunman walked into a high school with a semi automatic rifle and killed at least seventeen people i thought it was just someone put the fire alarm and then i actually got scared like there's actually a shooter
and people are actually dying
police have arrested a nineteen year old former student at the school who recently was expelled and who was known to carry guns but they have yet to describe a motive for the shooting
it was the eighteenth school shooting in the us so far this year
on wednesday evening broward county sheriffs god israel held a news conference near to school
a truly makes me sick to my stomach
down and guess that's horrible catastrophic


that's it for the daily i'm michael barbara
