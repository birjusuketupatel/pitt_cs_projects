is the day

saturday
in announcing tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum president trump said they would protect national security
but what if the threat to national security are the terrorists themselves
it's thursday march
peter when's the last time that we were in a big trade war the nineteen thirties that's the classic case of trade conflict yielding catastrophe peter goodman covers economics for the times from roughly eighteen seventy told the first world war
that's a period economic historians consider you know the first wave of globalization where there's a lot of trade a lot of development of new markets and the world's been nipped together in a way in which it had not been proven
and world war one and did that and produced a lot of nationalism distract economic insecurity and all of this lives on through the first decades of the twentieth century where you have this retreat to protectionism to countries
putting tariffs and other sorts of restraints on trade to protect their domestic industries and the crescendo of this is this nineteen thirties law adopted by a republican controlled congress called the smoot holly tariff fact i'm broke
which comes as the us sinking into the great depression obama
robin job but rarely come in under an unmarked
and the republicans in congress resort to protectionism as the fix they jack up tariffs on hundreds of products to levels that had not been seen in a century and this is supposed to put a wall around american factories and farmers and protect them from the ink
persians of foreign competitors but the results are immediately disastrous
no longer bring my job
yeah
a moving out from home
had become habit of our moms and radical talk boiling
america's trading partners in europe in latin america start imposing their own tariffs so suddenly american farmers to we're supposed to be protected now can't export their wares to other markets around the world and the economy which is already in the depression sinks deeper into the
it's certainly not the cause of the great depression but it is widely seen as a cause that exacerbated deepened lengthened the great depression and trade grinds to a halt really and around much of the planet
so even though these terrorists holly tariffs were meant to be defensive measures to protect the united states economy and its industries it sounds like it ends up being offensive and very provocative well it certainly has that effect i mean when you impede imports
from another country you are effectively hurting the livelihood of the people in that country who make their living selling stuff to you and they're not real happy about that and then domestic politics in other countries then demands similar retaliation people are angry and accusatory and now
suddenly just about every country i'm in great britain france nazi germany response to these american tariffs with their own tariffs that's what the effect of the smooth holly tariffs ultimately had we had tit for tat terrorists
out overnight and economic bunker
india
the on grinding robert
chanel other fewer opportunities for everyone and as a result european nations that are already feeling tremendous hostility and insecurity toward one another have a new reason to feel that way i mean it enhances the nationalistic animosities that have been unleashed across the continent
there is a blame game and it's easy to go and blame the people on the other side of border for effectively damaging your your livelihood any it is certainly a contributor to what becomes world war two so in this case a trade war actually is a factor in a real or it is
certainly a factor
so does the us and the rest of the world absorb that lesson after world war two yeah very much so
oh yeah and watching guy named examination up by congress convenes during one of the caution okay
mm hmm a cabin on a white be arrive on a private i'm trauma and
so the powers that emerge victorious from world war two and the united states is if the top of the list build this new economic order world economic cooperation and essential
and the fundamental idea is that if people are tied by commercial interests if they're trading with one another if they're engaging in commerce together than they are less likely to develop murderous impulses to one another
weymouth no other or the reconstruction of world
and
my own international system and ring
this idea is that the center of the global trading or that emerged from the war first with the so called get the general agreement on tariffs and trade which starts up in the mid forties and that gives way in the mid ninety's to the world
trade organization which is often described as the referee for global trade show their own agreed upon rules are now one hundred and sixty four members and operates by consensus everybody agrees you extend a deal to one world trade organization member if you lower your tariff on some product and you have to extend that same deal
to all the others and if they're disputing then you have this institution that adjudicate and looks at the rules and proposes remedies and it's it's all about settling disputes before there's a war
so after trade had contributed to a world war and it sounds like a driving idea behind this global trade agreement was that the opposite of could also be true and that having friendly productive trade relationships could actually preserve peace yeah exactly right
that they connected in his through trade would be a tremendous disincentive against war because war with them beating erupting something that depends upon peace to continue that's the fundamental idea
so has the global trade agreement and the de vito worked in terms of preventing the kind of devastating treat conflicts that we saw in the nineteen thirties yeah it has but there have been some flare ups i'm in in in the early eighties japanese production of automobiles
is almost twice as great per worker in america we did come pretty close to trade war between the united states and japan japanese steel workers are produced their american counterparts by about twenty five percent when reagan took on the japanese over surging exports of cars to the us now this and because they're about
our workers are match the american working man or woman again study one wanna were so what happened with reagan and the auto industry and japan in the nineteen eighties so reagan comes into office in january he want the american auto industry is in a generally pretty rough shape new cars and you
cause stand like shining tombstones in the showrooms in parking lots of the nation's car dealers on loved unwanted and unsold the seventies was the time of oil shocks gas is really expensive people can no longer afford to run cause that do twelve miles to the ghana and americans have now acquired a taste
later smaller more fuel efficient cars and detroit just isn't producing them
toyota that's country tough and city smart to stop and go you be asking for toyota and we'll japan has stepped in and suddenly flooding the united states with fuel efficient cars americans are buying them up and their landing and dry was all across the united states can enjoy the high
highest it cause you can put a price
and is under pressure from the auto industry to give them some breathing room so that prompted reagan to jawbone the japanese and to threaten tariffs that ultimately landed on some other products as well but the concentration on cars resulted in japan to voluntarily restrain their own export
the voluntarily or voluntarily yeah so how was it in this case that we avoided a trade war with japan why did japan basically agreed to do what reagan asked well in this case both sides of a lot of interest and avoiding a trade war the us has got military bases
in japan is pledged to defend japan and event of attack and there's just no scenario where japan's gonna have sustain hostilities with the united states and for reagan reagan fancies himself a free trader he doesn't want to have a trade war he's he doesn't want to have a breach with the world trade organization he doesn't want to be seen
as as unilaterally disrespecting the rules of global trade so both sides find this financial i so called protectionism is almost always self destructive doing more harm than good even though it's supposed to be helping advocates of protectionism often ignore its huge he hadn't crossed that far outweigh any temporary
benefits so this is an example of these global trade roars and global trade institutions working this is an example of yes the rules based global trading system working and also the pragmatic interests of business and consumers which generally carry the day
hey over the kind of screening of protection the european union has not treated as well
and it's been a very very unfair trade situation i'm here to protect him one of the reasons i was elected as i'm protecting our workers on protecting our companies and i'm not going to let that happen
trumps trade advisers will often point to the nineteen eighties example with japan and cited as evidence that if you stake out a tough position if you sell people on the idea that you're willing to go to war then that can be a fruitful prelude to negotiations to get your which won
but the situation today is quite different from the situation in the nineteen age
will be i


so peter from everything you've said tariff should be imposed carefully to solve a problem because of their power to trigger a trade or so what problem are the terrorists that trump is proposing on steel and aluminum supposed to address will trump is rhetorically going
after something that is in fact a problem in the global economy and has way too much steel being produced regard governments around the world subsidizing steel production there is a large glut of steel on world markets and a lot of it's coming out of china the us and the european union plane china as been dumping steel products on
the global market will just hurt their own steelmakers oh steelmakers continue to fight a losing battle against for studio
china the models feel make a giant mix all other countries buy and sell for less than a plant here to make
the issue here is that these terrorists that the trump administration has outlined would hit not china which sells only about two percent of the steel to the united states that's consuming notes states but every other american trading partner that sell steel canada which is the number one supplier
south korea japan taiwan germany mexico these are countries that view themselves as key american allies that are committed to the rules based global trading system that are suddenly being hit by the impacts of these tariffs
so the math that you just laid out is pretty remarkable present trump says that these terrorists are about cheap chinese steel but we only get about two percent of our steal from china so actually these tariffs are mostly hitting the other countries that we get our steal from including may of our allies but does this
and least solve a problem for us manufacturers
the idea is that you help american steel producers were operating in a global climate where there's all this surplus chinese steel that's bring down prices and making it very difficult for them to be profitable and certainly the steel industry lost a lot of workers there are a lot of weight on your workers and the industrial midwest
the steel producers themselves are happy about these terrorists the problem is that in the american economy there's something like eighty times as many people who wake up and go to work at companies that buy steal as there are workers who go to places that make steel so when you help the steel companies sure
up their profits by protecting them from overseas competition you've hurt everybody who depends upon buying steel many automakers have to pay if these tariffs happen the companies that make farm equipment construction equipment some of these are really big companies like caterpillar that are selling their
where's around the world they're going to have to pay more for steel so there would actually be potentially more american workers negatively affected by these tariffs then helped by though because more people sound like working companies that use steal that would be more expensive as a result of this then people who would benefit because they work
in domestic steel production of this is precisely why much of the american business world is up in arms about these terror well our biggest complaint really is that tariffs our taxes
the beer industry potentially three hundred and forty seven million dollars a year in taxes i'm very concerned there's significant risk here these tariffs will raise prices on american consumers of cars and trucks that are actually built in america
not just increase prices and in disruption to the supply chain but the fear of of retaliation that's already been stated by foreign leaders around the globe this is in fact the mainstream view among economists and businesses that you're helping one industry at the expense of everyone who depends upon buying the goods that that industry produces this is why
why gary cone the president's chief economic advisor walked out the door having failed to carry the day with this argument that the economy would be hurt by these tariffs so then what exactly is the president's justification for doing this the justification for these terrorists from the trump administration i mean we
in defense we need great steelmaker is that import of steel and aluminum constitute in national security threat to the united states so the idea that americans are not as safe as they would be because we're buying steel and aluminum from canada so he's the president
saying peter that any event of war we would need plenty of steel plenty of aluminum presumably for weapons for ships for planes and we need to make sure to protect our own domestic manufacturing of those materials instead of relying on another country for those medals is that basically the argument yes
plus it is this idea that there's something sacred about steel and aluminum and it from out of control of it if you don't have our own supply of it at home than work harold but let's remember that something like two thirds of the steel the we're consuming in the united states is produced in the united states if the us
generates two thirds of the still that we consume how could there be a national security threat of a suddenly not being able to produce enough of our own still well if mr trump goes through with this plan that's a question that some judges in geneva the world trade organization will probably be wrestling with so this could actually
up in that global rules system that you've been describing well we have
they a statement in response to the announcement that president
donald trump i mean european union in as signal that it's likely to challenge these tariffs as illegal under debate year
stand ready to respond to family and in the proportionate manner
on the bases and that's required by two routes now that present something of an existential crisis to the world trade organization because built the end of the world trade organisation is a lot of deference to sovereign nations and they may be tempted to say we may or may not agree with this rationale
but the united states is sovereign nation has the right to determine for itself when it's national security is on the line if they rule that way the result of that will be no a giant hole in the rules based global trading system because that would presumably open the floodgates to lots of other assertions from other countries that are looking for
an opportunity to protect favorite industries
on the other hand if the infallibility these trump terrorist if they say no we're not buying it there is no real national security claim here that could prompt the drug administration which has been openly hostile to the world trade organization to either to disregard the referee and let the game go on in which case they were
all have undermined the power of the world trade organization or to just pull out all together then we'd be in uncharted territory
so you're saying that his proposal by president trump has the potential to really throw the global trading system
in to crisis current so power of other countries responded to the threat of these tariffs on aluminum and steel it is at traditionalist being discussed h will now be shared with member states i mean european union as already signalled that if these tariffs happen they're gonna put retaliatory tariffs on a bunch
sensitive american products i would say that on the least they're steel products that are industrial products in their agricultural products and certain types of that is indeed on the list bourbon which has produced overwhelmingly in kentucky were shown mitch mcconnell anxious hand harley davidson motorcycles
which come from state of wisconsin home of house bigger paul ryan and other sensitive proud are he done in the trans decision to impose terrorists unseal an animal in court has fueled the of an escalating trade will canada mexico china australia brazil and the european union are are threatening retire
earlier toy measures against us product so we regard the imposition of any new tariffs and rating tariffs on steel and aluminum between our two countries is absolutely unacceptable
firmly and commands to defend our interests
we're no longer talking about individual industries were no longer talking about protecting strategic industries were talking about using trade to inflict harm across borders
so if these terrorists that the president is threatening on aluminum and steel if they don't really address a national security threat and if they wouldn't actually do all that much to change the global trading math around steel and aluminum and if it's really just can end up
setting our allies and provoking all this retaliation is there some other reason why president trump is doing this
we're going to put american steel and aluminum back in to the backbone of our catch these tell fulfill a very prominent campaign pledge that this president plan on we're going to put the miners as steel workers back to what and allow him to go and be greeted warmly
by steel workers i mean in places like indiana illinois and one of the hardest as this
state of iowa manufacturing jobs you steal jobs ohio michigan pennsylvania and when i'm president guess what steel is coming back to pittsburgh at a lot of other things are coming where steel workers have seen really really awful unemployment have lost hope
have lost savings mean this is a way of saying i feel your pain folks i'm going to do so much about it's going to be so easy
i've done something about it
and he talked to trade expert and they see it as a sort of cynical ploy word you're effectively damaging the economic interests of more work in people in exchange for that photo op but the power of that photo op is an opportunity for this president who is very good at speaking directly to his base to
with a victory flag wall a bunch of nerdy economists run around screaming actually it's a lot more complicated than that and it seems to be a bad that those people will be drowned out by the sheer power of that imagery of steel mills hiring people
so this is about domestic politics but it sounds like there are very real
and potentially very destructive consequences
of these terrorists to the american economy to american workers and to our relationships with countries around the world yeah exactly right
the president is invoking national security as we discussed in trying to justify these terrorists but you think these terrorists actually threaten national security i mean if you believe that it's important for the united states to have the trust of its allies then there is an argument to be made that this jeopardizes
national security
i mean look out of the carnage of the second world war came this idea daily for commercial interests are linked if we're trading with one another there were less likely to take up arms against one another and go to war and the united states the largest economy on earth is now run
by a president who does not seem to believe in their basic idea that as a direct challenge to the collectivist notion that has driven not only trade policy but diplomacy in the post world war two era and it's coming in for a stiff test
and one could argue that that is a threat to american national security
peter thank you very much
thank you very much

on wednesday the european union announced the tariffs it plans to place on american made products in retaliation for the us terrorists including bed linens chewing tobacco cranberries and orange juice despite those threats the times reports that president trump is back
the to sign the terrorists later today
here's what else you need to meditate
the times reports that president trump has attempted to speak with the witnesses in the special councils russia investigation about what they told investigators in one case trump asked his former chief of staff right to treat us what he said to the investigators in another case the president has a
white house boy done began to publicly deny our report in the times that mcgann had told investigators that trump asked him to fire the special counsel
again never issued such a denial
the encounters could open a new line of inquiry for the special counsel about whether the president sought to tamper with witness testimony

that's it
my on him
