to get my statement i've had to be quiet for so long
i was really excited to be able to speak it's bent over or maybe like a week span i've been putting together my statement and did a lot of editing a lot of adding things lot of taking things out and then my whole away their i kept thinking that maybe it's not complete maybe it is i don't know you entered the next if however you will hear
he has agreed to be publicly identified her name is nicola kayla thrash right
they called my name and i looked at my fiance is useful scott there with me
and he he was like are you sure it's your turn and i'm like yeah my picture is up air on screen

you are likely to know well i promised myself i wasn't going to cry and i was okay but then i took a deep breath
i would like to start out by saying that i was a gymnast get her to twist arts from the age of seven until the age of seventeen but i've been doing gymnastics since three
gymnastics isn't just about fancy we encourage you to four medals trophies you can get from morning a competition
it's blood sweat and tears and i didn't even make it like for the first couple words than i already started crying

i saw you almost every monday night after practice even if i wish the last one on the list
during those ten years there i really didn't know

this was hours of nonstop sexual abuse that didn't help my injury
when you asked if i felt any better i'd only tell you yeah sure you'd stop because her nap has helped i pray that you larry spend the rest of your life behind bars

is in the power of your voice thank you for speaking out in breaking your silence
thank you
yeah i the next survivor
we wish to me
the
so lie nasser an incredibly trusted doctor for athletes particularly gymnast for many years emily basil on rate above the law for the new york times magazine he was the physician that you tried to go to see if you are struggling with your body which of course many gymnast are going to talk
and what did you do
the to have now
how would you feel the pain is here comes across a little bit through here
this for regis
touch and what we've learned since two thousand and sixteen when the indy star did an expos day is that he was abusing his position of trust he was molesting many many girls you have come forward at first when these charges were brought doctor and ask are denied all of them michigan state university where he's on the faculty he said
had no evidence you done anything wrong but he was criminally charged and in november he pled guilty in court in michigan to seven counts of criminal sexual misconduct
eighteen homosexual hundred first degree relations your personal virgins your first wife your brother
yeah sure sure
this is a man who has pled guilty and what is at issue is the degree of punishment he wrote should receive


and now at the sentencing the judges deciding how to punish them
users you are you use were from the testimony your money
with than a million you
newsroom
mature here
and she first made a statement that she was planning to punish hand the maximum degree possible that she thought he should live out the rest of his life in prison but then this time
it was just
she really opened the mike two survivors who wanted to come forward to testify about their experiences the first time i stepped into one of the exam rooms and apps are had and is worth than i was twelve i say if nintendo was fourteen and tell them i was eleven years old when i first went to see larry i was seven years old
i was only twelve i had been patient and so it was eight years old
the pain you have caused the mentally and emotionally if unexplainable this is what we're seeing happen not just once or twice very sexually assaulted me repeatedly under the guise of medical treatments for nearly a year but over seven days i remember the first time very that at the a wave of women came forward and testified i remember how
absolutely mortified i was when you asked me if i had started my period yet because you couldn't do the treatment if i had a tampon in and i was taught that is now okay for anyone to touch you don't there unless it's the doctor and you weren't a world renowned
people who had not testified during the gulf phase of the trial who had not been cross examined but we're there to speak to the fact that masters abuse the misconduct had on them when they were growing up the crimes that larry nasser committed against me have altered my life for number
very good relations
this
me and we have over one hundred and fifty women coming forward in this way
it's an incredibly unusual even unprecedented moment in the united states court room to have this kind of impact from the testimony of victims at a fat and saying i've just never seen anything like it before
in what is the judge say while i can't imagine
nineteen ninety seven this happening you and not one person and and they were all so the judge many clear that this was for the victims for other survivors your words are a sign that you are feeling you're taking your power bad you're giving him back
nine
he will fall in your rise acting in a way that's quite unusual from the bench you and your sister survivors
are easily the friend
remain behind bars
the rest of his natural wife she was thinking each women as she came forward survivors or warriors and your words of goes victory
i don't know if you're all feel it now but you will
you are so strong and wonderful
oh we're having here is a kind of cathartic moment it has to do with the therapeutic effect if there is one for survivors in giving voice to what happened to them and striking back serves in the military
and
the army women are performing
without any battle with you as my leader
so this just making a choice about the role that victim should be allowed to play in a courtroom


you know we've been as a society debating about the role that victim should play how much they should be at the center of the criminal law for a very long time we often talk about in a kind of shorthand way the idea that like a victim is pressing charges against someone but that's not actually how it works it's the people vs larry and
nasser not alleyways race man or any other particular woman whose pressing these charges and when we see the people winning this stage we me in the state the government as the representatives of the people and what's important about that is that the prosecution doesn't actually represent a person they don't represent the victim there's this idea
have a kind of large your motivation of justice that doesn't depend on an individual victim
but around the nineteen seventies a lot of victim started complaining that they felt left out of the process that sometimes prosecutors and defense lawyers ignored them
there needs just for not being met at the same time there was some concern about the emotional a fact that hearing from a victim can have on a jury and on a judge and fear that there was something that of biased about this that could turn people toward more punishment and toward retribution and
a way that seemed prejudicial
for youth
fill in the nineteen eighties the supreme court entered this debate in the context of the death penalty teams used to the thumbs and to his victims always a meeting murder victims
as included in this case included
family members who obviously were upset by the column has anyone would be there were not closing in any way at the crime the question in this nineteen eighty seven supreme court case was whether a statement could be offered into evidence where the probation officer was talking about the people who'd been killed and the impact of the crime
on their surviving family members
was introduced to new evidence mr
have the testimony
the statements egg the made them so this is what's called a victim impact statement and the supreme court was deciding whether it was proper and constitutional to allow that to state statement at the penalty phase of a death penalty proceeding at the sentencing phase in other words and at first the supreme court said no
when a judge is deciding whether to send someone to death they are not allowed to hear about the effects the murder has had on family members and why not what was the reasoning they decided that because they said that the effect of the crime on a family members was not related to the blame the of the defendant
i think what you're seeing here is the fear that when we allow victims to inject emotion into the courtroom that there's something prejudicial about that though we're going to end up with heavier punishments for bad reasons and emily then what happened it was overturned at some point right that's right on the record
unknown number nineteen fifty seven twenty one
used to see so for years later the supreme court and essentially hairs a very similar case and reverses that earlier judgment will hold the moon would urge no automatic bomb prohibiting new capital since june from considering the gym do evidence relating to the victims bruce personal current roosters and in this later decision
and what the court says is the hearing from victims help educate the judge who's meeting out the sentence about what the harm of the crime has been in the process of behind and for cuban criminal defendants shoes
in the victim's family are often more on move to become soon blues to tuesday
howard victim impact statements use today what's the common usage now
it's a common thing that happens now is bad when someone has been sentenced there's a moment where the judge will let the people who are the most affected by the crime come forward and talk in a kind of oh been pretty informal way about what happened to them that i think is the very powerful element of what we saw the michigan car
from this week you know women seen each other wanting to support each other wanting to make it clear that the person who should feel shame and guilt here is doctor nasser not any of that

do it



do you mind if agency to defend inherently thrown may seem to think
cleary marines
larry larry larry larry i trusted you larry you or my dearest friend you larry where the gentle one you never inches to them being clogged are you really read my doctor my adult and most importantly my friend recently
i was abused in my own home by you i was abused at your office that unless you
i was abused in your basement
when my mum said on the coach in your children were upstairs
today and say that i saying this is if you haven't listened to one thing i have said he to look at me and listen you ten this for i love into something or here you've violated the various principle of you're calling
do know have i pray that you larry spend the rest of your life behind ours you cannot break me larry
i am the survivor

any moment now former usa gymnastics doctor larry nasser is going to learn what his punishment is for sexually abusing more than one hundred and sixty girls under his hair is moment
take us through what happened in the courtroom on wednesday
goes to church
what happened on wednesday was about barry nasa apologize your words several lose
significant
go to work or so before all this outpouring of testimony nasa actually complained to the judge that he shouldn't have to sit there that it was mentally difficult for him to hear and he also kind of blamed though when in so that made him seem like someone who really not wreck
end with his own guilt
the most the of your peers and comparison
the bush administration
rather short statement in court that was very different from the statements he made earlier in which at least it appeared that he was really absorbing what these women had to say to him
for that
to prove
whoa whoa
sorry
my phone with a mix of origin
these to your own do
thanks
so essentially these victim impact statement this whole process
yes it works potentially as healing device for survivors and victims but maybe the says something about what it does for the perpetrator of crime is that right
i think that is possible and it brings to mind the idea that when you have a crime of the victim sometimes if you bring together both sides there's a kind of reckoning and a healing that can come out of that that is more powerful than perhaps sending someone to jail or prison because it really creates more understand
dang and i think sometimes victims want is the sense that the person who's hurt them really understand what that means and what they've done

and seventy five
one one month
just fine
the judge is really sad herself up as a kind of figure of wrath and retribution in this case and so she sent doctor and asked her to one hundred and seventy five years in prison and then she also talked about why she was doing that
i'm doing
if you home
the sentencing
so there's a moment where the judge says i'm not special i'm just doing my job
and meet kind of feels like the heart of what we're talking about the she doing her job or is this inappropriate behavior for a judge in a criminal case you know we are going gonna have a long debate about that it's an example of a judge i'd say pushing the boundaries of her job and there i think has been a lot of catharsis as a result of the
she has taken other people are gonna i'm sure accuse her of grandstanding and of going too far of making this kind of personal and making naps are into a kind of state go figure that's though the debate i'm sure we're gonna be having
and i think there is also a recognition that victims have to be in some way at the heart of criminal proceeding said well we're talking about when we talk about a crime with the victim is something that has had an effect on a human being often quite terrible effect and so if we don't
wow victims to talk about what's happened to them if we don't pull them inside of the criminal justice system and then what's the point

when i was addressing him i went to go glimpse at him i didn't really want to because i didn't know if he was actually going to look at me and acknowledge what i'm saying but finally i kind of got the guts to do and i looked at him and he was actually looking at me and i mean i don't know if he was taking
in everything i was saying but
he was somewhat acknowledging lead to some extent in think that totally through the end of your state and so when you finished
you feel
well towards the end i kept thinking that there were things that i forgot to say or that i skipped through
i mean i walked up there feeling like i was carrying one hundred pound weight on my shoulders
and then you walk away from it
like it was just gone
did it feel like something had changed for you what did that mean for you i mean i don't wanna say that i feel great now because i don't i feel as if it's a step it just feels like a step that's one person that we can remove and
the deal with any more but there's other people that need to be dealt with you i mean you have to think of everyone else that enabled them
i definitely feel about maybe fifty percent better there is still other things that when they get dealt with
be a completely different person

thank you so much michela things

many of the victims who addressed leary master in court this week
also demanded accountability from us he gymnastics
the us olympic committee in michigan state university were nestor was employed as a doctor
since the testimony began last week the chairman and several board members of us a gymnastics have resigned the head of the olympic committee apologized for not attending the hearing and on wednesday evening the president of michigan state university
an assignment stepped down



hughes what else you need committed
in a super is exchange with reporters on wednesday
president trump said he was willing to be interviewed by special counsel robert mother saying i would love to do that i'd like to do it as soon as pass rubber miller will be fair to you in this larger investigation will find out
how are you concerned because here's what russia
and everyone says no colors
is no collusion oh well
if i
sure just fight back all it's structured so is a thing
i hope so the president's lawyers have been negotiating with mothers teams about the terms of an interview for weeks and the president noted to the reporters that any interview would be quote subject to my lawyers and all of that
and on wednesday afternoon with two weeks until government funding runs out again white house press secretary sarah could be sanders held a news cause she the white house release a legislative framework on monday that represents a compromise that members of both parties can support we encourage the center
to bring it to the floor
this framework will fulfill the for agreed upon pillars securing the border and closing legal loopholes
indeed extended family chain migration canceling the lottery and providing a permanent solution on doctor after decades of in action by congress it's time we work together to solve this issue once and for all the american people deserve no less
question sanders was asked was about want a permanent solution for doctor with me
the path to citizenship
well if i told you now what kind of take away the fun for monday but hours later in his conversation with reporters at the white house
the president said the solution could be a path to citizenship
after ten to twelve years

that
