
from the new york times on michael vaughan
the is that

today when president trump announced that he would end dog he made it congress problem they had six months to pass a bill or tens of thousands of undocumented children could be deported
as the clock counts down why is the president once again making it his problem
it's thursday january eleven

good morning
here to dodge ram out the program known as dhaka there was a virtual worded under the obama administration is being sim
a dark a program was implemented in right so it was september fifth i believe of last year almost two thirds of the way through the president's first year in office and attorney general jeff sessions went out at the justice department and made this dramatic announcement to have a lawful system of emigration that serves the national interest
we cannot admit everyone would like to come here is just that the administration was rescinding a program called dhaka deferred action for childhood arrivals michael scherer covers the white house for the times it was a program that was set up originally in two thousand and twelve by the obama administration as a way of a dry
arresting a particularly sympathetic group of people were brought to this country by their parents
sometimes even as infants and often have no idea that there are undocumented until and so the obama administration had put into a place a program that said look let's carve out this group of people and say we're not going to deport damn well going to give them the ability to get a work permit to work here legally it makes no sense
spell talented young people who for all intents and purposes are americans
and that was the status quo for something like five years two thousand and twelve to two thousand and seventeen the compassionate thing it is in the lawlessness
and force hours and if congress chooses to make changes to the law
to do so through the process set forth by our founders but it's actually not that simple right that suddenly the president through jeff sessions is just shutting down doc and that's exactly what he does right i mean look part of the interesting thing about president trump is that he is somewhat conflicted on this
issue to dhaka situation is a very very it's a very difficult thing for me because i love these kids i love kids i have kids and grandkids and i find it very very high doing what the law says exactly did in has a long history of expressing some
the same sympathy towards this group that others do
actually a little known fact is the president trump in two thousand and thirteen long before he was a presidential candidate her even given thought about running for president and he met with a group of these young immigrants they're known as dreamers and as i understand it gaby you are in that meeting with donald trump a couple of years ago
yeah and and he met with him in trump tower sat around a table had a long discussion one and
i shouldn't bad people who are not wild berry and don't understand immigrant and new it happening in the country and we worried about
and then at the end of it meeting as they wrote down the elevator one of them told us that
and bad you now you can
we lacked
wow
and here it out and really bad people would be embarrassed about
but again i'm yeah
that has clearly stuck with him so even on that day on september fifth day when he sent out his attorney general to end of the program president trump had managed to figure out a way to do two things on the same day and pretty dramatic fashion on the one hand he found a way to satisfy this sort of super conservative
if anti immigrant part of his base which had always hated this obama era program they had seen it has an executive overreach that obama had just would have waived a magic wand in kind of exempted this group of immigrants from sort of the normal immigration laws and so by sending out he's very conservative attorney general to ended he satisfied
that part of his base but at the same time in the reason why it's not so simple and why it's pretty interesting and dramatic on day is that literally the moment that he did that the moment he ended the program he also challenge to congress
to fix it
one thing tonight hours after the trunk administration announced it was phasing out the doctor program over the next six months president an interim tweet to congress now has six months to legalize dhaka something the obama administration was unable to do if they can't the end of that clock is march fifth after which if they don't act by march fifth
everyone knows that that sort of the day that many many of these young immigrants will start being affected by this strikes me as his kind of a brilliant stroke on the part of the president if it works he doesn't alienate his supporters who put up an office and who have lille reservations about something like a dream act
but more congress to solve this where congress to pass legislation protecting the streamers it would actually be far stronger and more enduring then what president obama had done which was an executive order or what trumped would have done by just furthering the executive order right know
i mean look at president obama tried to take the legislative approach during his time in office and i've said time and time and time again to congress send me the dream act put it on my desk and i will sign it right away they just couldn't get it through congress so the doctor program was an executive
actually that president obama did out of frustration is he couldn't get the legislation passed fast forward to president trump and if he can help republicans and democrats in congress to come together and actually do a version of the dream act that was tried and failed several years ago it will actually be a much more permanent
losing a much better solution for these young immigrants because at the end of the day gay won't be subject to the whims of the next president who comes in my office they will simply have become permanent residents the united states and depending on how the legislation to be written might have an opportunity at some point in the future to become citizens
so what's congress been doing in the four months since this six month clock started to count are they trying to solve this problem so congress does what congress always does which is they don't ever do things simply great
it's never as simple as just let's take this one issue and let's talk about it and debate and vote on it right so both sides looked at this question of how to deal with the young immigrants and said how can we improve our leverage
so that we get what we want
it is going to be an eventful few days on capitol hill let's get to illinois who can set the table force on that he like a morning
call center caps humor
and representative nancy pelosi has said they are willing to support a deal that would raise the national debt limit for three months now that is the offer fan democrats that unclear if republicans will accept it when i do think it's very interesting is the wall is so critically important to ham and dhaka and maintaining it is so critically important democrat
rats and he has using that as the ultimate and bargaining chip here will he get his way to both sides started posturing
this remarkable dinner the president late wednesday working around his own party hosted chuck schumer and nancy pelosi at the white house while we have an invitation to chuck schumer and i are leader humor on the menu tax reform border security infrastructure trade and how to resolve the dispute over so called dreamers the president said you know he said
the dream now
they could have talked it through with a bunch of aids there and what everybody's it was all we've got a deal the president and the democrats a great deal on doc i'm single and dhaka after the sit down the democratic leaders announcing we agreed to enshrine the protections of dhaka into law quickly and to work out a package of border security excluding the wall that's acceptable to both sides we're not going to
hi the wall to dreamers that's a very very good thing and good progress i've told him over and over again at one point he said to me go easy on the wall i said no
but the minute that dinner ended in everybody left president trump is pushing back this morning against democratic claims that they have a framework for a deal to save nearly seven hundred thousand young immigrants from deportation the president reading a short time ago no deal was made last night on dhaka massive border security would have to be agreed
in exchange for consent would be subject to vote the normal partisan mechanisms in washington kicked in and so within avenue few days a couple of weeks it was pretty clear that whatever quote unquote deal both sides might have thought had been struck like there wasn't a deal that was sealed that right and so for that reason this say
next month clock that you've been describing is still ticking with no deal right there is no deal and ultimately that's what led the president to invite members of congress from both parties and both chambers to the white house on tuesday for what ended up being this remarkable discussion hour long broadcast on television where they release have confronted this question in how to solve it

we'll be right back

so like what happens in this televised
at the white house on tuesday
what your
the president gathered all of these lawmakers around in the cabinet room
today to advance bipartisan immigration reform that serves community
normally depressants brought in for just the first couple of minutes and then laid out the meeting can happen in private in this case the press can stay for a while at a couple of folks can make statements the press was brought in and then we just loud to stay in the meeting went on and on and on for almost an hour
i think we're going to come up with an answer i hope we're going to come up with an answer for a doctor and then we go further than that later on out and everybody in all the different sides were trying to make their points so you had the democrats need take care of these kids and we all agree on that eighty six percent of the american public agrees on nine hundred
our members of the us
twenty thousand of them are schoolteachers repeatedly trying to make their case to the president dad let's just do this very simply mr president let's just take the dream act and let's pass it like not get bogged down by a lot of other stuff lives are hanging in the balance our new job done and then on the republican side to recent
terror attacks in new york that were the result of this i think failed immigration policy we like to see that directs you had a bunch of the republicans urging the president not so fast we're going to address a order enforcement and security and let's make sure that we do this and it's a package and it makes more sense for their concern
truancy sort of we do not do something with the security if we do not do something with the chain migration we are fooling each up and then there was one moment to crystallize the tension and then back and forth when senator what you like a sosa
sen dianne feinstein democrat of california veteran of the senate for the last several decades sees an opportunity and take the what about a claim doc of they'll now tries to convince the president that the best way to go is to just do a clean dream act something for these young him
without loading it up with a bunch of other things
i think that's basically what we're going to come up with the president seemed to agree i would like
you could sense that the democrats in the room were like wow that's a real moment because i think when they're here in then representative kevin mccarthy republican from california also and in the leadership in the house and was somebody who you could see it on his face he
realize that this was a panic yeah the without securing are you talking about security as well
wow i think if we have some meaningful comprehensive
immigration reform that's really where the security go president had just would have seemed to suggest that they were going to the banned in all of their efforts to get tougher immigration restrictions on who can come into the country tougher enforcement at the border learned like three pillars dhaka because we all were all of them are want to do it or secure
so we're not back out here and chain migration she was sort of back and forth between feinstein in mccarthy
do you really think that there can be agreement on all of that quickly and because course we know from coverage of the president over the whole year that oftentimes where he ends up in the position of whoever whispered in his ear last so you could see around the table in that moment both sides trying to be that voice
his head of the last voice to convince him to go one direction
thank you very much
so then what happens so the meeting breaks up with the white house and it was really only a few hours later then
and new road block to that trump administration's moved to and dhaka a federal judge in california issues a ruling on this very program on the dock a program a federal judge blocking the trump administration's decision to in the dreamers program on march for essentially what the judge said is that the president's decision back in
september on september fifth when he had the attorney general announced the end to the doctor program that decision was essentially illegal that the administration had not followed the proper procedures to end the doc a program and you can't just take something away with the stroke of a pen any issued a nationwide
injunction basically said the government has to restart the doctor programming and started giving back those benefits to people now
the trick here is that the legal process move slowly and it's not at all clear with the appeals that are likely and what impact the legal case will actually have mine in the meantime the political process is continuing and i think talking to democrats republicans the white house there is a real sense that even though the judge's ruling
on tuesday night was amazing that he came on that same night of the white house meeting right but that really at the end of the day nobody expects the legal process to be the one to solve this rate like everybody understands ultimately the political process is the one that's going to matter so is this time he just happened to be a coincidence that on the same day the white house holds the session on dhaka and whether to renew
had the judge this judge makes a ruling on die that's quite consequential we have no transparency into the judge's decision making my suspicion is that it's not incidental you know that the judge has been considering this case for weeks now on months the loss
suits were filed back in the fall and i have no reporting to suggest one way or the other but did he decide hey this is not a bad upper division is not a bad moment to release this decision it's it's certainly possible
make it seems like whether the timing of this ruling was coincidental born i it offers an explanation for why president trump after trying to make dark of congress's problem rather than his problem has now come back
and is trying to help get a bill passed because on last year we saw him using executive authority to deal with immigration with the travel ban and just getting blocked do to court over and over so is this court ruled just another example of
something the president trump seems to have already figured out and is exhausted by which is that executive action is just legally fraud and temporary and not a real way to get a problem solved yeah i think you're exactly right i think it is a reminder
of the risks that you take when you try to make big broad consequential public policy outside of the normal legislative process the judge's ruling in this lawsuit underscores better than anybody could possibly have done that
when you make policy that way it becomes completely wrapped up in this legal quagmire that you've got you know judges in california and appellate court judges and ultimately the supreme court likely to get involved in a process that ultimately shouldn't be about judges in legal questions rated
ultimately a question of what's the consensus in the country of what should be done with these young immigrants
even as the legal in the political process goes forward that's the question that hanging over these children is what will their feet be and will it be resolved with some kind of an ultimate political solution or will it continue to be uncertain and left to the whims of
kind of uncertain legal process and that's that's what we don't know the answer to you
thank you mike
yes you're happy to do it
on wednesday promenade house republicans came forward with a proposal for a strict immigration bill that directly clashes with president trumps efforts at a bipartisan deal the proposal would crack down on illegal and legal immigration and off
first three you doable work permits to dhaka recipients
without offering them a path to citizenship
while the plan is unlikely to make it out of the house it signals how difficult it could be for congress and the white house to come to an agreement
at the same time some liberal democrats are adamant that they will not vote for government funding measure with out a deal on immigration
and funding is set to expire on january nineteen


three years what else you need to meditate on wednesday morning in a nation wide crack down on illegal immigration the trump administration dispatched federal agents to read nearly one hundred seven eleven stores resulting in the arrest of twenty one undocumented workers in a statement
the director of immigration and customs enforcement said the arrests called send a strong message to us businesses that hire an employee and illegal workforce ice woman forced the long and if you were found to be breaking the law you will be held accountable
get your legal team sources told us believes that in the next few weeks the special counsel robert moeller will ask for some sort of an interview with you
are you open to meeting with him there has been no collusion between the trump campaign and russians or trump and russian is no collision under questioning from reporters on wednesday president trump refuse to say whether he would grant an interview to the special counsel in the russia and destination a rock
quest the white house aspects in the coming weeks that marks a shift for the president who back in june said he was cool one hundred percent willing to testify under oath in the investigation but at the white house on tuesday trump was noncommittal to get where you would you be open we'll see what happens i mean certainly else you what
happens but when they have no collusion and nobody found any color
at any level
it seems unlikely that you even have an interview
that's it for today
i'm michael barbara
