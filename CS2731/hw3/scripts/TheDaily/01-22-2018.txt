
from the new york times on my cobra all this is the day
today democrats forced to shut down by saying no budget
without a duck
republicans have refused to end the shut down by saying no docket
without a budget deal the us gov is in a stalemate
it's monday january twenty second
we begin with those high stakes negotiations underway at this hour will there be a government shutdown or and eleventh hour deal here so the question as be dad was would there be some negotiation some progress that would lead senate democrats to decide okay fine
we will go along with voting for something that will keep the government open thomas kaplan has been covering the negotiations the possibility of a breakthrough there seemed to come when president trump invited the senate democratic leader chuck schumer to the white house to meet president trump stepping in today with an unexpected invitation to the senate
top democrat chuck schumer to come to the white house over cheeseburgers they talked about the issues that were outstanding say new in my heart
i thought we might have a deal tonight
that was how far we've come
that's how positive our discussion felt we had a good meeting
but there's been plenty of arguing back and forth over what exactly played out in that meeting the way senator schumer calls it he agreed to fund the border wall that president trump wants to build along the southern border with mexico i essentially agreed to give the president something he said he wants in exchange for something we both war
in exchange for the president agreeing to an immigration measure that would protect the young undocumented immigrants known as dreamers it is true that chuck schumer made what i consider to be a bowl an important to concession and said yes we'll go forward with the wall as long as we do this on a responsible fair
caution when he had a substantial twenty million others
i'm not going to code members because i don't think that's my place to do it but i can tell you it was a substantial commitment to the president if this is going to have to be a compromise where democrats give something and republicans give something at the end of the day
spending some money on a wall that granted democrats say is unnecessary and is a waste of money and isn't the best way to address securing the border maybe that was something that they could swallow for being able to address the fate of we're talking hundreds of thousands of people are you will wanna
build this monument to stupidity you'll want a waste and you will insist upon wasting twenty billion dollars in i say free to dreamers soon as the border wall just one aspect of an immigration planned that isn't really about how we approach immigration in this country in the way that doing away with the
lottery or what the president calls chain migration is it seems like something they don't mind giving away since it's not an essential question of american immigration and how we approach i think that's right and being a waste of money is sort of a different question from making significant changes to
the immigration system broadly yes democrats think the wall is not the way to go but perhaps spending some money on something they think is unwise would be something they could swallow to get what they really want and as despicable as it is as hurtful to people like me and others in this country we are
ready to sacrifice that so that dreamers can have great memories
so things are looking pretty good coming out of this meeting between schumer and trump in the white house on friday the democrats under this plan that the two are talking through would get a deal on dhaka and the present in would get funding for his wall
she has promised since he started running for president and only sixteen so then what happens well the way the schumer describes it the president backed away from this tentative agreement
and suggested let's do it by tuesday night
we said great
several hours later he called back he said
so i here we have a three week deal
i said know mr president no one's even talk to me about a three week deal i heard that's the deal i said no one's talk to me
cold leader pelosi no one to talk to her
then a few hours later they called back again
well we're gonna need this this this this in addition things it was general kelly that they knew were far far right after the president and schumer seem to have the basics of a deal the white house chief of staff john kelly who is see
as a hard line or on immigration called tumor
and outlined a whole list of objections to what had been sketched out earlier on the day and as the night went on it was clear they said unraveled whatever tentative deal had been sketched out was in tatters here we go there are ten seconds left officially until the top of the hour into there is an affair
government shutdown your lawmakers now still working to try to come up with something but obviously that will be too late
so here's the breaking news it is midnight
no deal as a result at midnight on friday night the government shutdown shut of the federal government is now beginning the democrats had to unify to make this happen great day almost unanimously had to agree to hold out and let the government shutdown if they didn't get what they wanted primarily
some sort of deal on immigration
and they embraced all the political risks that come with being that unified and a triggering a shutdown yeah this was something that i think a lot of people myself included were really skeptical about there are a bunch of senate democrats were up for reelection this year in states that president trump one in two thousand and sixteen
there was a big political risk to be seen as voting to shut the government down and it was a big question mark whether a lot of these democratic senators would be willing to go along with that certainly there were a number of senate democrats particularly some of the most liberal members who really want to push this issue
and demand a solution on dhaka but the vast majority of democratic senator stuck together with this position that this stock capital that did not address immigration was unacceptable sarah to be sanders overnight writing this in a statement senate democrats own the schumer shut down we will not negotiate the status of unlawful integrate
while democrats hold are lawful citizen hostage over their reckless demand this is the behavior of obstructionist losers not legislators out at midnight the government shutdown the blame game started and since then it's been a lot of finger pointing between the two parties and so the republicans
most immediately are pointing at the democrats as having shut the government down over and in their words and unrelated issue not tied to funding the government which is dhaka senate democrats said by chuck schumer they are the ones to blame tonight they are the ones
who really in reality of putting illegal immigrants before you the american people dhaka is in place until march it is not that urgent how are democrats pointing the finger in the other direction at republicans so democrats are very quick to point out that the republican party controls the white house
the house and senate republicans are in control of every branch of government the presidency of course the house the soon it through their nominees the supreme court
the republicans are in complete control of the business comes before the house and senate another piece of the argument has been focused on president trump and this is where schumer and others have said the president must take yes for an answer
until he does it's the trump shut down happy anniversary mr president your wish came true you want in a shut down there champ shut down is all yours it's become this big battle of is this the schumer shut down or the trump shut down on be is preparing for what we're calling their schumer shut down the humor shut down is completely
unnecessary it should be unavoidable both sides had something they could point to in arguing that the other side was to blame
that continued ever since the moment the government shutdown it's been public blame shooting in both directions so what you're describing is pretty much the impasse for the rest of the weekend right do both sides remain locked in the position of on the left democrats saying we won't negotiate spending until you saw a doctor
and on the raid republican saying we will negotiate doctor until you give us a budget that is the outline although there has been a bit of a thaw and this is why there is some reason to be cautiously optimistic that there could be an exit to this crisis that has back to work
the capital and return to the scene of the down the political battle for ideal that will involved dreamers in washington law makers appear to be moving toward a deal to and the government shutdown alive for you at capitol hill where lawmakers continue to negotiate and in a stalemate a group of moderate senators from both
please met over the weekend to try to chart a path forward some kind of compromise that put an end to this neither side would really get what they want in the sense that some kind of compromise would perhaps involve some kind of commitment that dhaka
will be addressed in the senate in the weeks to come so would not be an actual deal on immigration
and as part of that perhaps democrats would then be willing to vote for a spending bill that would reopen the government for a short period of time perhaps a couple weeks and end this crisis so democrats would get new guarantee of what would happen
in those negotiations
if a short term budget deal is past just an agreement to keep discussing teacher of issues i doctor so that's the big question now is what exactly will this commitment promise pledge whatever you want to call it on immigration be one obvious issue that comes up here is
so mitch mcconnell the senate majority leader agrees down vote on a dock a bill in a few weeks
it doesn't do a heck of a lot of good from a democratic point of view if that bill passes the senate but that is dead on arrival in the house and never goes anywhere so just a promise to have a bow in the senate might not be enough in the eyes of some so that's really now the biggest lingering question
in is what promises are concessions could be made on how immigration could be handled in the weeks to come and will those promises concessions be concrete enough to demeaning fall to democrats
and i'm struck by the fact they're all of this uncertainty in congress seems to come back to these meetings at the white house and what happens when members of congress go there to try to work out a deal on immigration the trump or support this all started last week when dick durbin and lindsey graham
i thought they had a deal with the president and then it seems trumps aid steven miller stepped in and the deal's off now we have reports that the president's chief of staff john kelly played a similar role in stepping in and calling off the deal with chuck schumer on friday
i think it's a real point of frustration on capitol hill in dealing with the white house and the president which is certainly something that schumer and democrats have said how do you negotiate with someone who agrees to something commits to something and then that agreement that commitment suddenly
wiped away what's even more frustrating than present and trumps intransigence is the way he seems amenable to these compromises
before completely switching positions and backing off negotiating with president trump is like negotiating with jello even today a republican lindsey graham complained about steven miller i've talked with the president his heart is right on this issue and think he's got a good understood
hall or sale in every time we have a proposal is only a bag by staff members his longest david miller miller's in charge of negotiating immigration were going nowhere he's been an outlier for years they help us make sense of something president from started all this by rescinding dhaka and sending
to congress and telling congress this is yours to solve and indicating very clearly that he wanted to protect the dreamers but at every step along the way it's felt like the president himself has blocked congress effort to do just that how do you make sense of that well i think that's why there's so much
frustration in congress certainly among democrats they say the president created this crisis he set in motion
this entire saga he created this uncertainty for hundreds of thousands of people in ever since then it's been hard to pin down what exactly he was i think a big reason that we are in this position now
is that lack of trust and the fact that lawmakers struggled to figure out what the president wanted them to do the president sent different signals a different times and democrats really question whether something would actually get done on this issue
and i think that motivated a lot of people to really forced the issue and say
we need to take a firm stand and if it means shutting down the government then that's something that they felt comfortable doing
thank you very much thank you
on sunday ne senate majority leader mitch mcconnell announced that he was delaying only night vote on a temporary spending bill until today at me a signal that the plan being worked out by moderate senators who was progress
it would be my intention to pursue the legislation that would address gaga
border security and related issues in a gesture to lawmakers who are demanding that the senate address the fate of the dreamers mcconnell said he planned to move ahead with immigration legislation next month if the issue had not already been resolved go a step back on the brink
