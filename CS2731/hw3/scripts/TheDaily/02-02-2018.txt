
from new york times on michael verbal off the is the day
today from the moment he was appointed donald trump's administrator has been cast by environmentalists as an idiot
on a mission to destroy the very agency he was he sees it differently a conversation with scott through it
it's friday february second
initiator pruitt i think for most of us our introduction to you came when you are attorney general of oklahoma so take us up to that point in your career what was the story of scott pruitt before you became attorney general or does it start when you know i don't go too far
so i grew up in kentucky and spent most of my teenage years
i school and college aspiring to be a mutually baseball player found out that junior senior year after some surgeries and what not that that wasn't going to happen and started thinking about other things in law school took me in oklahoma so you know the journey the attorney general was something that i didn't anticipate either
and once you become a j general you make a series of decisions about where you're going to use your resources and you end up suing the environmental protection agency fourteen times and i wonder why wealth and mentally as we look at the environmentalist and it's michael that of minutes passed by congress and and miniature about it for a number of years
the heart of corporate federalism cooperative that allows it's the partnership of the states where states or vested with responsibilities along with the federal government to ensure that certain outcomes are g to protect the environment and so congress recognize that the inception of these environmental statutes that we adopted in the nineteen seventies that you can have a one size fits all strategy because the issue
facing utah the second most tri state in the country are much different than the issues facing minnesota this truly is a partnership that has existed since the inception of the day and sometimes that partnership gets out of balance
and there's an emphasis were perhaps decisions made at federal level or paternalistic in dictatorial and don't recognize how issues impact states in a different the time frame that you're talking about the fourteen lawsuits
from my perspective that was driven largely by this imbalance this use the statute some ways that had not been done historically were attorneys general looked at a statue clean water at clean air act and said authority given to a state has been taken away we need to ensure that we protect that right or that responsibility and that's what prompted the lawsuit and you believe
from what i can tell that under the last administration president obama that was overreaching or over stepping in its policies
help me understand and it's rulemaking humming ocean with that means what was that the environmental protection agency doing what in your mind was not just objectionable but illegal thing about it this way women are called the clean water act and what gives the federal government jurisdiction is a definition of something called the waters in the united states
jurisdiction of our agency is actually put in the play by weather or water is a the united states are not so the agents in two thousand and fifteen engage in rulemaking to define a lot of the and states and to find it so broadly it included dry creek beds and southwest oklahoma it included fennel drainage ditches in salt lake city utah
and so people that were seeking to build subdivisions salt lake or use their land and on the parts of the country the first place they had to stop was washington dc to say give me authority to use mile and farmers rancher don't instead of visions across the spectrum because the agency stretched the definition so broadly created uncertainty that's what i mean is that when you when you have an agency
taking rulemaking that takes authority to the point of words not recognise born with that you'd guess what happens is a result uncertainty it sounds like it with agencies like the patient should stick to the letter of things should be someone's describe you as an original i think that's fair term in a thing as a good description of what we're seeking a there is a very
rove the what's happened over the last ten years or so is the agency evolved and morphed into something that was almost like super agency where it was using his authority ways to displace that partnership that i talked about the very beginning why when you are trying to narrow of oklahoma was deviate such a target of yours
this agency
well when you look at the state of oklahoma and the responsibilities given the state of oklahoma to regulate for instance in a natural gas space that was a part of the clean air act that the agency to be before i arrived was using a weapon eyes fashion to force a federal plan upon the state the cost billions of dollars utility companies had to
convert power generation to natural gas were nobles and no coercion
represent the state's interest the state sovereignty issue with respect to our responsibility to get on that statue and exercise our responsibilities and clean air act were being displaced a certainly there were lots of of targets that you could choose as attorney general's the chief law enforcement official and that states
no he's our repel of but why the i did you see it is particularly egregious in over stepping in your mind against the interests of states to me in this goes to i think when a great challenges we have presently with respect environmental issues in this country today what is true mormonism and i think the agency took a perspective for a number
years that it's prohibition
that though we've been blessed with natural resources that help us literally feed the world and power of the world
that we should not what develop those natural resources we should put fences up and we should prohibit that in so in some respects michael the rule making that was being deployed by the agency was weapon eyes in the sense of picking winners and losers
weapon eyes and sense of saying we were going to favor certain types of outcomes in the market with respect to energy and environment that's not the rover regular the rover regulators may think regular to take a statute to use its authority to fairly enforce it against all those that are regulated by those regulations but not to pick winners and losers the agency for a
number of years in view was picking winners and losers in use and authority to displace states involvement in partnership and that's why the lawsuits at are giving my all that we've just discussed and the those lawsuits the logical question is why did you want to become the head of the environmental protection agency to fix this
and to get back to the fundamentals the basics of operating pursuant to roll long reestablishing process recognizing the partnership of federalism recognize that we can achieve better things together the he can't do business in a way that is disrespectful disdainful of rule of law speak to two partners that you've worked with the years
as what adversaries like the states all those things are in my estimation damaging into getting better outcomes and what we are to be doing together as a country to advance environmental protection when you were nominated for position i'm sure you know this their heads of environmental groups or anxious and they said so and a said things like having screwed in charge of
he is like putting an arsonist in charge of fighting fires and and that may offend you
nato and they have a muse you but i wonder what it represents to you to oversee the and be so at odds with so many of the groups that seal as it their job that is not only been on a british don't know me the thing is what these kinds of comments represent is all it's wrong in environmental space today telling me well people put on jerseys charges
yes idea you're pro business i'm pro environment you're pro environment and it's it's a political thing it's not about results when we talked about superfund clean up and accountability we are thirteen or forty sites across the country these are parasites considered of a polluted almost beyond those most polluted sites we have any one of the country from the uranium to lead and these
sites have languished for years not language because we wanted the technology clean it up we just had a ne made decisions we just haven't brought the agency the point of saying let's figure out what's going on was figure out what the options are less make a decision let's get accountability to get clean up today i'm on announce westlake it's taken twenty seven year to get a decision
and this is misery misery uranium buried in the soil
forty year plus the you now imagine that agency put westlake on the list and nine hundred ninety one i came into this position twenty seven years later the agency stores and that made a decision on how to clean it up man to make the decision of an independent and now worth eighth and about that
are you saying that the expectation of eve is that it will blindly side with environmentalist or has been in the past and then you see the the agency as to follow the law and sometimes that will mean making decisions that environmentalist agree with sometimes that will mean making decisions that the energy industry he original as
the term is used earlier we are housed in the executive branch and fifth grade civics tells us what if you hang on the executive branch your job is to enforce the law okay so the only authority i have comes for is the authority given to me by the legislative branch and congress in if congress doesn't give me that authority i can't make it up largely what's happened with the bass administration is they did
latter they made it up
and look and that's what blame on a different kind of leadership stuff are different kind of approach but the fact that congress is dysfunctional in is not updating the clean air act or clean water act are all these very statutes that we administer the fact that congress that doing that doesn't give the to say was going to do it in your place with a pinch it because then what happens we're doing things
we shouldn't do there's a perception that their that in the first year of the presidency a lot of the work of agencies has been in deregulating undoing many of the regulations and the policies put in effect under the obama administration would you agree with that assessment that when it comes to the much of the work has been undoing rather
then doing look we've had a lot of work addressing these deficient rules so a good part of our work is cleaning up that mess the next day up with something that's often missed is getting it right going for like on on the origin i say we have a rule that withdraws it and we have proposed rules coming out in april that provides such a definition so is that deal
and is that regulatory clarity like regulatory certain elbows it's probably all those things right
so from my perspective it is what it is we have deficient rules in the books were addressing those and we're providing it or doing the work frankly or doing the work of the agency
point in the simplest terms what do you believe the core of the should be what should it be focused on in this month i mean technically our role is to administer of the statutes that congress has given us responsibility diminish your the toxic substances zero the clean air act i mean that all those acts
forcing later ministry that but beyond that it is to truly obviously as we do their protect the health and environment and this country it's that and i will tell you there are some in that environment of space that believe me know what you should use your power to the punitive in weapon eyes it to would eradicate certain forms of energy at the expense of others that you simply wrong
wrong headed it's definitely the statute
if there either way i want or need you on this role for people who aren't paying close attention to you and to the i think the last thing that they might know is the back in october you repeal the clean power plant a signature climate change policy put in place by the obama administration with the goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by pushing states
to move away from coal in particular
is there a place in this approach that you're describing this original ism for the
to fight climate change does the law and your mind allow for the service early curtail or even eliminate in some cases and industry that the scientific community and the government community agrees contributes to climate change perhaps perhaps though what we ought to be thinking about
his again what does the statute say so you're saying of has to change the law and order for you then to on climate change what i mean the past ministrations again pinch shit they filled in the blank they said we're going to die
well we're going to use it we're going to we're going to use power fill in the space to say we're going to do what we're going to try to force power generation shifting from fossil fuel to to renewable what we've done you mention october us issue that proposed rule withdraws he also didn't offer what also did in december is are issued something
got an advanced notice a proposed rule making you know what i said in that i won't comment from about across the country
provide input and information on the authority this agency to do exactly what you described so we've already begun what i think our obligation is which is to make a decision on really what does the scope what does the authority what is the jurisdiction under section one eleven the clean air act with led to power generation that we should not forget that we can engage in a result orient
brooch we just we have to ask the question as the authority there when you say it was all meaning like they're people who see an urgency to something like climate change and they want to just they want to override some of the regulatory language concerns that you're describing and your answer seems to be then give me the legal power or create a legal problem i'm going to do and
my own and this administration i can do it like the last one it just because the view exists in the scientific community that this is an issue that must be dealt with doesn't mean that i as he paid minnesota are going to deal with it just me and to deal with is infinite
you said it largely well you know the sense that it's the responsibility of those that pass the statue to give us the authority to gauge whatever it is that they want from solid waste as ways to whatever it is you have my be and i will tell you the jury is out literally and figuratively
on what authority exist under the clean air act with respect these issues in a lord acton talked about political atheism at times and and i think that's what you described is that you know we really don't care i get there the process stuff and rule of law stuff that's not that to get there was this do something what you know what they're doing something or that yielded and
the past no progress at all that's what's so fascinating to me about people say oh you're you're withdrawn clean power plant that's terrible well what is the clean power plant achieve the country
what part of that had any impact on a ban on our comes zero how do we know that everyone into effect why didn't they going to have it
the supreme court for the first time in history issued a day during the tendency of litigation because it it's concern about the unlawful us of the clean power plant adopted in two thousand and fifteen body so so if you really care about these issues you need to make each branch do their job and our branch is a branch that existed and forth
law so on these issues around do you care about these issues that issue
quite frankly i will get these issues i think the debate about the impact of c o two is important for us to wrestle with as a country there are some the believe that it's causes an existential threat and it's tomorrow i mean that the penetration that was more important isis you know what i can tell you this if that issue is more important than isis
i want to know about it
but here's my view on it there are things we know i think we don't know i think pretty arrogant for people in two thousand and eighteen
to say you know we know what the ideal surface temperature should be in the year twenty one hundred now is that different than what climate change is happening yet climate change is happening
so as we look through these issues we need to ask be much more i think inquisitive and i think the american people deserve an open honest transparent objective debate about these issues because if you're gonna foreign policy around that that needs to occur but she's ask the tough questions less help inform public policy but after we do all that michael astra issue here
she is what what authority do if the last thing people remember is is the repeal of the clean power plant about your time in his first year is that okay by you will look i mean i think that that is a very necessary thing i think withdrawing the deficient two thousand and fifteen roll the clean power plant
is absolutely an important thing and i think it was reflective of an attitude of a what innovation as i told you with respect to how we did business strongly that changing so i think what will be something that would be more lasting is recognizing by removing that and moving to different way to and business we restored the way we done business historically and that means good outcomes an american forward
punisher per thank you for your time thanks michael pressure like was
no
when we come back we talk to the times environment or homeowner about our conversation with scott
hey it's like oh i make our how are you it's been so long it's been too long
now anti and i'm excited to be back coral davenport covers the for the times i just have this kind of philosophical conversation with administrator pruitt about his role at the the
central point he made was whatever the perception of him he's really just doing his job and interpreting the law that this has nothing to do with it
and actually by just following the letter of law he's not ideological whereas the under previous administrations in his mind has been what do you make of that well certainly at first blush there is absolutely a case to be need for that the a while
it's created in nineteen seventy by president richard nixon
foundational lies that it's charged with executing were aimed at cleaning up the staff that dumps out and smoke stacks intel pipes and interior local community
smog and chemical pollution that comes out of factories that was sort of the original idea of what they were supposed to deal and it is absolutely accurate that under the obama administration
the mission of the pay expanded and morphed and center and it became climate change now climate change and global warming are the major environmental concerns of our time we don't have new buys that are designed to do off am the only tool that the us government
really has right now to deal with global warming is the andes lies cast in the nineteen seventies and white scott pruitt it is saying is none of this was the intent of the hey let's go and this is his term he loves sees it let's go back to the let's go back to it as hazardous waste sites and knows hypes dumping and you are rare
that's what we're here to deal and the point of all this was never intended to be global warming sell let's get back to original mission for the agency so then how should we think about his repeal of the clean power plant which i think for some people felt like the nightmare of what might happen with pruitt as the head of the
but the way he's talking about it it was just a clear example of overreach by the obama administration and so he's returning the and his words to what he deems as legally responsible when it comes to something like one of our plan when you make about so hear things
get a little more tricky and nuance because the fact is the clean power plan is absolutely an example of the obama administration taking an old law the nineteen seventy clean air act that never anticipated global warming thing we've got this tour how can we use a in the most creative wave
possible to get a regulation that can help solve global warming sell skype relate and conservatives in general argue that they stretch the law they stretch the intent we've got all this back but there's one other piece of this and skype this which is there was a two thousand and seven supreme court decision that wade and on whether
it's those all lies and the yea can and should regulate fossil fuel emissions that cause global warming and the supreme court ordered to pay to do a study and make a determination fossil fuel greenhouse gas pollution emissions are they harmful to pub
health in the same way that those old smog and chemical potions are and the under the obama administration determine yes fossil fuel emissions that warm the planet do in danger public health just like those old fashioned politicians and as a result under the clean air act the is now require
wired required by law to regulate those greenhouse gas global warming emissions and that finding has been upheld by the courts it's a done deal so scott prove it might say well it it's an overreach it's not what we're supposed to do it's not what the law intended but nonetheless doesn't matter who's in charge
urge the federal government is still legally obligated to do something about global warming so improved says that the obama administration was acting outside the boundaries of law with the clean power plan he might be right but he might be wrong we don't know yet this is still tied up in court sounds like exactly what called you make of
good argument that one of the flaws of the clean power plan was that it picks winners and losers in the energy industry gives the federal government the power to essentially put parts of the energy industry out of business
all these kind of rate because the number one contributor to climate change in the united states is burning coal fired power plants the coal pollution goes up in the atmosphere and it traps heat so the clean power plan is in the long run designed to put off
old fashioned coal fired power plants out of business because that's how you solve the problem
according to prove the clean power plant didn't achieve anything because it never went into effect and the reason it never went to affect was that it was held up by lawsuits claiming that it was federal overreach is that true first of all is he right that over which can be actually counterproductive in a lead to a legal term
don't just like this which make the law hang out and legal limbo
it's true it was never implemented the recent was never implemented is there were so many lawsuits the supreme court said hey this is such a big legal question we're going to put a halt on implementation of this regulation until all the lawsuits are resolved there's no question at all
all that the obama administration and when when creating the clean power plant they really did some legally interesting stuff in creating this but there's also no question that a lot of the rollbacks and legal changes that scott who has made in his less than one year in office have also been slapped with lofty whenever you have big environmental already
relations from either side you get hit with lawsuits that's kind of par for the course to prove knows better than almost anyone what it means for environmental regulations to be held up in court because before he was a administrator as attorney general in oklahoma he filed these fourteen loss
suits against the and we were trying to get to a heart of why of all things as attorney general of oklahoma he chose to spend so much of his energy use specifically targeting the what do you think the answer is important he's the attorney general of oklahoma
a major part of oklahoma economy as the oil and gas industry right it's fair to say that his home state industry really was getting head with a lot of these regulations it's also fair and very important to know that scar it had a really close relationship with a lot of those oil and gas companies
when scott prelate as attorney general of oklahoma pushed for regulations to be rolled back he would make the case to the that the regulations were are harmful to his tea but as the new york times reported a couple of years ago it turns out that the letters that he was standing on attorney general letterhead were based
copied and pasted directly from arguments and emails written by devon energy which is the major oil and gas company headquartered in oklahoma there's another piece of that relationship as well which is if you're the attorney general of oklahoma
it makes sense that you are going to argue cases that would directly benefit oklahoma to heavily dependent on fossil fuel companies so in some ways you can see how that makes sense for a state attorney general who is also arguing for states rights the difference is that we're still seeing scott
who advocate for the same kind of policies now as head of the federal agency that is primarily charged with protecting public health so you're saying as attorney general it made a fair amount of sense to advocate for companies in his state but in his role as the head of the day
more surprising yes that's what's really surprising synchro prove it talks about climate change has become one of the most controversial elements of his time as that of the day
so i asked him about climate change and what he said was that all he believes in climate change and recognizes that the climate is changing he thinks that they're still an open debate about how dangerous that is just that we need to have that to be was he saying here
has a fit in to his actions at the piano
he's kind of tap dancing around basic facts got through it has sad on television and in congressional testimony things that stand against decades and decades and decades of international scientific research he has said that if carbon dioxide does contribute to climate change it's not clear how much
i did an interview with the president and the national academies of science a couple of years ago who said to me that the consensus that human activities are contributing to climate change and that the planet is warming is stronger than that consensus that smoking tobacco is linked to lung cancer
so are their questions about exactly what climate change is going to do when or their questions about the the precision of the models as we look at what's happened over the next century sure but i would say this denial of the established scientific research on this topic is really surprise
rising to see from the head of an agency that sits on a lot of the peer reviewed research that has been done
this ban something that's been very difficult for republicans in general as they try to grapple with the established science of climate change
the science shows that the major contributor to climate change is burning fossil fuels that's coal oil and gas and if you have a good relationship with those industries if they are the basis of your home state economy or a big contributor to hear political campaign you're in a really tough position politically so finally coral for environmentalists prude is everything
thing that they fear any period when a trader with the number one a fence beating as we discussed canceling the clean power plant but do you think that he makes a good case for environmentalists seeing him differently should they simply view him as someone who's adhering to the letter of law and if they want things to change
they should take it up with congress
not with the
so crude makes a good point there there is no law on the books designed specifically to deal with climate change
president obama tried to get congress to do that
congress rejected it and so we're left with there's this problem of climate change there's no law to do anything with it
it's not necessarily the obligation of the administrator to take all laws and and try to adapt them creatively to this new problem but that sad uproot adherence to this original list approaching i think frightens a lot of environmentalists as well the reason the he was cry
created in nineteen seventy is that during the fifties and sixties we saw an increase in pollution as states competed against each other to have the most lax and loose in environmental regulation and the problem is you know pollution doesn't obey state boundary
and the idea was a republican president created this agency because letting the states work it out for themselves wasn't working for the country and potentially living states workout climate change might not work either that is the idea especially since it is a global problem
are thank you very much thank you so much my ankle it's always great to be with you
boom boom boom
use would else you need to know the classified memo that was drafted by house republicans and is reported to be highly critical of the feelers conduct in the russia investigation is moving closer to public release the times reports that president drop
who has the power to block it release on national security grounds will inform congress today that he wanted made public over the objections of both the f b i and his own justice department which argue it could jeopardize sensitive government information those who have read the memo
hey it accuses the f b i have missed leaving a federal judge when it sought a warrant to spy on a trump campaign fights suspected of working with the russians
