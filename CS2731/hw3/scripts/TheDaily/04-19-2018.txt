
from the new york times on my this is the special episode of
today
the islamic state has attracted tens of thousands of followers from over one hundred nations around the world and at their peak controlled a total lamp larger than the united kingdom
what is that drew so many and what is that they're really trying to build
it's thursday equal

we here at the daily have been working on a new series focused on the reporting of my colleague who can kill a mocking and today or bringing you the first two installments of that series starting with the prologue

are to kill people
is there anything your doors
we adults to focus on we also have coats of ballistics job it would feel a lot lonely
inside the blue suit job of facts were major organs and be
slaves practice be headed step practice kind of what a medical student would do
a new had to have to know how to use and knife on a human




test one to has us okay yeah ok
can i go back to the and of course
so can you describe what we're looking at
yeah
it's a man standing in the cancer
he's clad in black
his face is covered all you see is a for his eyes
he has a knife in his hand and he stabbing at in the direction of a camera
at his feet is another man i wish i had more time this one is wearing an orange jumpsuit i wish i could ever hope afraid i must say my family once again his name is james foley he's an american freelance journalist and he's been kidnapped by the islamic state this is too hard for an american citizen of no country
and he's about to be executed and aggression towards some extent
and the bloodshed
this is basically how the world meets isis yeah and now breaking news out of london are deadly terror attack over nine years later isis is a van plowing into a crowd of people out of play enjoy a saturday night a bunch of guys in a van gogh or plowing
to pedestrians on london bridge pulling out kitchen knives stabbing people on the streets where they're going to search bags in san bernardino mass shooting identified it's a husband and wife
rapid shooting just build build bill bill bill who had to a christmas party and san bernardino california and come in guns blazing breaking news an explosion at the very busy port authority bus terminal it's an immigrant living in brooklyn who straps on a suicide vast and tries to detonated in a subway tunnel in times square
just a block away from my office he told investigators he detonated an explosive device in the name of isis this is isis now
and i truly believe is defining moment in history isis is the latest incarnation this is clearly a case of good versus evil of a war we have been fighting now for nearly two decades and make no mistake about a good will prevail


yeah
but here's the thing despite the billions of dollars we have spent despite the thousands of lives that have been lost both our own soldiers and civilians caught in the crossfire there are more terrorist now in there were on the eve of september eleventh not just trying to get your head around that there are more terror groups now
now not last there are more ways that they attack there are more strategy is to do so there are more tools that they use there are more of them not last
so
as for you
in the simplest terms what you're trying to find out
i am trying to answer one question who are they
this is something you learned in the training
the
you know it's going to be hard for you guys killing and or even who are they really they should first time which going to affect your logic in and resurgent gonna be sick in you might even feet from the blood who is a couple you're really fighting but what you have to do is use a drink demos emotion remember you doing this regard women
you're carrying know what's going on and what you have to what your duty to the movie
you mean you can
didn't i didn't question it

the
yeah

we'll be right back

chapter one the reporter

the
hey
yeah obama yeah i'm just like can you give me five vector
i'll just a smidgen
though


the bring it closer
one two three four five six seven eight nine so me before i started following you around all the time
i mean you're a reporter and you talk to terrorist on the internet i mean that isis was your beat but i don't think i had any idea what that reporting actually looks like great yeah
when you hear that got going
oh god
i didn't know
going right up to the front lines of war against isis there's a building that appears to have been air strike and as the coalition soldiers are pushing isis back to have this building
you're right they're directly by now
get out some trash bags were about to go into the building anybody pull out garbage bags
like trash bags that you've brought from home and you just start picking stuff up
quitters
hard drives
like garbage out of buildings
the nicest panther him so in the place and when i tell people about their part of your job
was always ask two questions first there's a backpack are to to such but i'm scared when i hadn't thought of isn't that dangerous they can be a good book a trip to cuba and i'm always like yes could be very dangerous
and the explosion that's close
gunfire a smug visitors in airstrikes
charlie
and the other question they ask is how is that worth it
link
what what do you say to them
so look every reporter that covers conflict and war knows that you have to be there you have to be on the ground if you want to try to understand the story
and as for me i'm trying to understand isis
and one thing i've learned is that if you're able to get to the buildings that they occupied right after they are underrated and i mean right after the community to describe what you're doing her and on in a run off the side of a church that isis had used as a base
nope of here you often can find the documents that they left behind if the little guy is like day by a dick these are not documents that are meant for publication
it's since a prayer mat and then over there are these aren't the rockets the man
investment if you walked into my home right now if you walked in right now you would probably find my bank of america statement if you found that you would find all of my daily transactions you would know what diet i have you would know that i have a penchant for buying a certain kind of rice milk
the stores that i go to shop at so you might conclude that that i'm probably middle class
if you walked over to the bookshelf you would find books in romanian in english and in french and you could deduce from bad that i most likely speaks three languages or that members of my family are bilingual or and well if you went upstairs and he went into my bedroom and you found my diary you would find my most private thoughts and you're saying yeah you
and i did so i am doing that to isis them
i am looking for isis has diary i am looking for their internal correspondence their receipts their personal tips with coworkers some of which end up getting sent to the equivalent of isis h r
the things they're struggling with but they're writing letters back and forth about so the documents are generally what you are using to answer this question who are we really fighting yeah
you drove to syria went with your friend from from and right for go go gold own lives on the are you of course i'm a journalist so i also want to talk to them
we need people who are willing to give the love especially who's that
that's incredibly difficult but has been able to speak to around two dozen of them both in prisons in europe what did he do before i came here courage and to stall homemade volatile and in jails in both syria and iraq
watch your for have i
he worked for months with him as a mechanic those interviews have been crucial for me and understanding the general framework of how this works and the motivations that push people to join them
but many of those interviews have also left me frustrated the toilet
them over here because he chopped off his home
the overwhelming pattern is that they'll have witnessed an execution have witnessed a beheading have been present when a stoning took place when he has other things that you feel fucked her stomach military action
haiti
claw shocked but they never took part in that i'm stops
to me that many times along the way you said no
they weren't getting suspicious of you know there were no all looking at me and asked him why you eat and over and over this is the story to tell us go away but both when they did so he said i don't want to work with you anymore so he quit they were a cook there were a driver they were a translator
bashir do you want to tell me what really happened or do you not want to be interviewed at all
they present themselves as having been witnesses to her but never having carried out the horde themselves i've lost interest because he's controlling found himself so many times i just can't tell them anything things true
that's usually occurs
usually

you know in these suicide attacks like the paris attacks
obviously children and women were also count
how do they justify that
he said
they using exotic soon justification for every attack
third the do it tour solely due to them
palmer are women and children indiscriminately we do to them
certain point either said that you want to quit
can you can it was there one woman here serious moments said
already been killed someone


what do you what are we going to orbit in a call on the canadian he wants to call him up who say safer this is his code name that he's chosen this this has been on the care as they call it and every isis fighter has another garrett they don't entered the terrorist group with their own name and the reason they do that is
as a security measure to try to protect her identity so who's if a book was safer
yeah i had he designed them it started with instagram
so he came to my attention through a researcher named on at eight ram she like me trolls
the chat rooms and these platforms and she had gone online and found who safer as instagram feet and and that instagram feed she was able to put together that i will say for is a canadian that he had been inside the islamic state sometime we believed in two thousand and fourteen
and that he had returned to canada and was somehow living in the general population
did you ever see his instagram yes yeah
you've got you've got these are screenshots that you took a screenshot that that honor to tuck he's taken a town since then
okay so basically has his profile just shows the smiling kid
looks like he's wearing what may be a workout shirt
but if you go back through it there are some things that are that are somewhat disturbing so for example he repost an image of a knife and not only find it
paired us to me it looks like a combination between a screwdriver and a normal life that has the circular this kind of spiral shape so that wherever you inserted
it doesn't get along just one edge and cuts in a spiral direction
and and there's a caption on the image that he reposted the caption says deadliest knife ever it takes a team of surgeons to seal the wound victim bleeds out and minutes this is one evil knife
so honored ended up doing a report on this and she sent it to me and i pass this on to our research team at the new york times and they were then able to cross reference that material with his linked to an account
on his linked an account we found his email and i sent him an email expecting like always do that these people are not going to respond to me they would what did you say in or email
i said to him what a hobby say which has my name is rick many calling marquee i'm a reporter for the new york times where i covered on al qaeda and isis
and i'm very interested to learn about the islamic state and your experience are inside it
of course i sent this expecting the obvious which has that either he will not respond or he would say that but
like many here from the new york times how are you
good i am i getting you while you're in the car
oh okay to my true surprise a couple of days later he responded
not
yeah in the email very gently asked him where his phone number once they had his phone number asked him if he will not call him that i called in and then i asked him for permission to come to canada to see him and what do you allow me to come with my team at every step i thought he was gonna say no
no i mean that's that's kind of of see you as a fact that he said yes and the fact that it had been so easy to find him started to make me feel nervous
i remember thinking is there something i'm missing as this is this may be a fake order
you
oh right
why doesn't want to talk to you know why why would you want to talk to me so can you show me certain things like can you show me your the stamps in your passport you have images from theory but what kept me going is is is that could also hear the tennessee in his voice
and so i had to take the taps so test test so the next step is is you and i booked a ticket
both here and we flew to canada we're not going to say where we went from faces
get your voice
add up ourselves in in this hotel room i texted him the name of the hotel the address the room number and he agreed to come after the end of his work day because he was working i believe at a restaurant
and then we started wait
and he was initially late by fifteen minutes than twenty minutes than thirty minutes
we're still waiting
he says what's our i'm texting him and and wondering if we're going to be stood up
around an hour now
by
at a certain point
i almost gave up i thought this is we've basically just thrown away a plane ticket to canada
and at some point i remember that you turned around to asked me do you think there's any chance that this person is dangerous
when i asked you if you ever got scared
what you did now
a reverse
a vacuum cleaner suddenly foot down and turned around us which scared
and then
the
you hardly turn off the microphone hundred it's your turn off the record your head and hope and then you told me a story and i think the would you told that story now about the nine one one call yeah yeah
so i don't usually scare easily but in twenty fifteen i get a phone call from the f b i
to many much yes i am a may i come to see you right now i can be at your office and the next twenty minutes
and we went into a conference from not far from here and the agent read a prepared statement
he said you were the subject of a targeted threat from the islamic state and we can't tell you more
that was the first serious threat but it's started to percolate in our summer that they were noticing what i was doing since then i've seen how as become a presence in their online chat rooms they talk about my reporting the dissect my
tweets they sometimes insult me and these insults
if he can just as though sometimes are pretty funny i think they've figured out that i'm sensitive about my weight so they sometimes call me think many many many like pig fat much
sorry
i mean there's something ironic about big fat shamed by isis
so you know don't make jabs about how it's put on a couple of towns based on my latest you know tv appearance
but then sometimes what they say is dub serious so for example when i was in mosul a couple of months ago they started talking about how they were hoping that i would get killed in mosul just like the kurdish journalist who was killed there at the same time in the city
but let's see what are the others
you have a folder on your phone or you keep the threat is when i'm here yeah i like my one of them is a masked man who was holding up a knife that he's pointing towards the camera and he said under a picture of me wanted to be kill this crusader a woman that refuses to join to islam many cleo marcie please enjoy
joined to religion before be heading or truck from our soldiers of islamic state okay pretty by said
so they created a channel where they're pretending to be me and then they're pretending to post in this channel as me and says i have to confess something here i started covering isis because they are real man i always fantasized about getting raped by them that's all my fantasies this is the sole reason i made multiple trips to most or just a captured by isis so that they can fulfill my
desires
so unused to the stuff now but back when the f b i first came it didn't really sink in it was so unbelievable that honestly i i just
i think i just started away somewhere else
and then weeks went by there was another apparent terror attack and your best time in germany and months went by a series of deadly bonds at least one packed with nails killing dozens injuring hundreds and in that period of time i covered attack after tax returns storm the chancery morning master priests kingdoms and choose
hostage and a planned a deliberate attack in suburban sydney starts to just marinate in your consciousness german media reports the attackers shouting allah akbar as your heart out the passengers and then about a year later
i was home alone late at night
so i'm home alone and i'm by myself because at this point in time my husband was working the overnight at his company at twelve thirty i think at night i'm getting ready to go to bed i'm i'm actually under the covers and i'm upstairs with my two dogs and suddenly
my rhodesian ridge back which has a big dog
grayling
the hair on his back straight up immediately afterwards i started hearing somebody ringing the doorbell downstairs
and they're ringing continuously it's not like it's not like knock knock and and go waves like
knock knock now
i'm thinking to myself what is this like who who is this what does this
so i get a hold of my husband who assures me that it's not him at this point of turned off the lights in the second floor bedroom because i don't want the people who are asked to see where i am
so the dog is barking the knocking is going on and the doorbell is ringing and ringing and ringing
at this point i'm so scared for my hands are not even working
now i'm ron right you're right
ma'am
what a what
so the f d eight and who had come to seeming had told me that they had alerted the particular police precinct were left he said if you ever have any issues all you have to do is call nine one one they have you on a list but rather that you call rather than waiting for you know for something to happen i mean how the market have to work again
what are your heart but yeah the operator who picked up must have thought i was crazy
you know i
i will be great
or whatever and i can remember exactly what the woman said but it was something like ma'am are you trying to tell me that isis
doorbell
robert mcnabb
so she calls me back and just as ma'am
i am calling to tell you that we've investigated and it happens to be the the water department there's been a water main break on your street and as a result of this they're going house to house to tell the neighborhood that you're told that is not gonna flush what do you think the moral authority is ah
that's true moral that story with wires of the best the store you chose to tommy when i asked you if you've ever been afraid i guess the story illustrates how
i got and stared into the very thing that isis is trying to do because in the end the purpose of these acts of savagery and violence
our to terrorists they're trying to scare us right they're trying to make themselves into bogeyman and live in our imagination and that night
yeah they got me that night
yeah
so back to the hotel we were we were there for about two hours yeah and then suddenly out of the blue there was
a knock at the door of our hotel room
and i was struck because i had expected him to go to the lobby and that the lobby would call us but and study had managed to walk past the lobby
hello
yeah and i open the door and he had a hood on and the hood he was pulled so far forward that i could barely see his face his face wasn't shadow
he kept it kind of pulled down like that for some time
we that way
and both of us being really friendly
overtly
going to sit down it isn't he
there was
and then and then we sat down and started talking right
thank you so much recover
you're obviously taking a risk i'm speaking to us
is so i just wanted to ask if it's okay that we call you are boo hoo say stuff
problem was enough
so as you know i'm money
this is andy
and as i explained to you when we talked earlier
i'm trying to understand the ideology of isis
it's obviously an ideology that has a lot of paul tens of thousands of people have joined this group and i'm looking to in the hopes that you can help us understand it better
does that sound okay
