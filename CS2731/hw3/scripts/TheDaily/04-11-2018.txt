
from the new york times on my cobra this is the day

today day one of mark zuckerberg today marathon hearings in washington
behind the hours of questioning about these books practices was a larger and more difficult to answer a question what is this
it's wednesday april that
so i don't go to a lot of congressional hearings in fact that was my first congressional hearing in d c and so i didn't know what to expect i showed up a few hours early and it was a total zoo
hi
like i cannot tell you how many hundreds of people waiting outside this tiny little hearing room kevin was at the hearing on tuesday and there were protesters in costume
there was a woman dressed up as a on
which i thought was very clever
oh my god
oh
loads of tv cameras and yeah it was sort of this circus like it was packed and wall to wall the entire thing was filled there were forty senators who are questioning zuckerberg so even by their standards this is a large group you were actually in the room for this what was it like when it's walk walking while it was v
very very quiet i mean so he started walking in the room gets hushed and then the cameras start going quickly

because it's become like an iconic picture in just suck or bird sitting down at his death
to prepare to testify and just the swarm of photographers were crowding around the really does look like this with a moment that everyone had been anticipating a long time
and he sits down and also as notes and they're off we welcome everyone today's hearing
on facebook
social media privacy
and the ocean fish and abuse of data and it was about five hours from start to finish we have forty four members between our two committees
that may not seem like a large group by facebook standards
what it is significant here
for a hearing in the states senate and i was through this whole thing i was in the front row and the front row of of press there a couple of rows of people behind zuckerberg and then press section started know is right up there and so actually you look on cspan i don't want to brag
arm and part of my hand her visible in about five hours or as the testimony written into history yeah i should have gotten in munich here
source my pleasure to recognize the chairman of the commerce committee chairman thrown for his opening statement
a german grassley today's hearing is extraordinary
extraordinary to hold a joint committee earring
it's even more extraordinary to have a single ceo testify before nearly half of the united states senate
but then facebook is pretty extraordinary it started off pretty tense let me just cut the chose if you and other social media companies do not get your in order none of us are going to have any privacy anymore there were some opening statements
sort of the senators to grassley nelson so the senators who have been leading on these issues and they were pretty aggressive how can american consumers trash folks like your company to be caretakers of the most personal and identifiable information was october it had
a long term opening statement about oh he had made mistakes we didn't take a broad enough view of our responsibility and that was a big mistake
and it was my mistake and i'm sorry
i started facebook
i run it and i'm responsible for what happens here and he started this thing in his dorm room he kept mentioning his dorm room at harvard i started facebook what i was in college
we've come a long way since then given why do you think that zuckerberg kept mentioning the origins of facebook in a dorm at harvard get it over and over so we have made a lot of mistakes and running the company i think it's pretty much impossible i believe to start a company in your dorm room and then grow it to be at the scale that we're at now without making some mistakes i think
it's just a sort of humanizing detail
why of people know the story of facebook
american dream narrative he was you know just a kid in a dorm and now he's one of the richest people in the world only in america etc etc but i think there was an interesting strategic race there because on one hand yes it's a humanizing detail
he needs more of those he wants more of those are the other hand like if your goal is to convince a bunch of senators they you are old enough and mature enough to be in charge of this gigantic technology platform
billions of people's lives around the world like you might not want to remind them how recently you're in college
i realize the issues were talking about today aren't just issues for facebook in our community there issues and challenges for all of us as americans
thank you for having me here today and i'm ready to take your questions
and then it sort of went off the rails i mean i never thought that this was going to be the most new discussion of technology policy and the intricacies of digital advertising mana well i watched a couple congressional hearings before like these are not subject matter experts most of them there for you consider my purse
personally identifiable data the company's not my day is that it
no senator actually the first line of our terms of service say that you control and only the information and content that you put on facebook and so it felt a little like a five hour tech support call
it felt like trying to explain to someone very patiently how their i phone works and what to do if it's on the fritz there will always be a version of facebook that is free it is our mission to try to help connect everyone around the world and to bring the world closer together in order to do that we believe that we need to offer a service that everyone can
ford and we're committed to doing that were have so how to use the state of business model in which users don't vote for your service
senator we run ads or most of them i would say their understanding of just the basics about facebook not even this russia stuff for cambridge analytic about just how does this thing work how does it make money how do people interact with it like that seem to elude some of the senators so
people people now give you permission to track specific devices in their contract if they do is that a relatively new addition to what you do
senator oh sorry i am able to opt out of i will say it's ok for you to
track what i'm saying on facebook but i don't want you to track what i'm texting to somebody else off facebook on an android oh okay
yes senator this kind of confusion about exactly how facebook work seem very much like the theme of the day and or thinking about that is that these book has become all powerful we know that they haven't done a great job with this great power that they have and that
lot of these senators are angry on behalf of their constituents for his kind of nebulous thread that facebook represents but what it seems like the settlers and the rest of us don't quite know it's like where'd you go from there because we don't really understand how facebook works great and to be clear
like i write about facebook for a living and i don't understand how facebook or like it's sort of fractal in the moment you start thinking that you understand part of it you discover that there are ten different parts of it that you don't understand at all and because everyone's facebook feed is tailored to their specific interests like know two people
see the same thing when they log on to facebook different it's literally different for everyone and so that makes it very hard to create a unified theory of facebook and how it works and i think that's the thing that i was seeing is just the senators were trying to grapple with okay is this a technology company is in a website is an immediate
companies that a political campaign tool is it's something that we should regulate like it's the news publisher is it something that we should regulate like it's a bank is it's something that we should regulate in some other way that we haven't figured out yet a really seemed like that was sort of the essential question is not what did facebook do in
twenty six sixteen it was what his facebook
mr zuckerberg outcome in peach
i was particularly struck by this interaction that zuckerberg had with john kennedy who is a republican senator from louisiana and sort of a guy who's been tough fun tech executives before i don't want to blow to have to regulate facebook
but now god i will
binge on you
i'm a little disappointed in the sharon do that
i just don't feel like that were connecting
show me try to lay it out for you from map and one of you
i think you're really smart guy
and i think you have built an extraordinary american company
and you've done a lot of good some of the things that you've been able to do or magical
but are promised digital utopia
we have discovered has mine fields
there's some impurities in the facebook punch bowl he started off pretty strong i think he expressed a lot of this sort of frustration that some people in the room when kneeling
then it can on an island off the rails as a facebook user are you are you willing to give me more control over my data
senator as someone who uses facebook i believe that you should have complete control over your data okay are you willing to go back and work on on giving me a grinder right to erase my data
senator you can already delete any of the data that's there are we going to ban that work on expanding man
senator i think we already do what you're referring to but certainly were always working on trying to make these controls easier are you willing to expand my right to know who you're sharing my data with
senator
we already give you a list of apps that that you're using and you signed into those yourself and provided affirmative consent and just keep saying senator you can already do this we already built this it already exists
you can see him sort of patiently explaining like us we thought about this yes we've addressed are you willing to give me the right to take my data on facebook and move to another social media platform
senator you can already do that we have download your information to all where you can go get a file of all the content there and then do whatever you want with it and then asked him you're willing to give me the right to say i'm gonna go on your platform
and you're going to be able to tell a lot about me as a result but i don't want you to share with any but
yes senator and i believe you're you already have that ability today people can sign on and choose to not share things and just follow some friends are some pages and read content if that's what they want to do okay
my be sure and about out
time or goes faster than this exchange kind of because like a microcosm of this entire hearing because kennedy is angry he wants facebook to do better but he doesn't quite understand what the problem actually is and ultimately the questions that senators like kennedy are asking
are kind of beside the point
they think there's some value in forcing someone like mark zuckerberg to answer really simple questions about facebook street for details way so simple questions but important ones to get on the record store cupboard would you be comfortable sharing with us the name of the hotel you see in last night

no
think that might be with this is all about
you're right to privacy
the limits of your privacy but then there were sort of the odd ball questions that just seems like people had may be thought of them on the fly or it was their pet issue or their bill that they wanted to push it was sort of a grab bag concerns do you have any idea how many of your users actually read the terms of
service the privacy policy the statement rights and responsibilities and the actually read it
senate are you not my state and from west virginia and thank you for visiting and next time you visit if you would please bring some fiber because we don't have connectivity in our rural areas like we really need and facebook could really help us with that on guy like whipped out a tablet
and like showed off his facebook profiles that i am a proud member facebook and he was really surreal important now my son charlie who's thirteen is dedicated instagram so he'd want to be sure i mention him while i was here with with you
this always happens railing i remember listening to congress grilling wall street executives in two thousand and nine after the financial crisis and they were asking all kinds of crazy questions too but what came out of the had was a sense that this was a sector that had to be reined in things have gotten out of control
that there needed to be comprehensive regulation of the sector that would keep something like the financial crisis from happening again and out of that process we actually did get regulation in dodd frank was the big bill that passed through congress that tried to address some of the causes of the two thousand and eight financial crisis and the
congress people in those hearings with the bank executives they were not experts on mortgage backed securities are credit default swaps but they still managed to understand in general terms what the issue was these banks were taking on too much risk and then they had their staffers and experts who actually knew the subject very well
come in and draft legislation that would address those problems and i think that's the step we're not seeing it with a spoken with the tech sector is we hadn't yet identified what the problems are they were trying to solve and congress doesn't seem to be united on that and i'm not even sure they're particularly close
to identifying what they're trying to do and then after that going out and actually doing who's your biggest competitor
center we have a lot of competitors who is your biggest
i think the categories of did you want just one i not sure i can give one but i give up
bunch so
give this entered islam credit mean there were a number of interesting and relevant questions i think zuckerberg got pressed a lindsey graham about some of the questions are on whether a facebook is a monopoly did anyone at facebook have a conversation at the time that i became aware of this breach and
have a conversation where in the decision was made not to contact the users he got pressed by comma harris center from california about specific issues related to cambridge analytic face books failure to notify users so there was some ground broken i don't want to give the impression that this was
all just a total three ring circus but i do think there were a number of occasions on which just asking a follow up question there was more pointed i think zuckerberg was very good at answering the questions that he wanted to answer part of that is because he's been rehearsing for this he hired a team of fancy experts to come in and
him for the session like presidential candidates would do before a debate so he was prepared for just about anything but they didn't really plumb the depths of what people might have expected them to ask so would you work with us in terms of what regulations you think are necessary in your industry absolutely okay would you submit some
proposed regulations
yes and i'll have my team follow up with you
how do you think that he did i didn't did pretty well i mean i think he started off pretty nervous but i think as a war on he started to realize that this is not going to be a totally hostel in totally sophisticated group of prosecutorial center this is going to be a mixed bag and i think he got a lot more comfortable as the day went on but i think
did well when investors think he did well to the stocks up almost five percent so clearly he reassured some people
one of the key issues here is his facebook to power are you to power in do you think you're too powerful
but i want to touch on this other thing that i was feeling today because i i felt that pretty acutely when some of the senators were talking to mark zuckerberg and sort of asking him for advice on maybe how they should regulate him how they should think about these things
it's a little bit more like a tutorial than a regulatory hearing and i really started thinking you know these senators are part of a legislative body that makes the laws for a population of three hundred and some million
mark zuckerberg by himself controls of supranational entity that's two point two billion people so he is like in a very real sense more powerful than any of these individuals' senators or maybe even the senate as a whole he can't launch
nuclear weapons or start a war or collect taxes but he can shape the behaviors and the mental states any information diet's have many many more people around the world then these senators can dress with their work
as a technology writer i assume you more or less knew the answers to most of the questions that the senators were asking but did you learn anything in his hearings
yeah i think i learned a lot about how senators and lawmakers view technology companies and view the work that firms like facebook do and i think it's sort of a mixture of reverence and skepticism and a little bit of fear and i think all of that mixed together explains
a lot about how the next few years are going to go for technology companies saying they're not getting less powerful rate in the absence of new regulation or something crazy happening in the economy they're not going away and so i think will start to see more and more of these types of hearings and my hope is that with each successive here
success of opportunity the law makers have to ask questions of people like mark zuckerberg the get a little bit better and a little bit better and pretty soon we'll be having the types of discussions you need to be having
kevin thank you very much
make that

i should ask you like a dick durbin start question which hotel you day until i'm staying on my brother's futon
the nicest hotel in washington enjoy
well i'm going to guess

we'll be right back


here's what else you need to know the times reports that the f b i agents who did the offices of president trumps personal lawyer michael collins will looking for records of payments to two women who claim they had a
fares with trump as well as information about the war of the publisher of the national enquirer in silencing one of those women it's unclear exactly why the agents are examining the payments but critics of the president have claimed that they amount to illegal campaign contributions to drop bit
because they helped him win the white house by hiding publicly damaging stories on tuesday trump continued to lash out at the department of justice for the raid
calling it a total witch hunt and saying quote attorney client privilege is dead and afternoon
as she know the president welcome to the emir of qatar to the white house today
during a news conference at the white house a reporter asked press secretary sarah how could be sanders about the possibility that the president would fire special counsel robert
over the raid which began with a tip for his
power firearms
as certainly believes he has the power to do so
in fact the president does not have the power to do so
that power realize with the deputy attorney general rod roses
who the times reports personally authorize the raid on cohen's office
that's it
i'm michael horrible
