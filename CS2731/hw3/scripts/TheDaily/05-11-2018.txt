
from the new york times ah michael barbara
this is the daily
today
childbirth is killing black mothers and their babies at staggeringly high rates in the us
why their deaths have everything to do with the lived experience of being a black woman in america
it's friday male of it
and they will
the states
yeah
so the same
miss them
variation
in
so some on landrum is a young woman living in new orleans who was pregnant
your about her
gradually increase a little greg during pregnancy
and i met her with her do
watch it out
yeah it's when you know when
he's only twenty three years old has a great upbeat personality but she's also clearly very nervous about this pregnancy
linda via rosa is contributing writer to the times magazine
know my
yeah
like she would say i'm really nervous i don't want to die having a baby i don't want my baby to die just say like if you have a flash pay a man in this way i remember last year
think it's okay but i was out
remember day she just was afraid that she wasn't going to make it because of what happened last time
those scenes
my grandmother is a sense and see because their grandmother mama mama had died recently found out that
beautiful
so she thought it was kind of divine order that she was having a girl she wanted to teach your daughter had a thing she loves music know she had already decided to name or harmony and then you have dylan who is turning seven and what's your other son's name is kay
case or okay
but then during this pregnancy she noticed something different okay with that
see
hey let's say hands
the hurt so may still day
is like shaq pains in a haze way
so the headaches were blinding so much that she was working as a waitress and had to leave that job and so she talked to her doctor about the headaches and he kept telling your well you know just take some tylenol and she complained again the headaches are quite bad and he said just take more tylenol and she wasn't comfortable with that but she wasn't sure
what else to do
so then what happens when you got closer to your due date
when sex and i do day i remember once
it's november and some own is noticing that she's really not feeling that well she's having swelling she still having those headaches that tylenol is not really helping so she goes to her regular prenatal visit with a lot of things to talk about my blood pressure was
in when it was high
any as they just let russia go down
high blood pressure is always dangerous but especially during pregnancy because it can lead to hemorrhaging it can also lead to an abrupt shun which means that the placenta detached from the uterine wall and that's very bad for the baby because the baby can't get the nutrients he or she needs bad for the baby bad for the mother it's like that
for both i was just
may they may me a day and it was fun
next day
nailed the usa
stay in his life addicts how he had a vacation
she was really freaked out and she said watched i do and a doctor said to her well you know you could go up to labor and delivery now and we could deliver the baby and she said well wait isn't too early and he just said well i'm going to be out of town and so i guess is when i could do it or your other choice is just to sit back cause
calm down and try to get your blood pressure down
that just
that area
yeah
but she was also afraid and he was listening to him because he thought he was a good doctor is so when a check it again i assume there is lower
meats and just go home and ito and a father
ages
make sure she don't really do much less than base
babies so she thought okay everything's fine again
so tell me how it happened and like what happened
okay i was laying down wasn't selling
a lay them
really get a while
and they just
it's four days later and someone has gotten much sicker she's very tired she's got boned weary fatigue she can hardly get out of bed
was to them
the analysis like all just
please
she was in the car
but i thought it was no arbor
when
as same way
on the seat and so she ended up actually getting an ambulance and going it was an emergency situation
in there
yeah i mean you
let me down
it's blurry she's coming making they just kept on h
and i felt like a see in the time
it wasn't of says it oh
when i that an air
in a day to check to see if she was free and stuff
when they pay the day
it was that because i kept saying she okay
cage in that way in england
she you know a wow
in any
well the soul
never be there

and then what was your condition like what you probably know now
it is worse
me
sounds like you are most
yeah

what exactly had gone wrong with this pregnancy
so pre clamps here is simply high blood pressure during pregnancy and the symptoms were obvious the swelling the high blood pressure as well as the headaches but it was ignored and it led to an abrupt option that led to hemorrhage and so the hemorrhage almost killed her and actually did kill her baby
alamo there
me so happy so happy now
it was there
come back
i felt it was they you know i wish does she suffered so i don't know what it banks of those the beads
the combat units say wow
bit off a phrase
insist
the
every may
yeah

i tend to think of maternal and infant mortality as a problem from an entirely different era or i tend to think of these problems something that afflict countries that have a lot of poverty i don't think of this happening
inside the united states in two thousand and seventeen two thousand and eight do
well it shouldn't be happening in the united states in twenty eight team
maternal mortality is a huge problem here in the united states we are the only developed country where the raid is actually going up the and then at the same time our infant mortality rate is high it's thirty second out of the thirty five most developed countries wealthiest countries so bad again
is odd and both of these rates are driven by black women what's going on with black women and babies so a black woman is two to three times more likely to die in childbirth or almost die then a white woman and a black baby is two point two times more likely to die been a white baby
this racial disparity is actually larger than and eighteen fifty during slavery it was narrower than when black women were slaves and you're saying that the problem of infant and maternal mortality among black women is so significant that it drives the entire us rate for both
up it drives the rate for both up
and why does this disparity exist how can we account for this difference
i first heard about this in the nineties i was their health editor of essence magazine and we had been told this narrative that infant mortality is a problem a poor black women weren't taking care of themselves and black women aren't getting proper prenatal care either because they are irresponsible or because they just don't have an
access to it but then studies came out that said no actually when prenatal care is equal black women still have small and preterm babies one of the statistics it really struck me was that if you're black woman with a college education and in fact an advanced degree you are more likely to die in childbirth
or lose your baby than a white woman with an eighth grade education oh i did not believe it i was like no that cannot be right
how could this be because the narrative was always oh this happens to poor women who don't take care of themselves and don't get prenatal care but then this study in nineteen ninety two just crash that whole thing apart this had nothing to do with that so then the next bang was okay this is got to be genetic so maybe the
there's an inherited difference that women of african descent have that is causing low birth weight so to me and colleges in chicago looked at black women immigrants who had come from africa and the caribbean so when the women first came their babies weighed about the same as white babies in the united states but then after to generation
the black babies immigrant babies turned out the same birth weights as african american babies which is to say low low low birth weight but you didn't see the same thing in white immigrant women so white immigrant women came to the united states and in those two generations their babies actually got larger so and healthier
and healthier and so then it became wait this isn't about genetics this really is about something else something about growing up as a black woman in america is bad for your baby's birth weight you can come into this country with a healthy pregnancy but your child and their child if you're back
something will happen to you yes it is in any of these other things it isn't poverty it is it irresponsibility it is an inherited and so now we're looking at race and racism the lived experience of being a black woman in america essentially being a black woman is bad for your pregnancy
in america something is going wrong here

the back
so i want to understand how this actually plays out in these pregnancies
reese as a force in an expectant mothers experience
well it happens in two ways the first is what happens in the healthcare system there had been study after study after study from in the nineties more recently that talk about what happens to you when you walk into a medical facility black people are treated differently there was one study that looked at medical students and
they had ideas about racial differences that were not true one that struck me was that black people have much higher pain tolerance than white people so need less pain management which is not true black people have thicker skin again
not true or the idea that our blood coagulate somehow differently maryland medical professionals who have these assumptions these are medical students who had these assumptions and so that is frightening because that's the next generation of doctors and i think those two studies were very eye opening for me at least so what you're describing is a kind of unconscious
but perhaps contrast medical racism guess what's the second way that this plays out the second way race plays out is in some ways more insidious it's more scary but something happens to black women because of our lived experience of being in america
the way it's been looked at by scientists
is about a kind of toxic stress so what of the leading scientists in this area coined the term weathering and weathering means that the body actually age is in a way that it shouldn't be aging according to your biological years because of a kind of toxic stress and she linked the toxic
stress to race in america racial discrimination and this one weathering is very evocative because it seems to describe racism as live day in and day out as a kind of storm that the slowly ravages of body and the body might look more at my seems stable and maybe even healthy
but layers if it had been stripped away that's right
it's the idea that any time something happens to you that makes your emotional the systems of your body breaks up the fight or flight syndrome is protective but if it keeps happening over and over so that your pulse races your heart beat harder your systems change and it's constant and it keeps happening over and over
and over it actually where there's your body
change your system and it makes you more vulnerable to all kinds of illness i guess we think of racism as a societal problem and we think of medicine as a science a hovers above all that but maybe that separation in our minds is a false one
i think it is very false and i think that racism and race is baked into every single thing in our society and medicine is not immune
how you been
they're attacked any anyway
stress
hey
you
we were
just every
max the age
what is the ages
it's
so what happens with some own and the second pregnancy
so with her second pregnancy she is very committed to not letting what happened to harmony happen again
she has a new doctor she has a dealer who is trained as a labor and delivery nurse and who is making sure that she is going to her prenatal care appointments and she's checking in with her and making sure she's taking good care of myself
yeah baby
here here
yeah says a way so she was a little cautious she was superstitious she didn't want to have a baby shower she want to buy clothes for the baby because she just wanted to make sure everything was going to be okay before she really let
her heart open up to the idea that i'm i really have this baby
so this
he never had
they really
you say
this is the way he said
because it it
a
yeah saves his name
and so what happens with this birth so while the doctor said we're afraid of you having a post term baby because this baby wasn't we thought the baby would be coming earlier but he wasn't and so weird
kind of nervous were thinking that by thursday we're going to induce him so this was monday and it was a premise is running a little bit late it was a little bit late so we went to the doctor on monday and she was just getting the usual test just seeing how the baby was and it seemed like the baby wasn't doing so well
his little heart was going any me me me me it didn't look normal on the screen and so the woman who was reading the monitor said i need to call your doctor right away i think we're going to have to take this baby out now she's having the baby today
so she got in her room and they started giving her the potatoes and a medication that induces labor and then about five hours in the pain got pretty bad so she needed an epidural so little to do and i had to step out of the room
when we came back some was not in a good way she was very upset she was clinching your fears she was very angry and this sub zero of course was to make things better better but they gave her an epidural that was more like if you needed c section not just the regular epidural just to alleviate the pain of on labour too much it was too much
well someone was really angry because she couldn't feel her legs which is not how it's supposed to be in this kind of epidural but also we saw her blood pressure going up and we saw the baby's heart rate kind of moving all over the place so much toner she said we've got to get some own calm down and so the tone it was very smooth she started my
massaging her hands and she started saying we just need to something terrible has happened it wasn't right and she had the medical personnel calm and explain and actually they said we're sorry
given how the wrong day has given her the wrong dose she was right
so then about one a m it's time and so a whole bunch of residents come in and then this man who i've never seen before simone had never seen before and he said oh i'm doctor so and so i'm going to the with your baby it was like who is
who is this man so it turns out that black women are much more likely than white women to meet the provider who's going to deliver their baby for the first time during labor in childbirth which has it's own for stress which was really stressful but some of them was way beyond that she was like just get this baby out of me
and then finally someone was just in the zone and she was pushing and latino was at her side saying polish you can do this you got this and i was even doing it to someone pushed the baby out and the baby came out and he was very still
so they put the baby on her chest and i was holding my breath and some mom said is he okay is everything okay and then all of the sudden he let's out this whale and we knew he was okay
encountered some seem in this moment when she's finally holding his newborn it was everything i've never seen somebody have so many emotions it once she was crying she was gasping she was happy she was laughing at everything it was all this pile up of emotions because she survived
and she has this baby and she made it and she named the baby kingston and his middle name is blessed
it's kind of remarkable to understand after everything that you told us here that more senior that's simply surviving pregnancy mother and son
that is a triumph that that is against in some ways the odds childbirth is supposed to be this wonderful beautiful natural experience but for so many black women and so many black babies it isn't
who

hughes what else you need to another day
the us
on thursday is really warplanes struck dozens of suspected iranian military targets inside of syria as tensions between israel and iran reach new heights
israel said it was responding to an unsuccessful iranian rocket attack involving twenty missiles launched from syria
all of which were intercepted or fell short of their targets in israeli control territory
as for sure
only issue was it slow me i'm a born during a presentation on thursday israel's defense minister said that the airstrikes had destroyed all of iran's military infrastructure in syria
if there is when on our side he said there will be of blood on their side
russia
see
for love the times reports that israel and iran have been conducting a shadow war inside of syria under the cover of the syrian civil war but the conflict is now bursting into the old
