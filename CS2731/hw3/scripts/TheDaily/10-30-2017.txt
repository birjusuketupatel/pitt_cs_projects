
from the new times i'm michael but this is
today
the dust is back in the news why the trump administration says new reporting that the clinton campaign helped fund is evidence that the entire russia investigation is all just politics
and oh were on the record conversation with the president's lawyer about the investigation
it's monday october thirtieth
ken vogel has been reporting on the origins of the dossier for the times can i want to talk about why the dossier is back in the news first of all remind us what does he even was the dossier is a series of memo written at the behest washington d c
based opposition research firm called fusion gps they hired a former british spy guy by the name of course for steel to look into donald trump's finances his campaign team and most importantly both of their ties to russia the bombshell burst tuesday evening classified documents on russian
interference with the two thousand and sixteen us election presented last week president obama and the president elect trump included allegations that russian operatives claim to have compromising personal and financial information about mr trump it should never have been released but i read what was released and i think it's a disgrace i think
it's an absolute disgrace the website buzz feed then published a thirty five page cache of memos from the alleged dossier
including a claim of sexual activity caught on a moscow hotel room surveillance camera it's all fake news it's phony stuff it didn't happen
and it was gotten by opponents of ours so investigators for both the special counsel robber mahler and the house and said an intelligence committees have actually been exploring the claims made in a dark and have made efforts to interview christopher steel he has rebuffed the congressional committees efforts interview him but
did reportedly sit for an interview with investigators from mr muller team over the summer so we do know that even as many of the most salacious allegations and many of the other allegations in the dossier remain unconfirmed it is something that investigators are acutely interested in okay
so why after all these months of the darcy his existence been revealed and everyone from the central council to congress investigating it is it now back in news is back in the news and large part because republicans won it back in the news and they have found an angle to bring it
bag into the news which is the financing of the dossier that is who funded the research that led to the dossier they believe that if they could show that this was democrats that it would undermine the entire credibility of a dossier so we had the chairman their public and chairman of the house intelligence committee actually send us
pina to attempt to extract the financial records of the opposition research firm that funded the dossier to show them to do research that subpoena would have actually had a deadline of monday morning and in the days before that we saw two people who funded or groups that
funded fusion gps as research into trump come forward voluntarily and say hey we did this and one of them the first one to come forward was in fact the law firm that represented both hillary clinton's presidential campaign and the democratic national committee republican seized on that like a gift from
the heavens that they could use to undermine not just the dossier but the entire russian investigation only a few days later another fonder came forward and it was a conservative website funded by a major republic and donor who was opposed the donald trump during the primary that kind of complicated the issue a great
deal because you had funders on both sides of the aisle behind the research that at least partly led to this dossier got it the president has been on a toy store and fired up over when he calls a lack of investigations into hillary clinton specifically citing several examples he mention the
now infamous dossier that was produced by fusion gps which was hired by the clinton campaign to find opposition research into them candidates from he also mentions this or russian uranium deal and which she accuses hillary clinton of taking bribes from russians for a favorable uranium mining company deal
made during her tenure as secretary of state studios trump on sunday in his tweets seems to be saying if clinton money is responsible in any anyway for the dossier and if a dossier is fueling the russia investigation then the whole thing is deeply suspect but that would mean that
the russia investigation being conducted by her mother is highly reliant on the dossier so do we know if that's the case we don't know how central the dossier his mother mother's investigation and in fact early indications are that they're really going down their own round and maybe this could sort of inform some of the other day
do but it's not like they would bring charges based on something in this unverified dogs they're doing their homework there there's some of the top litigators investigators and prosecutors in the country and they're not going to bring forms he charges just because a piece of opposition research made them finally can i want to ask you about another aspect of the mother and se
patient that's in the news right now cnn has reported that indictments are pending for a couple of former members of the trunk campaign team based on information turned up by motors team it is a landmark moment in the investigation into russian meddling in the two thousand and sixteen election sources briefed on the matter say a federal grand jury and washing
approved the first charges in the investigation led by special counsel robert mother a spokesman for the special counsel's office declined to comment the indictments are sealed with planes are underway for anyone charged to be taken into custody as soon as monday how does that connect to all of this that would seem to suggest that there is
some real validity to the overall investigation after all
he will certainly some of the folks who find themselves most in muller's cross hairs paul manner for the former campaign chairman michael flynn the former national security advisor but for the administration and for the campaign they are characters in the dossier but they have both attempted to pour cold water on the claims made about
them in the dossier that said we do understand that muller is closing in on them and so it would stand to reason that if he is going to bring charges against them in the near future that we would learn a lot more about the degree to which the dossier and the charges in the dossier are actually central to this
this investigation and we'd learn the extent to which anything they're caught up in connects to the president and other members of the team presumably yeah that's really the key question here and there is a lot of thinking that the areas in which they had the most exposure being there compliance or lack thereof
with the foreign agents registration act with money laundering rolls with potential tax evasion that those things were not really directly related to the president but rather were being used to try to get them to give up information that would be more directly related to potential wrong doing or collusion between the russia
guns and the the trump team if you see an indictment of either of those two it does suggest to some extent that the focus is on them and it doesn't it doesn't for close the possibility that they might then also give up something that could be used to implicate trump or trumps team but it does suggest that they are target
under them independent of the ability to bring it closer to truck
can hook or thank you very much yeah i was a pleasure
after the break how the president's were is talking about the investigation
we'll be right back late last week the day after the times reported on the clinton campaign's involvement in the dossier my colleague matter puzo went to meet with the president's top lawyer in dealing with the mother investigation ty cobb if you've heard cards name is probably from a few weeks back when can google was
last on the show after he overheard cobb talking about the investigation while eating lunch at a dc steakhouse
over my shoulders for can vote on a on the other hand they are politics and particularly politics and legal investigations their contact sports
if you can't take a couple of punches now and still show up here in the wrong game on thursday comp spoke to a puzo about how that investigation looks these days from inside the white house has the process going mean how would you characterize it is going quite well apologize didn't mean to interrupt your question and say it's gone
you know quite well now i think they're in a position where they've got the documents that they need to an abuser and way hand i think they're trying to do so as expeditiously as possible
why was ty cobb brought in for this role in the first place by president from what area of legal expertise and how is it helpful peer so ties inexperienced white collar where you work for one of the biggest firms in the country hogan and levels and he represented major
does he represent a people who got wrapped up in corruption investigations really complicated white collar investigations and in the end that's what this is this is a really complicated like our investigation of having a lot of documents and a lot of potential witnesses i'm sensitive topics
he he's done this is a guy in dc is known as being able to do this
you've seen now if not all certainly most of the documents that have gone from the white house the special counsel if tomorrow those all those documents were made public or they were reported in the new york times
and people could see what you've seen about what do i asked given bomber what story with that tell what would they see think it would be a much smaller story than i room in her time just to there
clinton campaign and didn't see you know i think what else he is what i think senator feinstein characterized there's no no evidence of collusion and i believe that the story will be the the president was mistreated and that the
excuse of russia undoing mrs clinton and millions that it cost the taxpayer in terms of a special counsel were sacramento and american ezra he's not behaving as a lawyer would behave if he had deep concerns that the
white house was sitting on some explosive document that would unravel the presidency
there's a certain level of confidence this is not an inexperienced lawyer so he he clearly feels like when this all shakes out the presence going to be fine that is both a thing you say as a lawyer but you also have to read a lawyers body language
and also read what his actions are showing you end he has staked their posture that i said this will all be fine map was cards reaction to the prospect that these former members of the president's campaign team paul manner for and my kaufman may be indicted in the coming days and how does that fit into the camp
since you're describing i asked i said hey if if bob charges these guys that puts pressure on them to give information against the president to cooperate get a better deal so i think the president has been
clear on solo it's i think it's sort of under reported that i think he would be sad for them as a friend and former colleague from
process results in punishment or indictments to the extent that that happens that beyond his control and obviously he's not trying to influence in any way but the president has no concerns in terms of any impact as to what happened to them on on his
campaign or on the us basically they don't have anything to give they
that implicates suppressor anything wrong it's wholly independent the process that the white house has engaged and and this
an interesting question but how can ty cobb know that doesn't that's not an ignorant question is a very question
so his job is to find out both in emails and contemporaneous documents and then obviously in conversations with people who are around the present time
any conversations with present travels private lawyers and their campaigns lawyers and the people who are in the campaign to try his job is to try to understand the universe of what what was going on both in the campaign in the white house
so if he ends up getting surprised then something has gone wrong i mean it has a good lawyer
you want to try to minimize your surprises
now we've been talking about the documents that ty cobb has to find and hand over to a special prosecutor when rubber mother asks for them what are these documents exactly
we're talking about emails text messages if they exist
notes
memos things that were created at key moments in the trunk presidency
the decision to fire gym komi be a gym commie director kept contemporaneous notes that say the president told him to drop the investigation into michael flynn right
mahler wants to see why we're records do you have on that why did you fire and good you fire and because he wouldn't shut down the rush investigation
because the remind me of the obstruction of justice is ty cobb confident that there will be no charges whatsoever against the president yeah i i asked that question what about the peripheral stuff
the question of obstruction of justice to can the president can the present united states
can he have strict trust us as a legal matter so
after for him
professor dershowitz are now is written extensively to say now
there's a legal theory going around that the president actually can't be charged with obstruction of justice like even if he did it the president can abstract just as because he has a right to fire the f b i director and he has ultimate pardon power he give him for any reason he wants and i asked them later
what do you make of that
i am actually explored there because the facts don't require because it's just you're just think firing of comedy or whatever conversations he's had it doesn't even reached the bar the medieval worry about it
yeah that's exactly right and he he expressed like real confidence and the underlying fact not just the legal argument that the president can't be charged with obstruction he seemed really confident in than the fact that the president didn't have struck justice he wasn't going to try desperately glares jared kushner and gun junior have talked pub
luckily about this idea that what looks or maybe came off is suspicious or unusual during the transition or the campaign was actually just a function of well intentioned politically naive or politically inexperienced people in a new situation or they didn't
hey being in if you are a sort of anti trump democrat that sounds like a convenient excuse
your take on
well i think if you're anti anybody whatever they say about something that didn't go well sounds like your excuse
i think that's actually one of the problems today
nobody can go i get that was no that wasn't for upon our intentional conspiracy it doesn't take his argument and it may not be formalized or have articulated is that the president may have hired some not create people who exercise and knock raid judgment but there's no hi love or
multifaceted conspiracy here to work with russia
yeah that that is absolutely their case and so ty cobb comes in and he asked this strategy
i know obama i i've done cases like this before
if we have nothing to hide we we turn over the documents we make everybody veil what and that's how we get out from under us now what do you think that the top lawyer for the president in this investigation whatever talk on the record to the new york times it sounds like you've known him for a really long time which may be one reason why i agree to do it but to read on
why now he's one to do this
oh my i'm a persuasive and charming person know but but nobody does that nobody goes on the record her pod cast in the middle of the investigation simply because of my wiles luck ty cobb obviously his posture here is
cooperation nothing to hide and they feel good about how this goes for the president in the end end i think this is part of showing the public that we don't have and hide
thank you very much
the is great
