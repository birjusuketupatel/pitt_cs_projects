
from the new york times ah michael barbara
this is that it
today
women are being sidelined passed over for promotions and raises and fired when they complain
a times investigation finds that pregnancy discrimination is rampant inside america's biggest companies
it's tuesday june twenty six
so about six months ago there was this explosion of me to coverage and my colleague discuss over greenberg and i were at the same time hearing stories of pregnancy discrimination on our be and we thought it was something we had to look into
natalie control f covers the economy for the times and that's around the time that we came across this woman ot show all great

i was born in fort meyers florida
in my mum loop me a member of the subjects them bill and i was younger she grew up in the eighties and florida
mom worked hard work two jobs
the care of me and my brother you know there was no renault's government assistance or anything like that she wasn't wealthy but she said she had everything she needed i mean i had a pretty decent life growing up as a child
can't complain
she started working early as a teenager that a job at k have seen then as a server at a diner and then from the diner i transferred to a car wash the selling place and after that job she gets pregnant and has the baby that was my first child and then she has two more kids
and no teachers a single mom at this point and she's looking for something a little more stable a job that pays better that comes with benefits a place where she feels like she can move up the ladder
and one day she's shopping at walmart
and i was walking around
my friend and i was like hey i do in and like
they work in it is thing she played briefly and be hurt me get a job here and as she hears more about walmart it seems like this perfect opportunity everything she was looking for it's a big company and she thinks she can grow there so she applies to the job and she gets it he
gets the job
when i started working hour away

i was happy
i was really happy because i was gonna be getting paid more money than what i usually get paid
i was just the big picture i just thought a big picture to big picture
so she starts this new job she's working in the deli in the bakery at walmart and the bakery you know requires us to go on the freezer take on the frozen bread box is our lift the boxes move stuff around the what we're looking for lid on the daily side you
take out your rotisserie chickens was a storm inside like a cooler like and they come inside this bugs the box place between thirty five fifty pounds though they're pretty heavy it's pretty hard work but ot she says she likes it and she finally feels like she's on the path to a stable career that's when i was able
the movements the my apartment my first apartment by myself just me and my children
so yes i was happy but then one day things started to change
that was in the freezer taken out the bread to get ready to start my cycle over again to get him ready for the next day so dark and clear
the get unproved than ready for it and more next morning
and that's when the sharp plane hit i hour to the bathroom and scene and i was cleaning
i had nothing
but when i went to the hospital when they told me i was praying that
and they want me to start doing heavy lifting
avoid miscarriage and believe it was like
weighs more than twenty pounds
and the doctor tells you that specifically don't wish boxes because if you lift boxes you might miss carry you you might lose the baby yes

i left the emergency room where home went to sleep woke up with the were waiting for the manager to come in to her about what was going on
and then they explained to her about what the doctor said showed her the paperwork
i told her and told me no heavy lifting on over more than twenty pounds
but my job consistent needs to do heavy lifting
and what did she say
oh goodness
she said a lot of things
my sheets are me demi moore summer somersaults on the stage and non was pregnant running you that
i took up a little gymnasts to me more the actress yes the after i'm not anymore
do you like to see
a more general
you manger said patricia
look i'm sorry your your doctor said you can't let boxes but i once saw me more on television very pregnant
doing acrobatics on a stage and enough and a lot of a lotta nothing she just compare me to be more and so on
demi moore did that on the stage
and if the market do it should be no problem with me work to me more
gospel put it in years
our can do the job then i can go and walk out the door
so i really didn't have a choice though
nearly like is
his place
sweet
i'm pregnant
be careful
i'm just go ahead on the job and do and also do and just take it just had no choice but just
weather the storm

so she just kept going to work she kept lifting those heavy boxes of bread and check in and things were fine for a little while
i was picking that one of those heavy boxes
of chicken rotisserie chicken as the most
and when i lived
this start shooting pain
on my back onto the left and right side and it shut down and it went from way up from my shoulder blade auto down my leg
almost dropped the whole box our feet but i caught myself
and i was heart and soul that i have a muscle spasms
like a seizure in my body
i was taken to the emergency room
they gave me medication and he told me i need for a while
a baby
the doctor was like you shouldn't be doing all this heavy lift and know that from the first visit
but on t shirt kept showing up for work and she's getting bigger and bigger and closer and closer to her due date and she's starting to wonder what she's gonna do when this baby is born
so she goes to her manager
i said
they know when the information in far is leave of absence she gave me a number to call and i apply and
when i got back to work the next day they called me to the office
and there was like well one it's a brain zero attention that we did receive your request
they told me then i was a temporary associate and warm i no longer need not normally my services
it basically let you go yeah

i was so devastated
i was thinking
what am i gonna do
because i was you know a single parent
i had three kids at his baby along the way by nobody gonna hire and seven months pregnant woman
cause of on do there
and everything they ever asked me and do
and when may let me go i was so sad and i was so
i was so how anyone tell when nato in their lending me my services
i was point think was the point i mean the year


the way back
anyone hearing a teacher story would be sympathetic she struggled hard to get a job at walmart it represented a big leap in her career
but i imagine that there are some people who will hear her story and viewed from walmart perspective which is here's a person harder to a job who can no longer do that job and so why should this company continue to employ air
the question of what companies have to do with pregnant workers is for sure and intense debate and one that dates back to the seventies or do you really women including seven promos general electric require fail
i'll do in nineteen seventy six the supreme court ruled that general electric was not discriminating when it didn't offer pregnant women paid leave when they took time off to have children despite offering paid leave to other workers who took time off for other reasons
supreme court ruled an employer does not after a two women and all use or out from work or having babies because it said many women aren't pregnant so how can a policy be discriminatory towards women when many of them are not pregnant and i went out and i have women and men today day
legislation to contract pain
court ruling last week there was a big public outcry and basically people were saying wait a minute this is insane a policy says pregnant women don't get the same accommodations as disabled people
is discriminating against women and so congress passed the pregnancy discrimination act in nineteen seventy eight
oh okay
a
that act said employers if they are accommodating people who are similarly situated to pregnant people they have to accommodate pregnant people
the it
a
so after the supreme court ruled the companies don't have to accommodate pregnant people the way that they do disabled people congress then passes a law saying that they do that's right and it seemed like a win for pregnant women but it didn't settle everything
employers in court said that pregnant women were more like people who got injured off the job employers had an injured anybody off the job and they hadn't made anyone get pregnant either so why should they have to accommodate people like that and so when women took their companies to court the
nice one
but then along comes peggy
actually drove a mini van and carried my packages small letters and a seat next to me and my van pegging young is an early morning driver for u p s
she gets pregnant and she gets the note from her doctor that says my doctor recommended me not left anything over twenty pounds she probably shouldn't lift really heavy boxes and she takes that note to you
yes explained to me that they do not provide light duty for pregnancy
says tough luck
if you can't lift heavy boxes you can't work here basically they said i'll go home tell you no longer magnet the thing is that u yes
didn't respond that way to other people who asked for light duty they accommodated a lot of different kinds of workers who were asking for light duty including people who lost their driver's license because of drunk driving so peggy sues and she loses and loses and loser
and takes her case all the way to the supreme court
finish this running kids twelve twenty six young bruce united parcel service in oral arguments justice ruth bader ginsburg challenges the u layer to provide a single instance in which someone is denied an accommodation
who is not a pregnant person is there an
dispensation in the
condition that was them
to live to any single employee
who was so i know as well
me was
there's not in name providing them that because one was not elicited by the petition it is burn it was in a prima facie case a lawyer draws a blank suggesting that anytime a man had asked for an accommodation they had received it but suddenly when it came to pregnant women
it was treated differently
exactly and offense the kills in fat low new thirteen well i would like to address and that seems to be part of the reason why in two thousand and fifteen the court road six to three in favor of tacky
and what exactly did the supreme court ruling say that yes should have done in this case it said that u p s should have given peggy young light duty they should have found a job for her sitting down they should have found a way
way to accommodate her request because they were accommodating so many other kinds of workers at the time
i'm struck the the gps case sounds very similar to the case of ot show and walmart even done with the fact that they were both asking their employers to not have them lifting heavy boxes while they were pregnant
yeah it's true you know legally they are very similar but the way this played out for a t shirt was that she didn't know the law she didn't have a lawyer at that point she didn't know about peggy young's case and frankly her manager probably didn't either and that's kind of
the reality of working in america today it's not as if you know laws don't exist protecting people it's dead on a day to day basis when in this case you're pregnant you need a job you need the healthcare the paycheck is the best when that you've gotten in a long time and someone tells you know
you can't stop lifting these chickens you're not going to challenge that person i mean it makes absolutely no sense for you at that point you're vulnerable you're pregnant you're expecting another kid and so on a practical level you're at the whim of the people that you're looking at every day and those people might not be lawyers they may not have any
sense of what their obligations are or what your rights are and another thing that makes this complicated is that it's not as if oh teaches managers came right out and said we're firing you because you're pregnant and you're no longer useful are able to do your job they said walmart will no longer been meeting or services and walmart does
disputes that she ever asked for accommodations so the point is this can get squishy this isn't always black and white and when someone loses their job like you know teachers case it's not always one hundred percent clear bed pregnant
see is what did the men

oh sure what happened when you when you left warmer
i was unemployed for a year
i went to struggle
dad and dead
take i'm still in the boat is okay
i'll flip the heavy heavy heavy diversion
i was really really in the dark place i'm couldn't put it see that one teach
but now
i had a new morning then my newborn was diagnosed with blood disorder
it was so much stuff going on in and out of the house
and then i end up getting and jonathan next in january
pain way less than what i was given to own
warmer
grilling
i was to do you have almost the now is that walmart in the job that i started it was like eight dollars
what is your job now
right now i can or asian at a damn rental company
i rent out then

so finally i just found a little bit about your baby
her name's jay
she's full of excitement
she likes to run play at the park the going swimming pool
she's more he likes to do activities
keep herself active she's a firecracker

who leticia thank you very much for your time we really appreciate it
thank you
who
on tomorrow's daily her to of the times investigation finds a different more subtle form of discrimination

here's what else you need hundred on monday the customs and border protection agency said it had temporarily stopped handing over migrant families for criminal prosecution
effectively suspending president trumps zero tolerance policy
the agency said it would no longer refer families to the justice department until it was a shirt that parents can be prosecuted without being separated from their children
the times reports that cause detention centers are filled to capacity the immediate impact of the decision will be the release of many migrant families into the us with a promise to return for a future court date of practice known as catch and release that the president
has strongly criticize
and thousands of illegal aliens are removed every month our immigration judge as a result of procedures in current law including voluntary or new law and an expedited removal just because you don't see a judge doesn't mean you aren't receiving due process at the white house press secretary sarah huckabee sanders to
offended the president's tweet that undocumented immigrants should be returned to their home countries without due process or and appearance before a judge
like as the president
you flight out what we've put out
things that we want to see in in immigration package
months ago for still waiting on congress to give us the ability to do that but under questioning by reporters sander seem to acknowledge that the president tweet was on like to translate into a meaningful policy changes nothing
when faced with that
anything right now
walking around making up walls know because we're at the obama administration were actually trying to enforce the laws that are on the books

that's it
i'm michael barbara
