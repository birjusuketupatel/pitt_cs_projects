
from the new york times on michael world
the
today
last october for us soldiers were ambushed in a remote desert in the share and the question became what was the military doing in africa and who was it fighting five months later the story from louisiana
it's tuesday february twentieth

well
earlier this month i drove for my based in atlanta a few ourself to south georgia
alan blinder is a national reporter for the times when i got into town i went for a drive with ginger russell and her mom years and the city limits an idiot
right now turns out not down
you're talking about
and as we get closer to tombs county georgia i started seeing these red white and blue bows these records that you'd see tied to street signs you'd see on the side of the road
we which want their fake
an outlier i wonder what really happened
is it still address as we get closer to where ginger and a lot of her relatives live hamas sister's house
she has no
in her flag on the front door
these urges people that neighbors were a long time that have their fly mac as saying he's have their rubens and grin and bear on mailbox after mailbox after mailbox this is my cousin katie
yes or no
that's my grandma's house and nobody lives better but they made sure that she got a better on her mailbox
these ribbons went up after ginger his nephew dustin right was killed in the share
work in progress
oh really
and right was a productive south georgia he was born and raised in small towns like santa claus georgia places like lions georgia
i've just had his grandmother at her house everyone knows as a wayne but he called her granny
it
does that was a big guy i mean he was a chubby kid oh
last
arrest records or there's a picture of him in front of an american flag in his army uniform
and everyone i talk to who knew him well said they thought he was having to try really hard to be serious
never figure that during the big
it is didn't will call it
looked goofy and
posted you just talk about military
you know
his dad was in the military so was his mom and the family can trace its lineage in the us military back to the war eight thousand and twelve
so he joined the military in two thousand and twelve very much following in his family his footsteps
but really from the word go he was telling his friends and family that he wanted to be among the army's best so he goes to training in georgia
does the army infantry school and he also does the army airborne school and eventually in two thousand and fourteen the army doesn't need of him as a great
one
okay
the
i'm at night
somewhere so distance home from one of his deployments and he and some of his buddies decides take a trip to the carolina country music fest and myrtle beach south carolina back alley of an outcry three it out
and i kept on he meets a woman named jenna the concert was like on the beats the last satisfying you know as area
and that song that was what i told you
i and from i the out
like i had on it
and i write a lot of liquid in carriers and i i said hey
hi
yeah i there
we dance and
it aired korea as a can't stand that i'm an adult as
it was like nasa call now me
my little nothing town too
man that manning
neither knowing he is
he's a schoolteacher in philadelphia he's a soldier signed fort bragg north carolina
but they're talking all the time they're visiting each other
he told his grandmother before he left that he had met the woman he wanted to marry and then it's happen
point it was coming
throughout their relationship they know he's a special forces soldier and another deployment is getting closer and closer it was time for said phyllis
his or her role
he didn't say much about what he was doing it at all
you failed to do
he said his family pictures of these beautiful landscapes and he told them it was the military version of a vacation
they all live
just paperwork and then he leaves for africa a country called nice share which is in west africa stadium
this as
it's raining africa or any skills
it's as if they were going into the as well
it's strange that us
and least it's as though
oh did you know i'm a diffuse and
yeah to pronounce year in a weird look at math see exactly where they know he was deployed to one of the combat zones they'd seen on tv somewhere like iraq or afghanistan
and the risk of his work just weren't all that clear to folks
it was a normal day harass you hit me up
i got as though
once time and money
at three thirty
october third
he told me that
they were a genius plans and they were going you now returned to that the battery
i love their levity and darling
aren't you as soon as i get it
it's families interception and a cleaner again
of the jam
so it was about midnight when two soldiers arrived dusted grandmother's house
don't they
he's laying on that
and his uniform came in
say these words
i'm poor wrong
obama long have been desk who have desk and you have has look you have this me

the tennis shocked when justin right as killed and when his body was brought back from africa
people lined the streets of the small town
they had to have his funeral
at high school football stadium
because it was the only place where they could fit the crowd that wanted to come

that's when members of his family started to wonder what was going on in africa in make apathy anything and lane
he was ever there the
how's it daily invested in it
say more that he needed to say it wasn't that he was intentionally keeping things feminist
there was not as close to dale said
i guess that's why i said to stop some members of his family still want a simple explanation of why american forces need to be a nice year and the first place
however with bush
united states that have been over there
and what is he doing in africa because you don't think of humanitarian effort and what you do this way
did take the world was it because of grassroots who was fighting
i busy fighting

when we come back what happened anywhere

we'll be back

i'm walking inside a military prison
northwestern nice hair
a woman who is
beating i think mullet
that's
what many call knocked covers a sex for the times me a couple of days ago i got back from me
where i went to ask the question what happened to these for american soldiers who were killed in an ambush in a forgotten and remote corner of africa
in a word that i think very few people understand
the pentagon has told the american people about what has happened has shifted numerous times they began by saying one version of events that then changed it changed again so wanted to get on the ground and i wanted to speak to the people who had actually witnessed in this that's the local
okay direct eye witnesses to what happened to think that he's willing to me
the most difficult thing was to try to speak to actual members of the terror group that carried it out
this guy hassan
they get permission to speak to him is going to help is a lot about the
ever
and i was able to speak to two in a prison in colonial era
a terrorist in area

and what did you find initiator can you start me the morning of the ambush so the morning of the ambush is october fourth i'm actually going to start one day earlier october third and it was at around six a m october third that a mixed patrol of american any sharing and troops left
the gates of their base the americans included queen brace as well as other troops and they set off on what they had planned to be a little risk routine patrol a classic hearts and minds exercise and what does a routine patrol
what the missionary and troops told me who were in the americans is they were told it's an earlier huddle in french that means go out and come back so they set off at six o'clock in the morning they spent all day they stop and villages they meet with local community leaders in the late afternoon they began heading home and they're basically a couple dozen miles away from the
of the compound when the convoy stops and their tools that that their mission has changed and what is the nutrition the order that they've gotten is that american intelligence agencies have honed in on a signal from an electronic device belonging to a suspected terrorist name to shuffle they've identified
what they think is his camp where he's hiding out in the far north of the terrain where they're searching and they want them to go and back up another american special forces counterterrorism raid as they go went to raid that cap
and this is where things start to fall apart
they go into the camp and they find nobody but they do find traces of the terror group they find ammunition they find the tire tracks of motorcycles that have sped off so they had somehow been alerted and had left the camp site before the americans got there
now the irony in all of this is that we're supposed to be the high risk think the raid on this camp site and they got there and they were find nothing happened they spent some time there and as the sun was rising they were heading home
and that's the real tragedy here because what happens next happens on an unplanned stop in a village they were not supposed to stop him but they've been out now for more than twenty four hours
in the desert they're out of quarter
the first village on their way back is a place called tongue tango and they stop at a well to fill up the water boils at this point the village chief has learned that there there and he walks out to meet them he tells them that there are several said children in the village and could they help them so as part of their hearts and minds
campaign they do carry supplies that are specifically meant to be distributed to villagers so they take out the medicine but they have and they start distributing add to the people that
but something's not quite right it's at this point in time that several members of the unit at tell us that they start noticing that the looks on the faces of the letters are not welcoming even menacing they notice groups of young men gathering they noticed several people on motorcycles speed off as if they're going to pass the message to somebody
and most of all they noticed but the village chief keeps on trying to delete them every time they get ready to leave he seems to have some other question or some other reason for them to stay they finally decide to leave the get on to the backs of their trucks and not even two hundred yards past the village they began taking her
heavy and deadly fire this is the this is the amish
the pentagon told us repeatedly that they did not leave the soldiers behind the new york times acquired the body camera footage of one of the for that americans and that footage it tells a very different story

in the footage you see three of the for americans could die on this day
and what you see is that they are outgunned and overrun by this terrorist group and that nobody comes to their aid
he specifically see a black s u v which is where staff sergeant bryant black staff sergeant jeremiah johnson and staff sergeant dusting right find themselves
one of them is at the wheel two of them have emerged from the car and they're trying to use the tasty of the car for cover their shooting over the hood they're trying to hide behind a wheel well
brian block is the first to go down
his colleagues rush to help him they pull him back by the strap of has flak jacket and try to bring him back behind the wheel of the car there then taking positions trying to keep firing at the enemy but the enemy is right upon them
and the surviving to just start running
and they're running and running you're seeing it through the viewfinder of the soldier who's behind the first they're running past shrubs they're running past tree is they're running past little hubs
the next filter jeremiah johnson his head
and you see him fall and roll
you see his colleague staff sergeant doesn't right stop running and take a position next to basically a desert trouble and try to hold off the attackers
one you a soldier one us know virtually no protection with no protection and is behind this bush that is so wispy that you literally see the branches of ricocheting from the force of his weapon
and he holds them off for at least a man and a half possibly longer but he's just one person and they descend on the soldier who was down they opened fire on him and then they turn their fire on sergeant right


okay so now we know what happened to surgeon ride and these three other soldiers but i think a lot of people including surgeon rights family don't really understand what the soldiers were doing in africa what were they doing there
nice air is now one of the battle france in the war on terror very much so in the war on the islamic state africa is where i actually started investigating tear this is where i began on the speed in two thousand and twelve when i was covering molly and weird this particular group
that goes on to attack the for soldiers began as an affiliate of al qaeda and so i won't explain to you the context of terror in this region
since around two thousand and twelve i've been following one particular guy who became a leader of al qaeda in the street and he then breaks off and creates his own group and he begins to actively recruit from a group of people who for traditional herders and no manager and who have one specific
france they are herders in an area where the government does not exist and they are being routinely attacked by armed bandits who are taking their cows and their cameras and who are killing their meant that made them extremely vulnerable to recruitment because this al qaeda group comes and offers to arm them an offer some protection and at the same time
princeton into to hurt us
so doesn't very much seem like a terror group just seems like a local government doing what these people most made which is protecting their life what exactly and you have to imagine that in this part of the world
if you're hurt or your animals it's it's like your four one k you know somebody comes and takes a camel that's like somebody liquidating your bank account great there is no other well they don't have bank accounts they don't have cash on them
this was an ongoing issue in this area and this one time al qaeda group moves and and by two thousand and fifteen a pledge allegiance to the islamic state so these herders yeah who wanted to protect their animals yes
there now pledging wales you to us
it took to isis exactly
so we're in africa fighting the islamic state or does that actually look like right so on the one hand with there to contain the threat these groups are thing and growing and taking territory and our presence fair is attempting to block that and howard
during that is by training advising and assisting local troops to fight the terror threat themselves and i know that this might be hard for listeners especially in america to understand but having lived in this area for seven years i have seen over and over again that when these to hottest groups go in local troops basically just rip off
their uniforms and run the this has been a trend adolescents at a fan of fear so the mission is train assist advise were trying to build up these local forces so that they can do it themselves so that we can in a way disengage and no longer be the forward element in these fights and it's a word
while go but it's a really long ground it's very hard to get these troops up to the level to do what they need to do so has this us mission in africa has it remained focused on containment or has it started to morph it's morphed i mean i think that what tonga tango shows is you have a putter
all that's going out there essentially training the nigerians who were with them and doing this very low rescue no interaction with local villagers and suddenly they're given an order to go and raid a suspected terror calf and if the americans who are in the lead their it's not an insurance that's no longer just containing the threat that's taking a much more proactive role going out into the
field and carrying out an from submission to try to to stop the track

here's the thing that is puzzling about the tongue at attack or soak so you have for american soldiers who are count which is obviously horrible but that would have been a blip on the radar in the days when where and polluter right in the days when we were actively fighting in afghanistan there are incidents in those two wars
where dozens of american troops died the same day and helicopter crashes that were taken down by enemy fire for some reason there is much less appetite and much less willingness to expand american blood on the continent then in the middle east
and i think that has to do with the perception of africa in the minds of people were africa is associated as a place of humanitarian catastrophe is of these endless what i think people assume our ethnic wars and where i think people think it's not our business to be there but what i know from having covered
these areas is that these terror groups specifically al qaeda and isis
their fire is aimed at us from africa they are not bear to kill local people they are there to kill symbols of western governments and specifically america which have seen as their enemy number one

what you're describing is a profound tension this way in our priorities it seems like united states of course wants to keep its soldiers safe in a place like new share my and wants to monitor and regularly and show the kind of restraint hard to do
do that but is it more dangerous if the united states is not in a place like new share and not being as active an offensive as required as does a visual and war on terrorism require the us to be there and to conduct itself in whatever
always are required to eliminate thread this is a part of the world that is incredibly of our town that has enormous and governed lawless spaces the very kind of spaces but these groups thrive i saw half of the country of mali in two thousand and twelve in a matter of days i'm not exaggerating in a matter of days be over
run by al qaeda as a result of local troops not being able to hold their ground
so i think there is an argument to be made for our presence in africa but if we're going to be there
i think that measures need to be taken to avoid the tragedy that happened on october fourth the troops that were there were sent in without close air support they were not properly armored and they weren't and to what turned out to be a very dangerous situation
that that was evident if you just looked at the statistics of how many attacks had happened there and yet they weren't prepared
and in my interviews with the missionary and soldiers who survived this ambush what they taught me is that they thought the americans had this under control
they think of the americans as all powerful they thought that they were going into an area and the fact that they didn't have the right weapons okay the americans would take care of them
and the profound sense that they were left with is one of abandonment not just of themselves but also of the for american soldiers who died and hunger tongue that
they were left in the hands of dna

thank you with me

here's what else you need to notice
ten off
on one as student protested in front of the white house demanding stricter gun control the trump administration said it was open to supporting a bipartisan senate bill that would improve the federal background check system for gone buyers
the bill introduced by form of have against and for democrats does not make it harder to buy a god but instead offer incentives to government workers to keep the system up to date with the kind of criminal and mental health records that would prevent our guns
millions of those records are missing from the background check system according to the national rifle association which supports the

that's it for today
