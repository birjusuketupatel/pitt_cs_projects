
from the new york times ah michael this is day

in a combative opening day of the nato summit in brussels
president trouble when after germany calling it a captive of russia and calling other member countries delinquent where his frustration is coming from
it's thursday july troll
michael those story of nato really stores with three countries the united states the soviet union and nazi germany david sanger is a national security correspondent for the times now the us in the soviet of course we're allies of convenience against germany
an all came very ugly and as soon as victory in europe was declared in april nineteen forty five
and at that moment the big concern moved away from a nazi germany they could threaten europe
true or soviet union they could do so
so right after the war was over
there was a great fear that vulnerable countries that had been initially taken over by the nazis
denmark belgium could all for under the informed the communist
so over time the us came around the idea that the soviet union had to be contained
a generation which will
hey
oh man
and harry truman want to congress in nineteen forty seven and laid that out
he said i believe it must be the powers in the united states
we are resisting an subjugated by minorities by outside pressures and that was really the beginning of vulnerable international order the idea that the united states was going to be a guarantor of freedom around the world
so how did the us actually put that into practice
or almost as soon as crewman ordered those words a series of crises came up the election which last almost two full days is held under the watchful eyes or three hundred the soviets were meddling in the hi am a white friends in nineteen forty eight the united states also metal
those are all western powers and russia a jerk
strong pressure czechoslovakia in nineteen forty is an established democracy the soviets overthrew a democratically elected government in trickles kevorkian on february informed that the alternative is civil war and the web unmistakable threat of invasion former soviet union if he does now
capitulate president banish accepts a communist cabinet
and then of course june nineteen forty two and one half million people cut off isolated from the outside world the soviets cut off all access to west berlin
i'm on our home run back or no longer be brought from overland and the united states ended up mounting what became call the berlin airlift the people in the western sector
learn to live with the sight and sound of these giant for engine aircraft
but the past year this has been there only hope with flu in supplies to keep the people of west berlin alive
many ways to keep this one little haven
democracy alive as well and david how does the us respond to this aggression from the silly
all story in nineteen forty eight the truman administration realize that they were going to actually need the put together some kind of military alliance
if anything day
if if anything ever to appear to the way
paper of around our freedom and are paid by april nine nineteen forty nine harry truman had gathered together ministers from around europe and they stood in the state department auditorium and signed this alliance about how the signing of the north atlantic
pretty and that created nader trading shall enter into as between the gate which have ratified looting or ratification and where exactly is nato well it's basically just a military alliance to defend europe against what was the soviet union
i'm an automatic treaty was signed by norway denmark the netherlands belgium maximum aren't in italy portugal
united kingdom on camera managed but the key piece of nato is something called article five and its founding document and that basically says
shorn to stand together against aggression against one one day an attack against all our attack on one country is an attack on oh and the idea was to create some sense of deterrence so that the soviets knew that if they tried to pick off even the weakest member
nato in europe they were going to be fighting everyone including the united states
this is a military alliance based in europe created by the us designed to rebuff a single enemy the soviet union guess that was the goal i say without hesitation
that i am absolutely convinced that nato provides the best
it's not the of peace you know michael there was this cheeky line early in nato's history from general hastings is may who was the first secretary general of nato he said the purpose of nader was to keep the soviet union out the americans in and the germans down
leaders of the communist meet in warsaw to sign the treaty which is too late
and the so is respond by creating their own sort of nader was called the warsaw pact and communist nations that were under soviet influence the poland bulgaria czechoslovakia hungry of course east germany
and they were a military alliance of the room so you saw these two groups of military allies facing off against each other
most at all times maintain its strength as long as the possibility of a great challenges
else can we say that piece for which the peoples of the world
and how does this new organization nato operate day to day has it funded has it function
there isn't a completely separate nato military force of any kind they don't have their own on instead they pull together the military forces of each of the member countries and over time they weren't haven't trained together and put their dark room together but the whole for is that they just get org
just under one european supreme commander appointed by the united states and of course it's the us has always been at the core of nato because it had the biggest forces it had the most money and it had the most sophisticated intelligence and of course
britain the united states and letter france had nuclear weapons and the whole idea was that if you pull these together you create a pretty fearsome deterrent and in fact that's pretty well worth what do you mean that it worked the think about all the wars that didn't happen we never saw
nuclear war broke out in europe though it was threatened frequently in the fifties and sixties and of course the soviets knew that the united states was keeping missiles in turkey nuclear weapons in belgium that in other words forces were forward deployed
and under some nato control or could be moved to nato control fairly quickly and that made them think twice
so the original idea of nato which is the symbolism of all of these countries kind of locking arms militarily and assuring each other that they will go to war to protect one another this has its desired goal of keeping the soviet union at bay
absolutely it plain old worked and it was in retrospect a pretty genius invention it's probably truman's greatest single legacy so nato is working and the soviet union falls in the nineteen eighties so it seems like that would be
the a highly logical time for need a which was created to protect europe against the soviet union to dissolve absolutely i mean that question came up very quickly after nine hundred and eighty nine and really dominated debate in george h w bush administration as the soviet union
who's breaking apart and the question was just a very basic one which is do when the baby anymore
we want we don't have this huge hoping soviet union with the power to expand across europe in anything russia which inherited the soviet union's nuclear weapons and all of its problems appear to be franking blue the rationale for nader
is falling apart and there were a lot of people saying it should simply despair that there was just no political reason any more and no military reason to hold onto it
but that's not what happened
who the back

david what happens to nato after the soviet union false
or rather than this band michael it actually expanded many of the former soviet republics who were suddenly finding themselves independent poland and hungary the czech republic all the countries that made up what many the countries that made up the old warsaw pact or is suddenly thinking
themselves they didn't want to be alone they wanted to be part of a west and so they applied for membership the nato and the big question was should nato let them and even if their wrist making refer paranoid and how does nato and the us it's lead sponsor respond to the risk
sire to join they were debates about individual countries than there were some debate with basically said if the russians came and knocked off this tiny little country like estonia latvia lithuania
we really go to war would we really invoke article five to come to their defense
but in the end people decided that the symbolism of having old members of the warsaw pact change teams and come over to nato was worth it even if their military contribution who's pretty tiny and what does russia do in response to this expansion of nato
a group that existed originally to rebuff the old soviet union will initially not much into what a mere prudent became president
and he viewed it as a humiliation he viewed it as an effort to go steal from russia have a core of the old soviet union and he was looking for an opportunity we get even
couldn't realized that article five was something that will get involved if he did a full military attack but he have the money or we we were forces to sustain such an attack so here they come up with a really targeted kind of disruption some way
of harassing these countries some way of undercutting their institutions some way of making people no longer calf
governments without actually bringing about an invocation of article five first he started rebuilding his nuclear forces and then he started in with the cyber attacks
very day one against estonia estonia faced a major crisis in two thousand and seven when it became the first country to experience a massive cyber attack which took down as during his email bank and newspaper servers another very big one against georgia in two thousand and eight paving the way for military action russia attack george's
computer infrastructure crippling the country to country is that of course have been all part of the soviet union he did a series of attacks on ukraine not a nato member but he realized that the fact that they weren't made a member meant that nato was not going to be tempted to come to their defense and he used it
as for his petri dish the place where is the could test out a number of ways of disrupting a society the russians are fully aware that microsoft products like all software can be used as weapons in cyber warfare he brought down the electric power grid in ukraine twice
and of course he metal the bid in there a white as well
look at what russia has done so far there are accused of having interfered or having try to interfere in german french british and us elections there is some evidence that he tried to metal and the breadth of in britain he attempted and failed to meddle in the last french collection he's been trying
in germany and of course vital he made his strongest effort to meddle in elections here in the united states in two thousand and sixteen using many of the technique that he had perfected against nato and other eastern european countries them former soviet state
president trump is slamming some of america's allies staging during a high stakes nato summit in brussels okay so here we are now in two thousand and eighteen and leaders from the nato countries have just gathered for a summit in brussels and president
trump is continuing to go after the military alliance what exactly is president trumps objection to it or president from has had several objections to nato over the years his first one is that it's really expensive and many countries are not paying what they should
frankly many countries
was a tremendous amount of money for many years back
are delinquent
and his second one is he doesn't believe that the united states gets very much out of these this were protecting germany were protecting french were protecting everybody
we're paying a lot of money to protect this has been going on for decades he's simply believes it costs a lot of the benefits to us are hard to measure and probably negative and is there any merit to his argument that the us is giving more than it gets when it comes to nato oh my phone
certainly a merit to the argument that the united states gives the word nato and the european countries don't sacrifice as much in their own defense
and that's not an argument that is new to down trough our freedom isn't free
we've got to be willing to pay for the assets the personnel the training
that's required to make sure that we have a credible
nato force barack obama used to make that argument and that's why nato countries got pressed to contribute more to their military forces during obama has time so there is nothing new and there's certainly nothing wrong in down trumps fundamental complaint
what is different is that president from is the first american president to say if this doesn't change on my terms i mean i've come to your defense when that moment cause i may nor article five wow and trump is actually said that president trump said to me and maggie haldeman during the present
central campaign when i asked him why he come to the defense of a small former soviet states estonia or something if they were attacked by russia he said the first thing i would do is check and see whether they fully paid up in what he calls me though
dues put what the rest of the world moses just they're standing on defense but he was essentially saying that if they call the fire department before the truck was sent out someone was them i woke up and see whether or not they pay their taxes no one's ever heard and american president talk like that or for that in a time of a
urgency he might think about not committing american defenses
a nato ally did from everything you said a lot of these original nato countries and later nato countries rush to the organization seeking defense from first to soviet union and now russia and still live under the protective umbrella of nato so if they're not willing to
to pay the amount of money that the us expects of them isn't that a legitimate grievance on the part of president trump given that they still benefit from nato he's certainly got a very legitimate point as previous presidents have that they need to go carry their own way
now their response to this is hey we've not only carried our own way
we've come in and vote article five to help you in fact the only time article five was ever in vote in nato's history was right after nine eleven
and then nato countries when in with the united states some in large numbers and some and pretty small numbers into both iraq and afghanistan
now their publics came to later on conclude that the united states had used the nine eleven attacks as a way to justify a truly unwise war in iraq
and the power going into iraq that been pretty poisonous to their future contributions to their defense budgets and it is made them think twice about the wisdom of simply letting the united states drag them around as nato decide what conflicts
enter and which ones not too as nato leaders arrived for that two day summit in brussels president rocks the alliance with the accusation that germany is called totally controlled by russia
say when germany makes a massive oil and gas with russia
they are supposed to be guarding against russia and here it goes out and pays billions and billions of dollars a year to fresh air so we started by talking about these three countries the us russia and germany as being the three countries that explain the beginnings of nato and i'm struck that the news out
of the nato summit today was the trump was going after germany saying that it was under the control of russia germany is totally controlled by russia because they're getting from sixty to seventy percent of their energy from russia and a new pipeline live in what was that about that seems like the autumn
mid insult to deliver at a nato summit
it was the ultimate and home may have had more to do with his differences with angela merkel the transfer germany then he did with any true belief but the core of the argument was germany gets an overwhelming amount of natural gas the fuel with keeps it warm in the winter
from russia and it's about building a new pipeline that will bring them him directly from russia and his basic argument is how can you argue that you're standing up against russia
when you are funding russia russia is overly dependent on its energy exports and when you're vulnerable to the russians who can simply turn off the vow and what was the reaction from germany
it led many to question whether or not president trump fundamentally believes in the nato mission
and that's a big question
i was a conference of europeans last weekend where i had never before heard people question whether or not they should go forward thinking with the united states would be the core of a few tornado
and for the first time i heard them debating could we continue with the nato that didn't have the us at the center and one in which the united states wasn't the garment and voice in defence policy potent and trump are to meet in helsinki finland on july sixteen just days after the president
the nato summit with america's closest allies the president predicted meeting don't quote maybe the easier
of others that dance he has scattered than strep david i want to ask you about what's happening right after this nato meeting and which seems particularly curious given the history that you just alamein for us right after this meeting ends in brussels president trump is going to meet with prudent what do you make
of this timing
the problem isn't the meeting michael the problem in their mind is donald trump's message if he was leaving nato to stand up to him and say we're not going to tolerate the meddling and elections and we're not going to tolerate the continuing occupation of crimea the harassment of ukraine
that was his message i think they'd be fine with the meeting happening right entered nato their problem is they don't actually believe that donald trump is going to stand up to put him and they're somewhat horrified at the imagery of him beating are publicly on television against his allies
and then embracing an autocrat who put dissidents reporters to death than is increasingly cracking down on his own country
so it seems like we find ourselves in a really interesting place where the country that nato was formed to protect against his and it's most aggressive in decades and the country that created nato is seemingly the least committed it's ever been
it's pretty rare try running their at the moment that we weren't that the cold war may not be over with it may just be entering a different kind of games that the united states
is questioning the very premise on which it created nato
and that the russians have been successful in sewing more and more discord throughout europe and hoping exaggerate each of these schisms but no one's exaggerated those isms more than president from himself
not by questioning whether the nato nations are contributing a mouse that's a perfectly legitimate question to raise been questioning whether or not he would even stick with the alliance and that's the central issue
and
david thank you very much thank you mike


here's what else you can each hundred just
a little one percent worse united states actual numbers a four point two percent a much larger gdp so i think that's
the times reports that behind closed doors on wednesday to president trump suggested that nato allies increase their military budgets not to the two percent of their economies that they've previously pledged to one but to four percent a figure that nieto secretary general sought to downplay
well our focus on what do you have agreed that we read read to be committed to the pledge reason defense political person
let's start with that
so where our way to go but the president did sign on to a nato declaration emphasizing strength and burden sharing within the alliance and harshly criticizing russia for annex inclined
that's it
i'm like obama
