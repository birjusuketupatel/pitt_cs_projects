nice piece

today
the coming battle between trumps
and the state of california
and james comb goes on national television to call the president a danger to the nation
it's monday april sixty
ladies and gentlemen
i've come to feel great affection for the papers of the world
because they've always been so welcoming to me it it is is a body building gym in was a movie star private citizen or as the governor of the great state of california so the standards that we have today in the united states are among strictest in a strange and in the world and
oh that largely to the state of california cool davenport covers energy and the environment for the times well ladies and gentlemen something remarkable is beginning to do something revolutionary something historic and transformative
let me give you some background back in the early two thousand that state of california was going to vary a corrective only move ahead of the rest of the country and put these very tight car emissions standards and place that would be stronger than the rest of the country we're doing is is changing them
panic
they're being the way and encouraging the future so the new standards would force automakers to make the it all that get an average of fifty four point five miles per gallon by two thousand and twenty five that's almost double what they were when the standards were put in place so that's pretty ambitious very
ambitious
crow how is it bad
one state california has the ability to set its own emissions standards i tend to think of these things as national have one standard for all these days so eager about great
lamb
maintaining an improving environmental quality under the terms of nineteen seventy clean area of new laws to protect the environment
and we are mobilize the power public i'm from california especially allay had some of the worst air and the country the worst smog and the country here we are you should be able to see the mountains you should be able to see our beautiful city with it can't you can't see anything california got a special waiver that stronger air pollution standards than the rest of the can
he has that was what was necessary to clean up their alley smog and clean up some of the most polluted air in the country which at the time as in california that all of our cars were operating efficiently we would have a significant reduction and all of this pollution and junk in the air that's what we need to do
and so ever since there has been this waiver for california to sat tighter clean air standards than the rest of the country
porn is a very powerful state a very powerful blows the men they do something it has consequences
and here's what we're doing for in is mobilizing good in a larger financial aid and political divide deal with climate change

so what ends up happening is there a couple of years between two thousand and four and she thousand and nine were the standards are considered and debate in and put into place and california but they haven't yet been implemented and the auto industry is totally freaked out
they are terrified that the standards are going to be fully implemented in california and they are going to face what so many automakers have described as sort of their worst nightmare where there's one set of standards for the state of california and a different set of standards for the rest of the country and they're going to have to create two different kinds of cars for these to die
markets and how giant is the market in california california market is huge it's about thirty percent of the entire us auto market it's like all of the ways in which he manufacturing your product you have to go into your factories and make two entirely different kinds of the same product automakers just saw this as a logistical and
financial nightmare and they were desperate to come up with some kind of wage our faces and of course what they wanted was for the federal government to revoke this waiver that california has so there wouldn't be two different standards governor schwarzenegger had a different idea
what was the day good good news
from washing though governor schwarzenegger is ideal as this morning as spoke with carol browner lose the president's advisor on climate change to work with the federal government after the election of president obama to take the california standards and instead make a national the goals to serve one national stand there will rapidly
increase fuel efficiency without compromising safety this was something that obama really wanted to do because this was a major climate change policy that i want to applaud california governor schwarzenegger and into california delegation for their extraordinary leadership
they have led the way on this as a of and so many other efforts to protect the environment and how to the car companies respond to the prospect of stricter national standards not just in california but suddenly being adopted potentially by the president across country
this wasn't ideal for the car company is it wasn't exactly what they wanted but just at the moment that this was happening that proponents of district your standard the state of california and the obama administration had a lot of leverage we can and muslim that we will not let our auto industry simply vanish because
federal government had just given an eighty billion dollar bailout to the big three auto companies who are on the verge of bankruptcy i'm talking about as using our existing legal structure as a tool that with the backing of the us government the make it easier for general motors and chrysler to quickly clear away all that
that are wearing them down so that they can get back on their feet onto a path to success
so if they're option was to separate standards or wine stricter standards that was the least worst of the options and all these forces came together to create these strict new standards based on the california standards so the auto companies buckle and they to these national standards yes but with
one condition
and this is really important
sad we would like to be able to go back in two thousand and seventeen
and they specifically chose that year because obama will definitely no longer be an office we would like to build in to these strict regulations the ability to go back in two thousand and seventeen and reopen and if that turns out that it's too difficult for us to meet them we would like what they called and offered
amp the ability to go back and reconsider the regulations and loosen them or a week and then if we can show that they have been to onerous to the plant else planted a last onset clause that might make these standards expire that would make it legal for another administration to go back and and tinker with them and and can
then president donald trump delivers remarks at a rally in detroit michigan on his plan to boost the us auto industry and job creation
it is truly great to be back here in michigan
the automakers are ready and waiting for this moment with in the first few weeks after president trump is inaugurated this o's of the big three automakers had a visit with him in the oval office in the very first thing that they asked for a wise to revisit these fuel economy standards
is that they're too onerous they're forcing us to build all these electric cars consumers don't want to buy them this technology is too expensive and soon after that that has also wonderful to be here with the leaders workers engineers
and suppliers afford and feared chrysler general motors has an inch and visit ed and automaker in detroit where the announced that we're going to do this i'm sure you've all heard the big news that we're going to work or the cafe standards so you can make cars in america again
have american automakers make the car as americans want to buy this big announcement there is more beautiful say an american made car no more
so the administrator got her start preparing to do the legal paperwork to file their legal documentation required to actually go in and rollback these regulations so we knew that was coming and we also started hearing that there would be a big and if
media flashy shelly media announcement
further the illustration announcing today another big rollback of obama era environmental i know why the trump administration could challenge california is ambitious clean energy goal the administration rolling barack obama era fuel standards proof says the if he is working with the appropriate emission standards
established under the obama administration are too high then he wouldn't tell us what was happening or where is happening or anything we heard sorted through other sources but they were playing announcement at this chevy dealership in suburban virginia and then like midnight the night before we heard that the announcement
with off even though the policy was still going to happen and then they said they were gonna do it at that sort of closed door announcement actually just at the offices so what actually happened at the last minute there were some automakers and auto dealers that we're starting to get cold feet about this announcement when they
started to hear what the administration appears to have in mind which is a very aggressive bad since overall back i've heard even a number that's been talked about is rolling them back forty percent well they could end up in exactly the situation that they hadn't wanted in the first place which is two different markets if they roll back the nash
standard in california is allowed to keep its legal waiver for its own cleaner standards that is the nightmare scenario for automakers and so you know one person i talked to one expert said they're like the dog that caught the car wait a minute why do i do now is this really what i wanted to car dealerships and car companies
all worried that the trump administration will go too far in the process and upsetting california creating a scenario where there would again be this tension between california and it standards and the rest of the country and their standards that is logistically their worst nightmare in general it's pretty
consistent that industry
doesn't want regulation but even more than they don't like regulation they don't like uncertainty industries will say that's even worse we want to know what the ground rules are so we can make long term investments and if we don't know the ground rules it's a lot harder to invest in what we're going to do in the future the uncertainty hurts worse hurts industries hirst invest
months and probably hurts the economy worse than clearly defined regulations
why would the trunk of injuries and it's period
why would a rollback these emissions standards beyond what the auto industry is comfortable with and potentially rile up the state of california and injure the very industry that these or intended to assist hasn't and tramp himself as the great
the regulator of these the american industry
american cars may travel the road
american players will sort of the skies and american ships will patrol the seas built in
and he loves especially to talk about rolling back regulations on sort of these iconic american industries like coal mining or automakers we want more cars made in the u s a and going in comparison to be john i think with the terrorists as well
no he said he's created these huge tariffs and some of these american companies and american industries are saying well wait a minute this actually might not help us you know it's a lot more complex the nuance than just slapping on some terrorists that's a lot more complex and nuanced than just rolling back these regulations and i do think that the
president wants to help the auto industry but it does seem that some of the nuance of that messaging perhaps as been lost
so where does all this leave us is sounds like california still holds a lot of the cards in this situation could california scott all this plan to roll back emission standards pretty dramatically by the white house
well they can't scan the plans to roll back the national regulation
the white house absolutely can just do that the question is can the white house force california to comply with the new lower and so we will see the answers to this unfold probably in the next few months
there might be a deal in the offing were california and the federal government would work together for a very very slight loosening of the standards but california is government particularly under its current governor jerry brown is very aggressively environmentally focused they have no problem clashing
with the trump administration in fact i think sometimes they seem to delight in it
and the tramp administration seems to feel the same way and i have no problem clashing with california and they are very very focused on an aggressive deregulatory agenda so if their new numbers are way way way lower than the obama numbers more than ten twenty thirty percent they will pretty much have to
who do illegal failing to revoke california waiver to a stronger standard california will jump right back with a countersuit so we'll see that legal fight unfold
and then the question of whether or not california i can keep its own tighter standard or not i think we'll go before the supreme court probably in the next year so
what would these rollbacks that the president is pursuing look like for the auto industry and for the consumers who buy cars eventually it will leave the market where it is if the standards were to stay and play as we would see a pretty aggressive transition away from gas guzzlers into words
cars and ideally technological breakthroughs where you can have an electric or hybrid or fuel efficient se ve day
roll back the standards essentially we won't see that progression we won't see that evolution will just sort of see things remain the same so the air wouldn't get any dirtier it just wouldn't get any cleaner yeah i wouldn't get any cleaner but you know greenhouse gases would continue to trap heat in the atmosphere know the planet would keep getting hotter
her
pero thank you very much appreciated thank you always a pleasure
on
mulberry bush


thanks
you were the president is unethical
on tethered to the truth
his donald trump unfit to be president
this would not in the way i often hear people talk about a boy who stuff but him being mentally incompetent early stages of dementia strikes me as a person of above average intelligence
who's truck in conversations and knows what's going on i don't think he's medically unfit mother whose moral room for improvement
on sunday night former director james komi gave his first interview since his firing as he begins to publicize his memoir which is scheduled to be released on tuesday a person who she is moral equivalence and church who talks about and treats women like the pieces of me
who lives cards to live a motors big and small and insists the murder people believe that a person's not fit to be president
on moral grounds that's not a policy statement him i don't care what your views are on goes on immigration or taxes
something more important than a should you know it almost and that is our president must embody respect and here to the values are the core of his country the most important bring truth this person who was not able to do that he is morally on food to be president the interview with a b c news is george stephanopoulos is to first
have a weeks long media blitz that amounts to a remarkable public saw by a former high ranking government official on a sitting president displayed the deep concerns he expressed about the president who me said he did not want to see the president forced out of office if you're right what is
the remedy should donald trump mph
impeachment is a is a question of law
trucked and politics and so that will be determined by people go new citizen you have a judgment auto give you a stranger i hope not
because i think impeaching and removing him from office would let the american people off the hook and have something hope and indirectly that i believe their duty bound to do directly people in this country to stand up and go to the voting booth and vote their values will fight about guns will fight about taxes will thought about all those other things down the road
road but you cannot have as president so someone who does not reflect the values that i believe republicans treasure and democrats treasure and independents treasure that is the core of this country that's our foundation console impeachment in a way with short circuit that
so in a series of tweets center before the interview was aired president term repeatedly attacked corey calling him a slime ball and a liar and claimed that cool me will could go down as the worst
f b i director in history by far

hughes what else you need to another
are there any consequences for a patrons russia and iran who continue to protect him
so let's say you will feed that russian sanctions will be coming down secretary nature and will be announced goes on monday if he has already on sunday the troop administration said it would impose new sanctions against russia to punish it for enabling syria to use chemical weapons against civilians
they will go directly to any sort of companies that were dealing with equipment related to us and chemical weapons shoes and so i think everyone is going to feel at at this point i think everyone knows that we send a strong message and our hope is that they listen to it
the sanctions follow american led airstrikes on friday
which struck syrian government facilities linked to chemical weapons
and are meant to signal that the u s pulled booth syria and its allies russia and iran responsible for the chemical attacks good on sunday serious president bush sure oh sod publicly celebrated his partnership with russia during a meeting with russian law me
acres in damascus assad priest russia for shooting down many of the us missiles launched at syria in friday's attack

that's it for the deal on michael mobile
