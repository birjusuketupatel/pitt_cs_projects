
from the new york times on michael barbara
is that
today
new that is challenging the popular portrait of the trump voted and revealing why it's the trump voter we don't talk about who may determine the outcome of the mit
it's friday august him
can tell us about this poll and why you're interested it's a pretty novel survey so most polls you'd call thousand people you're done with them in you instead has recruited several thousand people to take their pills every month and so what they did was they asked people on november two thousand and sixteen did you vote for the president
how do you feel
step further they went match that our panelists to official voter records indicate whether someone voted arena
now flash forward to two thousand and team they went back those same people and asked how do you feel about the president today
so you'd have a great picture you both have a really good account of how people felt and twenty six and we can ask the same people how they feel about the present today so most polls just go pick up a group of people like a thousand people asking the question and discard them and then the next poor as a different group of people and so on and so on this poor has been kind of more faithful to the same group of
and that's nice because you know that changes you see in the poor because of people changing their minds not changes and who you're ask i think it's the best account we have of who voted for the president and how they feel about the president today
all the pulls out of all the pulls out there are going this is the best we and it may be the best we are
so before you tell us who the trunk voter actually is according to this pew report give us a picture of who we tend to think the junk food or is interact with the white house white male voters traditionally those in rural areas the bacon the democratic party are and why hillary clinton had
not yet been able to get them but that changing american white working class makes up the core of down from support but what's driving their decision to support him over hillary clinton
i think the stereotype is of a white male doubt a college degree
who is so loyal to the president that he would back him no matter what he said or did let me turn it around mass you will definitely is my perception yeah so what proportion of trumps voters do you think are white men without a college degree
i would i would estimate fifty percent the data says it is thirty three percent so i mean that two thirds of trumps supporters defy that stereotype and at least one respect their either a woman at a college degree or their non white so just thirty three percent of the people voted for trump in two thousand and sixteen are white men with that
that's right
so i'm wrong i mean i'm pretty generous greater by think fifties far enough that your own okay so how do you think that compares to past presidents them or past republican nominee is be more specific so it could be mitt romney can be george w bush john mccain recent republican nominee so how many white nail non college educated voters
backed all of those were forgotten what share of their voters were white men without a degree
okay i'm going to guess and a give you a little explanation for each one
george w bush had a pretty significant appeal to a spanish voters so i'm gonna guess he has a slightly lower percents mean that so many guess twenty
six for george w bush and i'm going to guess
thirty four
workmen rocking romney i'm gonna go and twenty five the all around thirty to thirty five percent and the reason is that the country is getting better and better educated overtime and more diverse so even though bush did better among us and voters there were fewer hispanic voters back in two thousand and four
there's this weird across cutting pattern where the country is getting better educated but the republicans are losing ground among them so the trump voter is within just a few percentage points pretty much the same as your standard republican voter is really what you're saying right
so where did we get this idea me that trumps voters are mostly non college educated white men
or largely not college educated white men who will stick with the president no matter what it must have derived from somewhere i think it comes from a very understandable focus on how trump won the election
and the data shows what we've recognized for a long time which that trump one over the top because he excelled among white voters started agree particularly in these midwestern battleground states where the electoral college was one and lost and so when you try to figure out how trump one it makes sense to go and visit a steel town and go to the bar and talk to a white working class voters you
data for instance says that trump one white working class men by fifty point margin seventy to twenty three in the huge improvement for the republicans over mitt romney performance in two thousand and twelve but those voters aren't necessarily representative of all trump voters they may have been the voters that got him over the top but trying to understand the trump phenomenon more broadly more sociological or at least nationally you wouldn't have felt
so overwhelmingly on that one group so it's absolutely correct that president from did unusually well with white men without college degrees
it's just that that's not the whole story it's not how he did it's not so it seems like we've completed this voter who put trample over the edge and these battleground states in twenty sixteen the non college educated white man
with just the voter more broadly right and that's important because as you mentioned an important facet of this pupils and it's also tracking oil t and how people support for the present has changed over time and the people finds that yeah these white working class men actually are pretty likely to remain loyal to the president you ask people to measure their support from the president on a
ill from zero to one hundred and one one hundred means i love the guy and zero means you hate him and eighty nine percent of white men without a degree still raided him as a seventy five or higher as of this year was order for the president to be ninety percent of their basically guaranteed supporter i think that's fair to say but there are other elements of the trunk coalition that are not as oil the weakest link seems
to be women with a college degree so in this all fourteen percent of the white college educated women who said they voted for the present november two thousand and sixteen say they have a very cold impression of him today less than twenty five in november two thousand and sixteen when you first test the pool only one percent of college educated woman said that so
have a group of people who we know voted for the president who clearly have soured on him sense them so that's fascinating this group of voters that you're describing white college educated women we tend not to even think of them as trump voters and what you're saying is actually they were but they're starting to turn on the president yeah so fourteen percent of the president
supporters were women with a college degree according to the data son a huge number but for comparison new ten percent of voters nationally are hispanic and plenty of time is very understandable he spent trying to understand that voting bloc so fourteen percent out of a whole national coalition is a big number so we started off as conversation with you telling us that we don't really understand the trumpet
whilst we think they do that are sense that it's just way men without college degrees is not quite right at all and in fact it's a broader coalition that includes groups like white college educated women and now you're saying that it was that group that we tend to over think about on white on called you to hit men never mind the most loyal
and it's the group of voters we tend to think about it all who are the most vulnerable and are trying i'm right and that could be a big problem for the republicans in the mid terms
the
will do it back
we won with everything we won with women and i love the women
we won with
i'd graduated with limited
you know for those numbers came house that possible
i've ever heard i was going to win the women i said i think the women like the my wife the first lady a lot he said the women really like you
i like that
what i said i did we win the women
what do we need to know about this group of voters who tended not to think about it all when we thought about how trump point and twenty sixty and white women with college degrees as we head into the meters in general the pew data suggests that this group of white college educated women voted for trump with more reservations than any of the other groups that support of it so only
eighty three percent gave him a very warm or warm rating in november two thousand and sixteen
i think it's reasonable to assume that there was a race not the president have largely been confirmed maybe these were a republican voters who knew they weren't going to vote for hillary clinton because of all of her flaws and they gave the president chance but it it's fair to say that whatever concerned them are made them less likely to support the president two years ago has only been rent for
worst in the intervening two years you identify as a feminist you feminist no i wouldn't say i'm the feminist and a myth i think that would be may be going too far for women for men for everyone i think i think people have to go out they have to go out and really do it and they have to win and that's what and women are doing great
now for the first time since roe v wade
has a vice president a live vice president
my house of representatives twenty five for life
public state capitals that is pretty good
donald trump is also thinking critically their over remark you made the usa today about the actual harassment claim against roger ale to step down last month of had a pox new in that interview with columnist kirsten powers trump reiterated his criticism the women who came forward to complain about
he'd earlier said it was very fab that women were accusing ale the powers then ask trump what he would do if his daughter a vodka was treated the same way as alleged victims were treated trump replied i would like to think she would find another career or find another company if that was the case so something has happened
i was going on this is tons there's revisions into destroyed and the good that may vote against am or the party into a couple months
and how could make a difference in the mid term elections and they need to make a big difference in the maternal term she's not like a presidential election presidential election comes down to the closest states and for a bunch of reasons it turns out that the closest states
were disproportionately white working class and twenty six think that's the presents biggest strength so the president's big strength could really pay off in the states where account with like michigan wisconsin pennsylvania ohio you know high concentrations of white men in all those dancers white without a degree where a majority of the electorate
thousand and eighteen it's going to come down to close districts but those districts in our country are mainly in the suburbs
and they're pretty well educated and many of them didn't vote for the president those are going to be districts where the president's weaknesses are much more important and the president's strengths don't go as far so the voters that this poll shows were most loyal to the president in twenty sixteen and made the difference frame in that election are not all that important and president in
mid term districts right there less numerous in the battle round districts and they were in the battleground states
and then there's also a little additional twist which is that historically white working class voters are less likely to vote in mid midterm elections the why in general just less educated voters are less likely to turn out in lower information elections which is to say yes yeah
and the voters that we the least loyal to president from college educated women for example are very important in his mid term districts right and they also appear particularly energized in politics that call as tight as a tick take a look at these results last night in ohio's twelve this is a special election it's also heavily suburban very high
highly educated highest educated district in the entire state of ohio in the special election we had no high earlier this week
you know i know the democrat felt a little short but the turn out in the well educated suburbs of columbus was huge and dwarf the turn out in rural white working class from various that's why the race in a district so conservative close
so that's interesting this recent we focused on so much the ohio a special election is kind of a test case for what happens when the trumpet do we think about the most is not that president doesn't show up and the trumpeter we don't think about that much is very present and does show up yeah now suddenly you have a district that republicans have always won comfortably still too close
to call two or three days after the election

i wonder if this kind of perception issue we've been talking about the disproportionate focus on the non college educated male voter if that's also a mistake that the president and the republican party has made and if they have governed and politics in a way that
centers on this same perception that you've kind of just burst and in doing so
they have alienated this voter that you're now saying is going to be so essential in the midterms i think that's quite possible i think that you can easily imagine a slightly different version of this presidency that isn't one hundred percent focused on reinforcing the base that tries to assuage some of the concerns of the voters the periphery of his coalition that
would be much better position to heading into the maternal i mean the economy right now is not that bad president should have higher approval ratings
and so to me that indicates that the strategy that the president and other republicans have pursued over the last two years has been a subject on by the way this is like to pretty common problem recently i think in american politics mean take obama in two thousand and twelve you know when he won there was so much focus on
he obama coalition young voters non white voters hispanic voters what did obama do on that basis the first big push they did was immigration or form you might remember where i can guarantee is that we will have in the first year and immigration bill that i strongly support from that i'm more than then i want to move forward as quickly as possible you might even when that sean hannity briefly said he supported a
form because the republicans did so poorly among hispanic voters and both a republican establishment decision to focus on those voters
and the democratic party's decision to focus on those voters it opened up the door to the campaign and a lot of ways the because a big chunk of voters supported president obama in two thousand and twelve white working class voters who want part of that narrative with the republican establishment wasn't trying to do the democrats didn't think they needed to win and now suddenly there's a big opening for someone to movement and appeal to him
in other words the trump phenomenon is built around both parties focusing too much on the group of voters who pushed someone over the edge and then they tend to keep focusing on them and a way that leaves a whole other group of voters feeling left out who can then turn on that candidate yeah i think a lot of people took for
granted the idea that democrats were just going to win white working class voters in wisconsin at michigan and ohio in ireland wherever because they had for a long time and had for in some cases the whole last century anything less than is the mine large the trumpeter is the same as the bush voter and the same as the romany voter and the mccain
voter and historically a republican party weakness has been college educated women it actually seems kind of obvious in retrospect that to alienate that group even further as it seems president trump has done would be a meaningful problem for the party
this is a diverse country white voters that agree today are forty six percent of eligible voters so if you want to build a winning coalition on that group you're going to fall a little short and by the way the present one forty six on the popular apps be a acquaintance not like as we've established all of us voters were whites without a degree but it is to say that if you want to have a sustainable coalition american politics and asked you broaden only
be focused on please in one group
