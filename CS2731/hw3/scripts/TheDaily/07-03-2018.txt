
from the new york times on michael barbara
this is
today
as the epidemic wages on us prosecutors are looking for somebody to blame
my colleague rose gold it has been reporting on their unexpected
it's tuesday
july either
on a day when aaron ross would go hunting he would wake up early may be with the sun and maybe before
get up get in his orange overalls and orange pants and a matching had grabbed his bow and he would head out the door of his little apartment in his small town of hitting minnesota to go out looking for dear
oh
these are his passions hunting and being outside fishing which is a good because that's pretty much what there is to do a bear especially if you don't have a lot of money
and and spend a few hours out there and the outdoors and fresh air
and then he would come home
to his apartment that he shared with his fiance kimberly and outcomes
yeah whatever garbage bring
your it
you mean like he never actually shot anything robert
so he just brought it out there then just for looks
oh
the dailies any i spoke to kim opens i wondered if you could actually describe for me what erin looked like the first time you met him right

and when they come to find each other they're inseparable
or a lot of money or and you bring oh really
go do a lot about our
right
and when you say that you are sick at the time
mean our our own it here

robert robert air work

when i get my upper arm on my part but other times they would split the patch
yeah but not in it
i regret open it
out of there
robert robert
robert
a terrible
robert barbara
probably more all and that was to get a much more potent hit of that sun sentinel and ticket high
right
but you're right all right
away all my writing a very radical
oh i'm bored or burger and or they both had a long history of using drugs and using opiates
can came to them during her first marriage many years before and both of them had been using for many many years on and not trying to stop sometimes restarting and the to you and news together frequently

on december first two thousand and fifteen it's a saturday
and lakes up early he's headed and it's a hunting day there isn't as orange gear game is bow kim's up with him
he is going to say goodbye to him the first she takes a patch one professional patches
sure upset she kissed part of it to him
she keeps part of it for herself they both squeeze the gel out swallow it he sticks that half patch
in his mouth
he's going to head up and she stays home

and what happens next
in the middle of the day kim's adult son adam comes to the house to check on them he opens the door
right in the hallway lying there is aaron fully dressed holding his bow and not breathing
he comes further into the house looking for his mom and find her at the top of the stairs passed out
gurgling slightly
they've both overdosed
robocop
oh
wake up and or without him right away where everyone from our repertoire
already gone on gonna they were darker an hour
i where he grew up an airport
mark
bomb
what i remembered or
grind
i heard
and it sinks in
or you a ring
remember her
or air right now
adam her son takes her back to his house and takes care of her for a couple weeks and then she finally is like i gotta go back home i gotta face this and take care of myself
and she opens the door
we're pretty rare
waiting or bob apart
order regret korea
and she realizes she's alone
he went overboard
i remember back
and we're going to be hurt
i know why why are

she goes through the house she takes of repel she can find much as it down with cheap vodka
tries to kill herself and she wakes up again in hospital
with her son by her side
i
oh
right now
right and wrong
and are robert robert she is going to get sober and she is going to recover and get some help
so she checks and to nearby
treatment center and she's starting to get some how got a social worker
and one day she's talking to her social worker going over paperwork
air
oh you are iraq
right
no are near a year on record oh my god yeah
oh my name and i though
when we're anywhere and
better every ah yeah right
a year or in your back your anger or or ordinary murder
i know
right
a where your underwear
right
or very hard on her part of who i did anybody you are her
and they arrest can for the murder of an interest


all the way back

so can and aaron overdose together
how his kin in charged with murder
a lot of it has to do with a famous basketball player in the eighties
mainland by
len bias was of vietnam at the university of maryland

and had captured the parts of people around the country
he was one of the top and be a draft pick
the celtics so little boys

many people
larry
and two days later
a local success story took up tragic terrible this morning len bias the maryland universe of a basketball star on his way to becoming a world champion boston sell len bias this partying with some friends he's using cocaine and three year old one buys stop or the university of maryland basketball team is now bit and he has a hard
attack and dice
whatever your jog have one by google time we go go go go go it's hard to avoid it was the cover the new york times was the cover the washington post the smiling face it's huge news isn't good tom college basketball and an athlete of god mr mysteriously and there are a lot of the boards a drugs might have been and ball
and it becomes emblematic of what's increasingly at that time considered the drug epidemic
that was
today there's a new epidemic
smoke of cocaine otherwise known as quick crack crack a drug show to him so strong it might just may be called track of do the dishes a war len bias becomes this symbol of the jug epidemic and it's destruction and the villain in that big
his friend brian brian trouble and called nine one one
provided the cocaine and was using it with him
and trivial is charged with providing the cocaine he was acquitted
but this inspires a blurry of bills and laws that refrain the person who provided drugs and and an overdose deaths
as the killer
so even if someone didn't intend to harm this other person or even if they were doing the drugs together
they can be held criminally accountable for the other person's death
absolutely if they intended to cause the death it's just regular murder
for people who do not intend to cause of death but they are being held responsible for the death of someone who voluntarily use drugs and overdosed
yeah sure sure
so these laws were born in a moment of crisis spot politicians were calling crack epidemic in the late eighties but the reason i started doing this reporting now is because we're in what they're calling the obesity epidemic and i started to notice from local news reports research
surgeons of this particular tactic more and more of these kinds of homicide charges being filed and i decided to try and start actually counting and tracking and seeing how big that resurgence was
i only knew german
your search
great yeah i mean i'm particularly focusing interested in len bias kind of was the third degree that you guys have so i spent the last year looking at this i'm trying to collect data on how much the prosecution's actually we're increasing right
and i'll be a brother or your work and go to trial trial
you're going to america
and talk to fifteen nearly twenty district attorney's prosecutors across the country who are doing these cases record from a regular liberated paid
have been had a lot about oh
and fifteen states where i was able to get official data day doubled between two thousand and fifteen and twenty seventeen
what wonder you doing i'm i want to be able to talk about be a pro
in all
agreed not usually i
there is not evidence there is no numerical evidence of any kind that it's having that kind of them are we
oh i am in a mall
a mobile aren't year
oh you're from sri lanka
i think this
sophie's wisconsin border
there's been a while homicide judges author i don't want to the glue that using know i wasn't a good possibility we certainly have sued or a dutch why
keeping an eye on oh my
i really do you know i know that a number
then i heard that repeatedly i think it's working so there is i think a desk junked often between the hopes of people in leadership and people make policy and the reality on the ground
but
i don't know is socially prosecuted and drug dealers for children to teach to start to lose to will do you see an impact on the street
flo
but i don't give a shit
and went to see this prosecutor name pete or pit in minnesota and not far from where kim is in prison
he was really interesting because he doesn't think that this approach will keep dealers from dealing or users from using vote goal isn't to go prosecutor
use drugs to him over and kills them there won't be your problem anymore though
we were not really
he did it out of assertive sense of justice and and wanting to do something about this crisis of overdose deaths
to save the world
fortunately you you you the truth about public bullshit
i literally just very very holds you have you all these are the tooth
that too
what were people around you saying about this charge when were you hearing from from your family and from errands family
what really wrap your mind around heard about even getting
every worker know
making her mother
i'm ariel
are we at all
krista pal i fully understand did not give her pain catch in any attempt to do harm
means i get drunk and get behind the wheel and i crash into someone in kill them
that wasn't my intention but that person's death is still on the so chris it grew up with the aaron and she was very close to him and feels an incredible loss and i am to enhance here's the part in a couple dogs like to dress up t shirt on dog
popcorn watch movies dog
krill animal lover
krista what do you think it was growing up that brought you so close to and
we grew up in the domestic violence in my pants turned to addictions and there's not a whole lot of people in your circle of friends and understand when it's like could be the child of an attic yeah
high school and my dad's in jail
there's know anybody in your science class really get that but and
and where were you when you first found out that the police for treating aaron staff has a murder i was actually in my kitchen
investing here called me just that he wanted until i knew before i found out from the news that he was being arrested for homicide
and what did you think when you heard that they had town
really serious mean i googled it and went home
okay yeah exactly what she did
i won't lie i was glad he were glad she's being charged yes
and why
because
my brother last forty years of his life and the actions of one person cause that
krista what do you say to people who say that this is just what users do they share drugs
and if very easily could have been aaron who provided the drugs and rolls could have been reversed right i mean that i just i know in this case there with her prescription and she admitted giving a tan
yeah you're right and the roles were reversed
these the
my knee jerk reaction should be the same exact thing
right
but he my brother
i can't say that i would expect to wanted to go away what do you mean we would you want your brother charged i will point yes i went i
i feel that if that was the point where he was with his addiction that
maybe there would be the wake up call he needed to be charged with murder rate
the in my whole point here
his to advocate for another family not dealing with the grief that my family has and is dealing with
i don't know what else we as a society can do
clinton turret
but the data doesn't necessarily shell that these charges are deterring people from using our borrowing drugs
so if the charge doesn't have a deterrent effect
would you still want to see people like can getting charged with a crime like murder

the fact remains or someone
last the life
and
i mean if we just didn't charge can because and was an addict
and that meant that his death was of no importance you know big deal thirty six year old healthy man died and
my brother's life meant something
these are a lot of pressure on audience to do these kinds of know there's no from the public or know what doesn't kill her
it reminds me of a word perched already shown but tough shit she lives a risky lifestyle or even what do you think you'll get their sad
what do for a junkie
that's why we don't do drugs
yeah but that's a lot of victim blaming the whole lot of thrown her morals values on have one
get away from her job
currently moral us
i think that the families of people do is drugs
i anticipate for their loved one's death
to be meaningless or even made fun of they're expecting their community and the rest of the world not to see it as important to see it as expected to even say good riddance because that person use drugs and so when the police send a judge
and courts and and everyone is suddenly cares
that means a lot of elements of the generating

chris there may be people who hear it
and think to themselves
there's so much suffering here
and that charging someone with murder who herself is suffering with addiction just perpetuates that suffering
and that true accountability when it comes to addiction lies with a whole group of people who are web high and an industry that create these drugs and distribute them and makes it possible for people to abuse them
why do you think about that
one argue arguments the fact that a lot of prescription drug issues have been created by
over prescribing and if you find a way to restructure
industries we aren't lending drugs kitten hands of the wrong people to be distributed to even more for on eco i will jump on board
town and i this is
the only way i know how to try and save and on their family and the pain and grief and my family deals
so can feels like the most accessible person to hold accountable here
that's only twenty eight

and
rosie when we hope people like him accountable in the stats
who aren't me holding and canada
who are we not by me
no i'm not blaming the healthcare system the insurance industry that is not adequately treating people when are dealing with how people are self medicating with painkillers and the industry that has profited off that and and were not able to grapple with the kind of deeper
why of substance use and all that kind of social and economic and personal factors
that are really causing the crisis we can't deal with that and with what some people called depths of despair
instead we're looking to the person closest by who put the pills the powder the patch into someone else his hands that we get our mind around
the
do you think that you hurt aaron
i don't know
robert
what were we were born
there were already have an array i care
robert aircraft
don't require a warm here
ergo are here at all
oregon
do you think that you do you think you're starting to internalize a little bit what the state of saying about you that you are responsible for parent's death
yeah yeah
i know
our war or or were very
oh
a writer and or where i own a car or
i am a who brought up know
our
no
we're all on it
are all

kimberly elkins was charged with third degree murder in the death of aaron ross
but pled guilty to manslaughter and is serving a four year prison sentence in minnesota


here's what else you need to know other
very very closely for president trump says he spoke with four candidates to replace justice anthony kennedy on the supreme court
as the white house races to meet comp stat lot of announcing a pic by next month they are outstanding people
really incredible people so many different ways academically and every other word the white house to climb to say with whom the president net for the short list of candidates is believed to include six federal appeals court judges i think they pursue that is chosen will be out there that day
you very much everybody
and president trumps long time lawyer michael cohen who is under investigation for secret payments to women who said they had affairs with the president is signaling a new willingness to cooperate with federal prosecutors even if it undermines trough
in an off camera interview with a b c's george stephanopoulos cohen was asked what he would do if prosecutors forced him to choose between his family and trump who in the past cohen has said he would take of both
i put family and country first call and replied to be crystal clear my wife my daughter and my son and this country have my first point
