
from the new york times on michael barbara
this is the today
today
the two thousand and eighteen world cup is now underway in russia
the story of how it came to be there is more relevant than you might think
it's friday june twenty second
the fight for the right dose football world cup so did his final stage with candidate countries making their last presentations now are big names i've been arriving here in zurich and the media had their stake out in front of hotels we the important people are say it was a cold snowy morning in zurich switzerland where there
headquarters of fifa party that overseas world soccer's based the first tree from representatives arrived in zurich the ultimate decision makers for which country host the world cup a fleet of sleek black mercedes sedans drove into the bowels of course of fifa were twenty two men who control world soccer or march your
room make a decision where the twenty eight world cup would be out

can bend single rude about this story for the times there was a clear favorite everyone knew that england which was desperate to hold the world cup was the clear favorite england favorite to host the world cup and twenty eight team david beckham has been at the forefront of lobbying for the votes of the twenty two fifa committee members and everything
in their favor and stadiums and infrastructure at airports and hotels the world's greatest soccer tradition this was the country that invented the sport after all it was clear ingram it's going to win one of the ways i think the sell it to the world is the world watches english football the world comes and plays football in england and so bringing the world cup to england such
natural step so england is your favorite is there anybody else in contention yeah there are several other contenders there's a day between portugal and spain
one between holland and belgium
and there's another one which no one thinks as any chance at all russia
and why does no one think that russia has
fifa itself rated rushes to bed the worst of all the bits for twenty eight in with the worst infrastructure and the most problems
russia didn't have could occur at the time
so no one took them at that point time seriously as ah condition

but how seriously it was a russia taking its
at first it seemed like they weren't taking it at all they were barely making guidelines for filing different paperwork and he turned in by started to become a parent as time march toward that december boat russia might be taking it heck of a lot more seriously than people thought

so good is popular
is very popular all over the world
especially in russia
and he stood in to prove it i was born in length and girth
and as you know during world war two lane and get went through nine hundred base of blockade no electricity no running water
no food and know he'd in a rush russian the winter
but football matches were held even that tragic time football brings spock
into the lives of people young and old by the time of the vote in fifa battery uprooting had apply himself full time to the bed even appearing at a video making a final plea to fifa to choose russia so why do we think the couldn't suddenly cares about the world cup now
so remember this is two thousand and ten
this is a time when russia is trying really hard to change its relationship with arrest the world this is the time of the famous reset there is no event in the world that draws more eyeballs and woke up fish no opportunity for a liter sitting in a presidential box at the opening game to get more attention
then to be in the rocket
warm welcome to your life from our headquarters here in central moscow this is our team with me and nice and now it's two pm here in the russian capital twelve noon and zurich were in four hours time football's governing body will make arguably the biggest decision and sport will soon as the host for the two thousand twenty eighteen and twenty twenty two world cups waits for the
winners will spark a decade of multi billion dollar investment so going into this food in zurich england is the obvious choice russia is a longshot what do we know about what happens in this underground bunker when it's time to vote thing about this underground bunkers and no one's personal what happens down there it's one of the most secret places it's the beating heart of fifa
it's multiple stories underground
it's protected and such a way that no cellphone signals can penetrate this room
the walls are made of polish metal material that gives it doll sheen or the entire room overhead is a judge to layer above it a big squared able that looks like something out of dr strangelove like the order
joining this is prayer room mate out of glowing it internally lit alabaster nice twenty two members filed into this room that day the door was closed
and now to people's heard from them about what was happening
ooh
who
this is the public notary off the city of zurich it gives me the envelope
ladies and gentlemen after the vote everyone repairs to a different place where the press corps and many other people are waiting to get a result president of fifa at the time stands in front of the party and pose opened the envelope as his big reveal twenty eighteen
fifa both twenty eighteen fifa world cup later and gentlemen and will be organized
russia

so england is no no in fact when the dust settles in then found out it only got to vote out of the whole thing and they were the first country limited
so turns out they million a chance never had a chance
thermal gossiping i sorry you got it
i thought adjusting
much better than most
then russia the stadiums and sign of facilities we have we don't have a long way to go set it up is they should have got a hell of a long way to go cry
yeah i did i say
so what's actually going on here
how many is that russia managed to be that england and everyone else
at first seemed like a mystery no one can understand it but there was at least one person and you had a pretty good idea of what had happened
man was a retired british by living in london by the name of christopher steal the christopher still guess decrease for still the christopher still who wrote the dossier making a series of allegations against on trump involving his behavior and russia
that's correct the same one
christopher steel who was a spy for england for many years he had contacts to address and new perhaps as much as anybody about what was happening behind closed doors inside russia

and how exactly does this christopher steel get involved in looking into fifa or cup and russia when the twenty to game and crisper steel stopped being a spy for britain he opened a corporate intelligence for called orbis one of his first clients that orbis was the ink
wish bed to win the two thousand and eighteen world cup they hired and because of his expertise on russia to provide them intelligence and what the russian invade was up to two essentially investigate rivals to england try to better understand their pictures and their pets think of it as an insurance policy for their bid they are trying to find out as much information as they ended
everybody else because they think it will help their chances of winning
and what does christopher seal find out as is researching he's other bids and what's happened because for still finds out in the spring of twenty ten well before the vote funny things are starting to happen with a bit in his sources in russia and elsewhere in the world are telling him that their noticed anything untoward behavior on the behalf of russia
liquid his allegations that fifa voters are being bribed with paintings that potentially could have been taken from the hermitage museum quality paintings allegedly yes including one allegation which he never been proved that it because so many been given power of the fifa voters
yeah and what else there was a rumor of vote swapping deal involving qatar and gas pipeline that they wanted to construct were top allies of lot of your prudent were meeting with qatar people just about making gonna steal it seem to be a mask for maybe a vote trade and then there was the involvement of oligarchy very close to
gotta be approved by the name of romano but i'm a bitch
who is famous in soccer circles because he owns chelsea
very famous hundred in london
program which was a figure who in general stay out of the public i didn't get involved in anything and he had suddenly became very active in supporting the russian dead
and

so essentially steals research suggests that russia has been
more or less systematically trying to bribe and manipulate the fifa officials were going to vote on who he get walk up to oh that's right

we'll be right back

okay so customers feel compiles all these allegations all these bits of information about how russia seems to be bribing fifa officials and what do you do with it
he has two things first house is quiet english big that you're up against so much fiercer foe when they might have anticipated but then he does something else something a bit unexpected
he calls a new friend be as their lives in new york who happens to be an ancient the federal bureau of investigation
invites this asian who is a specialist in russian organized crime
to come to london and meet with him because he's got important tip farm and that's when he tells this ban
thief is worth looking into russia appears to be up to no good
why would this be of interest to the federal bureau of investigation and united states this is seemingly has nothing to do with the f b i
it's a good question
f b i had that time was very interested in what he called trans national crime it was interested in different kinds of crime the cross borders this is initiative under the director at the time
robert mother
mother wanted agents to look for cases that involve money laundering and movements if money across borders and this seemed like an opportunity to do that since christmas steel knew that the f b i was looking for those kind of case isn't particularly that agent when he got this information about fifa he thought it might fall into their we lost

so steel has given us information to his employer the british government and gives it to this f b i agent what happens after that
something you wouldn't expect necessarily english who you would think be the most interested in finding out that russia was up to no good apparently do nothing mainly it seems because they're so scared of offending people in fifa we're going to vote the they don't wanna say a word for fear of ruffling feathers
agent who had a background bus in italian mafia in brooklyn doesn't really know anything about fifa is not interested in soccer but he knows it could case when he smiles on it
so he finds a prosecutor in a federal court in brooklyn
and convince him to open a case and roughly around late summer of two thousand eight and is when the colonel case against fifa secretly be end
it turns out it's really hard to make a case against international soccer bandits
the us investigation of soccer corruption labour it on for over a year without significant break he wasn't until late two thousand and eleven when they finally were able to make a major step forward by flipping one of the twenty two men who was in that room in the bunker that's right and has of them
this was the only american in the room
by the name of chuck blazer who coincidence or not lived in the trump tower
chuck glazer and scheme to millions of dollars for the game over the years and had huge income but he had a nervous tic have never filing tax returns are paying taxes and when the internal revenue service which had joined to case him aware of this they saw gold opportunity and in late november twenty eleven
guy and era approach champ glazer and told him he had a choice either go to jail or cooperate with us investigation in place or immediately signed on

when blazer flips and becomes a cooperate or they put in newark then they can wear a wire and then make phone calls to make him traveled to different places
and he also provides them a tremendous amount of information about how he operates he told them that woke up votes in that bunker were very frequently marred by bribery he admitted himself to taking bribes from allocation of the two thousand and ten world cup which was held in south africa he made it clear to them that bribery was the of the day with in fifa and so on with this information from place
the wiretaps it's confessions what this investigation go
this investigation was conducted in total secrecy and no one knew anything about it but the o j with iris in the f b i was secretly rolling up one informant after another building but turned out to be enormously aggressive and ambitious case that case finally bus into a world view on may twenty seventh two thousand and fifteen it has been
dramatic day and switzerland and after the arrest of high ranking officials from the headquarters of rural football's the fall out of spreading across the world the fastest growing sport in america got a swift kick today several top officials have soccer's world governing body were arrested and a massive bribery scandal top officials arrested
by police and a dawn raid in zurich they face extradition to the united states whether wanted for questioning about kickbacks involving one hundred million dollars and what are they arrested for their already said for wire fraud for money laundering and particularly for racketeering including an official alleged should have taken more than ten
ten million dollars in bribes prosecutors say briefcases full of cash decided media and marketing rights even the site of the world cup they were being charged by the department of justice being members of criminal conspiracy to the department of justice was describing fifa as essentially a mafia organization
man for today's announcement
i'm honored to be joined today by director james colony of the f b i buy within hours gym me the f b i director and the red a the attorney general held a press conference in brooklyn where they mouse to the world event undertaken this massive investigation focused at the very heart
it's an honor to join the attorney general in the us attorney to announce important case soccer football is an egalitarian sport it is the beautiful game because that is flat it is available to anyone and everyone no matter where you come from richer for boy or girl you can enjoy the beautiful game of the game according to
the allegations in this indictment was hijacked that feel that is so famously flat was made tilted in favor of those who were looking to gain at the expense of countries and kids were enjoying the game soccer this is not the way things should be and the work will continue until all
the corruption has uncovered and messages sent around the world that this fund will not be tolerated i wonder if it had to be the united states that did this that investigated this case and made these arrests because our country's relationship to soccer is so different from the rest of the world and so much thinner
did did take an outsider to treat fifa as criminals i think you've put your finger on it
every other country the world cares too much about soccer to ever do anything in the history of investigations donor countries of sci fi of soccer corruption is incredibly minimal
in the end he s could do it because there is no political pressure on agents who want to build a case against soccer they could operate with a lot of freedom in a way that i think could have been impossible in almost any of the country that unwind reminds me of the fact that england lost its bid in part because of this and did nothing that's right you did nothing and in fact they even tried to prevent
journalists from publishing reports that would show fifa corruption in the days leading up to the vote december twenty two so a lot of these countries are just accepting the corruption and fifa that's right they considered it a cost of doing business with the most popular sport in the world and i guess from their perspective fifa officials are
odds
there's a higher order being who are to be treated the highest level of respect and white glove service and whatever they want their post again
who
good evening ladies and gentlemen
just the will i would like to see
thank you
from bottom of my heart
thank you
ladies and gentlemen
each bid is very special and significant
he is a challenge
and we are born to been in the stuff and fan find
so all these high level fifa officials are ensnared in this corruption investigation they are arrested they're paying a cost but i don't think i heard you mention any consequences for russia far as we know there's been no consequences from russia
the us correction is never mentioned russia
the ministry went up in their fifa for its part open an investigation of russia but when it went to russia and asked them for their computers have a good review them they were told that the computers had been destroyed and there was no evidence whatsoever just happened to the district that happened to have been destroyed there was no records any more of their bid
but he to move according to a football a little true football is boredom me a blanket
the would not she had been that meta fifa
welcome the russian now we're in the middle of the world cup in russia and the opening match vladimir prudent sat right next to the new president of fifa and they watched the game together
like a switches to russia for the twenty first edition of the fifa world cup match between the host nation and saudi arabia so not only is was a unscathed
it it keeps the games it keeps the games and prudent gets the world wide party it wanted all along
but hitting gone
this is highest
she could for
so what happens to christopher steal that explains why we hear about him a couple of years later in a very different but seemingly related context
sir christopher steel after establishing relationship with this f b i agent
watch his investigation from afar and keeps in touch with this person and he he's met in the f b i
and in twenty six crisper steals hired to do research on russia once again but this time to look into whether there's connections between the kremlin and donald trump
once again what he finds disturbs
it picks up the phone and he calls that same as it once again
he has a new storage our invites said f b i agent to meet him money ends over a new investigation and this one is thirty five page document detailing what he considers to be collusion between russia and traub to undermine american democracy

the can thank you very much thank you michael for having me

here's what else you need to know these are hard issues
these issues will ultimately get solved in this country to live because they have to get solved in this country
it's broken
our immigration system is broken we have a lot of problems that are broken one day after president trump ended the separation of children and their parents at the board and congress to act on the issue
how speaker paul ryan postponed a vote on a bill that would do just that after failing to win enough republican votes we need to tango
we have fifty one votes
we need sixty unfortunately because we have the ridiculous filibuster rule so he did sixty president trump had personally lobbied for the house bill which would have also provided a path to citizenship for dreamers but cent lawmakers mixed messages on thursday morning by declaring that the senate would like
reject the house bill which in turn discouraged house republicans from taking a risky vote and i think we'll get six senators maybe we'll get seven said is that still doesn't get sixty so there's nothing to get as the president was speaking thank you so much for having the the first lady maloney a trump made an unknown
bounced visit to a texas detention center that houses children separated from their parents under her husband's zero tolerance policy and i also like
ask you how i have to these two and
famines
as it
during her visit the first lady ask the staff about how children are treated as such facilities and to ten how many times they speak with their reality families
the children are about you
when he was you
