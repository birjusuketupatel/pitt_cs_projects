
from the new york times ah michael barbara
if the day
today
white house reuters see special counsel robert mother will not indict the no matter what he finds if that's true one year into the investigation
what's that all four
it's frightening made

my tell me about this meeting between lawyers for the special counsel and attorneys for the president so last month rudy giuliani comes on as the president's lawyer in somebody has to defend the president urged my job and he's going to bring an end of the investigate in his mind right is mine and as part of the
that he goes in and meet with mahler and his investigators to talk to them the biggest question being an interview will trump sit down with smaller for an interview in that could be and at least in trumps mine and the reality of that's my job my job is not lean over what the hell out of that what was going on before i got here it's my
job to make the case for the president leonardo it's very it's a very proud of that and go very different now than it was a couple weeks ago
why i got involved the giuliani goes in we i asked him specifically if they if they realized or acknowledge they didn't have the power to and day and both in the course of that meeting the question comes up can the president be in date
mike schmidt covers national security giuliani says no they push mahler's team for a one of mahler's prosecutors says probably not but malo doesn't seine he just sits there doesn't respond
and one of the system said they acknowledge they had to be bound by justice department politics
and according giuliani is telling there's no real answer that given to them in that meeting it's only a few days later and then the next day of the day after they clarified it for jay who was with me as a meeting that they didn't have the power to indict giuliani says that mahler's ninth is call and say we do not believe
the president can be indicted
so giuliani has gone to the special counsel's office in order to retrieve an answer to this big existential question can the present a united states be indicted
and over a number of days the answer comes back that the special counsel does not believe that he can indeed which would suggest that president trump will not be charged with a crime by the special counsel correct my does that just the mother has reached a stage
stage in his investigation where he is determined that the president hasn't committed anything illegal know it doesn't mean that it all it just means that if muller work your find wrong doing it does not believe the criminal court system the place dead every one of the country would go if they broke the
law would be the place for the president to be dealt with but the question of whether the president can be charged with the crime is not settled one there is a justice department policy guidance to prosecutors that the president should not be charged with a crime these power
is in place because the justice department believes under the constitution that in the president would create such a distraction for him it would be such a burden dad facing charges something so significant that he would hurt the president's ability to do his job
because of that can't be charged that's pretty fascinating doesn't that essentially mean in practical terms that the president is above the law know because there is a way under the constitution dad the country deals with the president dad as done something wrong
that's called impeachment
through congress correct
and i'm not afraid to the trial of it you're not i made my mistake
my years ago require i have never happened
never profited from a picture i earned every show where does this department of justice understanding that the president shouldn't be indicted where does that come from the justice department looked at this question under nixon when there was a special counsel investigation and i think too that our country
in my are required
i don't have examination because people have got to know whether or not bear president
and i'm not a crook i burn everything i've got they looked at the question under bill clinton when there was an independent counsel i have accepted responsibility for what i did wrong in my personal life
and i have invited members of congress to work with us to find a reasonable bi partisan and proportionate response and they concluded that the president should not be indicted so this dates back to the previous two presidential investigations that in one case resulted
in a president being ousted from office or for his behavior nixon and a second bill clinton were that almost happened and in those cases the department of justice determined that it as an entity couldn't charge a president with the crime and left the question up to congress
but i want to understand if the president of united states did commit an obvious crime let's outlandish the sun just killed someone
law enforcement under this policy would not prosecute they would hand this issue over to congress well that's the question about this where's the tipping point on this policy if the president was to do something extreme in the moment like the example you laid out would do justice to par
feel the need to allow charges against the president to move forward
in that is why it's a policy it's not all it's not like the constitution says the president can't be chart that's not in the constitution right this is an interpretation of the constitution the way the justice department has tried to figure out how he deals with the unusual standing of the present united states the head of the executive
it's incredibly unique position the most unique position in the country so it sounds like there's enough room for interpretation air that trumps lawyers weren't certain that muller would conclude the president cannot be indicted so why is he showing his cards now by telling white house lawyers that that is
in fact what he believes will i think there's two reasons why mother may have done it the first is that the question of the interview is hanging over the investigation whether trumps sits down with special counsel will trump answer questions to monitor it appears that mother has gone two lanes to try and get the press
getting to sit for the interview in march is investigator sat down with the president lawyers in went through the questions day would like to ask writers were in this case they're saying what the president doesn't have any criminal exposure
maybe that's a way of winning over the president to come in sit for an and saying there will not be so great a cost if you come to this area the other thing is that the president has considered and wanted to fire mahler last june as we reported the president went to
don began the white house counsel and say call the justice department it's time for mahler to go so if your mahler bother probably doesn't want to get hired either mahler probably believes in what they're doing and if the president knows look i'm not going to have criminal exposure on this maybe dallas wages
be that calms him down a bit because here's the other scenario ears flip it around rudy giuliani walks into the oval office and says hey we work with smaller today and he says in dating used on the table and even gas to or so
could be rubber mahler making sure that robert mother remains national council or it could be wrong our say look i'm going to be transparent with you in trying to be up front as possible in i don't intend to do this and what about the president's lawyers why are they pushing muller to say that he won't invade i think the president's lawyers have to
two big problems
they have a client that needs to be kept at bay and told that everything is gonna be okay why don't i just fire mother well i think it's a disgrace what's going on we'll see what happens but i think it's really a sad situation where you look at what happened there many people have said you should fire him
again
they found nothing
the issue with the present in the past year since mother was appointed is the president's loader trying to stop him from firing mahler a fundamental issue in the entire thing we have a horny
on average cloud over my hair and i've been able to do really that cloud mattered now everyone know
and i think did john down in ty cobb the two lawyers that recently left the team were very good english ensuring the president throughout this process that firing mother would only create more problems
yeah shaun
growing on where people in that department
yeah but what can i get another united going on i didn't and i don't have good
maybe out and got i want to not be involved were pretty athletic department i will wait
so most team and the white house lawyers are both saying that muller won't invade the president maybe for the same reason for the trump won't fire mom correct
we'll be right back


okay so now though we know that the avenue of charging the president and through the department of justice special counsel's office is more or less closed let's say that the end of his investigation robert mother finds that the president did in fact commit a crime what does he do
the notion out there in the media and amongst democrats dead mother is going to just send a report directly to congress that he would finish up write a report send it o'connor's it's not that simple
if muller wants to send a report to congress it has to go through the deputy attorney general right rosenstein while just not have the authority to simply give this to congress to allow them to deal with this has to go through the person overseeing the best in this case rad rubenstein rosenstein makes a decision about what goes
to congress in one done in that is why the question of who is overseen the investigation is so important because whatever muller find has to go through the pipe the person in the in between of who's overseeing it at the justice department in this case is rad rose is debbie tourney general because the attorney general
jeff sessions is recused is recused so one option is that more rights of a report sends it to the deputy attorney general who then passes and along congress to act on it or not act i'm leaving it up to garner current do you deal with this we found these issues in regards to the president here's what it is you deal with it so
then congress will die just this report but even then congress's in the hands of republicans both the house and senate who have not shown a great appetite to take action against us president to is there another option for mother to take if he believes the president has committed a crime
the other option mother has his to do what was done under nixon which was to make the president in unindicted coke conspirator and what does that mean nixon was in unindicted coke conspirator in the watergate greek and a quarter
right
her
hormone
among
under water
her his name was not in the court papers of the indictment that was filed he was unindicted coke and spirit or never won or some alias but it came out several months later that he was that person that he
was someone that had conspired with the people who were indicted and that was very damaging to nixon at the time
mahler and the justice department for that matter has the ability to name some one zero now as an unindicted cope conspirator it's highly unusual but there is nothing that prohibited so if muller felt there was incredibly important information dad he had about the president's involvement in a car
that was committed by someone else he could get that information out by making human and and a conspirator and what is the point of making someone an unindicted cool conspirator because it's not like to me is a bunch of people and robbed a bank i'm charging three of them and there's a fourth person new drove the getaway car and i'm not doubting that person but i'm going to
name him in a court filing maybe it's because that person is cooperating maybe it's because that person has provided with something be that person is fled the country or maybe that person is the president states and there's a policy in on the books
of not charging him with the current okay so this is essentially a clever way that would not necessarily involve congress have publicly identifying wrongdoing by the president yet you have to understand what we're doing years we're trying to figure out what mahler may do in a situation that we have rarely if ever
ever seen dad is very unchartered territory legally in were sitting here without the ability to see the world their mother's eyes to know everything he knows to try and figure that out so you have to interpret it in that sense is not like we know here are the roads and such
this is a very unusual thing this is different so what has been the president's reaction to this discovery by his legal team or this concession they've drawn from a special counsel that they won't indict him he's always seemed very eager to have people know that he's not under investigation of these we charge
so is this a relief damn it doesn't appear so at least by what he was treating about today on thursday morning he took to twitter and it being the one year anniversary of bob mahler being appointed the present in training it on that saying congratulations america we are now
into the second year of the greatest which hunt in american history in there is still no collusion and no obstruction the only conclusion was that done by democrats who were unable to win an election despite spending have far more money and then following that out with despite a disgusting illegal in ah
unwarranted which we have had the most successful first seventeen month administration in us history by far sorry to the fake news media and haters but that's the way it is so if getting this acknowledgement from mahler that he i've been doing the president was in part about
putting president trump eddie is why is the president and still so upset about this investigation if he knows he's not going to be charged because the cloud still exist
there are still these enormous question to doubt his conduct in office about his campaign
and bob mahler still investigating and he still looking into things in has indeed several members of his campaign
it's not clear where he's headed
thank you very much thanks for adnan



use what else you need to know the trump administration will announce a new on friday
it would cut off federal funding to clinics that provide abortion
or even discuss the procedure with patients
the war which takes direct aim at planned parenthood is a top priority of religious conservatives and is the latest move by the president to impose curbs on abortion rights and chinese negotiators are preparing to offer united states the promise of buying up to
two hundred billion dollars in american goods to reduce the trade deficit between the two countries
and fuse president trumps frustrations with china's trade policies
the times reports that the promise by china would allow president trump to claim a major victory in his campaign to read balance america's trade relationship with its biggest economic rival but economists say it's not practical and critics say it could impair the president's
more ambitious agenda
to punish china for pressuring american companies to hand over valuable technology
finally fifty for the news or forty five and the nomination is confirmed and the president will be immediately notified of this action on thursday the president's choice to run this the gina hospital was confirmed by the senate despite
bipartisan misgivings about who war in the detention and interrogation program after september eleven
