
the new york times i'm michael

hi the news anchors all start by saying our greatest responsibility is to serve our communities
what they are forced to say next has drawn attention to local news stations
and who they are actually being asked to show
it's funny people six

a complete report a wife barbara
michael bay bridge what the weather wrong
broke transport and the eye witness news team
hello there here's what's happening at ten for arizona
eighty is just eight hours away my mom was an anchor he was the first female evening anchor in the state of arizona
every day with voters choosing a president a congressman and senator and various local offices as a supervisor fifth or and through son is a place that he moved to and she was a child went off to san diego for a couple years but she moved back became an evening anchor couple of years after that i was born i've seen video
a news story that ran the day i was bored when they sent a camera over to visit my mom and hospital room so are you essentially brought into this world on tv
i mean the camera wasn't there as i was being born it was there a couple hours after aaron ways worked in local news for fourteen years i went off to college and wanted nothing to do with journalism i majored in theater and after college i went off to microsoft and did the tech
thing for a couple of
and it was only after i'd been there for about a year that i realized i was missing that instant gratification
so i took a week off and went back home to tucson and hung out at the station for a week and wrote some stories and went out on a drug bust proved i could do it and so they hired me as a producer so you started to work in the newsroom where your mother was an anchor i did though i very rarely saw her most of my time
there i was producing the morning show she was anchoring six and ten so we would literally past and the night she'd be wrapping up the late shows i was showing up for the overnight shift and how did you like the work i loved it it's incredibly rewarding you get to make something every day and see the results of what you do
every day and then you come in the next day and you've got a blank slate and was there something about the fact that was local news that made you take pride in it
it's that connection to a community
it's odd because local news is a very trains in business very few folks stay in a market for years or decades and the ones who do tend to be those trusted local anchors my mom could have played the tv news market game and left to son and picked
the family every couple of years from a to san to a phoenix to a los angeles and bigger and bigger markets but she didn't she chose to raise her family in tucson because it was a sense of place and i always be thankful to earth for that
oh my
really
so what was your first big break in the news bears
so i was going to son for about a year and a half and decided to see what else was out there and ended up heading up to a portland oregon
so i took an associate producer position bottom of the wrong pretty quickly worked my way up and after spending my twenties in portland which is a great town to be single and in your twenties in i got married had a kid and we decided it was time to head somewhere else so i started looking around for other positions
and ended up getting offered a news director job in sioux city iowa
and it was a big promotion for me at that point i'd been a manager on filling basis in portland getting to run the newsroom when folks went there but getting my own newsroom my own shop was a great opportunity so we packed up and moved the midwest
this is single and news etc
hey fourteen
police say this man is passing counterfeit bills and they want your help catching and i ones who are terminally ill make it easier access to end or more with your vision and as needs director for writing this tv station much problem for me it was the chance to build something it was a small
all struggling station that came from an ownership group that had gone through a fairly spectacular bankruptcy a couple of years prior was still basically being held by the bankruptcy court and the creditors
and you know in a market that size that you're going to be working with maybe a few veterans but primarily new reporters and that me it was exciting
you knew going into this job at this was a small station that it was financially struggling and it sounds like those two things or in some ways or a draw for you because it meant that he had the ability to to put your own imprint on yeah it was that feeling of being a part of that place
yeah
when did that
it sounds like this was going well and that you're enjoying this work when did that feeling start to change so after i'd been there for about a year and a half we got word that sinclair was looking at buying station
these things take a couple months to close sinclair ended up officially buying the station in fall around october twenty third
losing their was banned it in nineteen seventy one bite and current chairman bought a million embarrassment he was an electrical engineer
that deep curiosity about new broadcasting technology sydney ember is a media reporter for the times and the companies started are very small it was why radio station and why and television station in maryland in baltimore by a wanna get bigger and started buying more and more stations which cohen
sided with this sort of deregulation they allowed company is to our and more station we saw no reason no harm to the public that would result from networks are acquiring stations and after all the touched on has changed to meet not are not to be the interest of the hollywood producers or the networks or
the group owners but rather whether or not the viewers in particular markets are better off and we believe they will be if we permit groups to be able to acquire other stations and it does mean that independently own stations will do very well they do do very well and markets depending upon the owners and their management capabilities but there are
but economist or some very good efficiencies result when an entity he was able to grow larger and there's often time served are people very well in our society and we ought not to lose sight of and so there might have been in time where company could own a set number of stations might have been a cap and suddenly there was that's exactly right and enough are aligned handicap
i think five and then a new chapter seven and and twelve suddenly it's possible for a company to own not just a handful of stations but a very large number of oh to be safe
yeah and by the early t it as and sinclair and something like sixty stations across the country
we knew the station was up for sale and someone was going to come in at some point and by the fact that it was sinclair looking at us was also not a surprise and on paper seemed like a good thing because you've got a very large well researched company coming in the hope would be an owner like that comes in
and starts giving you more reporters you start adding news casts the sorts of things that you hope to see when a well resources company comes into what had been a poorly researched station and
hope they would have seen what we were doing there is something that had a lot of potential for growth
so what happens at these stations that sinclair is buying up what changes about the actual day to day operations so sometimes the stations are happy to hear that
he likes and claire is buying than he has failed now have resources to go out and report local news resources that they might not have had before sinclair came in pretty quickly the station started to realize that things aren't as crazy as they see and
yeah
so right around the time the sale is closing i fly down to north carolina for a meeting with news directors from other stations that had been recently acquired by sinclair
and were all at the airport we get on a ban on the way to the hotel
talking
someone asks about must run pieces so unless master in is a segment that is generally centrally produce that sinclair assets stations here and it sends out these segments to aid stations across the country and its as run he is during a specific period of time
not a polite request it's generally not a player request now it orders the stations around them
the explanation that came from another news director who'd been part of the group for probably a couple months
was just the yeah these stories come down and you bury them at like five a m when no one's watching and yes are conservative but he just run them and move on and the implication was not a big deal and corporate wasn't really watching or cared when they ran

and
hyman we made so and after the sale to sinclair alistair one is the first time that you interact with content that surprises you may even startles yeah it was probably one of the mark hymen commentary pieces is the deal j being used to silence media groups that hold the obama administration accountable islamic
radicals believe it's they're calling to convert or kill all nonbelievers it's time to ignore the craze and adopt the same energy policy to turn a blind eye to those who fit the profile and to invite them into our communities is irresponsible black churches and those counties organized they sort to the paul's campaign to drive obama voters straight from church
vote who may soon she and other islamic state from more the story visit the headlines dot net force of what facebook a market i mean they were clearly labeled as commentary and that continues to be sinclair his defense to this day is well we label or commentary his commentary but you're still using your trust
local anchors who do not have a bias and have spent decades plane completely down the middle you're using those trusted local anchors to give credence to give wheat to that commentary what did you make of the fact that these directors or being handed down within it
company to the stations and that you really didn't have much of a choice about how to respond to them
that was new and is still to this day completely unique to the way sinclair operates i've been part of other large and small station groups both before and after my time with sinclair and the way corporate works in every other station group in the country
is that they'll provide guidance on the broad picture of the way you cover the news or present the news but the day to day content decisions about what each station runs in every other station group is left to the local news directors and if there is
he is corporate content that comes down it's something that stations can run if it fits and there was actually not a whole lot of it in other station groups at all
sinclair it's it's different it is something that you must run and you must put it in your news cast and you can't touch it and that made me as as a journalist very uncomfortable did you ever ask your anchors or the reporters on air
for fill these orders
yeah sometimes i i wasn't keeping very close track i guess partially because i probably didn't want to know so you didn't wanna talk about it because you are in some ways ashamed of it owed a deeply ashamed uncomfortable whatever you'd like to call it it would just have a fundamental moral quandary on my part i i just couldn't do
it comes down to that sleeping at night looking yourself in the mirror in the morning
was at that point i realized i needed to find something else
so is it safe to say that you
left the station
because of what sinclair was asking you and your colleagues to do because you had a fundamental objection to what your new corporate parent was doing
absolutely
twenty four it mean sinclair has continued trying to grab the game basically hit a wall and it might be has regulatory limit on how many seasons
and when has interim like david sinclair in its chairman david men began pushing very changes to the regulatory limits on a number of stations in l a
if you believe is i do for the federal government has no business intervening in the news then we must stop the federal government from intervening in the news business
and that is why this afternoon
i shared with my fellow commissioners and order that will reform our media ownership rules and help pull the government once and for all out of the newsroom and quickly the federal communications commission began rolling back regulations and one of the things he did was a easy cap on how many stations that broadcaster cut down
and sinclair benefited immediately
counting and deal for tribune media company you may recognize because it used to be a company that owns a lot of newspapers the los angeles times that today they are a lot of local tv stations
so in buying tribune which is what their wants to do it would be buying up dozens more tv stations
this merger would allow sinclair clarity i reach seven in ten american homes and it would have more than two hundred stations across the country and when that makes the largest owner of tv stations and the country sinclair in fact was already the largest donor stations across the country and they still would make it even
bigger and city what have we seen with and clears programming in the past few years since november two thousand and fifteen sinclair has required at stations around and daily segment from what it calls it's terrorism alert desk for example commit terrorism alert as in washington i'm wednesday mass some british officials say terrorism related
had a record hi honey is are generally i heard us near mongering hate segment on has sixteen percent increase from the year before and they also will run conservative commentary from pundits like mine came in and boris epstein who is a former a spokesman for president
the latest conservative talking point where their aids media sudan along with other cable news networks is struggling to stick to the facts or north korea the president sending a message that comes out on that if you do not bad down and diplomatic discuss elizabeth olsen here gonna have the deal directly with donald trump whole be a lot
less interested in mason or healthcare government directed healthcare can be deadly or terrorism
terrorism has not the most would continue to be under constant threat of attack or taxes half of us are paying for everyone else are terrorists the new tabs on steel and aluminum are pushing our trading partners to engage and fair trade with the united states and they're definitely right leaning segments that are then shown on
local newscasts is there a sense that sinclair has gotten more liberated to do this and might even be doing it more sense trump was elected i don't know if they're doing and more but people are definitely noticing more
hi on fox san antonio is jessica headley and i'm ryan love our greatest responsibility is to serve our a san antonio community were extremely proud of a quality balance journalism that fuck san antonio produces so we are concerned about the troubling trend of irresponsible one sided news stories plaguing our country the sharing of biased and false
news has become all too common on social media more alarm and he will really started noticing what and clarence doing last weekend when the when they dead been published and video that showed anchors i dozens of sinclair stations reading the same anti and mean yeah i would say their media more alarming family outlets have less the same thing
stories about checking facts first and fortunately his from members and the mania use their platforms to post their own person by us and i intend to control exactly what people think it's an extremely dangerous to our democracy they must friends in that has have generally been introduced by an anger with his granted but then there be packaged segments this
differently in all of the angriest were actually reading the same script so the anchors became the segment the anchors became a segment that the sharing of biased and paul smooths
all too common
yeah
unfortunately
country
really dangerous to history through this is extremely dangerous to our democracy this is extremely dangerous to our democracy this is extremely dangerous star democracy

so what did you think when suddenly just a few days ago this all exploded
in the national media with this video on dead spent what were you thinking when sinclair his relationship with his tv stations suddenly became national news
i was deeply sad for everyone in those videos
they are people they were people i knew people i'd work with people i mean and not have worked with but have seen on the year for years and to some of their credit they gave that video all the sincerity of a proof of life hostage video meaning they looked uncomfortable
clearly uncomfortable by what they are be expected to do and say i don't think any certainly not many of them truly believed what they were reading but they had no choice
sounds from what you're saying that you're sympathetic toward
these anchors had to do i'm absolutely sympathetic and that goes back to me growing up i think about had that been my mother in nineteen eighty three
five six seven years old
and my mother was told to read something like that she would have had the option of stand up for your values as a journalist and quit and lose your job and in find some way to feed your family or he could have read it and done it and sucked it up and said are it's bad
but i've got to work and i want to be a journalist
and every single one of those anchors that has a family that has a spouse that has a connection to a community that they have lived in for twenty or thirty or forty years every single one of them was in that position and what does your mother think about all of us to watch that video of other sinclair
you are saying exact same thing saw it i'm sure she was as horrified as the rest of us
she's been out of business for over ten years now
yeah he lives in seattle now she gets como sinclair station up there but she doesn't watch much and honestly don't think she watches much tv
and honestly i don't watch much local tv anymore either
we don't have cable anymore and where i live up in the mountains you can't get anything over the air so occasionally i'll streamer a local news cast on my phone fun feeling nostalgic i guess but i guess in some ways i've moved on to sound that both of you in a sense have started to give up a bet on tv news
i think we have
oh thank you very much appreciate michael
been my pleasure

we'll be right back

use what else you need another day
and answering a question for a reporter aboard air force one
president denied knowing about the one hundred and thirty thousand dollar payment that his lawyer michael cohen me to the adult film actress stephanie clifford weeks before the two thousand and sixteen election
a payment cheese was meant to prevent her from discussing an affair with in two thousand and six the clean could complicate the president legal battle against clifford who has claimed that the confidentiality agreement she signed is invalid because the president never signed by denying that he
knew about any green the president appeared to be confirming clifford's argument which could allow her to bring her silence without consequence
