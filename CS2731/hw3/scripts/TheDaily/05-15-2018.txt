
from the new york times on michael barbara
is day
today for his release it's a historic milestone for the jewish state
ferguson's it's the latest portrayal of the palestinian people to views of the relocation of the american embassy to jurors
it's tuesday may fifty
on behalf of the forty fifth president of the united states on america
we welcome you officially and for the first time to the embassy of the united states here in jerusalem the capital of israel
think here
david what's happening in jerusalem on monday
the longer term jared kushner arrived here we could treasury curry were ago america members of congress much better
remember a virtual return from jewish community a joke community and
period her big ceremony marking the movie it's good from tel aviv you to jerusalem david healthy is to jerusalem bureau chief of the dogs
reasons we are melting in a ceremony
remember it's the cell phones now going back to the formation of a third of israel jerusalem was going to be certified and away unto itself as a base create international study it wasn't given to either stock and for israel today which you know increasingly won't be known as the nation's
period of the jewish people to the united states to declare the juice from the capital of israel tend to move come be here you produce food vindication
acknowledgement of what very few has been denied her some time now
ladies and gentlemen please join me now in me and david friedman
it began with the ambassador of united states david friedman who use the former bankruptcy lawyer for president from has an orthodox jew on this exact day seven years ago
almost this exact time
david ben gurion declared israel's independence
just eleven minutes later
president harry truman cause the united states
the very first nation to recognize the reborn state of israel palestinians you remember that time with a very different sort of emotions
may fifteen for palestinians is called back the day it's the way they consider their catastrophe hundreds of thousands of them were expelled from more fled from their homes in what became israel and for them for gay really of morning and through the idea that united states was going to be making their move
on the eve of that particular anniversary was seen by millions quite a provocation seven years since down memorable events almost to the minute the united states slightly takes the next step
step awaited voted upon litigated and prayed for for all these years
a we open the united states embassy in jerusalem
mr
friedman
number of times said he was welcome them to the embassy in jerusalem israel
for many years american children born in israel when they got their passport
those passports would say jerusalem has the city and the country would be left blank mr freeman was making a note and on that away their that this is no more that could be united states to islam a very much a part in matches
part of the state of israel so right from the beginning we have this far right representative of the united states president provocatively claiming that jerusalem is the capital of israel that's right you know the palestinians have always felt that the united states was not exactly a neutral unbiased
arbiter of the peace process they've always had complained that you know israel was an ally and the palestinians always have to compete with that but now they're basically saying work or pretend there's been dispensed with the united states and israel are solidly like just about him the same shoes not just know side by side
and why should we treat the united states as a fair minded mediator can he talks they've responded by walking away from the table and slamming the door
no are looking for somebody else to fit them in december of last year president trump announced to the world that the united states would finally recognized the truth that jerusalem is the capital of israel
we went from my basket a free men to invoke a trunk and jared kushner by moving our embassy to jerusalem we have shown the world once again that the united states can be trusted
we stand with our friends and our allies and above all else we've shown that the united states of america will do what's right and so we have
we've invested a freeman has been really quarterbacking the trump administration's attempted a peace process
i am here today as a proud american and the grandson of holocaust survivors he harken back to his grandparent who had to bribe the holocaust after the war they built a new life in america a beacon of hope a land of limitless opportunity in my office in the white house i keep a photo of them on my desk
to remind me of how high the stakes are when nations fail to recognize right from wrong
and the decisive power america has to tip the scales in favor of the righteous
it was an interesting idea and effect i found myself wondering from when were suggesting that know like his grandparents who put the holocaust behind them the palestinians
really just put the past behind them and move on it is now my great honor to call upon the prime minister of the state of israel benjamin
you know and prime minister netanyahu is your mark green energy to them that i hadn't seen before what a glorious day remember the small ones
there's almost palpable really there is genuine excitement
he talked historically but he also talking very personally and spent the first three years of my life
rude he had lived just a few blocks from the embassy site and recalled walking through what game or fields with his older brother
and being warned don't go too far don't go up where the embassy actually fits now because my mother told me
you can't go any further
this was due to border
it was exposed to sniper for because that would put with them and sniper range from the jordanian side
this is now
the most
pursuit of the most powerful nation on earth
greatest the united states of america
yeah born and making forty nine you know he's just a year younger than the country itself
he's he's he could hurt his own life
life cycle last december
president trump became the first real leader to recruit most jerusalem as our capital and today the united states of america is open opening gets embassy right view and jerusalem
thank you
president trump for having the courage to keep your promise
david is all this happening because donald trump is an office in other words does this reflect a larger shift in the way that americans are thinking about israel or is it all about his administration and its vantage point on this that's the really interesting question i mean what are we talking about are we talking just about
the embassy move every time a recognition of jerusalem as the capital if we're talking about those things i don't think they happen under a different president i really don't but i think you're touching on another question because i'm a little bit more to do with prime minister netanyahu the jewish population and and states is still heavily to the left with federer
many of the things and the policies that has committed guy who's right wing government has been pursuing in israel
have alienated american jews aggravated them made them question their support for israel or made it difficult to defend their support for israel a number of wins and at the same time
now who's increasing so tightly to president shrimp
for democrats united states
increasingly hard cake and david would have on average israelis how did they feel about the relocation of the embassy from tel aviv to do is just as a very divided country politically but he moved the embassy
pretty surprised to learn that he didn't left leaning israelis and politicians really could get behind it for many people the fact that israel alone really in the world had this very recognizable very well established capital city that was denied a recognition that they believed
was going in reading and to have that lifted finally is a really welcome thing there is broad agreement among israelis that to islam should be seen as their capital and treated as such for the rest

he and finally did it was there any knowledge none of these deadly protest at the ceremony today in terms on which is just gets a few dozen miles away yes jared kushner actually good make some note of it just glancing my been other than that
there were appalling and president they were listening to the lyrics of how leah
but it was a very striking contrast to what was happening just an hour's drive away

thank you did television crew me market
all the bad


so devlin we just spoke to her colleague david helping and in jerusalem after the dedication of the new american embassy in there what's going on in gaza as that is happening
well michael it's been put it simply have been the bloodiest day and gaza thousand and fourteen deck and wash covers the middle east for the times today we had fifty five protesters killed on the palestinian side of the fence that that brits gaza from israel and we had approximately two thousand
and four hundred people who were wounded in those classes
either by rifle fire from israeli soldiers positioned on the other side effects or from lesser injuries
here
to be honest i can mostly describe it as it look something like a medieval battleground today where you have a long fence running down the middle you have a long burma on the israeli side that has military post with soldiers inside them daughter along the fence and on talents
inside where the protesters have been burning tires so gears been filled with the inky black smoke
you have skype bombed kite bucks that's right yeah protesters they make these cards that they paint palestinian thugs are emblems own and then they attach sort of crude explosive devices in many cases it might be say a bag of sugar that is soaked and gasoline and then it is attached to a flame device
they set the kite into the air and then as that is burning and has the flaming tail the guy to towards the israeli border and they tried to landed in fields on the other side to set the israeli crops on fire
you have israeli drones that are monitoring or in some instances and appears firing tear gas as well over the area and then you have ambulances that screaming rushing to pick up people has been shot a wounded and then when you push further back away from the front line
you have a whole staging area where families are hanging out where people are speaking to my bones trying to urge people forward and where there is music and food
leaders in the main factions in gaza addressed thousands of worshippers they launch a lot of rhetorical attacks against united states which they described as the great satan
they attacked trump and they spoke about this decision to move the embassy to jerusalem as a great betrayal because of course for muslims and particularly for the palestinians they considered resume to be sacred city and they consider eastern jerusalem to be a place where they could potentially have the capital of a future palestinian state

for many palestinians the declaration by the current administration that it was going to move the embassy to jerusalem really signalled that the americans are no longer willing to play at the rule of being an impartial mediator between them and the israelis no historical struggle and so a lot of the rhetoric that i
heard on the ground today these protests was specifically directed at the united states
gaza is this area that he's been under an israeli blockade for the last eleven years and haven't territory is controlled by the note and group hamas which is by iran hamas has several wars with israel and very destructive that have reduced rubble
large parts of gaza
some of that is now rebuilt but nonetheless this remains a very impoverished place it's also a place that is largely cut off from the outside world all supplies of food medicine cement all the basics are strictly controlled by the government of israel and the people who live here for them it's almost him
possible to leave so so many of the young people i spoke to today who are participating in the protest they have not only never visited other countries in the region most of them haven't even seen israel so for them their view of an israeli or for israel looks like is be limited to the soldiers that they see stand
at the border posts along the fence and right now he very concessions effort to stop them trying to bridge that fence or to come across it
so we've seen through the day people will come towards the fence there will be warning shots then tend to shoot people in the leg but certainly anybody who has gotten as close as the fence seems to be in danger of suffering a lethal shots so there were a number of people were killed at the fence today and who
appear to have been shot in the head by israeli snipers who are positioned on top of terms that over the fence and provide them a few over what's going on
are you surprised by that use of force gunshots especially to the head of people walking up to the fence
i mean the israelis say that this is what is necessary to prevent people coming through and to protect the sovereignty of the country and also to protect the israeli communities that are living on the other side of this fence but you know any palestinian that you speak to will tell you and certainly some international organizations
who will complain that this is a disproportionate use of force when you speak people were trying to go across fence and you say you know what would you do if you actually get to the other side it's hard to get a strong answer and you get the impression that for many people the goal is to breach the fence and to make this kind of symbolic gesture
rather than to get through on the other side because i think most people realize that there is such a heavy military presence all the way along the fence that even if they were to breach it i mean at the very best i possibly be arrested and at worst they will be shot dead but this may be an opportunity for them to win international sympathy to play
in the court of public opinion but of course at a terrible terrible cause disease or with so many people shot and wounded today right even if they were to breach the sense you're saying it doesn't seem like it would really matter the be matched outgunned that this is really about the symbolism of drawing attention to their cause
and perhaps that's really the goal i think that's right has anyone breached defense defense in reality is actually several layers in many places so there will be an electronic then there may be a ditch then to be a high burma on the other son so there have been instances where a protests
truth have pulled back the wire and maybe gotten through the first layer but certainly nobody seems to have gone through the multiple layers and come out the other side and israel proper
some of the protesters i spoke to today they described how they had spent the afternoon
they hadn't gone to the front of the protest they had run the risk of been shot by snipers if they managed to push forward to the fence itself there were engulfed and these clouds of either tire smoke that their own side had created or their engulfed in tear gas that the israelis were firing from the far side
and then one young man speaking to told me about how one person beside him was shot in the leg and other person coming up behind him will shorten the head he managed to avoid all of that but at the end of the day i said what did you achieve and he said well i managed to pull back and number of pieces of wire and then i got through the first layer and i hid behind
a little concrete wall for a while and then i ran back and he said for him that was successful today that was an achievement
at the best the goal is to cut some wire and pulled back a couple of bales of wire and those are the trophies that feel like then you see young people came back from the fence these lumps of wire that they've managed to take out of it but not really put a serious breach in the fence that so
i have to say that seems extremely futile and kind of sad that people who are demanding something so big are going away with something so small
yeah i mean you gotta ask yourself why you were young guys and you would want to take these huge risk your life to push towards the fence knowing that you could be shot down by an israeli soldier on the other side and when you talk to people and you get beyond the the rhetoric and the politics what you really get too often is just this
sense of desperation young people who will say i've never left his territory i have no job i'm living my parents but i'm unable to get married because i have no money and so there's a sort of attitude of people saying well to be honest i don't have much to lose so for me these protests were up option
usually to express myself and even if that involves a threat to my life for the potential of being killed that's the threat that i'm willing to take in order to make this point and trying to project their point of view into the world
funny our colleague david was saying that when the israeli state was recognized seventy years ago this joyous moment for israelis that same day is remembered as a catastrophe for palestinians and it feels like here we are again seventy years later to the day we have these two groups experiencing the same thing
ang the declaration of the embassy as in one case a moment of great joy and in the other as the ultimate injustice
that's right you use left to look at the contrasting scenes on this very small patch of land you know today we you have in jerusalem the ceremony at the embassy and then sixty miles down the road inside gaza you have the scenes of despair of violence and really i think for palestinians even the things that they thought
that they could count on for instance the fact that the us when at least consider holding out the position of the embassy as a as a bargaining chip and potential negotiations with the israelis that has been snatched away from them as well and the decision to move the embassy was really seen as an emblem of what they called that treachery
a deadline thank you very much it was a pleasure to soak to thank you too

in washington a spokesman for president
russia
blamed the casualties on palestinian leaders in gaza where where the reports of continued violence and guys and today
the responsibility for these tragic deaths rests squarely with hamas hamas is intentionally and cynically provoking this response
as a secretary of state said israel has the right to defend itself
the


huge what else you need to know
