
the

from the new york times and the team that brought you the daily this is kathy
just one to okay
are you saying me of something
swiss
oh i forgot the words it's a joke
electrodes michael one when in iraq did you first hear george
a nineteen ninety eight believe
i was at home
there was this
on t v a local tv there was some some videos like western new songs music videos music videos
there i have it
i was moved by the and how it a soft touch my heart
no i love metallic
oh then i guess a better question is how does somebody growing up in mosul fall in love with metallica
no offense to my in there were like in your in cars
some guys and it called metallic should listen to it
there's like work to buy any of these reports in there isn't any here and much as it was embargo a to remember that time and everything for or english or american it's like something forbidden
like given hush hush but you go to that's record show it was like one record shop yeah
the dire muscle and we were so lucky to have it
there's like and good looking at all
pictures of western music and everything
and it was so new to so i told them
me do you have metallic is yes of course which here you go two thousand and
anything know it does doesn't just give me some busy
best hit hit
but the first time after that
what the fuck is focus
just ah nice and kill
crying and another chapter
but after like two three times i listen to it

most of his songs totally this is your out
arnesen wars and why are we dine eight and a thing

say was born i've seen nothing in this country but wars and more wars and words
made some kind of connection that still deep with me
and from that
that's why i'm looking for

that has gotten to recapture nightfall this has been an occupation essentially by isis i'm all than two years and was the largest city in iraq captive by ice or find has now it's the only one they have black death as the beginning of what could be a long battle
ninety nine months of growling and all has left my and in ruins isis is hold on the city is down to less than half a square mile and so now and heavy urban guerrilla warfare
he settles into isis has pitted against the panels and and you're gonna eat
the full force and to us coalition

chapter seven mosul

good morning good morning
so
worth asking
this is where we got the seats
yeah there's a my p j s
pretty basic questions this morning
actually start off with on this
what what days
it's saturday night eighth two thousand and seventeen teeth has to seventeen and where are we were in iraq finally and basically iraqi forces are poised to take back most will be hearing that they're going to take back the city in twenty four to seventy eight hours
that timeline seems to be somewhat stretching it keeps on changing but no matter what i think it's somewhat eminent and after three years of isis holding the second largest city in all of iraq iraqi forces with coalition backing are poised to take a back
yeah
r c just came off the phone with a b m
and we're going to aim to leave around eleven i am so aim to be ready you an anti for eleven am i mean we need to be suited up in our bags bad for an overnight just in case yeah just in case
and you're going to meet you down the lobby
if anything changes hormone

let's start with the drive yet
so how can the current map study were in north iraq in the safe sound where were staying at a hotel
two hours
we are trying to get to western muscle to basically the last holdout that isis had i had a tip about a building that was in that area that i knew had been the headquarters of the has been under isis
and i just knew that if we could get there i mean i thought that if we could get them right when it was liberated we would find the motherland of documents
a year
as a checkpoint
in the car
we have are amazing drive her body
they don't need an awkward
we also have to security advisors one of them is rocky near and then we've got our international security and hi sorry
here you want me to talk about putting on under her job and then your heart
yeah how do you want to be identified
hawk of course am actually of spending quite a bit of time sitting with him in the backseat what is your pants do i learned a lot about whether his teacher
i used to be the i learned that he loves both george michael and metallica i started writing poetry
i don't know just came in and inspiration
but you've known them a lot on my have how is that you would describe hawk hoc fuck off
like huck is my translator and fix her so that i did like this program and he's asked my friend
he's really funny
oh my god like the half the time them with were laughing
he's a fabulous translator what's the frenchman
bella hope a law he's very methodical in terms of providing the accurate information providing me good translation about got caught by law who
lot he's a native language to grow up
he's born and bred in mosul i'm a descendant of these great great grandfather and what a lot of people don't get about muslim again
go back or budget and history is that this is in way one of the most ancient cities in the world
used have of cultures and religions province
area in which muzzle is located is mentioned in the old testament it's a history dates back thousands of years and they weren't the ones who started writing a very first thought it was near mosul that one of the tablets on which the epic of commission was written was found this is considered the earliest work of literature supposed to run grandfather's
mobilize the very first we'll in history
it's also a modern city it was the economic hub of the return there was a major university and if you were to walk through its were of flames
you could easily stumble upon villas that could have been airlifted out of santa barbara manicured lawns orange trees lemon trees and running through the heart of the city is the tigris river
it gets place where i want to clear my mind and if i'm like i said there something i would go directly to the record
sometimes i go for a depressing
just by the king of the revolution
magnificent feeling thanks will be
take all the stress you out
the moves like the rest of iraq paid a heavy price under the increasingly tyrannical rule of saddam hussein he tracked the country into conflict after conflict that the eight year around war the incursion into quake and this in turn lead to
sanctions that impoverished iraqi people and our fellow citizens then in two thousand and three at this hour the us invaded iraq american and coalition forces or in the early stages of military operations to disarm iraq to free it's people and to defend the world from grave danger
two thousand and three it wasn't final examination yet in college and their has gaming to cover been wracked at that point in time hulk was just getting ready to graduate from university and he remembers welcoming us forces and being hopeful that rebuild you're going to do this and that it would be the start of an even further modern
a nation of muscle and of iraq of i was like looking at japan and germany and it was like think to myself going to get some basis year and you're going to flourish
i mean as a country but actually what happened i thought
your your car bars
suicide attacks targeted assassinations five more americans were killed in action today
getting worse and worse and pretty soon it had devolved into a chaotic ground work and least eighteen people were killed and iraq after a car bomb exploded at a crowded theatre all that chaos was the perfect soil for a growing insurgency
the insurgents were at first fighting the american invaders the crusaders as they called them but very soon the also turned on fellow muslims they began targeting the shia sect saying that they were not true believers that they had rejected the true thing that this is like oh allow will grow exactly you noble noble
because keep in mind the leader of the insurgency was a man named i sub we he was the founder of the group that goes on to become isis and according to files that were just recently declassified by the cia he was in muscle as early as two thousand and three and there he began laying the groundwork recruiting followers
there's recruiting fighters and building cells inside the city

so year after year as the chaos in the nation
this little group that begins with just a few dozen fighters grows there are gaining ground they're gaining acolytes and follow worse
come on point
as poss
rush on a lot more her home mom
and when the us finally pulls out and the last soldiers leave iraq in the final weeks of twenty eleven afternoon nine years
america's war in law will be older
much more did
they hand over most mosul to the iraqi military and to corrupt officials entities underground cells that were in some ways lying in wait all along
they shouldn't have
anyhow
then comes
and by the summer of twenty four team isis had reached the outskirts of muzzle with what people say was just a few hundred fighters they sent word to their supporters inside so can you tell me just personally
what were you doing base and then they ambushed to city
massive gunshots everywhere
my room
then my friend called me and he said
my neighborhood is falling told them what they should always good forces are pulling out how to get a word phone call from a friend of hers and the friend of saying using the kind for i did i'm okay is going to be okay robberies are no no you don't notice that and hug advice has found that this is nothing security forces were everywhere
rich world like crawling security forces river a good marriage everything
there are thousands of iraqi troops in and around the city they have humvees they have sophisticated rifles these been fully equipped to buy american forces were saying it's bunch of tourist and they be average
the he like many of the people in mosul and probably like most of iraq had no sense absolutely no sense that the city good for her
to be the next morning
to my surprise
i woke up by the morning
my father said don't god was like what they're talking about
oh shit divorce her though
my father i want to see what's going on
joining walked out on my roof top
they saw by my own eyes
hobbies were burning
the compounds army of bonds were run
it's all been far
fireworks
everyone
another major piece of what america or more in iraq was lost today the fight proving too much for the us drained iraqi soldiers emotional today we saw sporadic gunfire and burning military be it'd be a surgeon
we stations right
and government built some and reportedly discarding the uniforms abandoning the military on vehicles and weapons it could take weeks or longer for iraqi troops to recapture the city of mosul





so in this timeline as takes over muzzle in june
the crater calif fade from there in july
and then what first there was this kind of what you know
very soon within i would see the first week of their arrival with days
backed or city terms progressing
they began positioning people in traffic circles and they were handing out a pamphlet or flyer to people through the windows of their cars was first large because of that it was on a flyers they were is
the pamphlet was something called the torture of the city to this is what we have abided by it laid out in a constitution like form both the new rules under which the population would now be governed and they were saying that we are coming here we want to be equal call the security
force to handle their weapons under to save repent is their promise to the people
their promise was you have lived under these infidel regimes you have seen what a disaster it's been male you going to see a huge difference but the islamic state corruption is not going to be allowed they are now going to live in a virtuous society and that they are going to see the fruits of that virtue as a result
their citizenship in this coffee
so what does
first or so before you and i came to so how can i had traveled to a bunch of different towns not just mosul to the town north of the city to didn't have a planes to the town of nimrod yeah
as other day he said
little and in all of these locations we spent a lot of our time speaking to people who had spent years living and thong
the money and time and again the thing that how can i kept hearing is that isis was actually addressing some of the longstanding grievances they had had with the previous rocky government says
despite all this bad boy
so for example the side wants
yes one day how can i were in the town north of mosul where we met a guy who sold tickets on the side of the street he told us about how one day a customer came to him he picked out a asked him to slaughter i did when he headed over the chicken the customer open his wallet and said i'm so sorry only have half the money from a non
the merchant accepted the money on the understanding that this guy would pay back and then week after week the guy refused to learn and the others so there's a good year
limit the amount of money that this guy was staffed was literally a couple of dollars and explained to me that under the iraqi government he wouldn't have bothered to put in a police report because the bride you would have had to pay would have been probably more than the amount of money he was trying to recuperate
but under isis he said that he went to the police station the isis policemen took down the complained he didn't take a bribe
he sent out one of his officers to investigate they found the guy who hadn't paid and within a couple of days they got the guy to happen
we went to a couple of small towns where people for as long as they remember they'd never been able to have board and four five maybe six hours of electricity a day and they said that isis came in and they sent a committee of electrical engineers to go study the problem and they fixed it now
you couldn't turn on all of your appliances at the same time you could use air conditioners or big things like that but people now said that twenty four seven around the clock they could at least turn on the lights how was garbage collection during that time
this was there in one of the near universal things
that people told how can i can compare before ice and then when isis came what the garbage collection how it changed is that the street cleaner
after good and this is the thing where to this day i don't think people understand us it was a functioning society it was a functioning state it was not recognized by anybody but in some ways day usurped and the better than the government that they replaced and that's that's pretty crazy
yeah
except if you're and isis this as a group that that has always known how to mine local grievances and use them to their advantage bear trying to grow this global calif fate and in twenty four team and early twentieth left him it was working they were growing
life is spreading wider and wider operative iraq and syria have moved into libya they've established training camp in libya they seized a one hundred mile stretch of coastline on the mediterranean facing europe they took over an entire city in the philippines
iran really good audio message in which it appears the pledge allegiance to be broke all the while much food they were taking and pledges of allegiance from over a dozen countries all over the world deprive them of chronic state and their ideological program of establishing and islamic calibrate in places where the existing governments were either nonexistent
or week or corrupt and their promise of a more organized a more stable a less corrupt leadership
it was able to find an audience at their peak this is a group that had territory that rival the size of great britain and the governed a population of over twelve million people so truly black flags devices are being lifted up on different continents yeah all over the were all over the world
you know one of the analyst for spoken to set to me that isis has capacity to cover and is more worrying than the capacity of their fighters
but of course i wanted to talk about the imposition of the dress code on women if you're living in the california
or in the street or painting
men even as you're seeing your streets getting cleaner guard your face from her head and those even as you're saying certain public services being provided better than they ever were before that women are not allowed to girl tell us they have avail you also feeling the heavy hand of isis
once the first time you saw the his or the religious please do remember they were wearing white uniforms
and a brown kind of what it called you invest like a vest and it's written that husband and pretty soon or drugs or alcohol or smoking of course in his the officers began pulling people decide if annuities are good good bit be lashed or he would be like that they were carrying out public punishments this is a
what was evident in syria and yeah the same thing happened all over iraq residents describe heavy handed depression and brutality under the role of these islamic extremists and the violence just escalated the group has released a video report is least showing the be heading of the kurdish man in the city of mosul cursed go beheading
their own citizens people that they're accusing of being spies of applicants they become was breaking news late ten day a brutal video surfaced showing then they start decapitated western journalists video appears to show the forty year old james foley on his knees and an orange prison jumpsuit with this executioner next to him only a knife in his left hand
gathering or something like that guy i don't adore the next to them by the want to hear they're going to share their actually i camped a chance years the look at adulterers are being stoned to death thieves are having their hands cut off they began to take suspected homosexuals to the top of tall buildings the stills dated march
two thousand and fifteen
show a man being thrown from a building where they were blindfolded their hands were tied behind our backs and they were thrown to their jobs his alleged crime being gay so it was depression to me and i imagine israel because they were kept in my house in the entire two and a half years i would say it's only like thirty times that you aren't yeah
there's of your of your home via and overtime the violence got more and more creative if if i can use that word and frankly weird
blake they took a captured soldier
they made him stand bound in front of a tank
and truth the tank
the tread crushing this poor man and they're just filming all the yeah they're creating slickly produced propaganda videos out as many of these
they took the members of a tribe that revolted against islamic state they were put inside of a cage the cage was lowered
inside the body of water and they have cameras on them and these people were chained inside the cage
in another they took people inside of a slaughterhouse
and they hung them from the ceilings
like animals and slit their throats and the bleed out
yeah we were so do i say subjugated by so anything they say would just like comply directed without any hesitation
why why this level of violence like why is this kind of grotesque blood lust
this is hard to talk about without i think upsetting people so on the one hand when you see these videos
so disgusting and so savage that the first thing you want to do is to say this is evil
these are sociopaths these are monsters
the thing that is that is lost in all of them
is that this is strategies
also
what is as the does that mean
it's a couple of things number one what they'll tell you is that this is god's law this is really important to them this is basically a fundamental underpinning of what they claim to be doing so even in their most horrific videos if you take the time to look at the transcripts will you'll see is that they spend an inch
normal amount of time providing a religious justification for what they're doing
so for example that horrific video that shows a man being crushed underneath the treads of a tank if you go and look at the transcript
you'll see them explain that the victim the person that has been count is himself a former tank operator for the syrian military era
other than site at the principle of sauce this is a principal in islamic jurisprudence it's an eye for an i basically you do this to me i do this to you
and so they don't justify it he killed people with tanks we are also going to kill him with a tech i see right but secondly they are also aware that they are now in control of a huge stretch of land were presumably a lot of people didn't want them to be there and so they used to finance
as a form of intimidation through out the cafe day set up open air theaters screens they were they were set up in one could places and traffic circles even in schools
and on a continuous loop they were showing the most horrific videos
and say you were wherever you turned in the hell of a you are constantly being reminded of what happens to you if you stand up to the islamic state
the third aim with all of this grotesque violence is i think there must ambitious
and that is that they believe that through these these spectacles of violence this theater of savagery they are going to terrorize the enemy
and they're going to terrorize the enemy into both letting them exist
as a state and eventually they're going to terrorize the enemy into accepting their way of life
but this is also where i think you see isis hubris i've long wondered if they had just stuck to a caliph that was only in iraq and syria without doing any attacks in the west i wonder if you and i would still be talking
about that calif eight now about that territory now but instead they put more and more emphasis on these attacks overseas and eventually it was this a strategy environments it was this constant drumbeat of attacks that in the end forces the west to we engage in a way it really didn't want to
boots on the ground by american british and french troops a coalition of countries that come together to try to route i sound

right ahead of us as a house destroyed an airstrike you can see that pancaked roth completely flat when you see that that means men the coldness
there was a nice fighting position
some sort of isis brother has concluded
really sad initially houses which opens for like this
if isis is defeated
today your city will be liberated doesn't make you happy
it's really complicated question
because no military liberation is about to be complete
we're going to talk about chivalry is are going to talk about infrastructure
so houses a total city that has destroyed and this is the is a victory
so i don't know whether i should be or
he is that the way i feel i can really feel happy



within hours
yeah our seeing forty eight hours seventy two hours that's what they mean
so we truly truth and true for all day and the whole time i was taking my phone i had a map of where the iraqi military was positioned in mosul and i was watching this little island the land that isis still held shrinking and shrinking a rabbit
okay
okay and then to complicate things we were told that there's a media blackout reporters were not being allowed in at all
and so at the end of the day not having been able to go inside which checked them with our sources to see where things start
it's not over yet
nothing
isis managed to get through the day

that evening
we were terrific to an abandoned house that was on the outskirts of western muscle
oh say about six miles from the first check points going into the hardest part of lot america yes it's a house that has been commandeered by the iraqi army and put some of their soldiers insight here but mainly they're using it to house local journalist
personally suffered from isis
because it was cooked oysters
so we spent the evening talking to them swapping stories almost all of us
we have dinner you just give me a rundown of the damn where you opens tomorrow united states and canada
a hurry up and wait day
throw up here
it was more than three hours to get your before
then we waited for the colonel who as pathetic as to the front
i think you will take us there tomorrow
but it's were cutting it off because if the city false tomorrow then basically one day on the ground
did you find any anything new out about
why they have this ban for not letting anyone in one theory is that it is too dangerous and just i think yesterday a group of a rocky journalists are somehow got separated from the soldiers they were with and gotten removed inside a building and were literally surrounded by
i think overnight
two of them were killed
and the others made it out today some it might be the danger and as it was getting raped
we started to get ready to back down but it was just so hot and really so loud in the house
that you and i are going out and hunk a couple of other members of our team
decided to go up onto the roof
we dragged a couple of foam mattress is that there we put down our sleeping bags
and i'm a purchase looking at the stars and thinking about the fact that this particular patch of sky has witnessed so much end tomorrow is going to be another notch in the lifeline of muscle a pretty important one
the day perhaps that isis is defeated
and it's going to be our job
to explain what that looks like the world
that was pretty humbling to think of that
as we as
honestly
