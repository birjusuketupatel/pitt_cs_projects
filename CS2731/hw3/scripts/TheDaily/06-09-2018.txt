


from the new york times and the team that brought you the daily this is kathy
good
what we're up to me lie i slept
what appears to be an event and villa here
on the outskirts of western muscle as we were in bed
with the counterterrorism division of the iraqi security force
and we were supposed to take off at eight or now sitting in the armored car that they provided for us
car is not your armored cars about turning on though
having a gaggle of men that are
pouring over the hood trying to figure out how to get this car car started
there's a rumor that it may just be at a gas could that is a route they're just figured out against great great
is it just out of days
temporary the briefcase
eventually after several hours yeah we get a working car and to go so we suit up we put on flak jackets to put on
i've got several trash bags
with the elite and counterterrorism force of the iraqi army
their permission to go and collect documents wednesday
and we've told them that were specifically trying to get to one building years or so
just goes but it's unclear if it's going to be safe enough to go there but there's a sniper risking their winning an airstrip
in fact they've warned us that we're driving into an active worse


no inside muslim
the main room
there's huge chunks missing on the road
those air strikes
russia of certainty that

how could you describe what you see
shaking your head really
yeah
i'm speechless
as you can select
cars
that was to have to have to be known as cars and degree in
or
i can tell i'm i know as much it's i don't know what a
you don't even recognize it
stuff

we got into the city
we got a car yeah
what do you see
they were parked on a narrow street
in western muzzle the house is all around us have been destroyed the windows up and blasted about coils of reaper the gates and windows of the shops
are warped from whatever blast they experienced we just open the doors to the car and immediately you could smell the stench of dead bodies we can't see them but you can smell them


so next we went to night
that's kind of like a makeshift base basically the closest the military position to where we are trying to go inside there were all of these young military men they were actually from the city asked the counterterrorism server say and they're the people that were embedded with so they invited us and and you
talking with some time
right click for sure
the commanders all have the same sort of phone and sort of i pad that has a mouth
isis
that shows you incorrectly town friend
spot where the friendly forces are and where as so real so the building were aiming for was actually a church this is the place but i knew has been the headquarters of the has been that the religious police the same unit that that was a fun used to be a member of the has been building
he's right here it's at that point is running
hoc recognize the sly and you went on my cart were actually

have these buildings
all so the officer who was in charge of this remains say that he's gonna try to find something is going to try to find us an escort to go to the historical
he assigned a couple of iraqi soldiers to escort us as we were going to go into this these buildings to be productive speak of like meters to be like
it would have been a couple of minutes walking if there was ruined
they walking and naturalists that to be trained how to clamber over for all of this problem
climbing over it looks like he's to be a taxi are we were walking on top of the doorways poking through windows curving around the pillars of homes that had
the no climbing over pieces of wood want to believe
a cloak use it as
so on this walk that we took towards church
it became very apparent just how close you
somebody has to the front lines i mean in a way hearing the sounds reassuring
because it's a signal that we were where we needed to be good run out and get out some trash bags were about to go into the building
finally we got to the church and did you just quit before we walk in what sort of things you're hoping to find
we know that they have careful very detailed meticulous records of the people they arrested and the severe punishments but they needed out against them and obviously that would just be the gold mine of variables
the second we walked and even though it was destroyed this has on number i knew right away that have been an isis spaces the isis weekly newsletter they had graffiti the pillars and other walls with the word but what what does that mean the key word the that which means remaining an expanding and this is their slogan
this is think of it as isis forever
plenty of computers
hard drives yen town
we found this way on
a couple of did
the mulder we found two bodies that the iraqi military said would than isis fighters
gets to get first and we don't walk over their bodies
just seriously
yeah i mean i hate to sound clinical about this but to me it was my confirmation that were in place for is a place that isis fighters were in that the protected and they die for
so searching for documents what what's the first thing that you're looking for
so i'm looking for the areas that are related to papers i'm looking for furniture desks filing cabinets shouts closets
i'm looking on the floors
hey her
i wanted to ask
if it's possible to pick up that backpack that's what we saw a backpack
it's pink bad that has a kitten on it and it's filled with the for which is the explosive that they use in their homemade rockets
don't bring it
in that same area
there were shell casings remnants of weaponry
after the side there was a hole in the ground that look like it was the tunnel we know that isis uses tunnels as a way to go underneath the building and come out and another one so that they avoid the tax from the allergen at the bar
op has found an old sword and they found one of the it's that they used for executions to thank you
the people yes
actually able to pick it up and and hold it
now it's thought that was a certain feeling yeah you describe what you're doing
looking at a notebook here have the courage and then we started to find the remnants of the documentary series with yeah and you on the ground you picked up a toy and piece of paper it was from the letterhead of the has anything remaining meaning we found
several bikers that were labeled the one of his but which means for ministry of the religious police and this downturn a found says the same business this found their spine the binders had been bhutto of the his book so when the road with the binders were empty
what place pike
was the scene of a crime that had already been searched i don't know who searched before us that isis come through here and take away all of these records because we knew that they would reveal the accounting of the various war crimes they committed was that another security force that was here before the one that we are with but no matter what their records that i was looking for
they will on
still gunfire

and on a certain point in a hurry to get back people are starting to feel nervous about how much time we had spent in this area that we had expose ourselves for too long ago
kind of thing i could go
definitely one of those people who was feeling nervous
so he began to walk back and two of our colleagues have already walked off and you and i and hock are walking in a smaller group a little bit further behind
and suddenly her cause
because he recognized that often a sign of the church i hadn't even noticed that there was a cluster of buildings and he recognized them because he had worked as a translator format more sense
he was outed by a neighbour and he was hauled off to see one of the caddies the religious touch in this building who threw them in jail for basically i i think a night
there was a risk
question here and so we met us to make her way through the debris there and we entered the room that's what used to this this is the judges robe
ago and the cardio ropes were still hang the rule but he was wearing when he was charging people like hulk hulk remember sitting in that fairy tale
a the you
my name off we go through his desk we see that the drawers have already been pulled out and heart just took off and like ended up going into the next set of rooms and the next other rooms
many more buildings
government and suddenly he came walking out
this with a briefcase
he was putting it down to try to get the dust off of it
and he unzipped the main zipper and suddenly i saw i d's financial reports receipts and i recognized very quickly the islamic state uncle on those papers
just enough to realize that this was something really significant
ever wonder because it actually was so hot and we had been out in the sun for so on the cable and my microphone rank was melting a microphone was going in and out and that was fidgeting with it you guys were over there talking in it was in this moment that the new york times push came through your
i'm your attempts to iraq or government claims muzzles been taken saying that the iraqi government was claiming victory and most all right




just explain what you're doing as you to hell down because it's going to be a lot of crap that that isn't this in this trash bag of of stuff that we're bringing out really dirty okay so you and how can i get back to our hotel in a safe part of iraq
let's take off your shoes we grab one of the garbage bags with some of the stuff that we've gotten in mosul
the briefcase
can just walk me through like what are the steps that you take next sure
so we put on surgical gloves
and we empty out the contents of the garbage bag
oh
oh you just go this will cause district
it's like what you would smell if you were in an air strike and a building was falling around you
and we start making piles were going to make pile of important and unimportant okay what we're seeing right away is as a card that this person's prank grow
protect her there are books every received suitcase there are financial reporter so honest take the receipts motherfuckers there are memos modes
how exciting
there are letters on isis stationary between different ministries of i says and this like attorney general
having detailed discussions about aspects of the economy
this is very new evidence of a bunch of departments i didn't know existed as there are people's ideas
years is there a c d roms and eventually everything that we have is going to be translated and the best part is going to be sent to specialists who are going to help us mine every bit of the information we have
tell me how you feel really really excited over like getting you know
i will admit that i've never felt more like a detective finding clues
on isis that
you know when i'm holding these documents the thing that's never far from my mind is that if we hadn't retrieved fairly papers from the rubble be very likely would have been destroyed and would have been lost forever and started to slow you down but will you just described what the bag looks like so it's a black laptop glad that that i so when it comes
to the briefcase specifically yeah what made it so impersonal yeah he forfeited time
so the documents were pulling out of the briefcase he he's like some kind of accounting for something help confirm and flesh out the reporting i've already been doing up until this point after you just described how it looks looks for the organizer investors like actual actual
kind of watch it yeah sure
and that is that isis is a self sustaining organism when it comes to its own finances much like the united states makes money from a million different sources so to isis had a diversified portfolio they were making money from the fields that they taxed from the seeds that they sold to people from the
wow it went to mills and from the traders who were being taxed as they were moving flowers from one city to another and from the merchants who stalked those commodities who had to pay income taxes once a year
and why is that specifically important to know so what of the major ways that america and european governments try to combat terrorism since nine eleven was to try to store of these groups of cash in the early years all kind of the way they did this is they would look for their external donors and they would freeze
their bank accounts
but there are no major donors in the ecosystem that as isis because the group is self financed there's no bank account and saudi arabia that you can freeze that would have any meaningful impact on the letter of the islamic state there's not even a single source of weapons that you can cut off because according to one of the other documents we found in the briefcase
faculty of military manufacturing and development oh my god oh my god this is a razor they had a division and side of their military that was dedicated to the manufacturing of weaponry and kissing this is a river
the piece of paper the heart will only touch with gloves you're just kissed
to create a very important part of going to put that
so basically this is indicating that within the islamic state there's a unit that is dedicated to manufacturing and developing weaponry
assume that this is there because they're doing the dumb and such a uniform passion but this is it finally you know what is this a group that was hell bent on been independent her on being self sufficient on relying on know what
this guy who the owner of this band and indus briefcase some go and some head gotten some big big should we found transactions totaling nineteen million dollars we actually took the time to add up the receipts and invoices that we found inside and that's what we came up with ninety million right
we knew that whoever owned this briefcase
had to be important
hi up like a general or something like that not a general a bureaucrat

so unlike the united states which went into iraq in two thousand and three and immediately dissolved the bath us state of saddam hussein and essentially through all of these people these administrators into unemployment and created the conditions that eventually led to to the rise of terror groups in
iraq
isis did the exact opposite they came to muzzle and they built their state on the back of the one that are already existed
and so the civil servants who had worked in the ministry of agriculture and the department of sanitation and the electricity division they kept doing the same job that they had done before
true brother sorry this so we know that whoever it was who on his briefcase they worked as a bureaucrat that's right and beyond that what were able to figure out from looking at the papers it's all the same name is that the person's name is obliterate we're seeing paper paper signed with this name
actually help us identify who this human being is because i put her on is a code name of the cornea it's a nom de guerre and the whole purpose of having a kenya is to hide the identity of the person who's who's nice
but in the briefcase in one of the fault of the briefcase we pulled out a color xerox have an id belonging to a man named yasir arafat other you see his picture it's a man with a receding hairline with bulbous knows bushy eyebrows and kind of saddam hussein our style mustache
and then pulled out the marriage certificate of us are escorted this an important but finally the document that we pull out that seals the deal is yes there is tighter of allegiance to isis
i'm going to put that in important
we see that in twenty fourteen not long after our most all fell in mosul he pledged allegiance to the islamic state it has his full name and says that hairs kenya or his nom de guerre is about her so we now know yes or his or his avatar okay
and average aura is the administrator of the division so now you know his job title on now we know his jacket got married married
his real name within his own name you know his wife's may you know his wife's day you know when not it all hang on let's put that in the sky
what do you do next right so now that we have all this information
we're looking for somebody who might have interacted with him and in the briefcase we found a whole bunch of documents from local mills in northern iraq and especially from the area
nevertheless they hook up with them and so how can i ended up driving from mil to mil trying to find people who might remember a man named
you and the employees of the mills and the silos and the greenery
and the very people who had dealt with isis leadership
gave recognized as name
and they knew him specifically as one of isis is money
he was a person who was
deposited by isis to come and collect cash
yeah
they said he was very taciturn really kind of just business as always
and one of the people who interact with the most with he said
up
he always had a black laptop briefcase with him

so on his id there's a couple of clues that led us to be able to identify his address it lists the name of his parents his mother and his father and crucially it lists his tribal affiliation he's from the audi tribe which is an important tribe from central iraq
using those close we were able through our colleagues in the baghdad bureau to track down his family in a suburb of summer
so this was after i'd already feinberg states when you and hawk and your manager and remark
you guys actually went to the house of the honor of the briefcase right
yeah
so
we walk in and first of all it had all of the trappings of this aristocratic house
enormous high ceilings chandelier and every single rom beautiful tapestries in this enormous like banquet hall sort of space
this is the
who's there
is there has been as went on his older brother
it's the family of the owner of the briefcase it's has uncle it's his brothers it's several of his cousin
was that was basically a lot of maintenance
and they immediately begin playing on that they raise their voices they're angry at our suggestion that obama was a member of isis and they say to us how can this even be possible
this is the scion of an important family he had all of his needs taken care of he had no need for money why is that you can go to be pointing to their money in this way there's almost an accepted hypothesis i would call it a cliche or even a mean that members of isis have joined for material
that they did it for the money because his or her were poured they were kinda birds they were these kind of hapless people who had no other outlets and the big bad terrorist group comes along and basically buys them off
i have found that that hypothesis is mostly hollow and if you dig even slightly below the surface you'll find that people that tried did so because we have some ideological infinity pneumonia
yeah and he was employed by the director it off the hear someone of salmonella
up to this point they don't know that i have the records in my backpack showing exactly how good iraq join this group and as i mentioned that they begin to tell us a story that goes i think a long way to explaining why this young man would have joined the islamic state
the family described to us that soon after the us invasion in two thousand and three in the middle of the night
the door was beaten down by us soldiers who came in with their with their money boots and dragged the elderly patriarch of the family which your granddaughter out of his bedroom and took him away to be questioned because of an idea that had gone off on a nearby road you saying that they they blamed him they were lame
yeah i'm i'm going into they blame the grandfather for having planted a landmine that took the lives of of several us marines
as it turned out he must not have been guilty because the family told us that he was released the next day
this is a wealthy affluent family that is used to people telling to them that is used to people taking their shoes off when they come and that is used to getting getting flattered you know getting gifts getting talk to in a polite way and this was an incredibly humiliating incident
and one of the details that stuck with the family but they told me about his grandfather was actually an and you walk with crutches and when the soldiers came and they screamed at him to to follow them he didn't understand what was going on and as it was he couldn't walk and so they grabbed him by his arms and literally pulled him
down the stairs and then up the driveway the family remembers his feet bobbing and hitting the stairs that was as there was going down and then and then seeing him dragged through the dirt up there there inclined well as neighbors came out to gawk or more warm and
it was bad enough that the american commander in the area came and apologize to the family and we got that account not just from the family but also from the police station up the street
so
at a certain point we hear a woman's voice from the hallway
i see
no it's explained to me that this is the mother of arbitrary he's very curious about what's happening because you understand that we're talking about her son but because there's a conservative family she did not feel that it was appropriate for her to join us but she has her ear to the door and hear something that upsets her and suddenly she's yelling through the door
this isn't it
when they were so what we did is monique invited the mother
to come with me and with him
and hock to a table that was essentially at the other end of this cavernous partner
i'm all for what
but because i want
and we sat across from her at this beautiful teak table covered in lace i remember that there was a crystal ball in the middle and one by one we started pulling out the documents
and then
she started
he's hitting her own face with her palm
and then very soon after that she has started weeping that
oh well
whoa whoa
yeah
through a lot of you said oh did i
was asleep
graeme that
all of items like the
it also afraid own
she had concerns about the people he was hanging out with when isis took over
any extremists tennessee's and then the second thing he said is for them
they out of all of my sons or he is the one who took the humiliation of his grandfather the worst on there
human only own business but what what all
it's the
yeah a level
tell her cousins
i have how many letters i have spoken to could tell her it's not ok
yet
and here is where you see the catch twenty two of using military power to try to address terrorism
we know that the us invasion created a buddha ross created people like this young man who were humiliated who were angry and who turned that anger into affiliation with this terror group and it's because of that very phenomenon that that the obama administration put off the eventual into
mention that only reached muscle and the five twenty six team because they wanted local forces to lead the fight they didn't want to have us troops on the ground veering that this would just perpetuate the cycle but if you don't use monetary my what you have is the rise of muscle so both as
news in different ways can lead to the further spawning of the group right the world is divided into the interventionist camp and the past the first cap
and what i have seen from my reporting is the intervention leads to the withdraws the non intervention leaving the syrian civil war to drag on for years leaves topple hussein france

so where's a goon draw now
i don't know
i repeatedly asked the family where he is and i'll do they were very clear and saying that they knew that he's top five which led me to think that they must be talking to him
they were incredibly vague about his whereabouts now going so far as to say that they have no contact with him they're not sure where he's at etc
i mean for all i know he could have been upstairs the whole time that we're talking
i mean regardless of whether or not he really was upstairs
what we do now is that thousands of members thousands have managed to escape they shaved after beards they cut off their hair they changed her clothes they slipped into a refugee camps they managed to get back into europe and they're out there
but we also know is that some of them were captured

why are they telling us rest of your control
i think that's necessary
this
