today republicans in the house and senate have reached a deal on the taxpayer why it keeps moving fast but remains so unpopular
the f c c is expected to appeal president obama as net neutrality most what would the internet of two thousand and seventeen look like without regulation
it's thursday december fourteen
as a candidate i promise we would pass a massive tax good for the everyday working american families who are the backbone and the heartbeat of our country wednesday afternoon president from fresh off what had been a brutal election defeat
alabama the night before
he stood out in the white house and delivered what the white house had called a closing argument for the tax for bill gym tankers reports on taxes and the economy he was surrounded by family is leon and maria
i would love you to discuss your middle class tax cut a little bit with the millions of people watching right now on television he let them talk about how great this bill will be not just for them but for their communities thank you mr president god bless you will continue to keep praying for you and your team as you move forward and forge ahead
with this new future in america god bless you
he can be my minister anytime
a lot of middle class families don't think this will benefit them emotionally two thirds of the country thinks they will ever get a tax increase or no tax cut it all so the president here i think was trying to give you something related will you american taxpayer to say hey hero people who believe they're going to do well from this cut and who buy
the way said very nice things about the president and he was very happy here those things many of your predecessors promised that this reformers coming but you did it
while the present is at the white house with these middle class families getting this final sale speech about the republican tax plan what is happening with this tax plan over in congress which as i recall pass this bill a couple of weeks ago probably giving both of them
selves and the president their biggest legislative victory so far as your right so the bill has passed the house and has passed the senate but it hasn't passed both of them in the same form so the houses that have have convened the conference committee to work out the differences and wednesday morning hours before the president takes the podium the last few months or so cause the news wires and eight
he had now indicates that republicans in the house and republicans in the senate have at least agreed in principle on a solid reconcile version of the tax reform bill that will move forward there was an announcement that kind of leak out off of capitol hill that there was an agreement in place on a bill that will be calm they believe the bill they sent to the president next week it's
flashes the top tax rate for the wealthiest individuals to thirty seven percent and reduces the corporate tax rate to twenty one percent president trumps says businesses and americans would also see cuts early next year this bill passed both the house and senate with basically no democratic support so what are democrats now saying about the final appearance
of the democrats are furious the american people are witnessing a master class in how one political party relying on secrecy distortion and brute force can muffle an unpopular deaf a third exploding corporate giveaway to passage they also are already starting to
warn that if deficits increase republicans will turn to cutting social safety net programs such as medicare and social security in order to make up the difference and reduce the national debt going forward and they are warning that that would be essentially another transfer of wealth from poor people who are helped by those programs to the more wealthy people who are benefiting from nice
tax cuts a final bill will come with tarnishing price tag and it's found that do a terrible job getting help the don't need it and they're furious because they just won an election in alabama and they think that their new democratic senator from alabama should be allowed to take his seat for this bill goes for in light of laughs
eight election german i do not believe that we should be old introduced me to in fact i think it's imperative that we respect the will of the people of alabama and delay any further action on this too experimental senator electrons can be sued the democratic argument is essentially recent history that in two thousand and ten why that nine twenty four power
public can say that our panelists state of massachusetts after senator ted kennedy died there was a special election in massachusetts a republican one it and when that happened democrat stopped the process of passing the affordable care act until he was seated following the election we are strong words from sen mitch mcconnell
leader of a republican party in which he quote stated in radically i think the message of the moment is that the american people all across the country are asking girls even are the most liberal state massachusetts the stop this health care bill
what the democrats do we waited to respect the will of the people of massachusetts quite simply even what it was hard and against our own politics democrats did the right there you're allowed senator brown to cast a vote on final passage of the year
i hope we could do the same today in the republican response is that senate election in two thousand and ten was entirely about health care and the roi more don't jones race was hardly at all about taxes and there is no reason to stop the process now it's almost over
lame duck senators wrote all the time they are not seriously considering stopping the bill on those grounds
as this victory toward draws closer i mean we are so close right now so close fact almost i don't want to talk about it maybe we should talk about it
in september
illustration and congressional leaders released sort of an outline of their taxes when by november start of november they had an actual bill on the house by the middle of november they had a bill in the senate by the end of november of the very start of december and the bill had passed both thousand the senate that is very very fast quite possibly the fastest you we've seen for
a major piece of non emergency legislation in a really long time and that speed has done is produced the bill that is likely to get in under the wire of things like this alabama special election changing the calculus in washington and politics but is also yielded a bill that a majority of
the public does not like and then a majority the public thinks will not help them and so there has been a success on the speed not as much success on the sale and now we get to see which ones more important for about it
thank you jane
thank you
this moment will be forever remembered as a great new beginning the dawn of a brilliant american future shining with patriotism prosperity and pride
with your help we will bring back or germs we will bring back our wealth as a country
and for every citizen across this beautiful and we will bring back our great american dreams thank you and god bless you all thank you very much

will be like back
yeah
it spans the globe like a super highway it is called internet
the net began back in nineteen sixty nine and was it tore the pentagon nowadays just about any computer and a modem join given what was the internet it's beginning what was the philosophy of oil was
started as this sort of defense department project to connect computers can lose right about the internet for the times and it evolved through the decades into what we now know as the world wide web
going on in recruits offices and classrooms around the world a revolution and which fifteen million people are taking part when i became president there were just fifty websites on the world wide web
now there are seventeen million and almost fifty million households online in the united states alone there sharing scientific data arguing philosophy or passing on cooking to have some gossip
open source decentralized royalty free new system where anyone can put up anything everyone has access to the same tools and all days created equally and treated equally you need a computer and phone and suddenly you're part of a new measure of people programs archives
ideas so no one is in control of the arena in infinite star any condition that way
yeah i think the early advocates for the internet envisioned it has a place where people could be free you is this stateless thing that was outside corporate control that would allow everyone equal footing i mean who is the ceo of the internet and there is no there is no one with the sort of red button that they can push to stop the internet it is
by nature decentralized than open thing
and when did that start to change i think it started to change in the early two thousand and one moment that seems particularly crucial is this case in two thousand and five that involved a small internet service provider in north carolina called madison river communication
they provided high speed internet as well as phones and other types of connection into their customers and one of the decisions that they made that was very faithful was to block and what's called voice over internet protocol services which are like internet phone services because
they made their own phone services right they wanted their customers to use madison river phone lines and he has snuff out the services other competitor yes that's so they were trying to do and vomit edge on edge
they had these crazy commercials with though
agree on every station
broadband ago
so van ives was this early voice over internet protocol company that made an internet calling service that would bypass your traditional phone line and they had about they said two hundred customers on madison or communications internet service who were being blocked
from using advantage and they thought were being shut out of these people's business just because they're internet service provider has a conflict and be on their own phone service to and essentially you had to ideological camps that open up about how the internet should function and one as the sort of dumb pipe
theory which is that the internet and the way it's delivered to you should be a lot like the running water in your house you open your tap water comes out you turn on your computer and internet connection comes out and the pipes that carry that internet to you shouldn't be able to prioritize certain types of data over others they shouldn't be able to say
this type of video will run at this speed but this other type of video or run much slower and you can't access these five sites because we don't like those five sites are we on our own five sites that compete with those five states that's the dumb paid theory and advantage is on that side they say we are an internet based service provide
writer customers should be able to use us regardless of whether their internet service provider has a competing serbs
the other side his medicine or communication side which is i guess you could call the smart paved theory which is that hey we built these pipes we built the infrastructure that delivers high speed internet to our customers we have the right to treat data within our system however we want to treat it and if that means shutting off on
a german there are things that compete with their own products then that's her prerogative and if customers don't like it they can go out and find someone else to give them internet and in a larger ecosystem of the internet who sides with the dump height theory and who sides with the smart pipe theory
so essentially divides into two kinds of businesses internet service provider so horizon it's e n t comcast these companies naturally want to have control over the services that they will because they don't pipes and their argument is we spent all this money developing his systems we should
be able to decide how we administer them and then you have the companies that create stuff for the internet and your net flicks is your goals days books all of the companies that rely on the internet to access their service they used the bikes they use the pipes and so they don't want any data to be priority
guys over other data because net flicks doesn't want a t and t to develop its own rival video service and block net flex from eighteen to customers
so in the case advantage vs madison river what happens so vantage files or complaint with the f c c use the regulator who handles communications issues and he agrees with them they say this is unfair to honor just customers they settle with madison
communication which agrees to pay fifteen thousand dollars as a fine and promise not to do this again and this is the first victory for the movement that would become known as net neutrality the big debate in the united states news over net neutrality neutrality a policy that forces internet
provided you treat all web traffic lethal damage control through the government have a web traffic and internet commerce and profits
ruling sets a precedent in the world of internet providers that they shouldn't block or slowdown in any way any content on the internet from getting to a customer is that is that the essence of net neutrality yes that's what net neutrality advocates want and that's what they've been trying to
hold in the twelve years since that happened
hi everybody
ever since the internet was created it's been organized around basic principles of openness fairness and freedom
no gatekeepers deciding which sites you get access there are no toll roads on the information superhighway
the set of principles the idea of net neutrality
has unleashed the power of the internet and given innovators the chance to thrive
abandoning these principles with trend and the internet as we know it in two thousand and fifteen the f c c under the obama administration essentially votes to codified net neutrality
just the net neutrality ruled by a vote of three to through that has was expected here but we have
it was the end of a long hard fought battle over the future of the internet with this strict open internet order that says you can't block sites or perhaps you can have paid fast lanes were certain types of data get to move faster than other who's it's really the first comprehensive update to the rules
that govern the internet
they're essentially saying this is not a toy anymore and this is a utility this is like the phone system like the highways like electricity this is a crucial piece of how we operate as a society so let's revisit the data alliance that we started to describe in two thousand and five
have they changed since then in terms of who supports regulating the internet and who opposes said sort of mean you still have the basic dynamic of the companies that create content for the internet wanting the internet to be a neutral platform
and then you still have the internet service providers who want to be able to control how their services are used but then you also have all these weird amalgamation nations and hybrids so for example google which is a search engine and contact company now also has an internet service provider google fiber that people can use to get internet
in some cities on the other side you have companies like comcast which has an internet service provider but also owns n b c so they're in the content business as well so the whole debate has just gotten a lot more cloudy and the battle lines aren't really is clear now
resident later on today said it will move to a vote to advance the nomination of a jeep
to become chairman of the federal communications commission so in january newly inaugurated president donald trump installs object high as the head of the c is working to establish the light touch regulatory framework it allowed the internet to becoming a marvel of the modern age and
hi is a guy who was on the f c c and twenty fifteen and disagreed with their decision to codified net neutrality and i'm opposed to a president obama is planned for internet regulation precisely because it is going to make for slower broadband for americans will increase the internet bills and ultimately will reduce competition
in innovation in the broadband market so in november he unveils this plan to repeal net neutrality
and what is adjourned highs argument for rolling back what started off as a kind of informal understanding but when that was well honored and then has become codified officially by the f c c net neutrality what's his problem
with it an argument for robbing a bag so his argument is essentially that in the years when the internet was being built into the missing and a wonderful thing it is today that we didn't have these rules that it was a much more lightly regulated sector and under that light regulation it flourished and thrived and grew into what it is
is
so there there there's a camp that says the as freire when it is more regulated and then there are people like occupy you say actually know the his fear when it is free air right and occupy would say the twenty fifteen decision was an example of government overreach
and micromanaging this sort of free and open space and i think the net neutrality advocates would say well the thing that has kept the internet free and open is this understanding that net neutrality was an important thing to preserve and uphold near tonight
across the country are demanding neutrality are fighting against i proposed by the the theme but seriously change the internet as well yeah i feel like know charlie
more than just how we express ourselves
theory and play some of the biggest tech companies like facebook and google are participating what they call a day of action it is a protest and the f c c plan to roll back obama era net neutrality war
what's the fear among proponents of net neutrality about what this proposal from present trumps f c c will do or how exactly do they think the decision made change the internet for the worse i think the darkest vision of this future internet that people are scared of is that it will be
i'm essentially a pay to play scheme that your get up one morning and try to go watch a movie on your favorite website and it'll say in order to do this you have to upgrade your package because that website actually isn't included with our basic internet percentage or that your
all be slowed down when trying to visit certain types of websites because the internet service provider has a business relationship with competing website
and the larger worry is that the companies that we all know and love today facebook googled net flicks they all came of age because of net neutrality they were able to grow and flourish because these principles were in place so the worry is that the next generation of cool company is that no one's heard of yet they
have a fair playing field to compete against the giants because net neutrality won't exist to protect them
can letting and neutrality is rolled back as occupiers up administration won is it possible that the internet will change and away or a can't go back to this idealistic democratic place where it started dead and even if you we impose net neutrality down the line with the next president after trump that something
essential about the internet will have been lost
yeah i think that's totally possible but i think there's something that a lot of people are missing here which is that the internet has already lost that open democratic quality we now have these giant silicon valley tech companies these platforms that control much if not most of what people
experience as the internet and they are not under the thumb of net neutrality they are not guided by these regulatory changes and so in a way the internet has already lost some of the initial quality is that its founders envisioned the internet is not
free in level playing field for everyone and this could make it worse or it could just continue the trend
thank you thank you add me
today the federal communications commission is scheduled to vote on a measure to undo the regulations put in place under president obama of the five commissioners on the f c c three are republican and the rollback is expected to pass by a three he did
margin along party lines

huge what else you need to edit a lieutenant governor tina smith of minnesota will take over for al franken in the us senate keeping a democrat in the seat for now but setting the stage for a big election in two thousand and eighty
