today
as pressure was mounting on to have president trumps former advisers michael flynn and paul metaphor to cooperate with special counsel robert mark a lawyer for the president came to the men with an idea what if the president or two
it's thursday march twenty by
were
march shrink hey it's michael
hurry of bed were actually were actually are you i'm in north around
i'm a vacation destination
better work stations anyway not be having a good time and i'm sure it's probably a little consuming to do all this but i'm very good landline taught manners that's all it really matters
one of these things may think that's what i want to make it
i have to do things i need a great land line in a refrigerator filled with coke
no
mike schmidt weird is this story begun the story begins last fall when i started hearing different tips about mike flynn the president's former national security advisor your plane was under investigation by that special counsel robert mahler for a wide range of thing
things including his contacts with the russian ambassador during the transition
flames lawyers and the president's lawyers had a joint defense agreement illegal arrangement of swords that allows them to work together and share information and have it protected by attorney client privilege in a way that shields it from investigators so investigators would never be able to get it it it allows a free flow
information a sort of protection as they try and work together in the face so what they would have said at the time was an overzealous overblown investigation by mahler
so that it seems like for the special counsel robber mahler and his team they would want to find a way to divide this team up can separate the white house and separate flan like you would in a police investigation where you want to keep the witnesses and
in different rooms so they don't coordinate their stories i think that mahler was less concerned about that and he was gaining flames cooperation if muller was gonna do a thorough look at the contacts between the russians in the campaign he had to talk to flint flint had been at the center of those
contacts he had discussed with the russian and master how they were going to respond to the obama administration implementing sanctions flint had lied to the f b i have doubted there were all of these questions and if muller was going to truly turn over every rock he needed to know everything that fled new
but to get to flint it sounds like muller needed to break him out of this new troll legal defense arrangement that he has with white us earlier last year our colleague matter puzo had said that we should keep an eye out for defendants or witnesses pulling out of disagreements be as he said it would be
the first sign that someone was going to cooperate with the government and they were no longer on the same team they were becoming essentially adversaries and i sort of to put it at the time
a puzo turned out to be right in what way on thanks giving i got a call from someone who said that fully in had pulled out of his joint defense agreement with the president and what did that tell you for a suit was the first in best in greatest signed net flynn was going to
flip that he was going to cooperate with smaller and tell him everything that he knew and lo and behold within a week flynn except a plea agreement flips and becomes a witness
and so what are the tips that you're getting in the midst of all this flint please set off a lotta new information that was coming into us and the most interesting and salacious one was something that i didn't even believe at the time that i heard it which was that john down the president
lawyer had offered a pardon to flinch lawyer
last year
why didn't you believe them
well the problem is to be a good reporter in the trunk or i think you sort of have to have an incredible imagination for a d impossible for things that you would never think would happen before but it just seemed like such a aggressive moves that would look at least politically very damaging
the president it showed the severity dad the president and his lawyers were taking the investigation that they would go to such lengths to use one of the president's greatest powers as a way of essentially defending himself
so what would be the intention of the white house in making that offer when it did will certainly one of the biggest possibilities would be the fact that they were trying to stop flynn from cooperating with smaller in telling mahler everything that he knew bitch
what would the assumption be if you're flynn and you get that offer the assumption would be hey there's no need to cooperate will take care of you will literally part and we will make sure that you face no legal consequences for all of these questions asked the table and you will be fine
least legally so what do you do with this step i put it my notebook and i tried to figure out other ways of getting it confirmed but a grin into debt and after dead end with it i couldn't find anyone else said it heard about it and it was something that was very tightly held so early last year i thought i'd taken it is
far as i couldn't and i didn't think i had enough to worried but then another reporter began to hear similar things not only about fun but about manifold paul metaphor yes paul manner for the president's former campaign chairman
and when you begin to fear that there's another example of the behavior
gives the original tip about flame a bit more credibility you start to say well okay so this information is coming in from another way about manner for then what does that mean about the new information any really sort of galvanized are reporting and say okay there's something here we really gotta go
after it and what's the context for this offer being made to paul manner for what was going on with him manifold it was in a very similar situation define last summer mahler was building an investigation against him but he had not been charged yet but as i recall man for is quite resistant to working with a special
ah council there's been a big distinction between flynn and man afford since the beginning and the investigation man afford his had the body posture of i've got nothing to give up i've done nothing wrong i'm going to fight this to the end of the earth sign has been very different his lawyer has been very quiet
i have not made any pronouncements about trying to fight is and if you were reading between the lines and looking at flynn you sort of wondered maybe he really does have something to offer some like i'm not trying to shadow why make the pardon offer if it doesn't look like manna for is at risk of flipping the way that
finance well that's a good question that would sort of lend itself to an argument from the president side which is the president simply thought these investigations of manifold slain were out of control there was nothing to them and for the better in the country day should be pardoned in like go but why with the president offer
people parties before the investigation is even complete before we know exactly what they've done well i mean i'm not sure how much we can read into it in the middle of the investigation this was a cloud over the white house this was something and had really derailed the president distracted him created headlines that or
not certain about his agenda or what he wanted to do there was a widespread perception of least among democrats that he had done something wrong and the people around him a done something wrong and he could simply say work i know there was no collusion i know we did nothing wrong these guys did nothing wrong this is completely unfair they're being swept up in a police
tickle fight and i'm going to and then because we need to move on from this and had of the lawyers from and four and then respond to these offers well obviously if you look at flynn side they took a plea a safer path agreeing to cooperate with smaller working with smaller realizing that perhaps a
a path of the pardon would be perilous they've gone with the prosecutor instead of waiting for the president on man afford side he's told others they didn't wanna take a plea because he says look i did nothing wrong this would make it look like i did something wrong and i think the government has abuse their power and i want
fight this and a certain point like you feel comfortable along with your colleagues reporting this understanding that this involves a lot of confidential sources
it's now six months since you started hearing these terms we did what i often called diligence on this information and after talking to lots of different folks
on background about what they knew and using a lotta reporters there's five bylines on this story which is unusual for one of our pieces we got to the point that we felt comfortable with the information and ready to move forward
so has the white has acknowledged that this happened at these offers or made that dowd went to the lawyers for fun and for a for and offered them essentially a pardon
will take to questions
on the table
one involved in russia
sarah the new sanders stood up in the briefing room on wednesday and said i would refer you back to the statement from ty cobb in the report that you're asking about women which he said i've only been asked about pardons by the press and every team we responded on the record that no pardons are under discussion or under concern
duration at the white house say unequivocally no one here is discussed pardons in this case i can say that
ty cobb is the person that would be most directly involved in this and he's got a statement on the record saying that there's no discussion and there's no consideration of those at this time of the white house has worry about what might have there were no discussions about this
and what does that mean what does that mean does that mean there are no discussions about it at this time
i have never been any discussions about it or this is something bad they're planning on doing the problem with this white house instead you cannot take what they say from the podium too seriously because they have such a history of providing incorrect information
in just to be clear no one in the white house has officially denied this reporting the president's lawyers ty cobb and jay secular said they know nothing about discussions between down and anyone about pardons endowed is no longer in the white house down's no longer in the white house but he told me
me on wednesday dad he had never made such offers a gun he did say i don't even know what we would pardon fun for i'm not sure what he did wrong
which is an interesting refrain which of gets back at the notion dan dowd and the president doctor case against find was flimsy
and my do we know from your reporting whether the president knew that dowd was making these offers or discussing the possibility of these offers to flynn and metaphor cool that's the biggest crush and that's where we get into and this stage of the story what did the president know and when did he notice was down simply out
freelancing running his mouth talking to lawyers just trying to do anything to stop these guys from pleading or was he directed directly by the president to engage in these discussions and to plant the seed in and lawyers mine said this was something that could happen
that's what we don't know what did the presidency know what was his involvement and if you talk to folks dead no doubt that have worked to down they find it hard to believe that you would go out and do something like this simply on as are i also get the sense just from watching all the reporting of the past few weeks about the present legal team that he's deeply in
evolved in managing them end hiring them or firing them
well i think it's more that the president thinks he is his best lawyer
his best spokesmen his best strategist but he thinks he knows how to navigate this better than the lawyers do one of the reasons that dowd left is that the president wants to sit down with smaller form you interview because the president believes he can explain to monitor how he did nothing wrong god who knows that the president often doesn't tell the truth thought this was a terrible idea that there was a lot of downside
to this new president could just increase his legal exposure does
this feel like the essential question to you the president or on this now that's so much of the talk around the mall or investigation is about the question of obstruction of justice and this seems like could fall into that bucket dc is similar to other things to president has been accused of was the president trying to
drunk justice when he fired the f b i director was the president trying to obstruct the investigation when you ask me to end the investigation and defined in february of two thousand and seventeen was most part in some sort of effort to try and stop these defendants from cooperate
the president has the power to pardon he has the power to fire the f b i director he has the power to end an investigation but was he doing that for the betterment as a country because he knew there was nothing here and to simply try and move things along and get his shadow offered him and move the country and a direct
that it needed to go into or was he doing these things to protect himself that's the central question of the obstruction investigation was the president doing these things were corrupt and ten or simply as a way of being the chief executive of the country and saying i need to do these things for the betterment of the country and i know there's no
one here and how old we ever figure out the answer to the core question of motivation and ten well you'd have to get inside the president's mine

in a sense the stories on was unsatisfying because it is exactly where we been all along
has the president and his lawyers done things because they have something to hide need to protect themselves
or is it that they know that there's nothing here and they're just trying to move it along that is the central question isn't that nice story unfortunately doesn't answer that and while this is interesting in into new piece of information i still can't tell you what was it the heart of the president's intentions in anything which is why
over a mile or so badly as you said wants to talk to the president himself to understand why his muller could get the president to truthfully tell him what he was thinking then we would have a much better understanding of these different events
thank you my thanks amd

we'll be right back
hughes what else you need hundred eight on wednesday the muller investigation least a document revealing that in the final weeks of the two thousand and sixteen election
top trumps campaign angel
gates had frequent contact with the person the f b i believed had an active links with and russian spy agencies
the document also shows that gates wasn't aware that this person had ties to russian intelligence he is identified in the document only as person egg but the times is reporting that he is constantine cullen who for years was manner for his right hand man in his business
dealings with ukraine
and after weeks of speculation that he would fire his secretary of veterans affairs david shock and the president ousted him on wednesday and replaced him with his own dr baloney jackson in summary the president's overall health is excellent his career performance during his physical exam was very good
news to enjoyed a significant long term cardiac in overall health benefits that come from a long term of abstinence from tobacco and alcohol
this here and jackson performs trumps annual physical and declare can both mentally and physically fit saying that tramp who is seventy one has more energy than just about anybody is very articulate and past a cognitive tests with a perfect score
the fact that the president thirty out of thirty on that if they think that there's no indication whatsoever that he has any cognitive issues
on a day to day basis like i said before it's been my experience that the president he's very sharp
he's a very articulate when he speaks to me and found no reason whatsoever that they fit the president has any issues whatsoever with his thought process
all clinical data indicates that the president it's very healthy and that he will remain so for the duration of his presence

that's it
