
from the new times on my fault
that
today
in the days since the shooting in park and for a small number of outspoken teenagers have reason to national prominence for their activism and there cause for gun control
but more than three thousand students attend stone and douglas high school
my colleague jackie you sat down with six

it's one march

so i flew down to portland florida and spend a week trying to get to know some of the kids who you didn't necessarily you see at the vanguard of the movement that has brought up in the wake of the shooting
one day
outside of the school i met brooke harrison and her parents denise and robert
we talked for a little while and couple nights later
i met up with brooke and several of her friends

oh you know
the girls are going to a certified together to talk as their parents sat out silent era and chat with each other
early
so they were korea
in
two bills near madison lady and madison they call each other
annabel
and bro and
we talked about the activities that they pursue
yeah
a little bit about what they love to do is is gets
like just
so they were telling me about school and english class and writing an essay
hey
yeah
desks
nobody wants to be honest with a blessing
a lot easier to iran
no my desk is what usually i now
yeah no i just was for the door that's why it's not that guy because when i looked up i saw you did
has a this way
yeah why
and then they started telling me about the shooting
that's very my essay and we hearing gunshots using it was one it was like
yeah so in my head i i
the firecrackers
nice and anyone ever set off firecrackers and school before
just a you know it's like okay firecrackers and i remember the glass door brady and for some reason i ended up
do i remember it's price can i play but i remember being on the floor i want to see like a crack of like shower now it
oh i remember make opened my eyes i was on the other side of the door i was fully the teddy bear had guy and then i guess that's when he came in i realized what was happening
their entire classroom explodes we've gunfire
and i remember putting my hand over my head like a tornado drill just because i didn't want anyway
glass or any any any because you can you can feel like this stuff like following this now yeah
the elite i cannot describe vets now it wasn't like a fire it wasn't like any know how their own you when you smoke
ooh that's it got a guy and there was a lot of snuck a healing
i can't even explain it was hard to it was a definite yeah because they don't think wow
now that we've got yeah yeah
i was a black encourage per is there some way
i mean it's done in tibet and xinjiang bullets
honda about this i do really well
yeah
but there's no like fully in their you know a bullet casing was really fat in there was tear
one of the things
girls have done to try to understand what happened to them
a grand scale is to try to understand moment by moment where happened to them
a micro scale so this is the diagram okay you can see this is the door is the law that connects to the hallway mr
tonight reach added
draw a diagram of their classroom with each cluster of desks was which student was sitting at which desk and where the students fled once the bullet study
he will remain
the true images of were certain students were when they died and they do images of were they believe the bullets were coming in from
this was it was just like a map of the day that their childhood good
yeah
he's so the this is where i was sitting i was facing the door
alyssa was facing me and the shooter was firing through the window of the classroom door
which the student said was mocked this harsh i guess having some kind of cardboard so i kind of like top down and put it over my face to show i don't keep when i lived at least really i just thought that if you saw my eyes he would shoot eat because i was right across do it range so i'm like yeah you have to cover myself
i feel the whole world was spinning in everything was going in slow motion to vent the shots were just boot
know when you are you watching a movie and you see it happening but you're not there
wow didn't know already
we're excited yeah
i
when i i've thought about this about being in a school shooting and the one thing that i've always said that i would do is text you
thank you for everything and i was so like map and everything i wasn't going to be able to get to do that and now it's going to die and not let my mom know that i loved her
and then she shoots dillard our door and those classic all over lake in front of me
and then i just feel like a few shots happen over here and then i feel they said she's just sixteen days and then check falls back and then on
go silent
and i'm like skittish
and screaming your name
and then she i can't say

when does i yeah
the next door and they were young they only injure that yeah i would get out the really have the classes and i remember bear
screaming think he's come get us to without these computers he's coming out and i don't remember how i felt like hours from that to ours
swat officers stormed into the school they yelled into the classroom and asked whether there was any danger and of the classroom anyone with a gun
the students had no there wasn't and
they fled i received the tongue he put your hands yeah yeah i remember just for just like see like all these mass shootings in people running out with their hands
the person they thought was i then it's just put my hands and that's when i ran
they fled through a hallway that they described as being lined with swat officers and they burst out into the daylight and trim through a parking lot and to the edge of the school grounds and that's what i remember like running for my life getting my her
yeah i remember seeing the dog party doesn't want to keep them think then get out of here
yeah i ran from school
so far
as far as it's really i was a jeans they ask whether they hand i remember
good luck
still he took my femur outfit for evidence is there was blood on i was learning
oh i went i wash my teddy bear and be asked me up and on a i say no
you know i know but yeah we're getting the watch the committee months now as a tendency that teddy bear was the only thing i got out of that class when it was the only thing i was going to

you ain't got to gina
what we thought was genius hearing but are instead he walked in my best friend and i we walked in with our moms and
it was kind of weird because we were all wearing that pins that the ribbons and are and they asked what what the remnants or floor and we were like okay this one's for jamie and this one's for jenna and this one's for our stove and employers in general
and they're like on that floor and then mentally walked into the funeral home and then handed the us this car and we were expecting to see like jean his face on it but it was this guy named wrong
and it's all
as i leave mine to the wrong can yank it out but it was like the wrong
these girls are pretty resilient and they've actually been able to find some light moments in all of this
romney wrong

so when we talk to girls were incredibly composed and even laughed at times
but then they are still just by tomorrow back into that day that's all a me to the like it's fine

this week marks the first full week back at school for the students at stone the douglas high school
on saturday despite weeks of lobbying by the students the florida senate rejected a proposal to ban the sale of assault weapons
we'll be back
here's what else you need to know having to take your questions
a fairly strong manufacturing center in this community and i'm pretty sure that because your what your government plans to do on tariffs announced on them student yourself
we require be in of the new tariffs rating tariffs on steel or aluminum between our two countries is absolutely unacceptable
a week he was treating which to retaliate against president troops plan for tariffs on imported metals
with terrorists have their own on everything from american leave motorcycles to furthermore the level of cooperation and integration of our militaries are defensive north america and are working together on a broad range of security issues in canada prime minister of justice
trudeau said that trumps rationale for the terrorists that imported steal from his country was a national security threat to the u s
makes no sense
the president doesn't really do this because if he doesn't screw that
just going to be a huge turn on american citizens back in washington senators from the president's own party including orrin hatch in utah and then sas of nebraska
openly opposed to the tariffs seeing the would hurt american consumers by raising the price on goods don't use aluminum and steel in a steel mill today was great for you if you consume stale and every american family at the start and i not something that has different metals to there is a bad day for you in an interview on
fox news
the president's chief treated like peter nirvana
was asked about the criticism from republicans are sas and hatch little the chair of the senate finance committee
wrong
and of course they're wrong and in terms of the republican party to remember this don't shop for and against sixteen republicans none of those republicans supported donald trump's positions on trading read every one of

that's it for the ah michael moore bottle
