you
now i'm across the room on the dirty
the come in and give you know his press conference and and i'm going to be with him
going to speak
but she's going to stand by side with a lawyer and it
of going to talk about the create
the
kevin feel in the guy as this case zeal to this investigation was a man who had spent decades preying on women
the drugged and sexually assaulted and a who and evaded this moment it's a day
so far too long
used to celebrity he used his wealth he used his network of supporters to help him conceal his friends now we really know today who was behind that act the real bill cosby was anything
scared
our money
kurt and you may be many
to go
so we hope that this case sends a strong message that the victims of these types of crimes can come forward and be heard on what happened to them
you know
back in the bible
than half of our office
we are
sorry
four
what happened
but
we got a chance to make up for it can
hopefully have milton yeah
a work
oh
it would encourage it
or emotional about
that people recognize that kind of courage like this late
think she showed carefully she stepped off she went forward and and and we got to the right result and and she stayed through this she didn't she didn't have to start down this journey with us she didn't have to come here for the first trial she didn't have to come here for the sec
trial but she did you know this is this is the first criminal conviction for a well known figure accused of sexual harassment or sexual assault since the meeting movement essentially it blew open
oh

fourteen years later
may be easy to forget that she was that first courageous person
up in public to go to the authorities and say that bill cosby drugged and sexually assaulted her
her courage or resilience in the face of horrible an unfounded attacks upon her and her family has been so inspiring to a whole bunch
there's been a lot of talk about the idea that the main difference between the last trial and this one
is that the me to movement happened in between do you think that's true
yeah
i what
it out every member
edited it be normal or way
a wait
or fun or to open up a perpetrator or beat normal or away
back
you know i've got it and their weight
what are you up
you remember a garbage bag
why did about game
or girl or the average area
here
your and eight up
i could not look at your waiting your report not look at air going back there perpetrator
look at bear
get an arbitrator actor he raped them
it it not eat normal eight your upgrade
i want to thank jury justice has been
i stand here in the spirit
king said the arc of the early universe is long but today it has bent towards justice we are vindicated we are validated and we are now part of that tsunami of women's power and justice
are not shutting up and we're not going away
get over it i spoke to one of the women after the last for two and accuse bill cosby of sexually assaulting her and i'm sure you spoken to many of them and they were so crushed after that last for they felt like they had and their minds been robbed of justice but also they thought that every other woman had been robbed of justice too
and so i wonder how the reaction today feels in contrast
i mean women
the only one criminal trial
late
to be
a warm
and they didn't get it
obama
do you get the sense that that these women feel as if this verdict even though they might not have testified that this was their verdict too
yeah
we living room
bored and being
i'd been to
england
that record in the morning
what i need to me
coding eight o'clock at night
bit
really what does this verdict mean for you personally agree
a bird it made me a bit your greet her humanity really what are our i'm on it
i regret your
humanity
not only restored my baby in a mad at me ready though

we're back

he was what else you need to know how much of viewer legal work was handled by michael cohen
oh yeah
yeah my overall little tiny little for action but i go
it may and represent me and dumping he represent me like with greatly stormy
you represented me
what i hated i have absolutely nothing wrong with doing a wide ranging telephone interview with fox and friends on thursday morning
president trump acknowledged for the first time that his long time lawyer michael cohen had represented him in efforts to silence stephanie clifford the adult film actress who said she had an affair with trump a decade ago
trump had previously denied any knowledge of the one hundred and thirty thousand dollar painted by cohen to keep daniels quiet
a payment that is now the subject of a federal investigation another gift from the heavens in this case they keep coming out don't know i don't know how our lives
fallen into such good luck in this case but i'm going to take it to shortly after the folks here
clifford lawyer michael as a naughty was asked about the president's disclosure on m s n b c s morning joe what's the impact of that
huge casually damage in admission by the president because according to what he said on air force one a few weeks ago
a thing about the agreement know anything about the payment michael cohen went off and did this on a lark and mr trump knew nothing about it we now find out that that's bogus
