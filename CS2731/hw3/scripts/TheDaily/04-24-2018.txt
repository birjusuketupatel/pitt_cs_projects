today
when the owner of a hong kong bookstore went missing
questions saw what had happened
and what did the chinese governor of she didn't pay have to do with it
it's tuesday april twenty fourth

in downtown hong kong there's an area called causeway bay and you walked down one of those streets you'll find tucked in between an upscale lingerie store and a pharmacy there's a grimy little staircase and there are signs all over twenty you upstairs or beauty parlor an apartment buildings
but if you stop on the second floor landing you're going to find a tiny little store called causeway bay books and inside there's just a few shows a couple of tables stacked with books and the owner of this bookstore is a man named lamb when key he's got a proof of grey hair tiny little glasses and
nervous energy about him he's always smoking a cigarette
and one day
he just stopped showing up to work
alex palmer has been reporting on what happened to i am wiki well turned out that lamb wink he wasn't the only one he disappeared at the end of october in two thousand and fifteen and within a couple of months people started noticing a curious trends that other people connected to causeway bay books and to the pub
swisher that own his store
they were also disappearing
street in hong kong is now the center of a growing mystery a bookseller in hong kong went missing three hong kong booksellers who went missing in china
is the fifth totally from the same book publishing company to have disappeared since hoped to find made have disappeared
the assumption was that chinese authorities were involved somehow because the thing about causeway bay books and about lamb when key and the man connected to him is that they weren't just ordinary booksellers they were selling a very special commodity in hong kong something known as banned books which often talked about chinese officials and way
ways that inside china you could never get away with this is hong kong rowdy unruly raucous free press bears works that touch on the darkest secrets of communist china the greatest seems of the party but then you also have another side which is what lamb when key and his bookstore
we're more famous for which are tawdry are so you have pulled be grocery store novels about the sex lives of high ranking communist officials and their tawdry affairs and the corruption the back stabbing and the party basically hong kong books show that the perfect stayed image
put forward by the communist party might not be quite as true as the chinese government and like its citizens to think
what does a ban on books in mainland china
mean for a bookseller like lamb is in hong kong it means a couple of things it means first of all that a lot of the customers who he sees in his book store every day are people from the mainland coming to hong kong for vacation since it was handed over to china nine hundred ninety seven from being a british colony it's been good
and teed a measure of freedom that the rest of china has never been able to enjoy so hong kong has freedom of speech freedom of the press other freedoms that only it enjoys within china so chinese tourists come there to get a taste of that kind of freedom they go to these banned book stores which offer them insights into
their own country that they can't get what they are inside china
but lamb did something that other books others weren't willing to do he would ship books and mass to his customers in mainland china so that way they didn't have to come to him he didn't have to go to them but he could still get his product out there and
he developed his own methodology his own tricks for doing this so he knew only ship to the busiest courts where these works were less likely to be caught in the huge flow of goods coming into china he will slip false dust cover as onto his book so if official just takes a look at the packet it looks like something
perfectly acceptable within chinese laws but really be opened the pages it's exactly the stuff china doesn't want giving him so he learned how to perfect the system and he said that more than ninety percent of his books made it through
lamb ever been caught for doing this he had he had been caught once in two thousand and twelve he was interrogated for six hours given a warning but by the end of that session they were laughing like old friends and he was let go without a problem
so he essentially talked his way out of trouble yes and he'd always been able to do that he knew how to talk to the officers he knew how to play dumb you know how to crack a joke offer them one of those cigarettes he always had on hand lamb has a certain nervous but radiant energy and he knows how to navigate situations like this it's ben is
profession for years and he's very very good at it but on october twenty fourth twenty fifteen suddenly that failed them

that day lamb was going from hong kong into the mainland and when he tried to pass the custom checkpoint he was stopped an alert when up when he put down his passport and a few officers started pointing towards him
if you officers started surrounding him than a gate in front of him swung open and a whole group of officers came and rushed him into a corner and lamb started asking what's wrong what's wrong what have i done what's happening but no one would answer his question they shoved him into a room and he found himself sitting across from two officers and one
was man named lee we recognize from is running in two thousand and twelve when he had talked his way out of the situation and a one point they were left alone so it's just and lamb and lamb trying to smooth over the situation makes a joke and really just explodes enemy and says how can you be talking about this
part of a special invest in a taskforce we know what you're doing and it's our job we're going to shut down to hong kong elicit publishing seen once and for all and lamb was stunned into silence that was the last thing least said to him
after that meeting with louis in the other official at the custom checkpoint lamb was put onto a train blindfolded handcuffed with a hood over his head and when he got off he was driven for about forty five minutes and move to a facility where it was put into a cell and
told to go to sleep
so he is genuinely confused he's doing what he always does and suddenly he's whisked away and far from home with no idea exactly what his legal status that's right he had been allowed to work as a please into both to get away with skirting these chinese last for a long time
so he wasn't sure but there was one paying that was different
after a mysterious secretive process china has chosen it's new leaders and foremost among them the new party general secretary as expected she jumping at the end of two thousand and twelve shooting pain had become secretary general of the chinese communist party few months later pilots official china
has a new president in march two thousand and thirteen he became president of china so as were looking at this situation with lamb in two thousand and fifteen this is right at the same time that she's paying is consolidating power power in china it began back in november when it became the president of the party the head of the military and now the head of state ousting rivals he's cracking down on
corruption and president changing things anti corruption campaign has purge the party of many of his real or perceived enemies and rival and bringing everyone to heal more than eighty thousand communist party members had been investigated so for some have lost their jobs and others have been kicked out of the communist party
and no one no matter how high ranking appears see from she's purge it was taking down even the biggest names in the party showing that nobody is above his control and that he was going to take down anything that threatened his rule so whether that was corruption or whether that was information and these kinds of books that he didn't want to see
the hands of ordinary chinese it turns out that lamb and causeway bay books they just spent about to publish a book called choosing ping and his lovers which perhaps writing about choosing ping himself touch a nerve like nothing had before
okay
game
once people realize that lamb have disappeared and his colleagues had disappeared all under these mysterious circumstances hong kong exploded in theory
oh
there were protest marches of thousands of people holding lambs picture holding the pictures and names of his coworkers
okay signs reading today we won't tomorrow you and me and people feared what would come next if they can take our books that they can take our people then what freedoms do we really have left
if it unsafe helpless
us is no longer
this is evidence that people hong kong china is not honoring its commitment to hong kong freedom exactly
what to say
oh

and all this is happening in hongkong people protesting lands harassed and leaving notes for him
at the store what's actually happening to lamb lamb doesn't know any of this wasn't happening back and hong kong he has been restricted do is so interrogated every day not given any contact with the outside world any news any information he was watched twenty four hours a day by rotating teams of two men who
talk to him no one would tell him how long it banned there that he wasn't given access to any calendar anything like that but he devised a way to keep track of time he told the new thread off the clothes he had been given and each day who had type one not into the thread to keep track of how long you've been imprisoned and one day
about three and a half months into his detention he was put on a train without explanation and he was moved to a sumptuous sprawling villa called the kyle and villa and he walked into a room and the villa and he saw around a table his coworkers
ebay books
that must have surprised him yes he didn't know what to expect no one had told him anything he had known then the other coworkers had been taken so they were all very cautious they weren't sure what this was if they are being set up why they were being allowed to meet each other all the sun but they sat down to this dinner there were served
of course after course of the vegetables and pork and tofu and under the watch of security cameras in a guard they tried to talk in whatever terms they could about their situation and one of the employees a man named lee bowl with ben coal owner of publishing house that sold its books through causeway bay books
he told the other man just cooperate this is going to be over soon let's just do what they say and the also handed each of the men one one hundred thousand and hong kong dollars and he said that this marked the dissolution of their company that they were out of business and that they should put it all behind them so it seems that in putting these men together in a room
chinese officials thought that this would be a good way to end their company and make sure that ever knew that if they just one along with what was happening they'd be okay
does this mean that all of these detained men including lamb are now free not quite so isn't carriers come back to i'm i may say they've got a deal for him he'll be allowed to return to hong kong if once he gets there needs to go and get a computer from his former boss the man at the dinner who
i told everyone to cooperate oh and bring it back to chinese officials on the mainland and the reason he wanted this computer is because contained information about customers about authors so this was going to be their ticket to figuring out exactly who had been buying the books and expanding the investigation to the mainland
one more thing he'd be allowed to return to hong kong permanently after that but only if he kept working this bookstore and served as a more for the investigation so it keeps selling his books keep welcoming customers that every time somebody bought a banned book it take their information down he'd take photos he keep records and he would turn those over to officials
on the mainland so in real time may be able to know who's buying what and where it's going if you did that a to let him go
so what did land decide to do he agreed instantly he said that after being in detention for that long after being interrogated like that he was ready to cooperate he just wanted to go home so anything he could do to get to hong kong he was thrown to do it he was broken
he formally agrees to this deal offered by the chinese government that's right so then in june of two thousand and sixteen they put him on a train and he heads back into hong kong for the first time since his capture about eight months earlier and he goes to the police station he tells them just as he had been instructed to do that he was find that he can
taken that they should drop any investigation into him and then he followed the instructions again lamb one to leave those house he got the computer and after talking with lebeau in private this time lamb returns to his hotel room and he gets ready to go back to the mainland the next morning with computer and hand to hand it over to chinese fish
channels but he been given a cell phone by his handler so that it could keep in touch with them and they had strictly forbidden him from going on the internet are looking up any information but sitting alone in his hotel room that night he starts searching for his own name and he starts searching for causeway bay books just to see what's happened in these ones that he's been gone and what do you
and the first opportunity it sounds like to do that that's correct
being on the mainland with censorship and with internet controls he wouldn't have been able to find anything anyway so sitting in that hotel room in hong kong it's his first opportunity to see if anyone's even notice that he's missing or what's happened to him and his colleagues at that resonated all any start scrolling your what do you find his
is that chinese government
sometimes
i think is not
it's not need a hong kong is only fight
the page after page of videos and articles and he sees that six thousand hong kongers had bart through the streets chanting his name chanting the name of his book store and his colleagues and calling for their freedom calling for their release this was the first real indication of the reaction in hong kong to the disappear
once is the mood was angry he sees that this story has been picked up all over the world that people are worried about hong kong and he stays up all night just reading and watching
yeah
the next morning he goes to the train station and he's getting ready to go back to them a man he has the computer with all the information in his backpack and he's almost ready to board the train but he stops to smoke a cigarette
and he starts thinking and is
monks another cigarette and he keeps thinking about what he seen and what this means and by the time you finish his third cigarette he knew what he had to do any walked over to pay phone and he called a former customer of his a hong kong legislator named alberto and he said this land when key on the man who's missing can i come in and talk
do i need to tell people what's happened
and an hour later lamb when key was in a room packed with reporters after photographers with video cameras and it seemed that all of hong kong was waiting to hear when he had to set
what's incredible how about this news conferences that lamb was the fourth of his coworkers and employees to return to hong kong but the other three who had come back they had been parity in the same line they said there was nothing wrong we were helping with an important investigation
mainland china that's all i'm going to say i can't talk and lamb suddenly come back and puts himself from the news cameras and lays out in extensive and painful detail his entire ordeal from the day he was captured until the day he found himself standing in front of those cameras narrative what had happened
really
call so lamb and key ended up saying whatever in hong kong had feared all along but haven't been able to put words to it took him coming back and in that press conference to really articulate what hong kong it feared all along
and what happens after lamb holds this extraordinary and news conference well pretty much everything he expected to happen which is that his coworkers denounced him they said he was lying anyone connected to him on the mainland said that he had been tricked that this was all a ruse some of them were arrested including his girlfriend and them
mainland who who denounced him and was briefly interrogated for her role in bringing these ban books over his girlfriend publicly denounced as that's right his coworkers his friends his girlfriend he was ostracized so and presumably at the behest of the chinese government that's right so even as he becomes something number here
within a hong kong for speaking up and for putting into words what people had always suspected that personal cost was pretty immediate and pretty clear
and what about the bookstore causeway bay books what happened to that and i guess to the larger industry and ban books and hong kong in lambs absence the books had and bought by a man surname chan who immediately closed it so the bookstore was shuttered still there
and if you peek inside you can still see some of those dusty shelves in some books on tables but it's been closed ever since he was taken he's hoping that someday it'll come back but if you look at the larger publishing industry and what's happened since lamb monkeys disappearance and return that seems unlikely because law
i'm with keys case was not isolated it was actually just a harbinger of what was to come for the wider industry the banned book industry is in freefall people won't publish people don't want to read it people don't want to be associated with it because to them it's not worth the risk
space for dissent or contention used to exist before shooting pain it's closing if not gone already both within china and now it seems in territories connected to china or even with chinese people overseas anyone who might be stirring up trouble anyone who might be trying to crack
that perfect image that the chinese communist party and choosing been put forward about their rule that person is seen as a threat that information is seen as a threat so anything inside china or out that tells a story that china doesn't want people to hear that's no longer safe

oh thank you very much appreciate my pleasure thanks for having me
