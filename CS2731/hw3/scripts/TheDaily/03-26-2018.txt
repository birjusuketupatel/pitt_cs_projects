
for the new york times ah michael barbara
this is
today as hundreds of thousands of demonstrators prepared to march on washington in response to the school shooting in portland florida
students on chicago's south side felt sympathy but also frustration why hadn't the gun violence in their community
the nation's outrage
it's monday march twenty six
queues are
no one's ever
the current
so on a typical day quiche on your man who was fifteen years old has trouble waking up because he is fifteen years old and he said like eight alarms on his i phone they start very early in the morning and they go like every ten minutes and he keeps snoozing am finally one of them work and get that bad a bad
he lives on south outside of chicago with his mom and his older brother it's a two bedroom apartment him and his brother share a room they're both teenagers
his bedroom is plastered with posters there is basketball players and then there's also a poster of our okay on the wall so mean me and recently reported from chicago meanwhile his mom the sitting in the other room just calling out the time to make sure that her kids get to school on time
saying it's seven ten seven twenty they've gotta get out of the house by seven forty and finally it had some forty and she comes out of the room and sees her kids the door
and off they go
so tell me about this commute to school every everyday when he leaves the house he has to keep in mind that he's going to walk through some neighborhoods that are not going to be safe he has the think about has walked to school
go can show
oh you know being wrong place
i have to make sure the
stay safe is more for kids so i don't be the next kid the been served from the virus has been going on in the neighborhood it's about ten to fifteen blocks he can cross a major street and on one side of the street a certain gang controls that area he goes to the other side of the street and the
different game controls that area and he might not have anything to do with either of those two groups but simply because he lives on one side of the street and goes the other side of the street is now in a dangerous territory
so he has always watch his back
you have to pick and choose what to do and where you go to so you can be so so if you orca
oh is just look around you so even if he resorts is so good
they were toy one worked to the next work he told me that he was tied by his mom at a young age if you take one route one way take the other route back because if someone's following you then they're going to be confused his mom told him that if you have couple of bucks in your pocket and you're paying for something only take out a dollar at a time
he lives in one of the most dangerous cities in the country
beyond that his neighborhood is one of the most dangerous neighborhoods in chicago he lives on the south side of chicago in a community called auburn question and the homicide rate in that area is nearly twice the average for the city it's nearly ten times the national average ninety percent of homicides are key
carried out by guns so there are a lot of guns on the streets in this neighborhood but he lives in
moreover he was walking back from tokyo girlfriends that it was though
yes in his father also try to say are so those who are you go down as he's walking
it was in wrong place at the wrong her and those a pseudo down
now turn
q on her the the my hair
okay early comprehend
oh so
angry prayers
is is
just a lot of work

so it's march fourteenth and it's a month after the shooting and parkland florida the school shooting there and students are preparing for this national school walk out the entire school is participating there's a lot of anticipation in the hallways there is little posters up on the lockers about the national school walk out there
some kids holding placards with the faces of of the kids that were killed in kirkland florida there's also kids with posters and pictures of some of the kids that were killed in chicago
and so this walk out for a ban is also a statement on their own community
the articles for recently in me him
i like me
you can just be late for that
can one said anything what he's going on with his a game playing good cute
you just never know was go have the least
for me i know it's different to me i come in here
your teacher but i've lost three students of us years three years and i've been here
and so that's why people
he shine is participating in the walkout and he's also going to be speaking at this rally it's a community rally were three different schools are going to be there so key schon it he's never spoken publicly he's got a lot to say but he's a shy kid and he's really nervous
preparing his speech him and one of his friends are both speaking and so they're kind of huddled on the side in the hallway writing on these little cue cards looking at stats on their phones
pacific
your statistics
you know this month transition
a treasure trove right
going to transition from provoke
go
the number
after three months
one hundred and ten you have been shot
so he's been murdered he's rehearsing you could tell that this was something that was a really big deal for him
there's this bout that goes off that signals that it's time for everyone to start walking out and then you see kids streaming down the stairs going outside of school and there is a massive crowd there's lots of media they're they're kind of all crowded around the area where people are speaking
key sean and his friend both who are speaking pay elbow their way through the crowd to get to the

though
sorry
remove the one on google
contrary to me
and one
no no no
and while he's speaking he pauses and them at all because he's so nervous and he adds cheers from the crowd
any also gets a little emotional he talks about his brother and he talks about how that forced him to speak out and fight for changing as one no morning or agree with you angry
you're angry
you can make a game were removed them

so after the speakers are finish they really seventeen white balloons or the kids and park or in florida they release thirteen yellow balloons for kids that go to keep on school who have been killed
and then fifty red balloons to signify chicago kids who have been killed and that's not an exact number but it's to signify the amount of people who have been lost to gun violence in chicago it's hard not to notice the numbers bigger bang number is significantly bigger and for them it was on a comparison
but more of a frustration about how we deal with this every day we need to be involved in this conversation as well
and this is our reality of gun violence
and want school oh really think of his clothes for shooting cause most most over happens at school
thanks so to the school to to or
most say okay me me after school in the the great the so school
you a place hordes of the word
soon why did these students think that the violence in chicago doesn't get the kind of attention the scale of attention that a mass shooting garners in park on florida so i think the kids understand bad seventeen people being killed at once in a school
it's horrific and terrible and the scale of that is powerful
but at the same time they also wonder given how long they've been dealing with gun violence and how present it is how many of their loved ones have been shot and killed in their neighborhoods
why that is events cause for a national movement why that is cause for people to have a similar reaction those are the kinds of questions that they were grappling with so what will work out of my them a walkout touches later
most of the schools around the country
you really do have after asia
this is my school
i went with he shot to this violence prevention youth group that he's part of its in the basement of a church and lamar johnson who is the leader of this youth group asks them a question about what are the differences and similarities between you guys and the kids in portland
we have
asia was some
filling the trauma

listen to what
now
from than of course that she was really answer and will get the same sympathy and compassion

do you are know the media in a car which i mean the average income of a person and pardon
so is between one hundred and twenty five hundred thousand dollars a year per house
okay so compare to do you know the median income for a person limit our membership
i again
so people cargo and makes three times more to you your family as you grow
so lamar's the youth group leader is trying to help these kids grapple with these feelings that they're having a frustration but also of of remorse for what's happened in portland and he's trying to guide their conversation trying to guide their energy you mm angry a partner
no our partners with those the vague knowledge of the phone the reason why do you have performed because they privilege
they are really sincere about helping create change here just as well as the so when are angry at them
when i want you are to be angry is the whole system itself easy the girls are said
easy access to go for who
we talked about as the day out been happier
how he wasn't for the a good bigger
so the same way how easy is it for you good
so nasa you get o two into now you gotta get what similar was dayton ohio right because they're so now we take those similarities and divisions now you say this is why would to say we do with the same amount of time everyday would have same age
and we had the same easy access to guns but isn't that right that we give viewed negatively because of our roof
because we don't have as much money as though you'd been fighting for peace and justice for long term a non stop know so use this moment
anger frustration this momentum and takeovers it
so when we go out of your own be ready
then this remarkable thing happens
ahmad thousand on the bottom
since one of the
and we're going to me
a few months
students
some of the survivors from the park land shooting come to chicago to meet with these kids the church that lamar works with facilitates this meeting and it's one saturday that they come to chicago and they meet behind closed doors
he shined is going to be meeting and gonzales become one of them are well known survivors from portland shooting for the first time
he said
some kids from brooklyn speak key on speaks at this point he's become a bit of a pro at doing this than spoken a few times
those who were no
what does
as a said
it his words

sam
today
no
this isn't just in schools
this isn't just
this isn't portland
this
united states
and this is the only had has its problems
so these two groups of kids who lead dramatically different lives but also have had really dramatic experiences with gun violence
acknowledge their differences but also land on this theme of commonality between both of them and this idea that they have all been affected by gun violence whether it's been a mass shooter in their school or whether it's walking down the block and having
to watch your back because there are bullets flying in the neighborhood
and as far as this chicago kids are concerned they were frustrated before at the attention that they didn't get and now they're saying you know what whatever it takes to light this match the we want to be part of this movement because this affects us
losing somebody is losing somebody getting shot is getting shot it doesn't matter if it happens to me or if i happen to someone in florida the fact that you've lost somebody because of gun violence it's going to feel the same
what i have in common with kids and park lose that our know how it feels to lose someone those close to you they have conversations about their shared experience is they have conversations about how they're going to push this movement forward together
these kids who have come from parkland are very aware of what these chicago teens ace and they are very committed to making sure that their reality is included in this movement that they're kind of leading at this point
hello one tee shot
i'm from chicago know and all its him for split to try to school so he on with his peers from chicago goes to washington to march with the kids from portland
no we don't have learned on their shoes
they should earn the national march for our lives against gun violence
and they're they're meeting with people from across the country and really talking about that the type of gun violence that they face in their community this is why i'm here because we know that when this becomes the norm chicago
do you toys is rising across the country
especially in chicago
it's clear that change his
it feels like what we saw on saturday in washington was using one tragedy a tragedy that happens less often than a horrible mass shooting and then in this instance affected or a white community to elevate this violence that happens on a far more routine
even daily basis to a mostly african american community
and for the kids from chicago this is their chance to really be recognized
yeah i think think for the kids from chicago who are marching in washington this is their chance to be part of a national conversation this is their moment they have been working in organizing in their own communities for a long time and now there is this opening on the national stage and there
taking it and they're running with it

thank you
very much thank you
this weekend at the march in washington
sean and students from other and question rallied alongside the students from florida
the efforts at inclusion by the marches organizers were shaped by the conversations that happened in chicago
between the two groups of students and the connections they made their
skeptics and cynics who told us to sit down and see stay silent
wait your turn
welcome to the revolution
it is a powerful and peaceful one because it was of by and for the young people of this country
my name is camera casting since this movement began people have asked me do you think any changes going to come from this look around we are the change
we'll be right back

use what else you need to know day
you were twenty seven he was six me where you physically attracted to
not at all
did you want to have sex with him
but i didn't i didn't say no i'm not a victim or not it was entirely consent oh yes
guess in an interview with sixty minutes on sunday night the a film actress stephanie clifford said she was dread and for trying to tell the story of her alleged affair with president trump and agreed to remain silent to protect herself and her young daughter i was in a parking lot
not going to a fitness class with my infant daughter as taking the seats facing backwards in the backseat diaper bag getting all the stuff out and a guy walked up on me and said to me leave jump along forget the story and then he leaned around and looked at my daughter and a beautiful little girl
shame if something happened to her mom and then he was gone the emerged thread occurred soon after clifford had sold the story of the affair to a tabloid magazine which feel to publish it sixty minutes reported for fear of being sued by trump you target is a drug throat absolutely i was rattled i remember going into the work out
cause and my hands are shaking so much i was afraid i was going to drop her with that dread in mind
clifford said she signed an agreement to keep quiet in return for one hundred and thirty thousand dollars from lawyer in october of two thousand and sixteen eleven days before the election the president continues to deny the affair or clifford was paid to stay silent about it
watch sixty minutes who's watching to where would you say her
he knows i'm telling the truth
