kim jong on surprise new year's day call for direct talks with south korea could undercut the trumpet administration's tough approach to north korea and scramble the dynamics between the three countries
and orrin hatch is leaving the senate potentially clearing away for the return of mitt romney it's wednesday january third

what you mean do you want me when david tell us about this new your speech that kim jong un gave a couple of days
in the same speech he had two very different messages for the allied forces south korea and the united states he did have two messages in this one david sanger has covered north korea's missile program for decades and the first was to be about spades new one cuticle cutters get don't put on
do you do basically said if you thought we did a lot of missiles staying and nuclear testing last year this year than we're moving to what he called mass production of missiles and nuclear weapons kind of up hundred okay
goes back a message though wasn't director of us who was directed at south korea
didn't and that was unusual because the north koreans are usually ignore the south koreans they this them
his lackeys of the united states they frequently say are up of the a and in this case he said what's get involved and direct negotiations with the south koreans about everything including the upcoming olympics
the south koreans are hosting the olympics the winter olympics starting an early february
the south koreans have wanted to see if they could get a north korean team to come in not because they're particularly interested in their olympic skills but because they're interested in kim jong non not conducting some act of terror disruption during the olympics them their theory was that if they're on athletes are playing
not likely the mess with the game
so what is kim jong il ne trying to do here with these two divergent messages produced two different countries so the message for the united states is simple were a nuclear power move on to the message to south korea is the unusual one because
clearly kim jong a pretty cammie examination of of the nature of the relationship between south korea and the united states has come to the conclusion that there's a lot of daylight
between president moon in south korea who just took office the middle of last year after his predecessor resigned of a scandal
and president tropics janice rock to his nations day saying is more open to dialogue with north korea were would meet whereas it jong on under the right conditions to talk about the nuclear weapons program president moon has said that he would open up discussions with north korea
basically without conditions no nation on earth has an interest in seeing this band of criminals armor itself with nuclear weapons and mr president prompt those made it clear they would have to be impatiens including an understanding that any negotiation had the lead to a fairly quick the new
queries asian of north korea it is time for north korea to realize that the denuclearization is it's only acceptable future most importantly president moon told his own people last year south korean president who now that sounds like claiming
our over any military action answer that after meeting with president from he now had a veto right
mona de vito right on any american military action against the north the implication being that he wasn't going to lot of war start up he wasn't know let down from go attack north korea and the american officials who i spoke to right after that statement said
he's got no such veto right this is a decision that really made by the united states in the united states entries
so the us and south korea are genuinely divided in their approach to had a deal with north korea and its nuclear program and it sounds like kim jong own knows that it is certainly fair to say that the president of south korea and the present the state
have very different views about have a good deal with this they start from a common point both of them would tell you that ultimately we need to get to a nuclear rise korean peninsula the question is how do you get their president moon believes that the way you get there is by trying to learn or the north
koreans out of their isolation offer them all of the usual inducements will leave from sanctions internet for investment so forth and so on president trumps few is the president treated out being nice to rocket man hasn't worked and twenty five years i would wouldn't work now clinton failed bush failed and obama failed
i won't fail that's been tried before and nothing will lead the north koreans to give up their nuclear weapons in return for some promise of investment from south korea or from the west and so then the question is do they have a common strategy for dealing with north korea and right now
now the answer is they don't the united states has great strength and patients but if it is forced to defend itself or its allies we will have no choice but to totally destroy north korea president trumps approach is to say we're going to try some diplomacy with no expectation that it's going to
work and then when it doesn't work i'll move on to my military options or as the view of the south korean president is south korean president known as urging open dialogue
quote president and i will not buy a hostile policy against north korea we have no intention to attack north korea we do not wish to save the regime replaced or collapsed more going to make diplomacy were one way or the other
but what's interesting here is that it was evident who kim jong on the president has days and the president south korea had to very divergent strategies for dealing with the north and he was nimble and to jump on this and say let's see what we can do to widen the
gap
that was pretty sophisticated diplomatic move so let's talk about how he tried to widen the gap he sees this opportunity this divergence between the us and south korea and what's he doing in this speech to try to capitalize on what he's doing is suggesting a meeting between the north koreans and the south koreans
that basically it's foods the us
the opposite of what he usually wants which is a meeting between the north koreans in the us that it's the south korean and his hope is that north and south korea would week some separate agreement
that the united states could not say no to and as a result it could lead to some agreement to relieve sanction some make it harder for the state to read military action do whatever he could to separate the us from its ally of seventy years

what was south korea's response to this invitation from the north to start talking the south korean seem quite open to it in fact they turned around and propose that they get a conversation going at the d m z that's the demilitarized zone that separates the two countries and we'll see whether or not covered
station happens whether the content of it is about more than merely whether the north my participate in the olympics is there a way of seeing south korea's willingness to directly negotiate with the north as good news for everybody including the us and other words
north korea cares to preserve its relationship with south korea is arguably a good sign in the stand off anytime you have conversation going on between them you have to think that's a good thing
but you will have to keep in the back of your mind the possibility that this is merely a delaying tactic
merely a way to go buy some time while kim jong on gets ready to conduct more missiles as and more nuclear test food you can prove beyond a doubt that we can reach any corner of the us and you know even as we are having this discussion there are reports emerging from american intelligence
agencies that suggests that another missile was being loaded up for testing and the result of that is that kim may simply be hey i'm going to buy a little time with the south koreans while i complete my experiment here
and other words that's not a good situation for the world that's just can getting more time and more cover to advance his nuclear program that right and he sees the olympics as a great opportunity because he knows that the olympics have to go well for south korea and he's the potential disruptive
so let's talk about the role of the olympics and it's because it's kind of fascinating and odd even
what is south korea is concern about the north in relation to the games
well their biggest concern about the door
is that it would disrupt the games and subway imagine that they use a moment when all wise and all too real networks are focusing on the or the games on this gig jumps on bob's where everything else that goes into this
and in the middle that they are missile test or a big nuclear test that will be bad right
and i think that kim jong un has recognized that that boy capability gives them some huge leverage for the next month or two which is kind of amazing so came to england unpredictability means he has greater leverage with the olympic games going on
then potentially any other time because the imagination ones while with the possibilities of what he might do with the world focused on the south that right
so to the north koreans actually have an olympic development program like the us this doesn't feel like something they do in the past michael the north koreans have periodically same athletes under the north korean flag to the olympics one thousand and sixteen
who's the summer olympics in rio de janeiro they actually did send a good size team at it goes about thirty one athlete more women than men interesting the medals wait what
hello
asian bronze to lydia valentino as of spain darien a matter of ruth took the silver and gold medal awarded to rim johnson of the democratic people's republic of korea i think they had set a target of twelve medals or rio and they came up a little bit short on that when they only got seven she cemented gold
this attempt

be in this particular case though is that they only qualified to athletes i think both figure skaters for the twenty eighteen olympics and south korea and they never actually submitted the names for those athletes by the deadline at the end of our
october now
that's not necessarily dispositive here they could say they want to send their athletes and the international olympic committee which has made a pretty clear would like to have some north korean represent asian
in the games could let them in the last moment bend the rules right presumably all of this would be part of these discussions with south korea that we're talking about i think there would be the initial discussion was south korea get the figure skating out of the way first move on a nuclear weapon

in the end david how much does all of this this unusual change in the dynamics between these three countries have to do with our realization over the past year of just how far along the north korean nuclear program has gone has that fundamentally shifted the dynamics
here in a way that allows the north to do bald things i try to break apart a seventy year old alliance between the us and south korea or it's a good question because until now the question was would the around states come to the south korea
written by the north once the us feel threatened itself it may pursue a defensive policy that is separate from the one the south korea but then it must pursue in the past we built missile defenses in alaska california
on the fourth one day the north koreans might be able to lob one or two or three nuclear weapons or away
but now you're looking at the possibility that if they so decided they might be able to wobble are more than that and of course the missile defenses could be overwhelmed and at that moment a president united states is going to think about this issue and very different terms there were a lot of people saying that the president what this isn't fundamentally that different from the sick
jewish when we faced with the soviet union starting in nineteen forty nine or with the trainees starting in nineteen sixty four
and both those cases classic containment and mutually assured destruction worked what's interesting is that this administration says in this case classic containment will not work
that in fact north korea might use its weapons to blackmail countries to try to take over the south there are any number of scenarios that many in this administration spin out that they believe the north koreans could try to enact using the new power of a nuclear weapon that can reach the us
including the possibility that the us would not come to the south defense if the north can take out was angels to washington
and you suspect the deep conversations between the north and south in the lead up to the olympic games are really just about preserving the peace until the olympics are over and negotiations will more or less go back to normal after that or do you think given what you're saying that these dynamics could forever beach
change now
it's a fascinating question for clothes it's very possible that this is all just a temporary thing but it's also possible that if they got into a real discussion it could generate a dynamic of its own could continue pass the olympics
thank you thank you mike all happy new year
on tuesday night president trump responded to one of kim jong wounds provocations from his new year's day speech when he'd said that could a nuclear button is always on the desk of my office
this is just reality

but it is the much bigger and more powerful woman has
my body works
labour

when the province reserve shooter our last month he said i was a fighter
i've always been a fighter

mitt romney running
or or you wouldn't need to worry about it
what run running gear and but now
well wrong
agreed utah
and what does it say about the state of the republican majority in the us senate and trumps relationship with the republicans in the senate that he's so fixated on exactly who occupies a single seat in the body
and he had a row liable ally in iran you gun not only a question mark with somebody who could actually represent a competing coalitions body i think it how romney would vote in the finn and i think even more than that would help rally would conduct can show public what he would say to the media what he would sound elevation about the

new specific countries renamed but niki heels the us ambassador to the united nations called the allegations of foreign interference complete nonsense blamed iran's leaders city unrest and called for an emergency session on the iranian government crackdown on the protests this is the precise picture
a long oppressed people rising up against their dictators
the international community has a role to play and honest we must not be silent the people of iran are crying out for freedom
all freedom loving people must stand with their cause

so far at least twenty one protesters have died and about four hundred and fifty have been taken into custody by iran security forces in tehran
