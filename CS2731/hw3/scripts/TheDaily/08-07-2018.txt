
from the new york times on of of this is the day

republicans have found themselves unexpectedly scramble to hold onto a house in tuesday's special election know i have it's turned out to be a symbol of what's ahead for the party in the mid

it's tuesday august so
experts tell us about this election in ohio today this is sort of and accidentally important election were only having this road in ohio today because the previous congressmen a very long serving republican quit in the middle of his term to go take a lucrative job and the private sector
this wasn't supposed to be a competitive race it's a solidly conservative district to the north and east of columbus ohio he voted for president trump by eleven percentage points and voted for other republicans by a great deal more than that but the rate has gotten shock competitive and in a way that is pretty revealing for the larger
landscape of the midterm election
and you have this battle wage between two candidates who are themselves very conventional politicians you don't have a rock star on either side of the race here the republicans a state senator name troy boulder son former car dealer the democrats to thirty one year old county official danny o'connor
they are basically generic republican a generic democrat
and so in spite of the fact that they are both basically boring canada
and despite the fact that the district is basically a conventional a republican district it's a very very close election and this is all about the enthusiasm on the democratic side the divisions within the republican party sense of basically being demoralized that you hear and see from so many conventional republican voters

so don't think we've got an interesting race here because it's a republican district that could flip to democratic control with to kind of plain vanilla candidates that stand in for their parties more broadly that's right plain vanilla is a much nicer thing to say about them and boring and in some ways it's more accurate you don't have a large
i figure in this race and you don't really have a larger than life issue in this race you get to see really a snapshot of what the republican message is going to be and what the democratic message was going to be and who that massive resonates were so it's very much a race about the two parties and their strategy is just a few months before the general election kind of feels
it's a perfect petri dish version of what november's maternal it's pretty close to an ideal test if you wanted to test the mood and the messages in this campaign nationally you would want to do it in a district that was a little more moderate a little more diverse than this one is an overwhelmingly white and solidly conservative but
til this is as close to a good test were going to get before the final stretch in the next three months is the fact that this district is very wide and pretty conservative mean it's even more in port to republicans given their constituencies yes it means that this race approximates the republican party better than iraq
makes the country and it will tell us more about the state of the republican coalition in the mid term elections and the effectiveness of the republican message men and tell us about the mood of the country as a whole so how are we seeing the republicans approach this special election how are they campaigning well at the very beginning republicans thought that
if they nominated a mainstream conservative if you want something called troy borders
conservative champion truly water and bold leadership eliminate ohio staggering deficit and land on a message about taxes and the tax cut bill that made its way through congress that would just be enough in a district like this one states and toy voters and voted to cut taxes by five billion dollars the result in other words
look what we've done done a good job you've got a good candidate keep us and our exactly and they thought the bat message would resonate with the kind of moderately conservative suburban voter that sent pat deberry back to congress over and over and over again the national republican party work to actively to get troy boulders and through the primary he beat back a candidate who is
much further to the right because they banked on mainstream conservative message this shouldn't be complicated true boulders and an iron man athlete
he is grit conservative grid
so
to eliminate ohio's budget deficit without raising taxes they ran some ads about the tax bill the ransom ads about pro bowlers and being no good neighbor good family man he knows about hard
aldridge in the family farm and ran the family business and written those about you
and thin christian but it just didn't get the job done
meanwhile the same old politics in washington just aren't work any o'connor the democrat as run a very hard charging campaign we need new leadership and both parties about shaking up washington about brain new leadership to the capital about protecting healthcare benefits and about protecting medicare and social security let's fight back against drug and insurance
anthony greed let's protect every dime of the social security and medicare benefits seniors have and i'm danny o'connor in i approve this message and so the race heightened and heightened and heightened and pretty quickly dishonest danny o'connor wants to take away your guns
this is danny supports open borders and sanctuary cities
you saw national republicans switched from a positive message about the economy to just the most relentlessly negative campaign you will find all and sanctuary cities to stop illegals from taking our jobs fight alongside trump to implement his engine
and use conservative grip to build the gone i'm a christian conservative he's been endorsed by right to life five times have an a rating from and or ad for nancy pelosi in her gang of liberals like me i'm a republican troy dollars and a conservative with grit and i approve this message
and why is this strategy chef that you're describing notable from your perspective of someone who covers politics is the kind of strategy that you normally see at the very end of the midterm election when an embattled political party feels like it has no option but to go all negative on the other side and what you have right now
his three months before the general election the end of the national campaign republican party leaders pointing at this race and this strategy and saying this is how we're going to keep the house
in other words the party isn't waiting until the last few weeks of the upcoming that terms as far to go this negative as they are doing in this district in ohio their viewing it as the strategy for the rest of the mentors that's right this is not the last resort this is their best hope and what does that tell us as the republicans are
a lot of trouble and then
so you went to ohio to check out what's happening race i did
oh
i don't i don't remember
education

so what's the situation there for the republican campaign dollars a week out from the election when you were there when i was there they're big concern and i think it's still there are concerned today was just about getting voters on their side engage to and energized that their concern is that
in polling frankly for both political parties the voters who are paying the most attention to this race who know the date of the election who are planning to show up tend to lean towards the democrats there are many more republicans in this district and and are democrats but by and large just not that focused on this race and that's a problem
for especially bothersome it's a huge problem for boulders and democrats wake up every morning looking for opportunities to send a message to the president and to do something about the state of things in washington republicans in this district maybe some of them will show up to send a message to washington by and large you're asking or group of people who were well
to complacent to turn out on the first today in august is that enthusiasm gap you're describing typical and they turn election it it's you'd normally in a presidential race you see partisans on both sides really show up in the national elections a choice between the two parties midterms are often just referendum on the president and the party it is angry or at the present
it tends to show up more we saw it for bill clinton and george bush barack obama we're seeing it for president trump but the republican party's challenge on that front is compounded by barry very serious divisions on the centre right the republican coalition in a district like this one is just unstable because those folk
in the suburbs who will love your more moderate republicans like a path tiberi like a junkie basic aren't so hot on president trump and folks in the more rural part of the district they love the president but whether either group shows up is an open question she didn't mention the rural trump voter in ohio
steals like that kind of republican is more or less a guaranteed voter in today's election that they would be happy with how things are going is that what you found there are definitely a much more likely voter then your suburban soft republican but even for your more hardcore trump republican
this is an off season election it's the only thing on the ballon many of these folks have already voted in primary elections which ohio held earlier this year many of them may be planning to vote in november but asking people to vote three times in a year is a pretty big ask so what's the approach with this kind of voter with this negative
strategy that you're describing is it to go after what the democrats would take away from them or would change for the worse the same way that president trumped up so immigration guns a kind of cultural war stuff that really is the approach that you're saying with your hard core trump conservative voters in the more rural
parts of the district
resistance is demanding when they want to eliminate the law enforcement agency that enforces immigration most americans doors to climb
what daniel can't help they usually a lot of adds a lot of political mail pieces about immigration about guns about nancy pelosi nancy pelosi in washington liberals are dangerous they can't be trusted to uphold oh your values liberals in washington want to repeal the middle class tax cut implement socialize
medicine and high taxes on working families danny o'connor is just as dangerous he was trying to hammer home too conservative voters that there's an important election on the ballot and the democrats are coming dangerous daniel corner
i'm troy or sin and i approved this message when i saw vice president perhaps they are with pro bowler some he was all the other side talks about this thing bush become
what they want to bring what the blue way
you carter join nancy pelosi
in a democrat majority on capitol hill you're going to have fewer jobs fewer opportunities more government and more attached daniel carter is gonna raise your taxes we need to build the war we made hair strand try sex change in america stream trying
hi maria
your out
somebody and talking to folks in the crowd you heard people essentially welcoming that message that yeah we need to go we need to elect a republican we need to protect president trumped was verbatim one of them
i love
what comes rally on saturday night it was really just total war on day o'connor you see this i mean usually pelosi who by the way again controls danny oh god gonna whoever that matters
any it sounded a lot like his twenty sixteen rallies and he was like a low level person that did nothing
any of drawn
beauty is another this though we're fighting they will take away your taxes they will destroy so many things that we've given i do talk about draw borders son but he went after danny o'connor as i you know nancy pelosi liberal was a guy who's vote in congress is going to create more crime and more illegal immigration
danny boy and the democrats vote to let criminals and drug for into our country and thirteen run wild in our communities and you know what they do once
we're going to protect our law enforcement not just ice all of our law
for the voter in ohio in this district it's just kind of two thousand and sixteen all over again right for the republicans the challenge and turning out trumps base is giving and the same sense of urgency that they felt in the presidential election and what about the voters in this district who aren't trump supporters the more moderate republicans well
this is what makes it so complicated for republicans because all those more moderate republicans you're sort of john case of republicans they are probably the most important group of decision makers in a special election and i found them sounding pretty indecisive and pretty ambivalent about their options in the race i spoke to one woman outside of barnes and noble in dublin ask you just barely
i think that brother
and he needs now
but be so
juvenile and petty but i like doing said he would do more republican voted for president
she wishes he would knock off a lot of his antics but he's delivered what he said he was going to deliver and she asked me by the way what are the names of the candidates and their special like a good sign for a it's not a great site and that woman is probably not going to show up for troy borders and if she doesn't know his name before the election bad is what makes republicans so nervous about this group of voters
i got really bad guy
go to another woman at her door i was going door to door canvassing with the congressional leadership on big republican super pac spoke to one woman had her door who said she's a republican she votes republican her main concern is taxes everything good brother
i
i'm sure i can i knew that before he was elected sale and she thinks the president's allows you to offer for him i didn't know now and vote for him in two thousand and sixteen and she's pay no attention to this election so in some ways even more emphatic than the woman in the parking lot that she is just not paying attention
and she almost seen resentful of the implication that she should resentful of the implication that just because she's a republican she should care about the special election and vote for the republican and people have heard a lot from these campaign so maybe it's just exhaustion but there were also seems like a sense that know you you can't demand my vote right now
sounds like republicans in this different have an apathy problem on the one hand with kind of loyal trump republican voters and kind of a deeper problem with moderate republicans in this district who are not happy with the president and don't seeming teach and erase at all that's exactly right
and republicans are trying to solve both problems or ones with some remedies that could undermine each other you bring in president trump to fire up his base your risk disillusioning anti tramp republicans even further
and the bottom line is that in both cases with the trump supporting voters and non this strategy in this race is scare republican voters to the polls with a very dark vision of life hundred democrats it is exactly to scare them to the polls and to disqualify democrats as an alternative to make sure that voters who
who like the president see his political legitimacy at stake and it's to make sure the voters who don't like the president don't see the democrats as a viable option

so the strategy that we're talking about relentlessly negative tactic
why is that necessarily a bad place for republicans to be because that was a pretty effective strategy for donald trump in twenty sixteen it's way too early to say if this strategy is going to work nationally will get clues today to see whether it works in ohio but the fact that they need to spend so much money to defend district
like this one republican outside groups have spent nearly four million dollars trying to bail out troy borders and that is greater than what the democrats have spent by a factor of five or six they can't have that kind of spending advantage in every race around the country and november one in a money there's not enough money in the house campaign in total to put
bad into all the competitive races a district that the president carried by eleven points should be a district that's responsive to a message about keep the progress keep up the momentum in washington reward us from the things we've done so far that message didn't connect so what would you call this strategy being practiced at
in ohio
think you have to see it as kind of an apocalypse now strategy right that this is every piece of ordinance that republicans had logged with incredible funding behind it at this basically unremarkable the opera
and what's the significance of what happens today in ohio look i think most people involved in the race think that ball son is more likely than not to win by a little which would give republicans maybe a little bit of confidence that this is a strategy that can work in much of the country if the strap
dougie fails then you are really in a break glass and case of emergency situation for the geo they used everything they have to try to yet there are people out if it doesn't work there's no fallback plan right now meaning if the apocalyptic now strategy fails then it's just the apocalypse
that's certainly how it would feel to the republican party have ninety days left until the election with no strategy that can keep even a district that the president one by eleven points in their right to can save the district that the president one by double digits
then you're in trouble that would be most alarming for republicans also alarming for republicans if they hang onto the still by one point two points three points there are dozens and dozens and dozens of districts that are much more closely divided than this one and if the slash and burn strategy can only save this destroyed by a point two two
there are certainly enough district for democrats to take the house that are well to the center of this one
so a win for republicans today in this special election in ohio because still feel like a loss there are going to be very very few republicans in washington reassured by a one point when this district
oh
so how is it accurate to say that that after a republican presidential candidate donald trump one on a relentlessly negative and polarizing strategy in two thousand and sixteen and then government pretty much the same way his republican house majority now requires a relentlessly negative and puller
rising mid term campaign to defend its power and what does that tell us i think that's exactly accurate
it makes a lotta republicans extremely uncomfortable are no rules that this is not the campaign they envisioned a year and a half ago but thought they'd be able to run in the mid term elections on an upbeat for looking message about economic prosperity about having kept their promises on issues like health care and immigration and taxes and national security and
instead they have this relatively demoralizing slog ahead of them have essentially having to tear down their opponents all over again and by the way this time they don't have hillary clinton to help them
guess what i'm wondering is once you go that negative are you stuck campaigning that way as long as you've got that same president and power is that become the message of the republican party there is no separating the republican party from president in the eyes of orders at this point we have seen that so consistently
in the elections since he took office and we're seeing it in this one too that's part of why republicans have decided to take the risk of bringing in the president brain and the vice president into a district where they are polarizing because they are making the bet that the polarization will work for them
thank you thank you
we'll do right back
what else you need to
at twelve or one this morning the trump administration reimposed twenty year old economic sanctions on iran
that had been lifted by president obama as part of the iran nuclear president trump said the sanctions would encourage iran to renegotiate the two thousand and fifty nuclear which he pulled out of inane but the most immediate consequences has been to infuriate america's allies in europe
including britain germany and france who fear the sanctions could severely punished domestic companies that do business with iran
on monday the three countries announced a plan to block the us from punishing those businesses as the sanctions require and just like the battle says it's basically an inter galactic invasion into this phase two people i'm telling you that the age of shed and
