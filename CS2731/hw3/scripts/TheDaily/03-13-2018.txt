
from the new york times of michael for oil
is that
today venezuela thought it's loudest political prisoner had finally been silenced
only he had
two of the story
it's tuesday or thirteen
so for the past six or seven months a couple few times a week i will suit down at my laptop
and open up a video chat service that we believe is secure
and i will create a room private room that only leo lopez and i can access
i wait for a few minutes and at a certain point
the screen of flickers
that situation starts to swirl around and
after a minute or two i can see and we start talking you think it would be and okay
go back to your experience in some ways to warn
we didn't have much knowledge of a okay
right
we should we should get
you will how risky is the his decision to talk to you
oh it was always risky
yeah because the speech or me
my name is
remember leo lopez was under house arrest serving fourteen year sentence will hilton rights for the times magazine and the government that imprisoning him has said in the clearest possible terms he is absolutely prohibited to speak publicly and if he does so
he will be punished in a greater way than he ever has been before the white van right around the right
that night and he knows they're monitoring him all the time we took it for granted that there were audio bugs in his house at a minimum but it seemed fairly obvious that the secret police outside of his house with an assignment to surveil him would have some access
to his internet activity and in fact every so often
the shit
a white truck would pull up outside of his house and knock out his video and audio and internet connection area
and we would have to wait a couple of hours before the van laughed to resume contact
i think that
he said
fascists
but despite all this he was determined to keep talking so we took whatever precautions we could like what
we were you
couch yeah
college friend
for example would pretend to be college friends and this college friend is they get about shut down there and wondering is very little talk about journalism essentially non
yeah and over time i got to know our leo's kids men while was in elementary school own show
and then leopoldo junior
who was only an infant really when his father went to prison is now four years old and it's really getting to know his dad for the first time we alien
helios wife lillian which is kind of pop in and out and say hey it's good to see i haven't seen you for awhile and things like that the kind of keep this looking friendly and not like an interview setting
in sick
i don't know
play which can only be a couple of people
it's not for shaking thousands of as from tuesday
the thing is we often did joke around about the circumstances because despite the short term risk of him getting caught talking to me there was this larger ambient hope around my
be possible in venezuela
we saw people in this pro or position area waiting hours to vote vote and to recover democracy to recover democracy here in venezuela last summer was a moment in venezuela and modern history today's that could start turning point for venezuela controversial president nicolas or headlines all around the world we're talking
about this being a turning point for venezuela today's election could be a tipping point for a country that holds the world's largest oil reserves a lot of excitement here and all that this is the moment many here have been waiting for the opposition parties were rally getting into the political ranks to take some governorships and take more mayoralty s and hopefully put up a press
financial candidate who could win today venezuela rosa did ready to see that is not negotiable
and so when he and i started talking i think there was a very strong sense from both of us that while the future was unknown it was entirely possible that by the time this story came out leopoldo lopez could either be out
of house arrest and deeply engaged in the political life of the country or even possibly a candidate himself
allegations of election fraud in favor of present looked as ruling party won nearly all twenty three contested state governor show venezuelan president nicolas murderer consolidated power in an election us officials consider to share but as the weeks went on it became clear that the material governments
grip on power was only tightening depth and that st nicholas and the terrorist government is consolidating power isolating the opposition at of next year's presidential that said as white as president nicolas my a little has bought opposition parties from taking part in next year's presidential has been bought three opposition parties to running in the election a desert
solved opposition parties one by one they ended up prosecuting and chasing politicians of all different opposition parties out of the country or arresting them and so the picture of the electoral change just darkened and then shot
no one really important day in the fall i was out for a walk with my kids in my phone pain to the message from leo
telling me that he was afraid that he was about to go back to prison right away
i think it said a male have a few hours
you get audio know so i hurried home and we made the connection
okay
yeah over it
last night around at an early
out
thirty
political elite make any right
a
bird and
regular american have been working with need or needed
they'd taken his chief of security away and no one had heard from him since you're right
me and union
any charter
and eighty
and eight eight
you wrote about
able to complete your know
right
that i would money
oh

and now was for me a moment when i began to see what we were working on was not gonna end up coming out at a time with less penalty for him
and it may come out at a time where the penalties would be even worse but do you radio
are about any that
i am absolutely sure
oh my god
orchard
great you're in or or
get out
it was clear to you that this interview is going to come out while he was still a prison her and with the stakes being
quite high as high as possible
and maybe even higher than they were when we started
wait you will
we all are
i'm not what do go
yo
or you know that happen
you will be the only
or month and i will like you okay

well i'm struggling to really understand why is leo doings why is he continuing to talk to you
man i
i wish i knew i mean i'd ask we talk about it i try to understand to i don't think i don't think i can wrap my head fully around it i mean the honest truth is i wouldn't do it in his position
but i think part of the explanation for him
is the despair of the country around him
yeah i had any
before sunrise hungry venezuelans are waiting outside grocery stores praying for food trucks to arrive by midmorning there is little
those only better now i am only men design as more the chaos in the country of venezuela is profound each day at dusk the unemployed converge on this side white trash heap in downtown crack at average weight loss in venezuela now twenty five pounds according to three universe you have masses of
starving people sound even dying from simple infection is due to a lack of basic medicine
to country in the next five
dad levels of crime and violence
i can imagine here the highest murder rate in the world in caracas their living standards have one declined pulverized by triple digit inflation and a collapsing currency the exodus of refugees fleeing venezuela is on a scale
the western hemisphere has never seen before that compares to the syrian refugee crisis or the flight of the romania to bangladesh same way that my money and very annoying only god knows what we're going through acres in truth when he's hoping that we have a government that doesn't get over it or another
at this moment
he used to saturn and leaders should to take risks and so in a certain way his suffering is totally different or less than what most venezuelans are going through you're not willing to suffer like a dick are bring in a different way
a century thirty's now
we're not vote for a banquet very hungry because you know different ways
shades of the same lack of liberties and
so he sees his role as a definite leader in this moment
as experiencing some form of pain that may mirror what's happening outside this house
yeah i think it comes from this place of believing that he has a fundamental right to speak and if he doesn't exercise that right and take that risk
then he's being defeated and he's not standing up for the principles that he thinks all venezuelans should be out in the streets taking the risk of protesting and standing up for and so i think for and there was a sense that he can be rebellious and defiant in the way that's avail
double to him and in this case it's just speaking
right
change
he made it clear that it wasn't my decision
that it was his decision
and so absolutely certain that it was the right thing
to do
by this is an extraordinary experience i have to imagine as a reporter
to know that your work
we'll put leo in grave danger
yeah it's it's it's horrible and away
i mean look
you're a journalist they're going to be some stories where you think some of the people in the story belong in prison
sometimes that's what journalism and see that's the job
this doesn't feel like the job i mean it it feels like the job to tell his story but it doesn't feel right to know that the subject to a story could be imprisoned just for talking to me
it's been very easy to imagine the at the end he might end up in prison in venezuela might still be spiraling into in comprehensible past trophy and
i will have been gone he pulled on himself
and would that be okay if a country continues to spiral and his back in prison
it just seems like a very difficult position to be in
yeah i would turn it around on you
we're doing this in this is part of it
why what how do you feel about it
well if the daily as part of the the reason goes to prison and i don't know what to do with or maybe you do
i don't
i hope he's ok

big
yeah
will our leo and his family feeling the night before the story comes out i called them before the story appeared on line to see how they were doing
you should
crazy
summer
you from
lillian wants to talk to you
you
knowing how are you
had a conversation with lillian
there's a real reason why don't you
are you feeling about that right now

a
average
the
right
i
i think she was willing to focus your attention on what it really might mean and how bad that could be
but lillian was also fully committed

yeah
history
we understand
three
she
yeah
i heard a story that when they're older
for first marriage to year
before you answer you should know
if you marry me
you're marrying
guerra
sacrifices that i would make for venezuela
do you remember that

are there things shit you will do today
the fairway
although with the kids
try to make most
evening
it has to
hey
i asked them both about how the kids were handling it what they are doing with the kids trooper to prepare them and do we're not preparing the kids they have made this decision
not to tell the kids about threats to the family to try to hide his much of it as a can and allow the kids to lead the most normal life possible
and lillian told me that they were going to be saying some special prayers
that evening
and

the kids on to the call
let me hear the prayers

it was kind of our breaking to hear the naive enthusiasm and join the voices of the kids saying these prayers and that they didn't really understand
what they were praying for
you live

because i am
she

peter
i don't want that
get a lot of guns man i appreciate your estimated do this with here
dutch
so banquet
judge and jury or family


hey my friend and i don't know if you will happen
it's close to happening at least
so the article gets published and what happens next
well right
we were releasing the article
the house raided
dan it in a new way
so they have never happened before
swat team style secret police burst into the ass
with ski masks on and machine guns
and there was no i mean that from the kids
they said they had an owner to take back to military prison
it didn't say any more than that
and they refused to leave
but i just want to let you know that i i ask you from a heart you don't feel bad about anything
oh and on any sense of guilt
by any means by any means so wall
agents with their mask the machine guns are in the house
julio lopez is totally undeterred leaving me voice messages in secret from the next room with the invasion force early feet away from him
because he's been speaking to me
the best rebellion
the test nonviolent protest that i can make at this moment is to speak out and chose to do with you
ask you please don't feel better about
what
please tell your people
now to leave me a stray please
as the only thing i asked for you and your people
forget about us


will his dad what this is about a refusal to be silenced clearly but also about getting the rest of us the rest of the world
to pay attention
i think without a doubt
part of his hope here is to get the international community engaged and invested and i think if his imprisonment
would create crater international pressure it pushes towards a regime change
that would be for him
the ultimate impact of the personal sacrifice

and so far they have not fulfilled the order for these arrests pulled all of those is still at home with his family with this increased military presence
we don't know what's going to happen
but threat of imprisonment
couldn't be any higher
and which is going to have to find out

thank you
very much for your time and fair reporting
thank you

or the i back
