
from the new york times on michael barbara
is
today when republicans handed massive tax cuts to corporations most economists rejected their claim that the companies would give that money back to working americans so why do you
companies seem to be doing just that
it's wednesday february seventh
so when the tax bill was being debated at the end of last year
two stories out there chin tankers only covers the economy for the times the story that the democrats battalion that's where the republicans and democrats for telling was that the bill was not really going to help workers very much
this g o p tax scam is simply that from the american middle class and from every person who aspires to reach the bulk of the bill was going to corporations and corporations but largely keep that money and pass it on to shareholders who are disproportionately benefit from a reformed that's not the middle
class family and you can't deny the fact that there are many middle class families that are going to pay more as a result of this bill it would not find its way into most workers paychecks the republicans were it was a bit different so going to lower the taxes on this business so it's globally competitive so can compete with this foreign competition then we're going to get this business and ability to write off
the investments they make in this business to buy more machines to hire more workers to raise wages that to us is really important they believed that the corporations will take the money and not just invested but invested in things that would actually boost workers productivity making them more valuable to their companies and then the workers because they're more
valuable would get paid more and so by that argument eventually workers would see raises because of the corporate tax cuts
however there is no evidence that this is going to be a stimulus of the economy as nervous as a trickle down to the middle class there's no evidence that the middle class are going to benefit from the corporations are already sitting on record amounts of cash and if they wanted to reinvest it and if they wanted to pay people more money they would have done so i hope is that if there's a corporate tax code that it trickles down to
a regular folks who work every day for a living
let's go to the broad expectation was that most of the benefits of the bill would go not to your typical american worker but to hire and americans higher earning people corporations and their shareholders who tend to be the very rich
let's begin with some breaking his from over nine with tax cuts and jobs act is pass vice president my pants very case he had to cast the deciding vote if a major victory for president trample immediately tweet it in that state senate just past the biggest in history tax cut and reform bill republicans cheered as they pass the most sweeping
tax overhaul in three decades president from now on the verge of taking a tax victory lap
where were you when you learn that the tax plane had passed do you remember
our big what an hour but never got over it but our tried it my colleague sabrina tavern he talked to west carter the president of atlantic packaging in wilmington north carolina so tell me about your business is plain english as you can muster
when we were
okay that's good
op where a year old
our grandfather started a company an already
i quit bad reading material bader product
what's an example less white paper board
go around
are we do a lot of
the border guard
oh i've heard back
when on
your called not bother you know it
what do you mean you know we're going to have
sorry macabre you people and
it in a great opportunity
never had a situation where we had that much
it
and why
what we saw right away after the past was something that and i can't stress this enough no economists predicted was going to happen call it a tax cut a deity
it is giving more than two hundred thousand employees a one thousand dollars special bonus after that tax bill signed into law
the very first company that i recall seeing a press release from saying they would invest in america and their workers before the billion past was eighty and t and then there was this stampede of companies who did the same thing eighteen t and comcast now saying this tax reform package will mean one thousand dollar comcast
walmart or thing apple you're seeing some major fortune five hundred companies american airlines is the starbucks is also bank of america and then a whole bunch of other banks the third bancorp also pan out bonuses us bank income and retailers various car dealerships who are announcing bonuses for their employees tens of thousands of employees about to get a thousand
just giving one thousand dollar bonuses a certain one thousand dollar check thousand i've i've got a letter
i just wanted to add that extra emphasis to them to know that the reason they were getting and thousand dollars was because of the tax plan that the g o p and president trump had put to get it starts rippling through the economy and soon you had some three million american workers who are receiving bonuses according to americans are attached
you other major al bundy about point out it out
white added we bought our an incredible
do it
and you know about a week or a market about it
how do we want to do to you know we have a gallon of oil
figured out that would all going to break out in with what happened next what did you decide to do week rapid
and actually went out and our
edit about
baby or but we're outta we've been able to
without proper letterhead
wrote it oh boy
cracker orbit
everyone around and we rented out in my inbox
people walk him
a great
we weren't good how significant is a million dollars in the context of your business
million dollar big deal
we get about i'm on it
jim what's going on here in the expectation was as you laid out that big corporate tax cuts wouldn't actually benefit workers but isn't that what's happening
well sure these definitely benefit workers let's be really really clear it's much better to have an extra thousand dollars in your pocket the not and even if it's the government takes a kind of taxes from that thousand dollars you're still with a lot more money than you would have had so this is great for workers it is not however a sustained wage increase to get a bonus
as for the most part we're talking about bonuses we're talking about a temporary change of what appears to be and again the politics could change and it could get repealed but for what is right now written as a permanent bill so if you are a company like bank of america who is giving out any one time bonus to your workers that is out of a pool
of money that is a recurring benefit billions of dollars a year you are telling your shareholders you're going to have that is
a drop in the bucket if you look at the overall span of a lifetime of the bills benefits to you so what we're seeing here is that companies are actually getting a permanent change but companies are passing on one time payments to their workers workers are not getting a permanent change and what's going on here is that bonuses are kind of like a sugar high there and
nice thing to have you certainly to a park from it but it's not something he's in town on as a sustainable meal in the long run you don't budget house payments based on a one time bonus you might go out and buy a new tv but you're not able to change your actual quality of life for were a recurring difference in your bottom line
some workers are getting just bonuses from their companies but other companies are actually giving wage increases like melbourne which is getting minimum wage increase across its stores and faster timetable that before and this is where the question about whether to bill ends up raising wages
comes into play because if it doesn't raise wages that instability like a very bad trade off for the american war her but if it does maybe different story
when well wages start rising for most american workers it's a nagging question if you look at the last few decades from the standpoint of a typical american worker in their wages have basically not moved a majority of us workers have experienced a decade a flat wage well before the great recession wages had already started to
stagnant instead they have watched as the economy has grown a lot and the very rich have gotten a lot richer red line or corporate profits the blue line or wages and you can see that corporate profits are up by thirty five percent over this roughly five six year period now almost and wages are only a five point three percent and it's only been in the last couple of
years that those typical workers have started to see their paychecks increase and then last week two thousand golf at last month that to make number of the bigger headline know if then pay checks wage growth is way out any the fastest pace and seen in years and sal wages increase that the fastest pace since they seen since the recession
the years ago we had jobs report for the month of january that showed us the fastest wage growth since two thousand and nine great news for workers and a sign that wage growth might really be back and here to stay for the first time in quite some time
so jim what is it the wages have started to increase now
does your increasing now because the labor market is getting tight unemployment is low
there are fewer people looking for work which means employers have to compete more to hire people and hire good people which means they're going to pay them more and that is all happening before the tax bill even passes before any tax cuts start to work their way into workers paychecks and before companies try to see that the windfall from the corporate tax cuts
with see what you're saying is that some of these companies like walmart or already going to raise wages anyway absolute yeah it's if you look at the labor market right now it is hard to keep workers and so because of that walmart is bush league minimum wage and handing out bonuses and who made that possible
president trough mart is the latest company that make such an announcement directly result of the tax cuts
walmart has been raising wages even before there was a tax they were raising their own minimum wage that said that they can raise wages until they got their facts that bali starbucks has been raising its own minimum wage j p morgan chase announced this morning that because of the trunk tax cuts they will raise wages for two thousand and two thousand
and of their employees create thousands of new jobs and increase small business by lending four billion dollars so what we are seeing now is it may be an acceleration of the process to raise wages but also it's just a very good business decision walmart really up it's game the new republican tax law they say is the reason why and that's all thanks to new tax reform
bell for which j p morgan chase directly credits the passage of the tax cuts and jobs act
jim it sounds like some of these corporations are acting like the wage increases are connected to the tax cuts why is that the acting like it because it's a positive feedback loop with lawmakers and companies companies are appreciative of having more money and lower taxes from lawmakers the
turn around and say thank you to the lawmakers for giving them that extra money and in turn the law makers can tout the company's announcement see you're getting more money workers as proof that the law is working so what the companies and lawmakers are doing right now is locking themselves into this virtuous cycle and telling each other great job we did
let's keep going in hope of selling the bill so that it stays forever innocence
he announcements are kind of a pr campaign for the bill itself
when they are whether they're intended to be or not the announcements are certainly telling the american people hey there's good stuff for you in this bill which until it was passed was being derided and framed by democrats as being mostly for the rich not very much for you but i think it's much more likely that what they're really doing is seeing it
incredible opportunity for good publicity here when you are a company that says we're giving workers a bonus or a wage increase and then it suddenly all over the news that's great free advertising
and right here in cincinnati and is very beautiful factory floor the schaeffer cooperation announced that every single worker was getting a one thousand dollar tax cut boehner is your so generous thank you
congratulations everybody
why it some of the worry about tax reform in about getting business tax cuts that historically you know the surpluses don't end up an employee's pocket books but when he decided to give bonuses to all your employees after the tax cut
to announce that decision i mean was part of your thinking to communicate that the tax bill was a good thing in the tax bill is actually going to help real people
wow
i don't
early or motivate

do that we had another boy
what do you get it
you're really cool
okay don't ever want
a reputable right now but our reputation
oh pretty good



jim we've talked in the show this week about the role of confidence in the economy and i'm wondering regardless of whether this publicity is based in pr or something else
it's also kind of capturing or crystallizing this mood in the country that the economy has gotten better and perhaps that's been happening all along but this is the first time people are kind of picking their heads up and realizing it
whether or not the tax cut is really to thank for that is it meaningful that people feel better about the economy
yeah it's meaningful it's it's a good thing we should want people to feel better about the economy and whether that is rooted in a long running trend or a short term policy change if people are feeling more confident and optimistic that often leads to very good things we've of investment all that's really great and a relief we've been living through oh really
rocky economy for a long time the middle class has been feeling like they are struggling for years and years and years even after the recession ended and it is a great thing for america that people are maybe sort of finally starting to feel like that cloud is lifting what i think we would worry about is if that optimism turns
to be like the bonuses sort of a sugar high and people a few months from now are feeling less so
and then you could see a crash


engine in the back of my mind during this conversation has den the thought of the stock market crashing over the last couple of days
is it somehow connected with all this
yeah the stock market is reacting in a way that is very counter intuitive to this good economic news for workers investors in the stock market looked at it and appear to have said well we're worried about this they're worried that rising wages means rising inflation and when the fed is worried about rising inflation it raises interest rates
now raising interest rates then slows economic growth so what investors are saying is they're choosing to sell some of their stock now to beat the lower growth that the fed may have in store for them because they're raising interest rate so the irony in all of this and he be
basically it feels like the market is mean hey it's like most people one ordinary workers wages to go up but now that it happened the market is saying whoa whoa whoa we're worried about this situation
this is not a huge cascading crisis yet in the stock market but to some degree with they're saying is maybe stocks were a little bit overpriced given where the fed may be taking interest rates because of inflation concerns to packing a little bit of their gains from the long running time at the punch bowl so to speak and
they're going to take those profits and go home

thanks jim
thank you

will do attack


here's what else you need to an attorney
on tuesday during a white house meeting on m s thirteen gang violence president trump threatened another of government shutdown if democrats refused to agree to his demands on immigration reform if we don't change it let's have a shutdown will do is shut down and it's worth it for occur
love to see a shutdown if we don't get scuffed taken care of the comment which was seemingly off the cuff was at odds with a strategy by a republican leadership to separate the immigration debate from the negotiations over a spending which congress must pass by thursday to avoid a second
government shut down this year
it was an impasse over immigration that caused the government to shut down three weeks ago
at the time senate majority leader mitch mcconnell persuaded democrats to support a temporary spending and reopen the government by vowing to turn to immigration and the dreamers on their own tops after spending plan

that's pretty ah michael verbal
