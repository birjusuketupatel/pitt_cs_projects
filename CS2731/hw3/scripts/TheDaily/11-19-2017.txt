what's your favorite build yourself
only the good die young
particular
yeah
yeah
when they were babies wheels thought they looked very different on that they're fraternal twins not identical
they also present very differently in how they've chosen as they've got bolder to look now that my hair shorter you know like a liar like when he also cut her hair to the learnt that she wanted it it it changed a lot of things for her
that combined with her
crawford's of clothing
mostly terms of the boys rugs
means that most kids and adults assume she's a boy and atlantic sweat pants
tee shirts
my favorite color is blue and green so i were that kind of color staff
for your sister is a bit of a tomboy it sounds like yeah definitely
he said a tomboy there's no doubt that also has chosen her own path here

when do you also get involved in the cross hairs
a thick we sign them up for girl scouts for me were six or seven
so there's the girl scout promise and then there's also the girl scout law okay
on my honor i will try to serve god my country to help people at all times and live by the girl scout law
i will do my best to be honest and fair friendly and helpful consider it and caring courageous and strong and responsible for what i say and do and to respect myself and others expect authority use resources wisely make the world a better place and be a sister to every girl scout
they both would seem to enjoy the least at first i said can all at the time and i was little i only wanted to join because they clearly crying and my friends were there
that's one of the reason they did it but then they just that kind of me
yeah and every meeting all they do when you do late princess coloring pages and they make friendship bracelets
yeah we mostly just made they step out of be it
colored in color in pages
called girlish crafts i don't like that terms where do you think that use ideas
come from of want
coalition boyish mean i didn't come from like a long time ago

girls were assigned to be sharing things more like stayed home things and boys were to where are they going to whine
in the old is he like the were told they were supposed to wear dresses show people have started to quit the dresses and girls together and boys in strong together
i'm always use on t v and it's always frustrates me on the baby be in a hammock
add where it says a girls play with barbies by pink accessories
ne
now glasses
and then maybe another time is an ad for nerve guns in the only actors are boys anything like boys grab you and afghans and go and why are there no girls and because this
the first strike disrupt her in retail that each saucer
it sounds like you've given a lot of photos
yeah
i wasn't actually
as concerned about it into third grade and then i started to think about like how
i was not being the way people expected me to be highly classmates and school say a right wing boy clothes or why do you have boy here that means your boy
i think the turning point for also was that we sent two summers ago some girls two girls go can dig him
and
also had a really hard time it was the same summer that she cut her hair
some kids as to why are you going girls
the all was boy boy mormons you know why there was boy
going with them the girls name
coming up arguments were girls no with the leadership
usually on how
that was the end of her girls didn't
so i just thought well and i don't run girl scout why can't a girl be in boy scouts
i had heard that there are more activities i like like arteries little and horseback riding but they don't actually do horseback ride let enough so things that were more adventurous yeah
in the us last year
and said i want to be a boy scout and our first response was to say no that's not possible when i asked my dad in fan or they probably won't let you in your ground and then i can sneak in and pretend i'm unemployed
because of my hair
still up until just a few weeks ago the rule in the boy scouts was the girls weren't allowed
what is it turns out we know the guy who runs the truth and will probably let me and that mean that that and
traveling what the scout leaders in our local troop told us was that while they couldn't register also with the national organization
they could sign her up they would get her uniform
she could earn all the badges that all the other boys
for all intents and purposes she would be a boy scout and that's the way it's been
what's this kind of can you say
i cannot currently my can i get and and i am standing up kind of get that really quickly short okay i'll be right back please please hold a lady
we'll be right back
you know how sometimes it seems like your kid actually now more than you get ready for more and that because banks to the google and since tent google how many is great for doubting but it's also great for the rest of the family watch this hey google play space trivia what's at the middle of the milky way
galaxy
a black hole yep definitely didn't know that just add your kids google account howard by family link and ask it to do even more staff from choose your own adventure stories to musical chairs
and when you're done listening to this pod cast hey google play the kids daily pod cast here's the latest news from the daily for kids expand the time like only google can
okay i got it okay oh thank you too could you could you recite the pledge for me okay
more of the scout oath is on my honor i will do my best to do my duty to god in my country and to obey the scout law to help other people at all times to keep myself physically strong mentally awake and more and you're straight

i remember the first day
pretty nervous are and i was gonna let alone are on of my head down a little
even i knew people would then is a boy and first i so kind of shy about messy and misunderstand the other ways and job of leg
they loved me a little bit a little strange leaders i gave you
if someone is whole weird had kind of lead the way you look at them like oh okay they definitely knew that i was they are so
no i all i have to introduce myself and i'm gonna be brave about it and i can do it
kind of what i thought


the name is dawn bates
i'm ten years hundred and i'm from marriage must plan name is hair goes in ten years old and i'm from massachusetts harry and are in also true
to me not me but she nearly as the bastards
something that she's pretty she's really good i is like one week there was they said
go to this camp
those this one day where we will make these fought with sticks and also basically she was like a director for everything because there was this one are will take moss a on the bottom of the for would act like a question
earlier
do you remember a moment
also where you felt like the boys in the troop except you
well i was this is actually something very recent just the last part meaning hours actually elected patrol you there
kind of my drill leader of the troop for the rest of the year and it was really happy when they decided mean that's a big deal yeah hello this is dylan if anyone is just secretly telling her like where you a blaze gap just why
why would you do that because you know what
also i can do lots of things end it takes lots of bravery to step up and
cause of people do want to be a leader
it takes to braver
to be a whale
sweet
dylan and harry thank you both for your time i really appreciate you welcome
so also how important do you think it is for someone like you to have the choice between a boy scouts and the girl scouts
i think it's important for me i have a choice because i know if i didn't have a choice
i would be stuck with something i didn't enjoy and if know i had ever had a choice
than
we wouldn't be where we are today
i'll probably wouldn't be the way i am now
i am dry unaware national i think it's very important than i have that choice

they'll hear is my sash pretty nice
i got a again lad is shown cookies
now which is it what what what she's where the girl scout though his new york is one of my favorite things about girl scouts crew on your sister or join the boy scouts you chose to stay in the car scouts what do you like about it
well i don't like hate boys but i do like to get away with just girls for a little bit because boys do for around a lot and sand dams it's a little annoying and some parallel distracting sell our so i like doing stuff with just girls in just
just my friends that are girls
but i really like to use them more cool stuff because
the boy scouts get to do like would clean an obstacle courses in the girl scouts doesn't really do much of that boy scouts goes out and as lake really like cool like crafts like they rock they launch like many rockets and stuff like that
a
when they're on
clear you seem a little envious of what the boy scouts to my him oh yeah i am a little envious
because they get to do slightly more exciting stuff as and they get to have like a pocket knife
do you want to hug him my yeah i'd say sell that would be cool
do you think it would be better to bring in the activities there boys do into girl scouts and set of girls
feeling like they have to leave girl scouts in order to do those active i do think that because i do you using girls can can concentrate more around regular girls but they would like the stuff that boy scouts does so i think it would help of that stuff was brought into the girl scout troops
do you feel you can be more yourself or the you learn more on one it's true across well i think i can be more myself because i feel like not embarrassed around girl sort of like they're more comfortable to top well
and staff sand and girls just need to concentrate and they should be able to just be themselves
when they're with their own gender

who had his summit dollars there are a hold on those planes
we have two very different girls than they are completely their own kids but to leave so they represent other girls i think the the leadership in different ways
sure that they grow only species has been helpful to cluj some degree i can see times when she gets a little over overshadowed by boys then i think having a time and it doesn't happen very often she's in a cold school so the the little bit of time once a week or whatever it wants to hang out with girls
and be doing it seems a little girls
i think it's probably been good for and she seems happy with it
for also she wanted to be in the boy scouts and she has her own reasons for the
it really comes down to what feels and power to them

cleo and and else can you hear me
yeah ok
boy scouts won't start accepting girls until next year but you to have been able to think about what this
decision might mean earlier than most people you're kind of a a glimpse into the future of what a lot of other girls across the country
are going to get to think about sooner if you could give advice to girls who are deciding whether to stay in girl scouts
or join the boy scouts
what would you say to them
okay clear here if i were trying to persuade someone to stain glass cats i would probably say all like a of really really nice girls in the girl scouts and it's just like i've always felt comfortable at east girls especially since then my friends and it
just like the activities i know easy as cool as no one's in boy scouts but we do do some pretty fun activities in the good times together so that's fun
okay elsa responding to the question
i snuck and top
ways away like a girl could join the boy scouts
yeah ok
is because she wanted to be time she can
you can so it's perfectly fine if you want to

i want to tell you both that i think you are really cool
your your great you're smart you're sensitive and caring and i'm really glad to have male
yeah thank you
okie pokey
yeah
