
from the new york times on michael bubble this piece the daily
today
during their historic summit president trump standing next to president poop challenge the conclusion of his own government that russia interfered in the us elections
they think it's russia trump said i don't see any reason why it would be


it's tuesday july seventeen
judy davis what's the main question what's your main question going into this summit on monday while the main question is really you know what is going to try to get out of this and is he in this opportunity we have that sit down with coach and gonna actually bring up
some of the big issues in the relationship primarily the fact that russia interfered in the presidential election but also russia is illegal annexation of crimea the poisonings have written that russia has been accused of carrying out his the president and actually pressed him on these things are going to be all
about friendliness and reaching out which is how the president basically seem to be approaching this in the days leading up to that meeting where in all this is coming just three days after these latest indictments from the special counsel robber mother's investigation indictments of russian government officials which left to essentially under nine
mobile that russia medals in the twenty six election and that it was orchestrated by prudent and this government right i mean this there's always going to be a topic of conversation at this meeting he said that he was going to ask about it even before we knew that these indictments are going to happen but certainly once they came down on friday
it completely changed the cast of the cement and was this going to change a president's tack on this is approach to put non the issue or was he going to do what he's done in the past are essentially to ask the question but when push him and has denied a know he's basically moved on from and
and the fact that the indictments came down on friday mean let's just move on just really impossible
so what happens as this day begins in helsinki that gives us some idea of what the answer will be just on so for his part the president started the day with a series of fire he tweets president champ as he is want to do start treating unquote our relationship with
russia has never been worse thanks to many years of us homelessness and stupidity and now the rig which which of course his way of referring to the mother investigation
so right off the bat he's essentially parenting or hijacking a pollutant narrative the russian air at him which is but it's the united states that is responsible for the difficulties in the relationship it's the united states that's been at fault that we haven't pursued a better and warmer relationship with russia annexed time
to change that and that was the going in pastor and very quickly within an hour i think the russian foreign ministry retreated the president of united states and said we agree we agree with the president united states sentiment that the problem here even though we have my old in the us election the problem here is the united states
right
and that tweet and the russian agreement with it that now kind of feels like a harbinger for the rest of the day absolutely
and good morning to you a bit of drama this morning as this summit is already an hour behind schedule so for a while after president trump has treated and he is not the finish president he's waiting for couldn't to arrive he was scheduled to arrive just about an hour
our ago but as president potent likes to do he likes to keep other world leaders are waiting and repeat in likes to arrive late meetings like this one and of a power play the pros united states now walking in to meet

there you see that handshake and warm words between president trump and president potent as part of them you know the reporters filed out and it was time for them to me alone with just their translators and that's what they didn't present and trump is now meaning behind closed doors with russian president vladimir poodle and finland's presidential palace and then they were supposed to spend ninety minutes together
they spent more than two hours together just the two of them and their interpreters the no advisers president now president who brags about his ability to make a deal is sitting down with one of the most experienced players on the world stage which was a prospect that had really alarm and a lot of people going in during couldn't time in power he's met with every year
us president since bill clinton because it's kind of a big deal when the president of the united states and russia talk together and for there to be no historical record at all of that is pretty extraordinary server to president reached burned to come out every moment we're watching her door there was a longish way and there was a lot of anticipation because nobody
really knew what we were going to hear when they going to come out with some big announcement were they going to make nice were they going to be very have to do with each other
some terms of what happened
it was just kind of black box
so that's where we were that she president walken
so the two of them come out of the through a side door and the it their place that their lectern
personal issue
just so much president spoke first distinguished mr president
what it isn't gym he essentially started out by saying you know less than what we've had this tension and there's no reason for it the war is a thing of past situation and the world changed dramatically you know he really i think was trying to strike the tone of were world leaders and we should be on an equal plane to those ghosts
asians referred to go or joint wish i were drink with jewish with present from to redress this negative situation and volatile relationship and of course this is part of pollutants objective here is to be seen as not a pariah not as someone who invade countries and murders people but as someone who's the big player on the world stage and word
the summit with the american president and once again prison trump motion the issue of a so called interference of russia
american elections he did mention what he called the so called interference of russia russians food has never interfered and is not going to interfere in to internal american affairs including your approaches and he kind of the ended it on a positive note he said in general we are globe with the outcome of
first full kill meeting had a good conversation with person trump and i hope we started to understand that other better and i'm grateful to donald forward forward and it was pretty clear he was happy with the way things went but he wasn't gloating he was just being very matter of fact and laying out what he thought that they had gotten out of the top
and then
have just completed a meeting with version important when a wide range of critical issues for both of our countries we are direct open deeply productive dialogue
when very will it was trumps turn a productive dialogue is done only good for the united states and good for russian what it is good for the world and he kind of portrayed it as a political risk for him i would rather take a political risk in pursuit of peace
the to risk peace in pursuit of politics as president i will always what is best for america
what is best for the american people that you know he was willing to take this a grass and because you know there's that it's dark opportunity here and i like repair the relationship with russia and he made this comment what our relationship has never been worse
that it is now
however
changed
as of about four hours ago
meaning like he donald trump by having this meaning had essentially you just kind of change the relationship and that this was the dawn of something much better during today's reading i addressed directly with president potent the issue of russian interference in our elections and during his opening scene
the president said that he had addressed directly with in the issue of russian interference in the us election and he said i felt this was a message burst delivered in person our ears perked up and we thought oh maybe this is condemning this spent a great deal of time talking about
president bush
may very well want to address it
and very strongly because she feels very strongly about the news an interesting idea and then that was it
this is the moment that you've been waiting for instance all of us have been waiting for not just since these indictments on friday but maybe even since the meddling occurred that standing together in front of the public the president would speak candidly
occasionally about this interference this historic interference in our election and he does that instead yeah it was striking because the way he phrased that it was a message best deliver it in person
you could imagine him going on to say you know in the message is you've attacked our democracy you better not do it again years the price you're going to pay for her but there was none of bad and you know him he is on the stage with couldn't standing right next to him and whether or not he had brought it up privately this would have been the moment
on the world stage to say to people i'm taking this guy task i am holding him to cap and he just was not going to go there
this was a very constructive day this was a very constructive few hours that we spent together
it's a the interests of both of our countries
to continue our conversation and we have agreed to do so
i'm sure we'll be meeting again in the future often and hopefully we will solve every one of the problems that we discussed today show again version and boot thank you very much
so then they finish their statements and it was time to take questions and the press mr president you treated this morning that it's us foolishness stupidity and the muller pro that is responsible for the decline in us relations with russia president champ as asked by athletes reporter for writers do you hold russia at all
all accountable for anything in particular and if so what would you what would you consider them that they are responsible for yes i do i older both countries responsible and the president essentially
no i think that the united states has being foolish i think we've all been foolish we should add this dialogue a long time ago
long term frankly before i got office
they were all to blame he doesn't take the opportunity again to take him to task for any things i think that the the probe is a disaster for our country any kind of pivots from the general thing and starts talking about mother proud i think it's kept a support it
kept the separated there was no collusion at all
everybody knows it
people are being brought out to the four so far that i know virtually none of it related to the campaign and they gonna have to try really hard to find somebody that did relate to the campaign there was a clean campaign
i beat hillary clinton easily and frankly we beat her and i'm not even saying from the standpoint we won that race
it's a shame that they could even be a little bit of the cloud over it
people know that people understand it but the main thing and we discussed is also zero collusion and it has had a negative impact upon the relationship of the two largest nuclear powers in the world we have ninety percent of nuclear power between the two countries it's
ridiculous it's ridiculous what's going on with the bro you know that was a pretty striking
well man where you know he's for weeks and months his advisors have been saying we are holding russia accountable for friends malign activities and here is a direct question about the your old russia accountable for anything and the president doesn't mention anything and he is instead blaming the are prob for president
i could follow up as well
and then put in his ass by the same report or the american reporter fighters why should americans and why should president trump believe your statement that russia did not intervene and the two thousand and sixteen election given the evidence that us intelligence agencies have provided and will you consider extraditing the twelve russian officials there were indicted last week by us grand jury will
a little at the president answer the second part of their coercion and trump jumps in before curtain has a champs but as you know the whole concept of that came up perhaps a little bit before but it came out as a reason why the democrats lost an election
which frankly they should have been able to win because the electoral college is much more advantageous for democrats as you know than it is to republicans we won the electoral college by a lot three o six to two twenty three i believe and that was a well for
that was a well fought battle we did a great job
essentially it's very clear that he thinks it's class question about twelve russian officers you are again accused of attacking the american electoral system
at the whole issue is meant to undercut him he is completely focused on the fact that these people are not failure but has campaigned and has nothing to do with him just to say it one time again and i say it all the time
there was no collusion i didn't know the president
there was nobody to collude with so he views the through the prism of his own campaign and his election not the democratic system and the electoral process it was undermined right we win a brilliant campaign and that's why i am president
so then you know it's couldn't turn to answer and at this point he basically doesn't have any any more trump has already made his case as to who has to be believed who's not to be believed
you can trust no one if you if you do this what did you give this idea that president term trusts me or i trust him
he defends the interest of the united states of america and i do defend the interests of the russian federation any essentially says you know there's no proof we should be guided by effects could you name a single fact of what definitively prove the collusion
this is an utter nonsense
just like the present recently mentioned i just wasn't your own president he denied that so you now don't take my word for it yeah take your own president's work for it that was really striking because you know
a lot of these encounters are about message and what's that in public and what is seen in public
and the spectacle of the two of them a pair of offending russia
and essentially rolling their eyes and calling ridiculous the basis of a federal investigation that's been minimized by the entire intelligence community of the united states was something right
the final question for the united states will go to jonathan home air from the ip the second american question the final american question was printing press reporter and he basically just heard it said president chump very directly who do you believe just out as of important denied having anything to do with the election interference in two thousand and sixteen every us intelligence agency is going to
russia did what who my first question for you sir is who do you believe my second question is would you now with the whole world watching tell president what you did doubts what happened and twenty sixteen which warn him to never do it again this is kind of the final chance for trump to say so
something judgment at all about the russian interference in the us auction in front of the man who director that's right so let me just say that we have two thoughts you have group said are wondering why the f b i never took the server and he pivots to its idea of where hillary clinton's emails what
happened to the servers of the pakistani gentleman that worked on the day and were of those servers they're missing where are they what happened to hillary clinton's emails thirty three thousand emails gone just gone i think in russia they wouldn't be gun show easily and why didn't the f b i
in accept that their servers at the dance scene that were hacked into why was the f b i told to leave the office of the democratic national committee i've been wondering that i've been asking them for months and months and i've been putting it out and calling it out on social media
where is the server and where he essentially says i i don't know which to believe and he kind of indicates the he leans toward project i have a president important he'd you said it's not russia i will say this i don't see any reason why it would be that i really do want to see the server
what i have i have confidence in both parties anything i have confidence in both parties both parties us
latimer couldn't and his intelligence official so i have great confidence in my intelligence people but i will tell you the president who's extremely strong and powerful in his denial today i mean it's essentially as if he's making excuses for food and who's sitting
they're smart gang and looks like feeling very good about itself julie what is the reaction in the room at this moment i mean what is it like to be in that room as the president of united states rejects his own countries version of events
in favor of russians this country that we are accusing of having done this i think that it took everyone's breath away i mean start of these things are things that we have heard the president say snippets of of for but it's a very different thing for him to be on foreign soil with the president of russia
and undercutting his whole administration has or government so i think you know there was a lot of looking around at each other like is this
really happening
and what does this actually mean and at a certain point
after that last question was asked and he did not take the side of the united states it was almost like the oxygen
it was just very hashed

do the whole time i'm watching this honestly i'm just wondering why genuinely why would the president that's what is to be gained for him
and for the united states in seeming to side with russia over his own country and his own government at such a sensitive moment when russia's role in attacking our free elections is becoming more and more undeniable who gains from god i think it's really hard to say i don't believe that this
well thought out well planned now reaction that he had to these questions
what we saw was the president being defensive about something that he considers to be an affront it has legitimacy
and he could not see past that and it was not i don't think him at that moment about national security or the standing of the united states in the world it was about him and feeling like he was being undermined and undercut and that he could never be as powerful as he wanted to be he could never have this kind of relationship that he wants to have a threat
russia as long as this was hanging over him
and i think he feels on some level that any acknowledgement of what has happened
that it somehow means that he is not a legitimate president and he's not willing to do it
do think that many of us are sort of misunderstanding this moment because i think most of us saw these twelve and vitamins coming three days before the summit as basically requiring trump to finally condemn rushes meddling in the election put his boots
actually happening the timing of these indictments is causing trump to be more inclined to defend and less willing to criticize because of the questions that it raises about his election and twenty sixteen and about his legitimacy i think that's possible i mean i think that part
of the message from the indictment on friday part of the expectation was almost all this gives the president a much stronger hand going into these meetings to basically you know throw the document down in front of couldn't and say look we know that's happened what are we gonna do about it
and then it when some way he is the conversation for him to stay were holding you accountable
what we've got how are we gonna make sure this doesn't happen again but i think instead of say it almost feels to him like device is getting tighter and the narrative that he doesn't like that russia helped him to win the election is gaining ground because these indictment there so clear
and detailed about how it happened
instead of kind of strengthening his hand which it will have done for any other american president in this position i think he felt that it under kind of even further and so he's even less willing to acknowledge that there's anything to hold russia accountable for a question for president for president thank you so the how does this
finally and julie well cells president wouldn't have asked do you just the military government have any compromise material on president or his family and he pauses what the translation goes through and laugh
kind of roll his eyes and he said yeah i've heard those rumors old distinguished color good material you bruce when prison transit it school board when i didn't even know that he was in law school it's nothing it's difficult to imagine a nuances of a bigger scale
please just disregard the shoes and don't think voters anymore you so at that point jump jump back in and the last thing he says is if couldn't have anything on me it would have without longer go and if anybody watch peter struck testifying over the last couple of days and i was in brussels watch figured it was it
disgrace to the of the it was a disgrace to our country and you would say that was a total witch hunt thank you very much everybody thank you
and then he turned on a feel and he walked out

so president trumps final words on this historic day at the end of this summer is that the muller investigation which just indicted twelve of pollutants officials for hacking the united states election was a total withdrawn
guess

joy thank you very much thank you my

we'll be right back



thirty years what else you need to an attorney
