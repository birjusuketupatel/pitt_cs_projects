
from the new york times ah michael barbara this is the daily

today the sole survivor of a brutal murder identified three white men as the attackers
so why did police ignore those suspects and put a young black man on death row
it's wednesday may thirtieth
on the morning of june fifth nineteen eighty three and chino hills california bill and marianne to use were a little bit concerned because their eleven year olds and had not come back from a sleep over at a neighbor's christoph is a columnist at the times so what about noon the dad built use drove over to pick
it's time nobody answered the door so he looked through the sliding glass doors and all he saw was red
it dawned on him what he was seeing he kicked down the door he rushed to the body of his son who had been stabbed to death
dougan peggy ryan both forty one was found in their home hacked to death along with their ten year old daughter jessica and a young neighbor eleven year old christopher hughes and the other son josh ryan a eight year old hosted sleep over it had his throat slashed and his head
cashed in but he was still moving

yeah
it was about as gruesome murder is one can have and
who's there immediately and idea of who had done this a suspect edelman seized on
there were some clues almost right away nothing was taken from the ryan house except the family station wagon
we're looking for the ryan automobile the ryan station wagon had been stolen and several people had seen three white people inside that station wagon driving it away
people who had seen three white people at a bar with bloody clothing
and then soon afterward a woman called out and said that she believed that her boyfriend had been involved in the murders he was a white man who had recently been released from prison for murdering his seventeen year old and he had come home late on the night of the killings
in a vehicle that resembled the ryan station wagon and he had left his bloody coveralls on the floor on top of that josh the kid who survive said that three or four a white men had done this already got to require ask them how many people are there are one two three and his why a while he was recuperating
just maintain that there were three attackers and so the police initially put out a bullet am looking for three white killers and were those three wide suspects
arrested
no instead they arrested twenty five year old black man kevin cooper who two days before the killings had escaped from a minimum security prison and where you were serving standards for burglary

oh wow brought up and walk
good got reporter
will go error
but what are all
i've gotten
i'm going to work at all
gov
oh are here
what drama and where did you go next after you walk away though
oh well
whoa whoa
good our governor cobra
euro dollar an hour
i worded here
so cooper please the prison any hides out in an abandoned house which unfortunately for him is just one hundred and twenty five yards away from the crime scene
i think the police simply looked at this and it was just too much of a coincidence how could it be that you have a desperate escape felon who just happens to be staying in ban and house so close to where it is brutal crime unfolds
and frankly i think there was also an element of racism they looked at the mug shot of kevin cooper in here is this young man his rap sheet showed that he'd been arrested ever since he was seven years old he had a long criminal history and i think they just decided this is it ah the
mobile alabama
educated
what
oh yeah
our right
mama a
so the police are looking for kevin cooper but they're not finding a lot of evidence linking him to the murder scene they don't find fingerprints of them they don't find his hair's they search house where he was staying and initially they don't find any evidence they search the car
they belong to the ryan's you've been stroll initially they don't find anything they are either
and then mysteriously evidence begins to appear

they find a hatchet chief it had missed the first time and a prison uniform button and they also find cigarette butts that he had apparently smoke i think the authorities thought they were acting on the side or just just i think they thought that given cooper was a multiple murderer
and they were frustrated by the lack of evidence to show that so i think they help the process along a little bit so you believe from your reporting that the police department planted evidence against kevin cooper having could is in their minds that he did it and the day were doing a public service by putting evidence there
that would make it possible for them to arrest and victim that's exactly right
hurt her
a quarter or
right
it all away or
or
our
don't either
oh no
what
the way to go to rio bravo

wow
he is tried in the end the jury said that if they've been one last piece of evidence against him they might have voted to acquaint kevin cooper has been convicted on four counts of murder and run counter i'm attempted murder they took a week to convict him a jury has to decide whether cooper said be sentence
the gas chamber and then he was sentenced to death
and so he was scheduled to be executed in two thousand and four

how about it again
before meet everybody walk under every game make walking near came out in a body bag of the first one ever walk into your car out and walk out


granted stay to say down whether given to greece blood on that he should some in or and
a test tube of these bloods it's been taken by is yours
i'm going after he was arrested and so the court said that they could test that bloodstained to see if it had a blood preservatives cause he
it it's good exists
exactly and so this was basically and mc was that blood planted or day he bleed and the commission is a crime so what happens when they actually do the test is your designed signed elevated a bloodstain so it seems has come
on from get to bruce arteries and veins but rather from the test to that's been taken of his blood held by the sheriff's department does it's the evidence on the t shirt was planned was planted and to to back up they went back to the test tubes that be taken in the check the blood that was in it
it turned out now they have the blood of two or more people so it seems that some blood had been spilled out on that shirt and then to top it up date with somebody else is blood in and so that wouldn't be suspiciously low
so what happens to kevin cooper astor that discovery displaying his judicial appeals have essentially run out so he is making political appeals to allow the evidence to be tested using advanced techniques and hadn't existed before and so he makes these appeals of
governor schwarzenegger who at the end of his term says well this is actually pretty serious but i don't have enough time left in office and i have my it's accessories will review this carefully he appeals to come along harris when she is attorney general california and her office she refuses to allow advanced dna testing he appeals to give
brown and one of the reasons i wrote about this case is this is not alabama this is not mississippi this is not text this is a do democratic this is california this is a democratic liberal governor jerry brown who is refusing to allow testing camilla harris before that and say evil for whom liberal
policies around law enforcement have become default absolutely so
let's see whether we managed to get justice in california under a democratic governor and that will be a measure of the degree to which things have changed which there has been real progress in criminal justice on race since nineteen eighty three
so it seems pretty clear from what you've said and from your reporting that the police planted evidence against coburn but for years now many high level thinkers would seem to have known this or has been brought evidence of it and cooper is still on death row
are we missing anything here about why that would be the case is there a version of this story where perhaps evidence was planted but cooper is indeed guilty of this crime and i'm trying on my head around why so many smart people in positions of power could have known so much of what your now bringing
forward and yet here we are east on death row i've been racking my brain to try to understand how this could happen that session and grudges case of framing of an innocent man on death row and i can't come up with any explanation other than just the jury to wish
institutionally once somebody is found guilty there is this resistance to defense appeals and this system kind of sets in motion this process that ends up with somebody on its trajectory to be executed
what's been the reaction since you wrote a story for the times and she revealed you have found camilla harris called me up next day to say she felt terrible about the case she issued a statement calling for advanced dna testing in the case so we're forcing herself from our time as attorney general of california that's correct and several other california
politicians have done the same a candidate for governor candidate for attorney general sen dianne feinstein the other senator has done the same jerry brown has not spoken san bernardino county district journey put out a statement saying that kevin cooper is guilty that there should not be testing
so he's sticking with the conclusions of this case despite everything that's exactly right

and since
nick published historian the times senator como harris
has come forward and she has urged governor brown to do what you're asking
my boy
already robert
your go
mark over the counter
oh so you're not as a preventative is she might think
a lot
to do you think that you have a chance now
notes
oh
oh
oh good
yeah why
go work
what are you want
apartment for every car
what what about about problem
how we make okay show
to your mind the more the situation movies theoretically towards justice the more the system
finds a way to move away from justice to to kind of keep the status quo
oh probably go
about about it
oh what
at be and what we wanted
oh
i wonder
when you think about all that's happened to you
who in your mind
do you blame
yourself
cobra all of a model
roma roma
or to pick up her hair congregate around
but require got a over
or not

kevin cooper remains on death row
as governor jerry brown reviews his request for additional dna testing last week the san bernardino district attorney my remus filed a petition opposing such testing citing could false claims some cooper and his propaganda machine
designed to undermine public confidence in the just verdict
yeah
use what else needs hundred eighty on tuesday north korea's top nuclear weapons to go sheer kim jung troll arrived in new york to meet with secretary of state my pump hail the strongest signal yet that of possible june twelfth summit with president trump
may still occur
kim jung troll is officially barred from entering the us because of sanctions put in place in two thousand and ten following accusations the he was responsible for torpedoing a south korean navy vessel which killed forty six people
and in the latest effort to count the dead from hurricane maria
researchers on tuesday estimated that the storm killed four thousand six hundred people in porto rico last year many of them from delayed medical care
that figure is dramatically higher than the official porta rican government tally which found that just sixty four people had been killed because of the hurricane

that's it for the daily on michael barbara see them wow
