
for many times and ankle barbara
this is the daily
today
part three of our series on lease and policing in baltimore
what happened to a generation caught between of crack epidemic that consume their parents and the of crest of police tactics meant to fix the problem
it's wednesday june sixth
i care
detroit
i'm sure
and into can i go ahead and a look at it

the first time i went to visit toby at her house we went into this empty room
she called it looks room or yeah this is the way
you might have agreed and you guys
so the room is filled with all these photos knock and she tells me to bring up this one
it's blown up the poster size and it is really beautiful photo of seven teenage boys
and it is right in the middle of them

it was agree about filigree right
with them
on the far left is fat
me
he's the one of the dreads making if he signs
lisa then comes to raise or too easily next best friend and this one does raises where the niche
he has his arm kind of casually hung around my neck not smiling just be mean he looks like someone just cracked a joke and he's cracking up and then there's eddie on the rate in a red sweatshirt kim
jim
he's wearing kind of oh what looks like a varsity jacket and tatar and tata
s many




the went verizon i phone september two thousand and good thing
they and went teach them the there and it's that thing
september two thousand and fifteen eddie a thing is though was set in the street
and get an annuity with one the nanny about to take that one of their may he i kill fifty three days if the math
the this is the rest them i think it's the my there i got over it then but at them around said honest that
oh
my family are fun
man why you know it as little for what are their status as drama
he was dave and although his day when
three
federal out of seven from two are in jail or one survived everybody else does indeed
so she reaches for this photo album and she opens it up in front of us
and she starts flipping through showing us birthdays family celebrations kill all with milk and their extended family of friends in their neighborhood
and so many of them
had been killed
a girl cause in danger ne win and grew up together episode i'm give his children
she was killed
that was man was a may a cousin named little tony another friend named the leak
he was noted
thinking hold on a second
right
i actually couldn't quite process it i didn't know how to ask her question i didn't know how to ask a question about it
his baby their innovation israel rabid generation
the girl and our babies bailey is the town
i mean it reminds me of
covering the war in iraq and having people die
you know right under your nose you're having an interview and writing a story about a family and you leave them on friday and come back on a tuesday and the father's dead
i mean that would happen all the time and that's what her life is like people are just evaporating and not you know all people who got cancer
but seventeen year old fifteen year olds
insane
they're like in a war or something what happened
hand in a war itself




zero tolerance policing we're supposed to make life better for next generation
that we supposed to stop the crime from the crack epidemic that had so tormented toby and that is generations
but obviously that's not how it played out
instead look in his friends their lives were shaped by two forces first by what the drugs and the job losses had done to their parents and the options they soft their lives as a result but then second by policing strategy that seem to assume their destiny from the very beginning
arrested or dead

here's there were
i never it
funny looking
he
long alleys
with around him
the road
what did you remind you
what do you look like
me
oh my god
everyday
about
now
very very
so it turns out that when nuke was younger he spent several years living with his great at marion it's younger sister she become really successful it's an accountant
and she moved out to baltimore county like so many upper middle class people in baltimore in this year's
it was a world away from toby in the city
when you could get a better life
at know be
or
whenever we want our could get better and why
you know
really an hour and a about having more



had piano lessons the time sign language they taught him how to read very early
very martin
autumn

and a rated highly literate
oh
the order
we were here
let me right here
law in order for the court you're right
when they are not all her with her all the all
no not no
i remark



but he didn't last
no longer life
right
what do you want
about
nick wanted to go back to the city back to his mom he was a strong willed kid so we moved back in with toby
she's working night as a bartender
he was often fending for himself this just and you are looking at of obviously a very disturbing live shot there that is the world trade center and we have unconfirmed reports this morning that a plane has crashed into one of the towers of the world trade center
what the morning of september eleventh
because in this daycare preschool type thing some blocks away in west baltimore and nobody can route to be an phone the school has to shut down because the plane just hit the twin towers and everything's closing oh my goodness oh god there's another one and know who at the time is three makes his
way home himself
he crosses this big avenue lafayette avenue as a three year old and his own and that was kind of his world he had to figure it out for himself
and make his own way
reader he was like a leader he was he doesn't really everybody told to stop
no
you don't say while oh no
everywhere i love
nuke met milk in elementary school all the law to level
you don't mind me might be to mark russell would have been what he plan to be given a little creative tension some oxygen all getting it now
he also i see no no more shows will will still require yemen and and store he was like the pied piper of children in the neighborhood not obese in a plan with them
all our way we play point one key you don't rail his tank he is a beetle around a corner own own radical
oil and he planned all up he was the fun one
he like bikes are located right
as we all do
or more oh yeah why new bikes no eggs were device came from
always buy it
all your might not might be four bytes out and take years it might be for terrorism
much are lawyers and many bikes and stuff like that

yeah
the
could could do reading them
nick was in high school when he was killed
he was one of seven kids and it's high school killed and little over a year
different kids then once in the photo but was never really interested in school
it
hi
this is actually not right
three
he was never scared to say that i want the and police are back
he like both the world
and then it was he might be a rapper
i won't save it
be isn't that nothing illegal then
and was acquitted is be you really know
i mean for it
okay so it's easy you know that
when they told me i so embarrassing

and no idea
three

so his grandmother did get him a job in the library one summer
but he didn't take to it it was too slow
he was looking around his neighborhood and he seemed pretty much one path to getting had fast
and that was the streets we grew up so young
we are paying attention to it key
why and a half hours style asking a lot of sad times when we was all the steps you watch watch them awesome
new grew up watching the young men in this neighborhood
and watching their relationship with the police he's watch and okay saw the police came from this way
he got away and ran that way saying when you could you miles you get older you do you to to use will ago i know what you do with do because i was watch and so yeah
long before nick was actually doing anything illegal
he had some run ins with the police but then look did start selling drugs when he was about thirteen with his friends say
he got with his post in the photograph
they to block where they worked and then to protect it
their turf they got guns

they don't do shit will make your life
we just trying to get our money
how's your wages are lower
they not understand what that's how it is with us
san fran and people outside in whizzes some misguided their pride in an alternate universe now we found that attention on a black and at to black with
well we just china all that situation
early gave it to be a plus
the fact that they are lake say they're enforcing a law against the thing that you're doing were like it's that way they how do you understand that when i'm dawn

that's life
i ride out hustle a he will a soldier they whoever by
stuff like it is not people they just cover bear situations
we just charming and better
what the police nerdy not want to understand it he said he just bought a house ireland in a cave laying on of money or we read me we need this summer so much money
nick spend some time in jail but when he got out he kept going and he was making money
he bought nice clothes keep our car even we didn't have a license instagram account was full of him holding money flipping through it counting it when smiling with a giant wads of cash in his best know hundred twenty two and on a tank which one is with the prize
already added the matches it
everyone wanted our legal money
legal money safe

a whole objective of illegal legal money is the enough a legal money so it's hard to meet women as objects
to if your close
pine clothes what
the the are keen personal a primary make enough to give me a house buy a house in my neighborhood rented out with somebody
cause thousand cars to bob luxury manage some
i'm a key possible keep on stand alone
we started reporting in baltimore because of nick's story
but actually nuke with the exception
he was shot by the police
but there's other young man in a photo most of them were killed by other young men in baltimore
the thing about murder in baltimore is that it's actually really tightly contained to the circle of people committing crimes
he were killed in baltimore last year the likelihood is he'd been arrested an average of eleven times
which means to days victim is often yesterday's perpetrator
and what's left is a very unusual situation in america where in these baltimore neighborhoods an eighteen year old has a one in seven chance of dying before he reaches his mid thirties
and nukes friends they notice that all you surprised the wine f
oh no never
the old is nice bullet come into was you or your ball
don't is it you know you all live illinois you won't that
his
is so overwhelming that moment
scary moment
what it come with it
soybean income again
every play
so is scary you know his head and one day
you know that's possible
you way that volume
you've already had a black damn i like that
be angry be his life
we'll be right back


which kind of eerie feeling when you go to the block or no been selling drugs
most days friends are still there
doing their thing
get the sense that nothing's really changed
there's just a different kid in spot

his block was the corner of calhoun pratt that in west baltimore
there's a bodega on the corner
ball guys holding back the potato chips and people milling around
when his lies
women are being
dave
they married
we get out of murder
it's cold and what of next friends is inside that the degas watching the streets you the glass door what if you want for himself
see this
a theater leaf
and when we say get away meaning like we fought mean
if
remember him talking about them

the studio
so all of a sudden this police car pulls up this
arrogance
but not just like slows down and put on the brake and pulls up but like screech is practically bumping up onto the curb i mean goes from seventy to zero in like three seconds
any cops get out
yeah
or standing there in the middle of the street and this kind of absurd situation in which they're kind of bantering and they're all kind of insulting each other and you can't really tell what's going on
made it badly on the way and i'm sorry
then i add and nukes friend is just shouting about nice of belongs against him
when i was just riding a bicycle and you accuse me of haven't stolen it
oh driving too fast
you put me in the back of your police car and took me in a rough ride this before
freddie grade before they start known as the shit that they do that for you
did this you did value
for me
then one right
go
oh yeah yeah
have the police have no idea who i am and are confused by my presence
if you refer them or a reporter
focus on
yeah
okay
to israel
you're probably got a private server
it's clear there's this long history between them
like this is some your cat and mouse routine that both sides understand
got a baby
beg me
no thanks
for a few minutes of this the cops get in the car and drive off the suit
but i didn't really leave
the car kept buzzing the block i mean really accelerating like it was like on a race track or something
going around and around backing up really quickly tearing through an alley

i asked the guys i said this is usually happens when is he doing and they were like oh yeah that's what he does every deck
people your name
and i mean obviously this is a place where drugs are being sold the police should be here
but it's just the way that it's happening
he pops up on to the curb interested to people you have not
so
it looks friends
pretty and faced we'll see what would you want
all
in the midst of all of this guy's in the corner makes a drug self
just they seem very effective
what
any kind of occurred to me
oh this is exactly what we've been hearing about policing in baltimore after free grave
the police been trying to get away from their cave here
but don't know what to replace it with what to do instead
so what's left is this kind of half thing
this winding up of the hammer
but him i never comes down
and so you have these teenagers openly breaking the law
the cops still unsure how to police them
nothing's really happening
drugs are still being sold on the corners
and the kids were selling them keep dying
the four boys in that photograph they were all killed after freddie grey
yeah
and then just like that it's over
cops drive off
a knicks fan keeps talking to me about knock no different from
whoever the
we we the fourth
so
he made different new way
one particularly baltimore city
gets the money
when
no choice but to do
or starve
ebay don't come from a
a by don't come from new home
some i no choice but way
dat no bad
so this me it is really neat
something you take it a new house in me on steam
do you think know of
when you were younger
so what are you see when i was here
he rarely eighty though
by the only in relief
we started off him and his mother
mm
silly kind of had a choice pretty kind of
candace sawyer



oh
or
or or
oh
what

next time he thinks he did have a choice
no probably right now be at cornell or something like there are some with i mean this is for the most part of family they kept rising like mary and the accountant
or is great i'm gina who built in very successful business
she got pregnant at sixteen
and worked three jobs so her son murray's could go to private school
ragu
regret
are you
an hour or whatever
right
you got a a
walk right out
oh no armor
our out about their army
got out army or you

some people love the street
something not to do some people have little choice but to be but some people can do better if did not given an opportunity some people it's eleven and can make that choice can go away it right or left and some people just love the street by you have some guys love doing business have
something you love what you do some people some people who love the street life some people love been in the mix some people feel more comfortable and the street
whether the whatever whatever reason they feed off the energy of the outside
the possibility of merited safe selling drugs do all the shiites the miss him
he got to be on a swivel somebody is trying to get some people pops that's the heartbeat of the life
the more i listened to everyone in his life talk the more i was thinking
false choice
wasn't really a choice for him
he was a little kid
he wanted to be with his mom
and his mom was in that world
and his mom loved him fiercely and he left her too and he would have been unreasonable to expect that he would have stayed living away from her forever
so knock as a little kid
chose his mom the street came with her
every near san hit again went to call the police
the
the economy's
a hard question is how question it
and as gate
that's a question that she would don't know if he because if their own shell hit again and eight
guess where where's it at home as the here
charlie now companies down on apple and a snapple areas and this might not right
atticus at night and that then there's by eddie by saying so selfish
you don't know who to trust everybody is a everybody wanted that and everybody can get a then as again
and when escape or one day they if they want to trade though
asked her if she thought no choice
didn't really answer but she did say this
was this guy he have a
baby this
lita eight the day if old a fatty
ladies on his way
is where are the on thing without any do it again oh is that it is gonna be right in a family it's down do it and she saying all of this i'm realizing she sounds proud of him for being a leader in this world and could he have stay for camp or just like can't work at the line
for example like with him off or something like that
didi it was there is now the angle they couldn't wait
that's not him
that way
no on that the spaceship a is points to the mall or they can get up and take a day in the house is going to be built at the end
angle me no other way and it became be that way and will be no
i kind of stopped me my tracks
here was someone who loved her son so much admired her son so much
but he lived in its upside down land and they were very very few ways to make it as they side
this was the fastest way and was good at it
he was important in that world a leader
and she didn't want to take that away from him
she wasn't gonna stand in his way and stuff
if glad this is to normalcy
every berlin employee malice he get a he
like so a death
this is asked and
they will make life
each generation tries to you
next generation better
my grandfather went to my mobile the me to her with these don't be better than meetings ever better than me so on the flip side of the spectrum on a street right now
ill be deeper in the streets to me as a nurse him and raise him just like i am now to be stopped them a nurse and raise them to be the streets like a mobster to marry his son to be a master them with the world's to maybe get made and go higher and become the ball to the fail weasel he didn't make that makes it so of street you can
the same they intentionally or unintentionally and you think that's what happened
the ear
i mean i i just do this he foresaw the ending was op i don't think she thought it was going to be on okay she also other
he wanted to address they
hello
what hat


as i mean isn't that thing and raise raise it
that new york thing




changes
bentley
yeah

use what else in the tunnel
the results of tuesday's primary boating in california
the single most important battleground for democrats trying to retake bows are still coming in but as of wednesday morning
early returns seem to show that democrats are in the top positions in the key districts where they are hoping to reclaim seats previously held by republicans california is unusual primary system allows the top two candidates to advanced to the general election were card list of party
which had raised fears that democrats could be locked out all together in the final round of voting democrats think that california could give the party a third of the seats they need to regain control of congress
and shove it up
have enough work with american people
that we should be here during the week on tuesday senate majority leader mitch mcconnell cancelled most of the senate's annual august recess in a move that could keep democratic lawmakers off the campaign trail ahead of this fall's elections
mcconnell said the decision would give the senate time to complete important legislative work but the times report it is as much a political maneuver that would force nearly a dozen democratic senators to choose between missing votes in washington
and defending their vulnerable seats back at all
oh good greater cooperation but everybody should anticipate that will will bigger


that's it for the daily i'm michael see
oh
