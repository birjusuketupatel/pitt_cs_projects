a look at the final candidates

it's monday
july nine
will make a decision on the united states supreme court
no justice better be made over the next few days and will be a cigarette on monday and i look forward to that i think the person that is chosen will be outstanding thank you very much everywhere

i'll be announcing that on monday
my
adam lived with hours until the announcement of the next supreme court nominee how many serious candidates do believe that president is considering at this point
it looks like we're down to for all of them are federal appeals court judges one of them but cable or sits here in washington judge amy coney barrett suits on the seventh circuit boost in chicago
thomas hardiman sits on the third circuit based in philadelphia
re carefully sits on the sixth circuit boost in cincinnati so these are all federal judges who sit on the court of appeals correct president trump wasting absolutely no time with this one just five days after anthony kennedy announced his retirement from the supreme court the president interviewed
for candidates brat cabin are roman catholic church amy coney beret and thomas hard men as to travel schedule to announce his decision on monday
okay to take us through these candidates the fourth them one by one and let's start on the least conservative end of the spectrum according to conservatives who would be happy to hear conservatives tell that they have the biggest doubts i'm not sure they're justified but the biggest about judge brett or
gentlemen it's two o'clock judiciary committee will proceed with the nomination
kavanagh to be a judge for the court of appeals for the gesture to columbia shorter who surely has the most glittering credentials and the most interesting resume items he has been is illegal i figure whose appeared in every major legal fight in the past couple decades i work for judge star in the independent counsel saw
office he served with can store in the investigation
bill clinton impeachment in that capacity i had the opportunity to argued cases before the supreme court or the united states and the dc circuit court of appeals when the vote for being recounting in florida in the cases that led the bush v gore
was there when alien gonzalez the cuban boy was being deported back to cuba to be with his father he was there in july of two thousand and three i became staff secretary to president bush he served for years in the bush white house and under the circuit which is the second most important court know and i think i've earned the trust of the president of run to the
trust to the senior staff that unfair and even handed
a paper trail and the very rich resume experience and the association with the bush white house which not long ago would been taught to be a good thing among republican has been caused for some of them to doubt his spotify and why what is it about working for president george w bush that would unsettle conservatives about just
conservative cabinet as you will bear in mind that we're sort of the point in the oscar season where there's a month left and everyone is pissing on everyone else is moving so some of this criticism is a bit of a stretch but there are people who say sure he voted in the right direction in cases on abortion
the affordable care act but he didn't go quite as far as he could these are the kinds of distinctions people in the right growing so it sounds like when we're putting these potential nominees on a conservative spectrum if cavanaugh is furnace to left the band on the spectrum is pretty narrow
yes if there is a band at all if we have enough information to make this judgment at and really the key question is not how conservative they are relative to each other it's how conservative they are relative to the middle of the court that they will sit on the middle of the court will be john roberts they will be do the right of john roberts and it will be roberts who will hold the control
vote on the court so it almost doesn't matter whether you're between gore seat channel leno or your between a lido in thomas in terms of conservative news so long as you're to the right of robert's you will have done the job that republicans want dome which is to make sure that there are five votes in any major decision which
is to create a reliably conservative juggernaut five justices all of them committed conservatives as opposed to the world we've lived in for thirty years which is for liberal justices for conservative justices and justice kennedy so all of this infighting is sort of like the
republican primary but once you get to the general everyone is going to love who the candidate is and whoever the candid it is will accomplish the goal republicans want to accomplish if confirmed that person will create the most conservative court we've seen in our lifetime
so and i'm is the biggest thing working against cabin are actually his experience
yes i think so
i mean one thing we haven't touched on is that you can read his experience with the independent counsel investigation of president clinton in various ways i think this goes to a key point center which is impeachment and then conviction take into account more than just the facts because after the fact he is
had some doubts about how wise then investigation was wasn't just a simple question of whether there was a violation of law committed but our broader considerations country and that's where it really gets i think improper for someone in me in an counsel's office to say whether they think the president should have going to eat particularly after working closely with
president bush he's come to the conclusion that we should be very wary of imposing on the time of the prison in the united states who knows he says the hardest job in the world and he says maybe we should defer civil suits criminal investigations criminal prosecutions until he left office and that
kind of talk in the wake of the clinton investigation long before president trump was on the horizon may nonetheless worrisome democrats that should he have an opportunity to vote on some kind of easter rising out of the murder investigation that you would be too sympathetic to presidential power and that my presumably
appeal to president trump a nominee who we can put on the supreme court who might side with him if the mother investigation somehow reaches the supreme court where it certainly has perfect logic to it
that's cavanaugh who is next
gentlemen
two o'clock and we nominate a day is thomas michael hardman tom hardiman of the third circuit mr argument comes to this show
a position with an outstanding record who would be an unconventional choice graduate of notre dame and nineteen eighty seven he didn't go to an ivy league school and you didn't click on the supreme court or in fact for any judge would probably appeals to prison trump is his appealing personality
is hard scrabble routine finance and his education by driving a cab
i feel that i've found my home and the judiciary will all candor understand and he's a different kind of figure that what we're used to seeing and the supreme court and just got to point out that when you mention his education credentials it's not that you animal attack are a snob it's the president trump cares about ideally credentials
it's been reported the prison in trouble and someone from harvard or yale i'm going to submit a list of justices potential justices of the united states supreme court judge that i will appoint from the list while he was a candidate's prison and publish to list of potential supreme court nominees
church
i'm going to have a list of ten were working on it already heritage foundation and others are working on it already and one characterize those lists was almost nobody from washington almost nobody from the ivy league a lot of people from state supreme courts as opposed to federal circuit courts a lot of people from the
the american heartland and it presented a vision of the american judiciary that was sort of at odds with what you see on supreme court today more egalitarian here
and finally i have kept my promise to appoint a justice after he's like that he publishes the supplemental it on my list of twenty judges who will defend our constitution
and was on that list so you sense a kind of tug in two directions of what vision of the supreme court does he want to press and hardiman was also notably the runner up last time around the guy who didn't get the rose that when to kneel course edge instead
and again you put him on the court you put any one of the four people on the court there's not going to be a lot of difference in the voting array so it's really partly what story this prison in trunk wanted till okay so who's next
jokes are his room and catholic church
as careful as young man has been eight years and legal practice to michigan beginning as associate who has spent most of his life in michigan
clerk for justice kennedy also while i was working for judge guy and justice kennedy
i did become i hope reasonably well versed in the criminal actions themselves
so that i would be able to draw on that legal experience
beloved of his clerks an avid outdoorsman a big promoting a second amendment rights he has a concealed carry permit himself and he's written things very much in favor of say religious freedom so there was a case where the question was people at a church run restaurant
who are arguably coerced to work there when threatened that they would be out of favor with god if they didn't work for free whether they were entitled to back wages and the department of labor issues over back wages and george carefully says the government has nothing to say in this realm these are decisions to be made within a church those are really just decisions
and the government should stick to its business
a decision that protects religious liberty
yeah and catholic has written a book it's about the power of solitude is a self described introvert who likes to go off and his cabinet and right places where he's got no internet access but i'm not sure that your typical introvert makes the best fit with donald trump
this is a dynamic process but the latest thinking is that we're down to three and the judge catholic is not going to be the nominee in this time around okay so that leaves one final candidate we haven't talked about and who is that that same county barrett who became a favorite of social conservatives based partly on our economic writings currently
on her about religious commitments to catholicism
partly because her life stories quite inspirational she has seven children to them adopted from eighty one with special needs saturday will consider the nominations of to circuit court nominees professor amy county barrett to the seventh circuit court and but the moment that really propelled judge barrett into the forefront was that her confirmation
hearing when she was questioned about her writings and stances by sen dianne feinstein when you read your speeches
that conclusion one draws who said to her that dogma lives loudly with you
and
that's of concern the dog my lives loudly within you and that's a concern
and this notion these mean this phrase this headline the slogan the dog were lives loudly within you has been embraced on the right and you see on t shirts and coffee mugs and that his brighton judge barents prospects what may have justified the exchange little more than usual is the judge buried herself as
academic reflected on the role the catholic faith should play in death penalty decisions me is catholic teaching of course is against the death penalty and she wrote that there might be circumstances were catholic church should have to use him or herself from a decision involving the death penalty so that did open the door for that exchange that's it
top but the judge yourself as written to the
and what evidence if any is there that judge barrett is guided judicially or otherwise by her religious faith
i don't know that there's any evidence of that and enter hearing she said let me start by saying that she would apply the law if they freely and without reference to her personal views or her religious views can extend whether they derive from anywhere else on the lot
but she has written a little bit about rove that may be telling she wrote an article a precedent and she classified various kinds of precedent and she listed row is one of those that may be is not as well established as others because it has been the subject of constant criticism since the day was
shoot and she said that like a popular support is some evidence that is a less firmly established precedent
for her to even noodle that question gives you some idea that you might not be
particularly reliable vote to reaffirm bro
that
i want to stay on this subject of roe vs wade because no matter who the president text today conservatives are going to get their reliable fifth vote in a supreme court it seems from everything you've told us it's kind of a dream scenario for conservator
train
so as to what extent is this list
bow roe v wade i don't think it's at the very top of everyone's agenda
i think it's true that once trump places a second just to suddenly supreme court and we have five conservatives they will have the power to overrule row i don't think that's going to happen right away i think there are plenty of ways in which the cord can cut back on abortion rights sustain laws as in red states to make it more
much much harder to get abortions
but the headlines supreme court overrules roe v wade is not something chief justice roberts is really looking to do when you can get a lot of what you want to accomplish accomplished without that i don't mean to minimize this i think we could fairly shortly be living in a world where poor women in red states are going to find it very hard to get abortions well rich women
all over the country will travel to places they can get abortions because abortions not going away in california and new york but it might be going away in mississippi
so i don't what you're raising the prospect of our state laws that may become more permissible to this supreme court
right so think back a couple terms ago we had a case from texas texas imposed restrictions on abortion clinics that would have dropped the number of clinics in the state from forty to ten and made it very hard for a lot of women to get abortions because the nearest clinic would be hundreds of miles away
and the supreme court by a five to three vote ended up striking down those restrictions i think the next supreme court the one with to trump just is on it might well sustain many restrictions like that
and if that's the likely outcome here rather than the overturning roe v wade do you think all four of these nominees they were talking about would support those sorts of rulings that allow states to do that
that's my distinct sense
we spoke adam to send her susan collins last week and she's one of a handful of moderate sanders who are expected to make or break the president's nominee if a nominee had demonstrated hostility toward roe v wade in any fish
capacity
badly cause me great concern with figures like collins in the next why can't we just expect that a couple of these nominees like amy buried for example are too conservative to make it to the senate and therefore
in a sense kind of rule them out as possibilities
i think for sure buried will be the biggest fight the artists lift for the trump administration
there are conservatives to think it's a fight with having he why it would have political benefits to the midterm election it would energize the republican base and he's going to get someone on the court sooner or later even if he loses the first fight the so conservatives might support taking the most polarizing candidate
knowing that it would provoke a big political battle and seeing an upside to that even if they don't actually get that candidate confirmed onto the court or even i'm not saying she wouldn't be confirmed i think she might well be but it would be that feinstein moment read large it would be a culture war battle were
the right is picking a fight
and it will either win or it will feel good about itself and energize it's base in losing and as we have said it's not like the spectrum of choices here is all that meaningful
it's a little humorous to see the right is fighting over these folks because these are matters of the principal really this is who's who's down who's my guy who's your guy and the moment prison and drop names the nominee all conservatives will fall behind them

so adam were just hours from president trump announcing his choice do you have an expectation of who it's going to be and are you willing to share
absolutely realized michael
as a process that has shifted by the hour
and the information we of the weight has gone and all different directions
and i will within a matter of hours more likely not be proven wrong but i still think the best candidate from the point of view of conservatives the one who would make the most lasting impact on the cord and therefore the one the prison and true
in his own best interest this prick ever
adam will talk to him
good
we'll be right back
here's what else you need to know that the times reports that senate majority leader mitch mcconnell has told president trump that judges thomas hardy and women catholic would be the safest choices for senate confirmation
the process that may have to take place without any democratic support mcconnell has worn trump that george brett cavanaugh is extensive paper trail and judge amy berets opposition from abortion rights groups
might allow democrats to slow the process and prevent a justice from being seeded by the start of the next supreme court session in october
and
i look like to comment on sunday sixteen days after a youth soccer team became trapped inside a cave in northern thailand
four of its twelve members were rescued in risky underwater operation involving diverse from multiple countries
the team became stranded after rising rain forest flooded the caves chambers
leaving the boys who cannot swim
with little food or oxygen
divers will try to rescue the remaining eight players and their coach on monday morning

that's it for the day
i'm michael bar
