
from the new york times on michael are
is the day
today
for years republicans have campaigned on gun rights while democrats running for office have avoided the can issue altogether
will this year's midterms finally be about gun control

it's wednesday february twenty
tim walls a gun owner he grew up hunting and spent twenty four years and the army national guard tim walls is a house democrat from southwestern minnesota pretty rural district it he was the classic archetypal the boy
rural democrat
tim was you know growing up putting taught me a lot about responsibility and respect lessons i hope to pass on to my kids ran for congress with pro gun credentials jonathan martin covers national politics for the times got money from norway and an order to a radio from the and so when you're in that district this
a resume that really works pretty well i'm proud to stand with the in our a to protect the rights of sportsmen and gun owners that's why i approve this message tim was he works for us
paid for by walls for congress
now though he's running for governor
i imagine jonathan that this is the kind of candidate that democrats are looking for right now in this moment particularly in red states and purple states he had ah craps who lost the presidency because they fell short and a series of states and industrial metal ass are now looking for a political comeback
of path back to relevance and you've had somebody with military credentials pro gun credentials name sounds like a pretty strong state wide kill it from minnesota which by the way hillary only narrowly carried twenty sixty so that all sounds quite good so why are we talking about this guy today well because
i'm a way to being the ideal candidate running for governor in a purplish stayed till walls has come up against a challenge
one of the credentials that made him so appealing to at least strategist and the democratic party his support for gun rights is now increasingly unacceptable to activist in the democratic party people around us failed and
if they continue to fail us name will no longer be in office because soon we'll be given the abilities clubs and we will vote and outs and the people around us have been out in the wake of the horrible shooting and for though he is facing a real challenges from his laughed as he runs for the democratic nomination for governor
so he quickly has moved to detach himself from any connection to the and our a he posted something of an apology on facebook talk about how his views have changed on guns i will not i've taken no money image gubernatorial campaign i will not break any
i expect that the opposite of what happened in a lot of a money will be used against me he is basically cutting all ties to the in r a and embracing gun control after the shooting because he recognizes that this has created a clear and present danger and his march to the nomination for governor of minnesota it should be expected
that our legislative leaders should follow the will of the people is and if you have a walk in a coffee shop over the last week and fifteen conversations on how this must and you're not getting out and about and i'm here
so why it was just now doing this why would he have ever been campaigning as a gun loving democrat if you would push away democratic voters yeah i think this was the challenge for democrats in the recent past the gun issue was not the motivating force for gun control advocates like
it was for gun rights activists ten and one not well i think that in the universe of the most ardent gun rights activists that was their top issue in they voted the energies a political force in american politics because they have an ability to galvanize their supporters and drive them
the polls in state after state and election after election and democrats even if they or support of of gun laws didn't necessarily show up and vote on the issue in the same way it was not the sort of central for for a lot of democratic voters in general elections could also be jonathan the because it is a motivating factor for
republicans democrats just haven't had any success with can control the republicans have been winning that fight so it's not really an issue or campaigning on or voting on it there's no one is really expecting the democrats to get anything done
great point you make the party had affectively wave the white flag especially in the senate you know it's pretty tough for democrats to retain a senate majority if they are not winning and hold it in a lot of rural states
so what are we seeing taunton from republicans they've so effectively blocked of control for so many years now and mass shootings haven't seem to affect any of that if anything the narrative has been that the mass shootings have strengthened the and right and therefore the gun lobby and made the possibility of don't control seemed even less likely yeah that's right
different now is that the party is facing deep challenges in the mid term's across a lot of suburban house districts
facing challenges and a lot of governor's races and states that have large swath of cities and suburbs you add to that fact a president who is uniquely unpopular in modern american history where he's is popular michael is the issue for the republican he's not unpopular in some of the more rural reaches of the country where
a gun raised or treasured he's deeply unpopular in cities and suburbs in so if you're a republican and you're trying to figure out a way that you can create some distance between yourself and donald trump with suburban voters then you can criticize him but you can also create space on policy issues where is one obvious
policy issue or you can say look i'm a different kind of republican i support commonsense gun restrictions
can you give us an example of a republican dealing with this post parkland batter yes i'm brian best candidate for congress here in eighteen congressional district there are some in florida and near where the shooting happened including brian managed to a combat veteran who lost both of his legs who
is a junior house republican face a potentially difficult reelection i think most people who know me know that the second amendment is something that's very important to me mast was a supporter of gun right and i would encourage our lawmakers who are out there cause for gun confiscation to take a look at some of the horrific events occurring around
the world they all could have been prevented
where there are people president who are prepared to defend themselves the opposed restrictions on guys outlaw almost a lifelong and are remember i know the pride of owning a weapon of collecting of going out there and hunting shooting with family doing claes going out there and putting rounds and to steal my kids i
do it all the time but we got to look at keeping our community safe and protecting our children are protecting our schools after this massacre though he has had a sort of change of heart my community my country is not safer with this unfettered access of anybody that's eighteen years or older having access to this platform and is now calling for it not
expanded background checks are raising the age of those weapons he actually is calling for the banning of song automatic sales that pretty significant from a republican seeking office it sure is and especially somebody who seek the office in a state where most the republicans are pretty soon
supportive of gun rights you don't see a lot of florida republicans deviating from the and line
and in who is mast facing pressure from well the pressure masters facing is from his constituents because he is looking at a potentially competitive reelection this fall and had a district that straddles the atlantic coast in florida and this is middle class upper middle class floridians a lot of them who have moved to this day
stroke from parts of the northeast they just don't support the gun rights orthodoxy did folks in more rural districts in other parts of the south do so the kind of suburban district you are talking about where there's some skepticism about the president and can control might be the sort of thing that would when voters over
that's exactly right so this the district where the president's numbers were already on stan eat because of the demographics there and if you're somebody like brian massed you don't want this gun issued to be the final brick him the wall that walls you off if you will from those voters who are trump skeptics
so is the take away of what's happening to walls and mast a democrat and republican who are now both walking back their positions on gun rights is the take away that the whole country is now leaning toward gun control
no that's not necessarily or what's happening i do think that it's clear bet if you take any suburb or city across this country i think you're going to see an increasing openness if not it to me infraction on guns and i think that that's the same whether that's broward county florida
seattle what have you what has also certain is that if you're a democrat running in a democratic primary now for state wide office it doesn't matter anymore what state you're looking to represent party activists are going to demand that you support gun control
it's not gonna be a sweeping nation wide phenomenon gonna be a phenomenon happens and politically crucial regions
so let's talk about how this might actually play out in the elections returning to walls the n r a supporting democrat walking that support for the enter a back how our voters in minnesota responding to him doing that
well so far he was for seen as the likely nominee for democrats going into their primary and he is now under fire
rebecca auto who finished second to walls in this month's caucuses blasted walls new stand some his rivals for the nomination are swiftly tried to use against him say to a little too late to little too late
i've been meeting unless he's following the reason he's changing his mind is for rock political reasons he took money from entering in two thousand and eight ten twelve fourteen sixteen you also anger your old allies a long gun right support me so walls is now catching heat from the supporters of gun rights to see a one time out
i abandoning them and they're obviously not going to forget that so i was offered a really interesting test for just how damaging past ties even tighter that a recanted to the and are a could be in a dominating process
so if was is any indication and turning against guns upsets those trump leaning moderates and republicans he was hoping to appeal to doesn't have this sort of and democratic candidates like walls who were building their campaigns are around appealing to more moderate and republican voters yeah i think this is the risk is that
by moving the left done guns to fend off challenge his in his democratic primary for governor has walls and turn created new difficulties in the general election by sharing his tires to the and are a and losing what had been a political asset that he had among room
voters the ability to say i'm a democrat but i'm a different kind of democrat on the kind of democrat that you can support for governor and what about for these republican candidates like masked what's the risk for the them of walking back their support for gun rights well they don't want to necessarily rule out additional gun control because they think maybe this time
his dear friend perhaps this is the moment where we are forced to act on this issue with the more sweeping away but at the same time they're also loath to embrace gun controls because they don't want to be on the wrong side of the an array if a week from now like we have in the past we've kind of moved onto the next big story and it's not nice
sarah a clear michael you gained as many or more political allies by doing this because the people that maybe most appreciate the fact that you've moved on the issue and him ryan mass still might vote against you
send a message gets drop right or they may not believe that transformation is sincere genuine exactly
it feels like whether it's walls or last a democrat or republican candidates were talking about are now calculating that that's something meaningful has changed in the politics of the gun debate and they're betting that advocates of gun control are now as animated and likely to vote as a
rock as gun rights violators have been in the past is that the thinking he had that's the big take away from this is is this finally the big one is yes
the gun violence moment the has be calibrated the politics of this issue so that there's going to be something close to parody when it comes to people who vote on the guns voting because they support gun control rather than voting on guns because they support key lives the post on control right because the question your your
asking and candidates are asking his his gun control finally an issue that voters will vote on rather than just gun rights yes that's the issue we didn't have we now gotten to the moment where it is it is as safe or perhaps even safer in some parts of the country to run calling for
gun control because you know that people are going to show up and vote on the issue of gun control is that now the sea for political that then we in the past which is assuming that only the advocates of guns are going to be the ones that show up and vote on the issue when was the last time that we were in this position
we're out there
lurking in the darkness thinking unpalatable twisted thought is the next year buddy
preparing to slaughter of innocent on armed men women and children
and when that day counts as tragically and surely it must
the nation will turn to ask that gun owners and say you are the cop was on this and that is what we must work to counter the last time that guns was a major issue in an election was nineteen ninety four democratic politician said at one time you're done
allow themselves to be corrupted either clinton administration when president clinton had signed the assault weapons ban as part of the cry and will have a lot of democrats especially rural parts of the country lost their seats not a single republican incumbent lost a race for the house senate or governorship in tuesday's mid term elections
the election results of course give control of congress to the republican for the first time and sub forty years
now they didn't lose their seats entirely because of the guys that there was a larger discontent with clinton in the democratic party driving that but certainly and somehow seated it was one of the major issues so in our case the lesson for democrats will is not to pushed on control now have the opposite less seems to be happening for republicans
yeah in the mirror image parts of the country by the way to been a lot of the democrats who lost and ninety four especially in the house where from more rural districts and how the republicans who fear a similar political backlash on guns are the ones running in suburban parts of the country
so this is a test essentially of were moderate america really stands on guns
it's a test of how willing a moderate americans who are unquestionably in the ranks of gun control supporters how will they are to vote their passion on guns are those centrist voters finally going to show up in the in the polling place and know make guns one of their
top items that's really the question
thank you very much
thanks mikey
we'll be right back

here's what else you need to know your chief of staff general kelly has recommended ending the purpose of granting interim security clearances to members of the trapped in se asia
if that precedes what you be willing to grant a waiver to jared kushner when a senior advisers
what an outstanding job i think he's been treated very unfairly is a high quality person the president's son of jared kushner has been stripped of his high level security clearance limiting his ability to view highly classified information so that will be up to general kelly a general kelly respects shared a lot
general kelly will make that call i won't make that call i will let the general who is right here
make that call like many top white house officials kushner had been operating on an interim security highlights for months because of delays in completing his f b i a background check
kelly has begun to evoking those clearances after another white house aide who was relying on to rob portman resigned over allegations of domestic abuse
officials have not said what has held up cautionary background check
the f b i closely scrutinized contact with foreign officials and questioners meetings with russian officials have been of interest to special counsel robert mother in his investigation
the interim security clearance had allowed questioner to see the presidential day in the brief the top secret summary of intelligence given to the president every morning
and the u n reports that north korea has been secretly shipping supplies to syria that could be used in the production of chemical weapons
the report comes as the us has repeatedly accuse syria of using chemical weapons on civilians including in a recent attack in a suburb of damascus that killed dozens of people their deaths
was an affront to humanity
these hate his actions by the assad regime
can that be tolerated
un experts warned that the relationship would facilitate both countries in violating international laws helping syria maintain its chemical weapons supply while payments for those supplies would help north korea fund its nuclear missile

that's it
i'm like a small
