
this is margaret and i was the first person standing in line waiting to watch the npr politics pod guest this seems to bro i can only imagine things may have changed by the time you hear this this pod cast was recorded at
hey that's eight fifteen on june first okay here's the sham
hey there it's the npr politics pod cast live from charlotte i'm scott tetra cover congress moralize than national political correspondent dramatic months in our political editor and i must my solid political report
and we are here in charlotte at the mcglone theater spirit square in front of a live audience everybody say hello
we are partnering with w f a e for our latest live show and a huge thanks to them and for their support
morrow we had promised you walk on music beforehand it didn't happen but i feel like there was still pretty good at my work on music is going to be bad to the
so what does them through just say didn't enter another show so like i said we're going to talk a lot about the midterms is the big picture conversation we are now seeing the field fill out we're seeing week after week primaries happened we know who the actual candidates are so dominica when we're looking
when we're sitting there in the newsroom thinking through okay what are the races we need to focus on what's like the center of the balls i have where this race is going to be fodder
well i've said before but i i think the road to the majority runs through bony fish girls you know i mean it's it's it's you know and where do you were cheesecake factory is moot she's sat around yeah i mean you don't find these places in like cool hip cities right i mean they're on the outskirts of know that a sprawl right i mean
lake where where urban sprawl exists and where the people who live in those suburbs kind of wish they were going out for dinner in the city but they're going about fish grill that's
next
comcast spent grill
non speaking from personal experience here you were love it there were going to go at it but
you know six o'clock with the kids it's not a bad time
but the fact the matter is the suburbs are really really important i mean there's a lot of these places where hillary clinton did very well mean she won some two dozen districts
in places where republicans are in those seats currently and those are the prime targets and democrats need to net twenty three seats to win back the house they need to be able to win in those places that hillary clinton won an awesome a key voter in those districts is the type of of voter that you spent a while
the time talking to and we kind of shorthand them like the lukewarm republicans you know the these are districts
that that vote for republicans most years but they they voted for hillary clinton for president and sent a republican in toronto yo john casey yeah so so the question is how are they feeling or that they are they still decide it's i mean it's one thing to not like the president of the party that you belong to and it's another thing
going to go ahead and vote for the other party especially in our tribal world apart
i can tell you this sort of synopsis that i heard from cobb county which is a suburb area around atlanta and hillary clinton did when cobb county and then i'd be curious to hear from you real quick also a sky in a huge gains in those places as well so my quick take is that i do not hear any sense of buyers remorse and then these republicans i make
a make said i would say some of these folks did vote for the president somewhat reluctantly some of them got on board with him fully and a couple of them did not vote for the president at all but when you talk to them about their local races they are energized and excited because they see those people i mean these are your establishment republicans in this case at least
the protagonists but specifically about cobb county it's a really energized republican party you go to the g o p breakfast
get a good one hundred plus people there in a saturday morning so i have not seen as ends at least in this particular county ancients a where people felt and any sense that they were shifting away and moving towards the democratic party so the flip side which we didn't fully plan out but but we have is that i mean i feel like i've gotten a lot of different evidence from from
from scratch i've talked to from the democratic campaigns i've talked to in that in that they don't necessarily feel like they need the john casey marco rubio republican voter to vote for them they just need enough of them to not bother voting because you know american presidential election turnout is is still like that
low compared to a lot of other western countries but the gap between the presidential turn out and the midterm turnout is so much that it's just a question of who's energized who is actually taking the time to vote and on all counts on state house special elections on on all the house special elections we've seen there is a clear trend line of democrats being more
enthusiastic showing up knocking on doors and a lot of those democrats not only sat on the last for midterms but many of them sat out two thousand and sixteen in states that were decided by a narrow margin like north carolina well you know the curse of the democratic party is for some reason they can only get their voters out every four years and instead of every to the republican
the show up every election but less scott said in the special elections and the races we've seen so far they seem to be exercising that curse and other words democrats are turning out republicans are turning out to it's just the democrats are turning out more and they're over performing their past turn out performances
from past mid midterms and that's it the democrats are counting on because what you look at you are one thing about presidential approval i just wanted a dad when you look at the numbers of people who strongly disapprove of trump versus the people who strongly approve of trump the strong disapprove is about twice as much that's a sign of democratic enthusiasm and there's one very specific reason for this it's women i mean
democratic women in when people talk about the year of the woman it's the year of the democratic woman perhaps and
we've seen so far in these primaries democratic women have won a good number of these seats i mean some forty percent of the of the primaries have been won by women that's unprecedented and it doesn't have it's not happening on the republican side and you are seeing
record number of women running for the house they believe there's over three hundred women who are running for seats in the house and that is still a very small number compared to the number of men that running from their seats but it's an uptake any to your point even ago i will wholeheartedly agree that we seen a lot of energy as specifically among women i think the one sort of current
treasury and point i guess i have is you need to echo bit of what you are saying is that democratic voters historically they don't turn out in these elections and so even if you look at again historical voting patterns or eight me they just haven't shown up and if you wanna guess who's and on voter they're more likely to be hispanic they're more likely to be african american and if you want to guess who is a habitual
oh and they tend to be a suburban college educated white person but in a lot of wild cards this year for instance the parkland school shooting yes there is now a huge moved to register high school students they are the least likely to show up newly minted eighteen year old voters but we're seeing registration among those
that age group going up will they show up in november will find that out and today we got more metric suggesting an increasingly strengthening economy we have the lowest unemployment rate since two thousand we have two hundred twenty three thousand new jobs
if the economy is turned around in the way by all indications that looks like it's doing doesn't that pretend a good year for the party in power why are republicans looking at big losses if things are going so well i mean i would make the argument that it's twofold so one is i actually sticking with that republican pollster recently who made the argument
yes the economy looks good so you have three point eight percent unemployment which really is somewhat unprecedented in modern history that's only been the case i think prior to two thousand you'd have to go back to the nineteen sixties but we'd had extreme wage stagnation so you talk to people and often they're feeling like they're one or two months away from a disaster and i would argue
you that many folks say that just sort of it regardless of where they're at and the income ladder and so that's one point is that people have not felt those gains in part because of wage stagnation the other thing though to me as really fascinating that is that as much as the economy is doing well and that sort of translates perhaps in a presidential year you don't actually
see that translating and midterm years it's less of a fact it's very much less than a factor i was speaking with a professor of down at emory university in atlanta his name is alan abramowitz and he basically looked at every election cycle blake going back to world war two and he charted a few different measures to see how like what was a good predictor
who would win which party with when the mean terms and he said that the economy was actually not very helpful as a predictor at all they were other things like the generic ballot which which breaks blaine rails ghana which party do you prefer to control congress generically i don't for the generic democrat and a generic republic yeah and some he said that's actually a much
more helpful factor to see which party will likely win more seats in the house and then the other factor he mentioned his the approval rating be hesitant and then that's a big question donald trump's usually a president's approval rating tracks with the economy the economy's really doing well why isn't donald trump's approval rating higher it's historically low so two theories
one is he is benefiting from the economy without this great economy his approval rating would be in the thirties or or because he has so because he's such a unique figure
he just is divorced from the normal rules of political gravity yeah i mean president has is clearly benefiting from some of the peace and prosperity that were time out i mean back in december his approval rating was averaging about thirty seven percent in the real clear politics average and now it's run forty two percent or so so the
the presidential approval rating at forty two percent is a terrible approval rating historically for how presidents wind up doing in mid term's the thing that you have to realize with this is that presidential approval ratings when they're lower generally they lose more seats their their party loses more
seats in mid term's bill clinton for example when his approval rating up better
over sixty percent democrats did fairly well while controlling congress when you look at george w bush however in his approval rating was at thirty nine percent in two thousand and six republicans wound up losing the house to democrats you look at barack obama his approval rating when it was at forty five percent
democrats wind up losing sixty three seats in two thousand and ten now does that mean that president trump who's approval rating is forty two percent is going to lose more seats or as many seats as democrats did in in two thousand and ten probably not because of some of the structural advantages that republicans have i think
how some of these districts were redrawn in two thousand and eleven
strong economy the fact that democrats are clustered in cities and it's pretty easy to drug districts around those democrats because of that but you know at the same time there is no real aberration away from the idea that if you have a pretty low approval rating your
gonna lose seats and even as president trump has ticked up and that's something we've talked about a lot when it when when it comes down to it it's still way lower than almost any other president at this point in their pregnancy and i think something a young age and one thing about the economy because you mention that so the year that alan and brando it's that
richard emery singled out for me it's kind of the historical parallel he said with nineteen sixty six he had president johnson in affairs sure the president was enormously unpopular and the vietnam war was going on beneath said the economy was actually doing quite well and he did not have is you can see actually the president's party did not do very well that year what we're doing is we're looking at all
all of these indicators that have suggested the size of a incumbent parties losses when you have the white house and both houses of congress and your president is below forty five percent generally that adds up to you're gonna lose big are they gonna lose the twenty three seats that democrats would need in the house to take control
unclear so so so there's all sorts of indicators that we look at and we are not quite sure which one is going to be the operative one so we could talk about this for a while i guess we talk about it like three times a week for the of a year or so
but we have only talked about half of the congressional elections there's the whole set it to talk about as well we're going to shift gears and talk about the senate is not good for democrats
it's bad for them because of the numbers flat out and the geography so you know there are twenty six democrats that are defending seats this year only nine republicans overall and when you look at the burial ground where the state where the states are being fought a lot of them are in places that trump want twenty points or more in them
case in some laser deep red states that mara it's not like this map is bad for democrats because democrats did anything wrong in fact it's the opposite right they happen to win elections in a few states that were surprising for them to win and six years ago when all of these guys were elected those were the years when the tea party was running amok in the
republican primaries and mitch mcconnell haven't yet quite figured out how to bring them to heal so you had a lot of people like christine know daniel you know i am not a witch remember her you know people who were two extremes they would win the primary but they were too extreme to win a general election so you got a lot of democrats and states like indiana and missouri places where democrats taped theory
medically shouldn't win but now that he believes that between the last three election cycles that they lost probably five republican senate see as their husband to get him back based on this really good map but i will say this when i talk to democrats there when i say what's the definition of success in the senate this year they say
just holding our own and other words if they could get the status quo fifty one republicans forty nine democrats after november they would consider that beyond their wildest dreams they take up some lose some but if they end up net net the same they'll be thrilled asthma one thing i learned sitting next to you is that there are no india and they're they're losers
because you are one
so i mean explain to us how much of anomaly a was for a democrat to be representing indiana to begin with and in what the challenges
a democrat like joe donnelly in some of these other you know that around testers of the world face in this climate i mean i think that indiana will be one of those races where i would say it would be extremely hard pressed for joe don way or any democrat to win election against against when mara talks about maintaining the status quo you could also make the case that that would mean picky
up a senate seat somewhere else and forfeiting are losing somebody states that they already hold like indiana so just to give me a bit of perspective indiana as a state that in two thousand and sixteen donald trump one every single county in this state but for that has a lot of counties and historically has always been
in that way there had been democratic senators in the past but it just shows you that sort of overall tilt that you've had in many midwestern states i would argue towards the republican party we saw something i think i kinda that you know beginning in ohio ohio i think the senator their shared brown is quite popular he's a democrat and monaco at the same time republicans
our feeling more defensive than usual in a few of these states i mean president trump went to tennessee this week to campaign because a whole mix of factors had to democrats to feel like even with this uphill climb they might be able to snag a surprise seat and tennessee especially you know six months after they won a senate seat in alabama
and they have a fairly popular person running in that see do cuts sort of moderate
you know
no image which is a nother discussion and internal fight that democrats are having among themselves should you put forward the kinds of candidates who you know or rather manual who ran the house committee to help elect those democrats in two thousand and six believe that you need to put forward these more modern more centrist democrats to
when in places where there are more republicans are more independence and is the party comfortable with that because the energy right now would you look at all the polling is on the most left part of the spectrum for the most part the answer to that question is there pragmatic so far on it they want to find democrats want
candidates that fit their districts and it does it means if you're in california maybe you do on someone from the left but if you're in the heartland
you want somebody who can reflect the district or the state and for the most part if you look at virginia raf northam john's in alabama which was stunning upset connor lamb and the eighteenth district of pennsylvania certainly feel bread us and in tennessee they are all candidates who fit their status or die
districts i'm glad everybody came out tonight and i'm glad that everybody listens to the pod cast on a regular basis but mara i'm or one earnings as away but mara i'm wondering what is the value of all this conversation on june first when it comes down to it like how much how much can change between now and the election and how worthless is a lot of this analysis at this
his point given now where husband are given that there is incredibly high value
first of all you know i call it highly in this way when doesn't lock when does i start to lock in we learned not really why do you like what people believe is that the generic ballot which people are fixated on as a barometer of your normal
i'm not fixated on now but i'm going to be fixated on it after labor day oh so that's when you guys should turn into raving political junkies on the generic valid but there's all sorts of other things to watch for you know what's the economy going to look like this summer you know well that will the wildcard or that of a trade war take it's toll will there be other external events
like a hurricane or more shootings
so there are a lot of things to watch for but i think that we know what the landscape is we know what history tells us and we're watching and candidates matter and who are watching a lot of these individual races and asthma one one trend that we keep seeing every tuesday is that despite the fact that the national headlines
moved on from it after after the latest repeal effort failed week after week voters are going and google in healthcare and they're telling pollsters healthcare is their top issue and democrats feel really good about that which is such a contrast from when these guys were all running six years ago and they were running away from obama care because a lot of voters didn't like it now democrats say
we would love to talk about obama care over and over again and talk about health care and general because you know what that's our new republicans he had that that's the argument that they're making and i do think it is a somewhat complicated argument for voters to always say healthcare equals democrats like i think that some at the democratic operatives will say but then he sort of push them and get us
cent of all how are you coming to that conclusion and they believe that because republicans did try to repeal the affordable care act and portions of it actually were repealed
correct that they feel that they can now associate your rising premiums with the republican party but to your points got in is amazing week after week if you look at google trends every single primary we have seen healthcare medicare medicaid is at the top of the list about everything and two issues that
shout from each side one is health care of the others tax cuts republican still haven't quite figured out how to message on tax cuts it's still sort of an issue when you look at the polls good idea bad idea do i feel it too i'd not
significant a substantive chunk of voters have the taxes actually go up it's complicated there's the argument that even if you get a tax cuts somebody else got a much bigger tax gotten a corporation got a much bigger tax god yeah
and health care i mean you guys are right about the google trends it's also shows up in polling right i mean one of the polls that we did we looked at just like what are your top issues i was stunned to see that health care was far away you know more than double what everybody else talked about for something that needs to be dealt
with immediately right
it surpassed everything else in this was the single biggest failure of the republican congress that they couldn't repeal it and replace it with something better as donald trump promised wait till october when everybody gets their letters thing why their premiums are going to go up against that is the democratic argument that that's going to happen and now you do wonder though how much of the election
one is sort of locked in and big did by that point but
talk about in october surprise
i remember being on the campaign trail with with donald trump in october right when right when those premiums went up and he was talking about that way more than he was talking about the f b i and the in the crowds were responding
last thing on all of this built the house and the senate what's one big thing that each of you is looking for thinking about paying attention to to to give you a sense of which way the big picture is going here yeah
so i am very interested in every primary looking at the rock turnout numbers and it is not like an apples to apples argument by one real quick example whereas in the primary in georgia very recently so there's been a lot of talk about can a democratic governor when in georgia what we saw in the primary
that actually they were more republicans who came out to oh but not by huge margins i think there was about like fifty thousand more republicans and democrats in two thousand and fourteen there were about two hundred thousand more republicans who actually voted then the democrat for governor so many out long story short i think the numbers were seeing in primaries is a good
clue to possibly the way we'll see things turn out in november
yeah i'm watching for what the republicans finally settle on as a message now or in this primary season so you're hearing a lot about immigration because that's the kind of message that works with the republican base you hear donald trump talking about it all the time and his rallies is that going to be that kind of thing that republicans will think will energize their base in a general
election or will they go back to trying to sell the tax cuts which they've had a hard time doing thing is that we talk about president trumps numbers ticking up because of peace and prosperity
i think that those are the two things that are going to be the hinge for him that hold him in place where he is or the bottom falls out
do does the economy start to start to changed is that reverse position doesn't employment take up and how to independence respond to what happens over the next several months whether it's the president's unpredictability or economic measures and stability and they've who do they want
trusting more right while the show is almost done but before we do the final credits a very important piece of business i forgot before shout out to sandy schuster enrich dutch you're rich happy birthday to you from kelsey she said as an email a couple weeks ago asking us to issue you happy birthday happy birthday
