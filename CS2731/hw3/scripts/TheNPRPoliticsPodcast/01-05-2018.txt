commendation for him
the puck asked for you to check out namely how i built this every week i talked to the people behind him of the most inspiring companies and brands in the world with stories of incredible persistence grit and insight you can find how i built this on the npr one app or wherever you get your per guest hi this is a recording from
the capital and drink from kentucky where in today's the first day of the general assembly here in the commonwealth this pod cast was recorded at two o'clock pm on january fourth twenty eighty things may have changed by the time you hear this keep up with of npr his political coverage p r dot org the npr one app
or on your local public radio station alright enjoyed the show
hey there it's the npr politics broadcast year with our weekly roundup of political news president trumps lawyer has since cease and desist letters just the banning and the author and publisher of a forthcoming book fire and theory inside the trump white house prompt in an official white house statement
he said that when fan and lost his job he lost his mind
also with utah sen orrin hatch retiring all eyes are on mitt romney who has already changed his location on twitter from massachusetts to utah
the president's controversial election integrity commission is no more dissolved i'm to hammer keys i cover the white house for npr i'm scott that heroic of congress i'm healthy now i also cover congress and i'm more elias a national political correspondent guess so it is the fourth in it feels like it should be february already this has been
some of them
lot going on
you know there's like yesterday i woke up but i thought this day is going to be it about north korea oh it was not designed more and
end up by evening it's like a them thing there's a lot of meditation books out lately you just have to be calm and present and see which way the news waves going to take cuba and the news wave took us to one steve ban and and one president donald trump and a feud i guess is what has happened
this book from michael wolff called fire in theory isn't even out yet but excerpts came out and then the president released this
very unusual for paragraph statement really just going after steve ban and who was quoted heavily in those excerpts scott tetro you have read every single drop of this way i have read all the things where would you like to start do you want to start with the trump statement do you want to start with what steve band and said do you want to
start with the overall theme of the book length of many directions okay so yeah this is a book by michael wall from was a long time new york media calmness and author and had read a lot of stories about the trump campaign the trump administration early on he is someone who wrote a story in the week or so after the
the election
which is an interesting thing to think about in retrospect receive them and said i view myself as the thomas cromwell of the trump administration
a story arc that kind of fits
oh he was beheaded wasn't he was beheaded yes so so far being blasted by the president is better than being beheaded but both of them at one point were very influential in their realms and this book was seems to be written from the couch in steve bands office because michael walk out on have access to the white house which the white house
has admitted yeah i spent a lot of time there and the result is a book with really eye popping on the record quotes from tons of trump administration staffers not receive ban and katie wall she was number two to rights previous is quoted saying very cutting things about the president many other people as well and will get to
the ban and quotes in a minute but the overarching themes that this book is laying out at least the excerpts that we've seen so far
do fall in line with a lot of other reporting we've seen over the past year and that is that president trump is disengaged from the details of the policy in the white house that he spends a lot of time watching cable news and raging about it and that a lot of his staff can be very critical of him and then times dis respect him i mean
i had reports months ago of of secretary of state rex terrorists in calling trump a blanking moron allegedly and there are many quotes in similar veins throughout this book one of the other things about this is steep ban and this is not the first time steve bannon has been in the media saying critical things some trump and trumps
anger about him and what he's been saying has really been building up remember first he went on sixty minutes to say that firing me was the dumbest political decision and history then he went in vanity fair where i think among other things he said the president wouldn't last his term now he
is in this book saying the president's and narcissus his daughters dumb as a brick and his son took a meeting with russians that he considered treason us and are we getting out of prison is before we get to the bigger picture bannon thing i do think we should say that one other carrier to say when it comes to this book and the stuff in it is that there has been a lot of push back from people quoted in this book
from people in the white house saying a lot of his reporting is just wrong and people have been pointing to the fact that wolf has a reputation as a very lively writer but has he been admitted in some past a profiles that have been dug up that that sometimes the details are not his strong suit but like i said before a lot of the big picture things mere other reports we've seen over
the last year and steve bannon has not been one of the people denying that on some of the push back i'm hearing from people on the hill is that this is part of their overall complain about off the record or background sourcing is that it makes it easier to make claims without having somebody to
go back to you too can corroborate it and know this is a big part of the way a lot of reporting it's done in washington but it is definitely something that is is becoming more and more an issue of debate in this era when a lot of things get background information and gets challenges fake news the crazy thing here is he has full on the ditto
failed conversations sped he is chronicling with quotes quoting people having these conversations so dance what bob woodward does but michael wolff does have the reputation of writing really juicy books not all of his anecdotes can be supported yeah i guess what we're saying it had a little bit of a reputation going in that
different from like from bob were not bob woodward yeah let's let's call it a big grain of salt all right so let's walk through some of the high profile ban and quotes and maybe i'll get bleep tear it could be could be an exciting my on chest yeah so the first thing that got a lot of the attention or comments that first reported in the guardian back
in talking about that infamous june two thousand and sixteen trump tower meeting between donald trump junior paul and jared kushner and this russian intermediary who'd come they're promising damaging information about hillary clinton this is the if you say what it is i love it meeting much discussed on the part guess so here's what them and has to say even if you thought this was not treason as or
unpatriotic or bad
and i happen to think it's all of that you should have called the f b i immediately then he says the chance that don junior did not walk these demos up to his father's office on the twenty sixth floor is zero wait what does a geo it's like a schmuck
well i talk to somebody had great barton said that that to ben and uses this word a lot and it was a typo it's meant to be gym oak all that land text to me and i'm like well i think it's like jamaica that's what yeah so much more is a height so it's something that apparently according to this person or bright but she bent on says a lot so it's like a jumbo
fuck which i think is how you said like
i get like a character yeah okay i anyone to solve so basically he's saying i think the don junior took these guys up to me trump which he's not saying factually huge just saying seems to me that would make sense and that would blow a big hole in how trump world has framed this meeting all long saying president drug knew nothing about it why has continued
to say president trump knew nothing about it yeah and couple other key quotes talking about the muller investigation they're going to crack down junior like an egg on national t v and he also says he realized where this is going this is all about money laundering mahler chose in your prosecutor andrew weisman first and he's a money laundering guy the path to trump there was a self it at their go
goes right through parliament for don junior and jared kushner it's as plain as the hair on your face of those were the first round of key quote that went into the cable news ecosystem and led to that trump response yes which i would like to read just a bit of because it is it his unorthodox you know there have been in the context of what we're used to see
rate even in the context of president trumps twitter feed and even in the context of other white house's who have hated books about their internal workings because every white house gets a book like this they're not like this and every white house hate those books generally okay official statement from the president of the united states
steve ban and has nothing to do with me or my presidency when he was fired he not only lost his job he lost his mind steve was a staffer who worked for me after i had already won the nomination by defeating seventeen candidates often described as the most talented field ever assembled in the republican party now that he's on his own steve is
learning that winning isn't as easy as i make it look steve had very little to do with our historic victory which was delivered by the forgotten men and women of this country
steve had everything to do with the laws of a senate seat in alabama held for more than thirty years by republicans and later claimed that leaking to the media is the only thing that steve ban and does well i have a question about another part of what he said here is so those and also says that steve was really in a one on one meeting with me and my question
not that as i understand from other reporting is that there weren't a whole lot of one on one meetings with trunk to begin with that people didn't want any one other person to be left alone with him unless they have a better source
towards the president's ear is that right is it is that kind of a yes
this direction here yes i think this is this goes under the he doth protest too much category that thing that i the really left out at me in the statement first of all it's length is extraordinary that's what i'm saying he doth protest too much it's way longer than anyone would need to totally crushed like a bug a former
advisor if that's what you wanted to do but at the end he says you know many members of congress and candidates and people are supportive of my make america great again agenda he says they're helping to finally take our country back and build it up rather than simply seeking to burn it all down and when i read that i thought whoa michael wolff and steve ban and have thrown down
trump into the arms of mitch mcconnell because that is that sounded like mitch mcconnell you know his argument against the ban and and of course shortly after that i notice that the mitch mcconnell folks had sent out a not only a email with this statement but also a picture of mitch mcconnell smiling yes and he was a cat that ate the can enter it was a much shared give oh yeah
behind a desk grinning so this is all been son more palace intrigue of the trump white house it's like you know sport but what does this mean big picture what does this mean for their relationship with congress what does this mean for two thousand and eighteen are their political implications of this divorce that may or may not stick with steve
bam and well i think it means that steve van and stock as the leader of the insurrection against the establishment in congress otherwise known as mitch mcconnell has just taken a huge hit kelly ward who was one of his and surgeon candidates who was running in arizona for the scene being vacated by jeff flake
distance herself from steve bannon this is a huge victory for mitch mcconnell the president is allying himself with the establishment nod with the nationalist populist insurrection the steve ban and said that he was going to run all over the country it was going to find people to challenge senate incumbency was going to the criteria he was going to use where people who were not willing
to vote for mitch mcconnell as majority leader but not only did the president just kneecap him or as charlie sykes of conservative commentator said he ran over him on the south lawn and put the car in neutral and ran over him again but he also seems to have lost one of his biggest financial backers rebecca mercer and mitch mcconnell couldn't be happier
he was at his press conferences weekly press conference today he said i'd like to associate myself with what the president had to say about steve ban and mm just want to say when we were describing met earlier i don't think we fall into the just so i would encourage you if you're listening to look it up it was on mitch mcconnell official campaign twitter account which i think his team underscore mich
yes that is his campaign version he has a separate one for his governing what do they believe at majority leader which probably doesn't send as many gifts know can i go back to the the fact checking of how influential than and was when president tromp was driving from location to location during the campaign i would be there who got out of the car after president from steve bannon
when president tramples boarding airforce wander in the first few months of his administration who was walking right behind him steve man and well he does the chairman of the campaign and he was the karl rove and david axelrod of the white house example is the role he played so there's a little bit of reinterpreting history here if he was never that important because that's not true and and was given a position on the national security council
i don't think that that has ever been given to a political advisor before and i'll briefly i mean he was removed but there was one of the many things that happened in two thousand and seventeen that had already like left my mind until your might have been so another reminder of twenty seventeen that we're seeing play out yet again is the trump administration and the president himself doing things and saying things on twitter or information leaking out and then
getting back up here to capitol hill and every single republican saying i don't know what you're talking about or i haven't seen that or i'm just going to shut my mouth and run into an elevator that is the trend of two thousand and seventeen that is not going away in two thousand eighty which is incredible because twenty eight team was supposed to be the golden age for republicans they just had the
incredible victory the dow is a twenty five thousand the economy was doing great and all of a sudden donald trump has made sure to start twenty eight thousand and we've only had a very few days with this huge fight with steve bannon and a bunch of pushing the envelope tweets even for donald trump
so let's get to one of those pushing the envelope tweets this tweet came on the evening of january second it came and then only twenty minutes later he treated about the fake news awards that he was going to do so it was just one of a stream of tweets that seemed to have been in response to something he had seen on fox news there was a segment about this
thing that kim jong own head said about having a nuclear button on his desk so present and trump says i see your nuclear button and hear his tweet north korean leader kim jong un just stated that the nuclear button is on his desk at all times will someone from his depleted and food starved rouge
jean please inform him that i too have a nuclear button but it is much bigger and more powerful than his and my button works exclamation point show that tweet came out and it caused there were a lot of people who were actively worried well because he's talking about nuclear war so like i am
understand where the worry would come from i mean there's been as as were in year three year for depending on when you want started of a world of donald trump tweets oh he just says do on twitter oh you should take it lightly but i mean this as a country with that we have no diplomatic relationship with that we don't know much
about and they don't know much about us and there's very little to go on so when you have the president the united states making comments and jokes about nuclear war nuclear weapons
i think you have a right to be worried the people who know a lot about this are really nervous not only is north korea the number one foreign policy problem on donald trump's plate as this new year starts but as scott just said this is the kind of situation where miscalculations can lead and misunderstandings and miss interpretations can lead to
disaster
what's really interesting
to me is that yes he's threatened fire in theory before for north korea he's flirted with this idea that the north only understands one thing you should talk to them but real things are happening with north korea for instance south korea has decided to take him drunk own up on his offer to talk to them
south korea is nervous about donald trump's bellicose language because in the event of a nuclear war planned or unplanned hundreds of thousands of south koreans would be the first casualties yes there are also thousands of american troops on the peninsula but they would bear the brunt of it and what's really interesting is after prime minister
moon took up the north on their offer of talks donald trump treated again and he said with all of the failed experts weighing in does anyone really believe the talks and dialogue would be going on between north and south korea right now if i wasn't from strong and willing to commit our total night against the north fools but talks are a good thing the south
is pursuing a different strategy than donald trump but he's taking credit for it anyway this also makes me think about the pure politics of this a little bit there are a number of people who have had discomfort with a the way the president makes comments like my button is bigger than your button or the little hands conversation have
particularly evangelical voters don't like that about him they also don't like the big blustery bellicose way of talking about nuclear war and about things that are of grave important and this may come back to the president later on when these people who voted for him on the idea that he was going to be
be a non interventionist and who would toned down when he became president
possibility that this please into the broader rhetoric that has been alienating them one thing that happened today is that president trump spoke with president moon of south korea and they talked about the olympics which you're coming up very soon in south korea and president trump said that they're going to send a high level delegation but the thing that's really notable hear that comes
at the end of the statement from the white house about it is that the two leaders agreed to deep conflict the olympics and our military exercises so that united states and republic of korea forces can focus on ensuring security of the games said they had some exercises planned as i to have regular exercisers that
kim jong un hates and wants to step yes and they have just agreed to employees at least temporarily not do those exercises so that is that is actually a you know a diplomatic decompression so you have the bellicose rhetoric but the actual strategy is being conducted by south korea
you are we're going to take a quick break right now and when we come back long time utah sen orrin hatch is retiring and now all eyes are on a sometimes trump nemesis mitt romney
support for him your politics and and the following message come from super a new year has begun and if you're setting goals for your business you need the right people on your team zebra who has transformed how you find them zipper recruiter poster jobs to over one hundred jobs sides with just one click then

i'm stacey antics now i'm part of garcia and we are here with a new shell the indicator for planet money on every show we take some number in the news and we dive into it kind of vague idea of get it on npr one or wherever you go on yes
all right we're back and long time youtube republican senator orrin hatch announced this week that he is retiring there have been a bunch of other retirements announced this week to over on the how side and hatches decision to retire comes despite president trumps attempt to persuade him to
run for another term and almost immediately after that announcement from hatch one that mitt romney or probably what mitt romney aid went onto mitt romney's twitter account and change to use location from mitt romney massachusetts to mitt romney utah conveniently met
money does own a home in utah at least one and also is something of like a utah a hero because of the way he saved the winter olympics in two thousand and two we are talking about the olympics a lot and this pod cast and that was cited yes we love the winter olympics can't wait okay so kelsey that situation
is both unsurprising and impact full if that it's possible to be both things he has a little longest serving send are currently in this building but he has some hips hamster glasses that make it illegal oh yeah and he's gotten hits her staffers who are treating fun things for him on his official account but on eyes are and say right
but hatch i mean hatch has fueled speculation about his political future
on his own he has changed his mind publicly several times and there was a lot of talk about his overall physical and general health playing and his decision he has had his physical ailment had become more prominent overtime you should say he's eighty three years old and he has chosen to lead but his decision leaves a
huge void i mean he is the chairman of the finance committee which handles healthcare and taxes and a number of other things
he is one of the most senior people on health education and labor and pensions committee which is a really long way of saying they handled the other entire rest of the healthcare system and he's also really high up at the judiciary committee he is one of these elder statesman types who was also known as a big bipartisan dealmaker and it's a time right now
we're seeing a lot of losses in that apartment we're seeing people who are reliably viewed as republican dealmakers seen that there is just no point in running for reelection in this political environment people like bob quarter of tennessee jeff flake of arizona these are people who you know democrats would turn to when they would want to make a deal and were
president would turn to them to reach out to democrats when they needed people to get on board with you know complicated marginally bipartisan issue and unlike flake and quarter orrin hatch it was very loyal to president drop like set over the top have link the about him especially recently as they were getting this tax
which he carried over the finish line through the senate yeah he was absolutely one of the architects of that legislation
it is a loss that people are not quite sure who will fill that space
and the idea right now is that will be mitt romney but mitt romney does not fulfill that space of being you know the guy who's going to stand by president up and you know in terms of filling a space i have been obsessing about mitt romney taking or and had seat for many months as people here know because he would fill a different kind of space he if
as he is widely expected to do run and win easily he would immediately fill the space being vacated by jeff lake bob quarter he would be automatically the republican in congress with the most stature respected even beloved former presidential
candidate by his party and he would become the center of gravity for the kind of anti trump to the extent that there is that sentiment on capitol hill and a trump republican anti trip republican a lot of democrats for the heads even though right now since the quarter mccain like george w bush and flake kind of
explosions of criticism we've had radio silence from republicans but mitt romney just by being there he doesn't even have to say anything he represents the alternative for the republican party has learned to trump i don't undercut himself when he talked to trump about the secretary of state job there's a criticism
from a lot of people that that when romney went and have that incredibly awkward but amazingly photographed french dinner with pros drug drug frogs legs and immerse it looked like it was in cloud city a lot of people said he undercut all of the very harsh criticism that he had made of trump he seemed to approach it as if i can help this country
especially in an administration where he may have concerns about it i'm happy to have that conversation he apparently talk to hillary clinton before he went and have that meter i also think that that idea put him in a different camp than flake or from a coworker who say they want to push back against the president but they're leaving he saying i want to push back against the present
and i am volunteering to go into the breach and since we're talking about jeff flake he made some news today on all things considered kelsey jeff flake was asked whether he would consider running against president trump and twenty twenty and he said that he wouldn't rule it out
that is by no means and him saying that he will do it but he says that he also said of course that he didn't know that for sure that the president one run again in two thousand and twenty but he says that he don't think than an independent challenge will be coming and he wouldn't be surprised if a republican challenge came but he wouldn't say it will be him he wouldn't say which is the
politician way of answering a question okay let's move on to another thing which is last night the white house announced dead president tromp has dissolved the president's advisory commission on election integrity the president had created it back in may after claiming that he would have won the poppy
miller vote in two thousand and sixteen against hillary clinton if not for all of the millions of illegal votes were cast but then the president and his aides were never able to back that up with any proof whatsoever of widespread voter fraud they created this commission the commission was controversial from the
day it was created yeah and again mostly goes back to the fact that a lot of people viewed this entire commission as nothing more than a way to validate a tweet that there was no evidence for democrats are off the bat and repeated those claims again when this was dissolved said that that the purpose of this was nothing more
this is chuck schumer quote a front to suppress the vote perpetrate dangerous and baseless claims it was ridiculed from one end of the country to the other the fact is this commission never really did that march it was it may realize yeah and it was led by a vice president pants but kansas secretary of state chris coble took the lead on
he is a controversial figure in this world yes a lot of states just refused to hand over the voter data that the commission requested but there were also a lot of lawsuits and it wasn't just lawsuits it was the fact that these lawsuits had gotten to the point where they could credibly ask for information about communications about internal discussion
within the commission and at that point the commission just basically stopped doing any work yeah a lot of states refused to turn over voter data that was requested by the commission including chris kovacs own state so there was that a member of the commission actually sued the commission the whole thing was a mirage
ass and highly highly problematic that the white house in a statement said that not only is the president dissolving it because of these issues but is turning the issue over the over to the department of homeland security to review the commission's initial findings editorial note there were none and to determine the next call
voices of action one interesting thing about having it over in the department of homeland security is that there could be public records request for information about what is being done on this issue
we're going to take one more quick break and when we come back that tide race in virginia for a house of delegates seat has been decided by a drying and also can't let it go

hey sam sanders a happy new year i am popping into plug a new episode of mining pod cast show was called it's been a minute and this week we have a really good conversation with a republican member of the house
this really big swing district in texas and situation kind of represents the challenge a lotta republicans will face in twenty eight yes the president is the titular head of the republican party but he is not the only voice is the loudest voice right now of course he's allowed his voice but guess what i'm also a voice in a wing of the road
public important congressmen and former cia officer will heard check it out it's been a minute where wherever you get your pod cast
we're back and we've got an update on one of the craziest political stories of late republican david yancy has won a seat in virginia house of delegates in a tie breaking draw
will it is
and the way this was drawn why can't they just flip a coin it's so crazy number so they had a more canisters in a ball with the name of candidates and each then they took the first canister out of the ball was the winner than they took the second and show it just to show both candidates were in there
why not just let the coin also how weirdly specific is it to have film canister it's there could be any number of containers but film canisters let's find something that really highlights just how arcane this system is weird i guess our our our concerns here early based on the premise that the best way to to resolve a day
ty election is a fifty fifty chance thing but i don't know what else you can do other than revolt
and it wasn't just a fifty fifty election it would have determined the mature again that has delegates which which which would have been fifty fifty if the democrats had one and is a particularly high stakes in virginia where they had a number of issues that have been thought pretty significantly in recent years and where the democratic governor is and
odds with a republican legislature and so this is not one of the situations where nothing is at stake they possible expansion of medicaid in the state of virginia is one of those things that is at stake though it potentially could still happen will have to wait and see as the president would say if you had strong thoughts on this election and you slept in the internet been
thinking about it
i think that more than anything this this situation points out a reality of our system which is imperfect and is particularly in perfect when it comes to disputed elections and elections where it's a tie or a where there are disputed ballots it's just it just gets a little bit messy
in close races speaking of messy no not messy the fun part of our show it's time for can't let it go and thing that we always do and we talked about things we can't stop thinking about this we politics or otherwise kelsey right i'll go first because mine is about the weather
it is if you are in the east coast are basically anywhere a walk
east of the mississippi i think you are thinking about cold snaps and snow while i can't let go those interview that our local npr stationed to you and you did with peter seiko his the host of the npr shall wait wait don't tell me they called him up to ask him what his advice was for washingtonians about dealing
with the cold because he living in chicago and as we've established before i'm a chicago and and you're all smug about
i don't know if you notice that about iran and me we talk about it sometimes but this idea that there's like a half an inch of snow outside here in dc and people are complaining they are so worried about how they're going to get to work and what they're going to do so you know w a m you called peter say go up and this is what he had to say do not
plain about it
because that's not cool don't walk and go oh my god i can't feel my hands walk him from minus whatever degrees and maybe you've got ice and your beard
first of all grow a beard and then you walk and innovation your beard and are like little briscoe so and then shake your beard so the little snow crystals tinkle on the table in front of you and you will be the coolest i love this i love this because my husband came home yesterday and he was a see it's okay that i still have my b c
facial hair
i mean where the type of people who each own four or five winter coat because we see them as fashion statements so the
i definitely can't let that go can i say two things about that one i heard this live and i was doing dishes and not in a position where i could like touch my radio and change it it went on for so long
great little little too much
i did have a beard for a while and it is a very satisfying feeling when there is snow and your beard and you have an icy crusty snowbird you feel really cool about yourself
i cannot identify the only one who don't speak to that in the pod cast it's a true thing okay i'm going next right after president trump treated about his nuclear button being bigger than kim jong owns nuclear button he then made an announcement that he will be doing a fake news awards
ceremony or a war we're still trying to get the details on exactly what it will be but he will be awarding his fake news awards on monday night well one steven kolb bear saw that is a an invitation to campaign because he wants to win a fake news award
personally i'm excited for the most dishonest and corrupt video awards of the year as we call this the fake is because nothing gives you more credibility than donald trump calling you a liar and i of course don't want to get snob
that's why it's tonight and this is true while i have placed a billboard in times square the failing near times square
purchased a full page
add on my twitter feed
a for your consideration eggs
for me the best part is that bob mondello our film review or is one of the people who was quoted in this campaign literature that steven kobe or has created he is quoted not talking about steven kolb era his show but in fact about the movie dunkirk because why not
right mara
okay just to show you when we talk about can't let it go we really really mean it
lot of weeks ago my can't let it go was roy more his wife kayla more announcing at a rally to refute criticisms that she and her husband were anti semitic she stood up and said news would tell you that we don't care for jews
my tell you all this because i've seen it also i just want to set the record straight while they're here

one of our attorneys is a you and then she let it hang in the air with a little smile on her face it turns out which i thought was an extraordinary moment in the campaign one of our attorneys is a jew not jewish but is a jew and the forward which is in public
nation that has a big jewish audience it's jewish oriented publication went to work to find out who was roy moore's jewish attorney and they came up with someone who fits the description his name is richard jaffe and this is like a month long investigate as he he is someone who defended the more son caleb
