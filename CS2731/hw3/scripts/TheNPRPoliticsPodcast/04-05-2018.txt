
hi this is alex from central nebraska and i just finished loading the dishwasher which i never because of my life doesn't mean that i do i also just finished listening to the npr politics pod cast or daniel kurds slogans can't let it go was about a couple disagreeing about loading the dishwasher it was epic now you get to listen to a new episode of the park
last which was recorded at to forty four pm on thursday april fifth let's face it things have probably changed by the time you hear it is so keep up with all of as political coverage on the one app and pr dot org and your local station now let's get on with the ship danielle was literally dancing
a joy dance yes that's true i like this guy as last easement mustard the boat
this the our politics pod and we're here with our weekly round up of political news president trump is deploying national guard troops to the us mexico border it's not technically a trade war yet more like a trained skirmish but china is leading back at the us the terrorists it's out targeted at truck
country and with ceo mark zuckerberg preparing to testify before congress next week facebook is now saying that some eighty seven million people had their data harvested and shared with the political consulting firm cambridge analytical that's a lot and it's also a lot more than facebook originally said i'm tamer key
cover the white house for npr i was going to oscillate massacre of the white house and danielle current slaven political reporter and i'm more alliance and national political correspondent i just want us to know that this week for the first time ever and loaded my dishwasher handles down and how has it for her so much cleaner
my life has changed you know black is white up is down
food taste better
absolutely off a little food scraps from last night's dinner left in them and dear liz is i have stopped putting wooden spoons in the dishwasher and result of some scolding i received
so we talked about this a bit on the pod cast on tuesday but president trump has been back to railing about immigration and border security a lot in the past few days mostly on twitter but his exit and twitter income into the real world and yesterday he signed a memorandum to deploy
oi national guard troops to the us mexico border homeland security secretary cures to nielsen made the announcement yesterday at the white house press briefing we continue to see unacceptable levels of illegal drugs dangerous gang activity transnational criminal organizations an illegal immigration fled across that border
threatens not only the safety of our communities and children but also were very rule of law and although they announced it there are still a lot of questions about exactly how this would work and they seem to be questions that nielsen and the white house are having trouble answering at this point but i'd like to hear from the governor's is what it is good
they want that's not anything that we have proposed that we've we want to get to border security so i think that we're saying here we're going to hear any kind of view and until until and when congress acts mara
can you say about what's the is the plan right now according to the secretary nielsen is that she's going to be talking with governors of the border states to figure out how many national guard troops they would need and the ways that they could be the most helpful in a national guard troops act as backups they free a border
patrol officers but the backdrop for all of this is that immigration has become the number one election year issue for the white house and the president just as we started this pod cast was in west virginia giving a speech that was supposed to be about tax reform but it actually was a lot about immigration
describing and great gory detail how m s thirteen which is a gang how they kill and maim their victims and all the horrible things that are happening because of immigration they believe this isn't this isn't an issue that does fire up the trump base firing up the bases very important
number one political strategy for the white house keep their base energize get them out to the polls and a tough midterm election but there's also something else going on which is the president has been very frustrated that he hasn't been able to get full funding for his wall and as a matter of fact when he called for national guard troops to go down to the border he said they'll stay there until the wall
is built he got some pushed back from his conservative base when he signed a big omnibus spending bill that did not include full funding for the wall this is the first time he's ever done anything really that cause this much grumbling from his conservative base and he wants to show them that he's been tough and even though he can't get the wall build he's doing something else and that was the
impetus for this news new policy now technically politics cannot be the official impetus can be the unofficial impetus but there has to be in theory a reason why this is happening and and scott the white house and the department of homeland security
says there is a reason that remember the pros and spent a lot of last year bragging about how much he and his get tough stance on border policing have done to depress the number of illegal border crossings and in fact if you look at the numbers from the department homeland security we did see a drum
man drop in the number of illegal border crosses last year that was called the trump effect but we sort of sort
the little border crossings would have bottomed out about this time last year and they slowly begun creeping up again and just this week we got the numbers for the march border crossings and it was pretty dramatic spike they were up thirty seven percent in march from february and they were three
three times as high in march of two thousand and eighteen as they were in march of two thousand and seventeen remember march twenty seventeen a peak trump effect so it's kind of bouncing back off of an artificially low for and what we're really seeing is illegal border crossings returning to sort of kind of normal level that they've been at for the last five or six years but
as a substantial increase from where we were a year ago and that's what the white house and saying it had on here this is not the first time that a recent president of the united states has sent in the national guard to help along the border how do the current numbers even the spike numbers compare to what it was like when george w bush was sin
people in or when president obama sent in something like fifteen hundred national guard troops back in two thousand and six just before the recession
we saw illegal immigration was really it kind of a a long time peak
those days we were seeing more than a million illegal border crosses every year even if we would have see the border crossings we saw in march disdain for this whole year it would be way below that be maybe the neighborhood of four hundred thousand so less than half of what we saw in two thousand and six when when president bush that at the national guard like than the recession happened and people
didn't want to come here when the recession have when we actually saw him out migration a lot of folks who had come here for economic reasons to try to find work for finding work and home
we've also seen a change in the composition of the migrants and it's fewer mexicans now coming for work and so a lot more central americans coming often fleeing violence or or oppression in their in their home countries more children more families and well in the president's mind and we heard this yesterday from the homeland security secretary to this is also
completed with illegal drugs and gangs and a national security threat there's really no hard evidence that links this recent flow of immigrants again about a third of them children and families to those kinds of criminal problem with the white house and d h s were talking about absolutely and you so you can sort of see what
trump strategy here is then you know as as opposed to you know in the past you know if there has been a crisis the president said a crisis of some sort of the president has said okay let's put these let's send in these national guard troops trump is painting a crisis
a crisis of violence and drug dealers coming out across the border now let me send sundays national guard troops one other thing i wanted to add though and terms of contacts in terms of people in the country illegally is it's really easy to focus on people crossing the border illegally but a large share of people who are in the us illegally
did not cross the border illegally they came here legally and they overstayed their visas st louis and on vacation they came as a worker have some especially as workers yes and so it's it's one key thing to keep in mind that this is not trump has a big problem
with undocumented immigrants but it's not just about getting tough on the border and this is why during the twenty six thousand campaign you saw a lot of the republican candidates in particular
talk not just about amp up the border which is of course with trump talks a lot about but finding some other way of tracking so overseas and in terms of policy scary you talk about young people or these unaccompanied minors are families coming in
the way the trump administration is presenting that is that they are sort of abusing the current laws that they are coming in and they're not saying we're coming for work they're saying we're coming because we're afraid and because of that the law treats them differently than they if they were just like a dude who said i'm coming for work there is a
big increase in the number of people who have come across the border and say they've come because they have a legitimate fear of something going on back home the trump administration described that as folks taking advantage of the system could also mean that there's a lot going on back home that they are afraid of but it is true that the law requires the government to treat young
by themselves and also families differently than they would say a single man coming over for economic reasons families can only be held for twenty days young people if they're coming from central america generally have to be turned over to sponsors in this country off and family members as opposed to being sent quickly back home so there there is a
legal framework that makes young people and families from central america a bigger challenge for immigration authorities then then historical border crossings you know this is what the president and the administration cause catch and release and that they are forced by law to release certain immigrants
undocumented immigrants from detention
in advance of their court dates and today the president was talking about how and then they disappear and they don't show up for their court date and they are proposing they say the white house a legislative package that would correct these loopholes and would put an end to this catch and release effect
the chances of congress passing map this year i think our next to zero but yesterday a senior white house official said that the politics of this are good for them and an election year because he said how long can democrats filibuster in favor of illegal immigrants that's going to be very unpopular
unnamed white house official said and i think that as much as i cover politics but i'm extremely interested in policy the policy here is so unimportant this is really not this didn't come from a kind of policy wellspring this is a political initiative and go by
back to the summer of two thousand and fifteen when donald trump wrote down the escalator and talked about mexicans sending drug dealers and ranged across the border a lot of people wrote off his candidacy on that day but he obviously tapped into some vein of american politics and wrote it all the way to the white house and you know people say that they didn't that his supporters didn't
really expect him to build the wall they took him seriously but not literally it turns out they took him seriously and literally and some of the loudest voices on the right are saying if you don't build the wall why did we vote for you and that the president has felt very frustrated about this that he hasn't gotten the wall and what's so interesting about this week in particular one day
the president talks about tweets about lacks porter laws and that he wants those things fixed and about that he seizes on this news story of a caravan which and in stocks which has been stopped but he seizes on this new story look there's a caravan traveling through mexico to our border and the white house scrambles catches that holds a brief
about all of the loop holes which they called catch and release in the law that they'd like fixed not a single word about the national guard or militarize in the border the next day the president seemingly impromptu says we're going to send the military to the border okay and they have to scramble and catch up for that come up with some kind of policy have briefings have the
department of homeland secretary come out to say this is happening i mean this is how policy is made on this way to that as as far as what prompted this i mean aside from watching a fox news story about caravans and i'm not suggesting that that prompted this whole policy roll out you might call it what i'm wondering is what did prompt us then because even though trumps base may have
been upset at that omnibus that didn't include a big giant border wall i mean what did prompt us because we haven't seen his base abandoning hands and now now he has very high approval ratings among republicans but i think that the president acts as if he is in constant fear of losing his base i know that he's being told by someone
his advisors in and out of the white house that if he doesn't deliver on the wall if he doesn't double down on being tough on undocumented immigration that he's in danger of not so much losing his base but that they would be less enthusiastic and coming out in a midterm election when he's not on the ballot don't forget he has to try to transfer his party
hilarity to other republican candidates which doesn't always work just as barack obama in two thousand and ten and two thousand and fourteen so i think that was a number of things it was the omnibus it was his frustration worry about the mid term elections and then room and then a return as scott just said to the number one core issue
you that he wrote to the white house and that's illegal immigration we are going to take a quick break and when we come back china retaliate against president trumps new tariffs

we are back and so our fears of a possible trade war with china in response to president trumps recent decision to impose tariffs on imported steel and aluminum china has announced that it too will be imposing tariffs on certain us
products scattered danielle open floor here can you please explain where we are in this tit for tat several let me just start with what happened this week so it started on monday when china impose tariffs on three billion dollars worth of american goods it was one hundred and twenty eight products in total
including for example a lot of fruit a lot of nuts grown in the us and a lot of pork raised in the us and that was in response to tariffs that the us had imposed so then on tuesday trump announced tariffs on thirteen hundred chinese products now that was not a volley back at those tariffs
beijing and rather this was sort of fulfilling a thing that the united states had announced a couple of weeks ago a couple weeks know he said
we're gonna come out with a list of stuff and this was our list of stuff thirteen hundred thirty and hundred different products around fifty billion dollars worth and so in response the next day china said our we're fifty billion dollars worth of stuff so we neither of those last two things as fifty billion dollar rounds of threats
they have not been imposed impose yeah they've just been threatened were waiting until those actually come into effect so some of the tariffs so we've been talking about aren't already employs steel and aluminum tariffs for example although a lot of the big suppliers those medals have given gotten an exemption and then china's shot across the bow pork producers and and grow
that's that's an effect and we've seen a dramatic
drop in them presently hogs only seen almost growers worried about where it was going to have their market and pistachio growers in central valley of california but the really big second round rare of the the work at china over his handling of intellectual property and then the pushed back by china against soybeans and commercial aircraft cut
extortion united states those are in advance for the time being and we had larry kudlow the new economic advisor at the white house go on cable tv and say you know those by never go into effect that's that's really just a a bargaining chip we've put that off on them table and now we're going to see if we can make a deal in the stock market read the big sigh of relief when they heard como se the night
it's a trade war i think there's going to be intense negotiations on both sides but look when you look at this whole picture
gain china don't blame president trumps a solution
pablo has been saying is like president trump is this incredible negotiator we've thrown those out here now let's go negotiate this thing which is also a way of saying the you know larry kudlow who came to the administration from c n b c the cable news network for people who care about what's happening with the markets
kudlow is trying to put up like a big bad sign that says just chill this could not this could not actually happened maybe like margaret breathe the big early when they heard that the market which opened about five hundred points down ran on wednesday came back and of the day plus two hundred so but it's not that there are no repercussions here
i mean we have been careful here at npr and a lot of news organisations have been to say no listen it's haven't got into effect yet larry kudlow really stressed that but there are still results in the market for example the soybean market the price of soybeans dropped around four percent all at once and that has soybean growers very worried
read as the resident island i can tell you that you know a roughly one third of america's soybeans go to china like if one of our biggest export markets for one of our biggest agricultural exports
suddenly closes even a bit like that's going to be very very bad for a lot of people who by the way voted for president and it's only been going on the list that came from china renato soybeans go make tofu right
mara they do
hey
and so i saw a tornado they also feed easy
and the chinese with a growing middle class have been eating a lot more american meet by the way that aside from that one thing i want to add here is like this whole idea of us wanting to retaliate against china for unfair trade practices i mean a lot of economists will say like you know we're not wrong trump isn't wrong to say that they're stealing our and
property that there's force technology transfers anything like that it's it's just that tariffs might not be a are not a good way to solve this is what a lot of economists would say what are lots of business groups
appreciate the president's goal here they're just writing his means to that end and well there's at least temporary reassurance from larry kudlow that this is all just a bargaining chip america lost track record of predictions on economic issues is not all that great he's got a record of get things wrong and again and again and again but you know it's interesting to me
and this goes into the unpredictability or the suspense that's involved with every single trump policy initiative is if you look at the headlines on the washington post it says trump defiant as china ads trade penalties the big headline on the new york times white house edges back from brink of trade war so we do
don't know if there's going to be trade were not what i think is so interesting is that just as we were all the conventional wisdom was concealing around this idea that trumps second year in office was going to be about more isolation is more protectionist he was going to have fewer advisors who were going to push back against him along comes larry kudlow
who wrote famously and op ed piece saying that tariffs were taxes when president from first raise these then got hired to be a top economic advisor and as scott said he was out there yesterday sending a message to the markets calm down this is just a negotiating tactic it's not gonna really end up with these tariffs that are going to harm us and we don't know how
this is gonna come out i want to just turn back to our resident iowan here danielle because
this is not abstract now if you're a soybean farmer in iowa rape and you happened to maybe i don't know be related to a silly been farmer in iowa i just might be their decisions that are being made absolutely as a farm right now this is happening interestingly just as farmers in iowa and i imagine and other places
are ramping up to plant soybeans for the year so if you're a farmer in iowa illinois southern minnesota wherever you have a choice to make what do you want to plant in your field you on a plant soybeans you want a plant corn is often the alternative well if i'm a farmer and i look around that i see that the soybean prices depressed i might very well decide well i'm not going to
plant soybeans i'm going to plant corn this year or plant something else so like what you might end up with is a glut of corn yields come this far so i mean really
varian and we should say both corn and being prices have been depressed for a couple years and several years no solar farm income has been down for the last four years this is a really tough time for farm country to be hit with these kinds of trade and corn prices dropped a bit this week as well not as much as as soybeans dead if i'm right on
but him but they did drop so i mean this is definitely something that farmers are quite worried about i mean farming is a volatile business anyway well you know i wonder what politically farm farm country is trump country more or less i wonder if this is something that would make farmers
farm voters and farm country think differently about donald trump i don't know the answer to that maybe they're there
their belief and him early transcends these kinds of issues but you know the other thing that goes into the category of wrong answer to the right question is this is the only issue that i can think of where you have had such a loud chorus of republicans in congress disagreeing with the president i can't think of anything else where you've had this pushed back
against tariffs and as a matter of fact when you think about the political fallout from this even though this is something he ran on this is going to go under the promise fulfilled column for donald trump the people who are happiest about these tariffs are rust belt democrats running for reelection yeah and that's what's so interesting i mean he he is helping sherrod brown and know
higher with these tariffs no doubt about it by the way i mean trumped does have someone very close to him in this fight who knows the impact this could have on islands and that's a guy named terry brant said who was a long time governor of iowa now he is the us ambassador to china and who his buddies was president siege
paying of china so terry brant said this week was saying he was saying the company line on you know listen china really has been a bad actor and trade and so on but terry brant is also very intimately aware of the potential repercussions of of what should happen if we did impose a whole bunch of
tariffs on china or of china and positive bunch of tariffs on our stuff and so you have to be wondering what he is thinking right now and you know it's so interesting is that when you ask people will gee if this is the wrong answer to the right question of china really is a cheater and china is stealing our intellectual property what would be the answer and most people will tell you well the answer instead of these terrorists would be to work in
concert with a whole bunch of other countries to force that i needed to change guess that there used to be something called the t p p the transposed civic partnership which excluded china and excluded china for exactly this purpose to try to correct some of these problems and you know trump famously cancelled that that was both the w bush and obama long game on this
so the trump team i guess is trying a new strategy one more thing before we take a quick break that may or may not be completely blown out of the water by whatever happens next scott pruitt the administrator we talked about him on the last pod cast he continues to be insured of a
what do you call it cabinet purgatory where it's not clear what his fate might be the president today did when asked if he had confidence in him the president said i do
although sometimes when trumps shows i do he only means for a little while
screw it is a skeptic of the science around and climate change but he is certainly feeling the heat himself as right now from a mounting array of ethical challenges and it sounds as if the white house is whatever confidence the president still house in his administrator the war
houses put some distance we heard a white house spokesman out about him to do he he just totally decline to to come to approach defense right because earlier this week didn't president trumps say something like i hope i hope he is going to be great writing on going to own who's been in office for over that is not the definite
son of a full throated a doors and then sarah sanders went on to be when she was asked his trumpet okay with pruitt living arrangements he said he's not okay and that they were taking the controversies very seriously it's said every thing i've heard that the white house this week has been that pruitt is on very thin ice and not for anything he's
as the now i'm certainly not like the like wow
oh fuel economy standards rolling back the clean power plant that's all very consistent with the trump agenda but he has created a spectacle of himself and in all the wrong was and this is the kind of thing that doesn't like because it goes against his brand that he's draining the swamp and as a matter of fact and that fox news interview when pruitt was asked a question about those key
what do you think about this and trump promise to drain the swamp he said that was a very inappropriate question already we're going to take another quick break and scott you are leaving us making away from iowa
my better male counterpart
tim mac is coming after the break and we're going to talk about facebook and
i had get over it over facebook yes well we can't have two people on this pod cast you've never been on facebook before they these guys so we will be right back

fifty years ago this week to civil rights leaders were killed one you know dr martin luther king jr in one you may not this week conclude switch the final days of the lives of to lead to fall into fighting for justice find a dome in pure one or ever you get your pockets
we're back and we have a new friend in the studio
tim mag hello hi to him and we just bring you here when facebook is in trouble
i do a lot of other things i do really i just younger loring i don't actually have i have other town this and other are
we're going over fact checker kind of that out you know
so left him you were here you are talking about facebook and the political consulting firm cambridge analytical cambridge analytic a did work for the trump campaign among many others
and how cambridge analytic i had gotten at hand somewhat questionable on the data have some fifty million facebook users well we are having you back as facebook announces that upset if it was actually maybe more like eighty seven million right so facebook is revised assessments it saying hey we are
using the maximum projection we can figure out exactly how many people's information was taken through this scandal that's involved with cambridge analytical another saying hate eighty seven million it's not fifty million as we as previously said do we have any idea of how they were off by a factor of what seventy five per se
said well this is the the major problem with this whole facebook scandal right it's it's the idea that facebook has put out all of this information and it doesn't have any definitive way to track precisely each of these pieces of data where it goes what happens to it and what people use it for so they are merely making an estimate
about how many people were potentially affected and that could change and they can't get it back like he gone
that's the nature of information if i tell you something and you tell three other people and they tell for the people that information is out there in the world and you can't retrieve that nor can i ever figure out how he will actually saw it what with that information be used for you know it's interesting you use it for a number of ways but the political aspect of this
right is is to develop profiles of people to be able to target individuals politically with advertising with get out the vote efforts and so on and so forth based on information that they've taken from facebook profiles whether that's where you live what your political party is whether you prefer certain types of television shows weather
you have children all these things can be used to better targeted political advertising towards you or propaganda depending on your point of view depending on where you stand
so next week and this is a pretty big news and will be a big deal next week mark zuckerberg the ceo and creator of facebook will testify on capitol hill
he'll be there for two days have been to couple of different hearings joint hearing of the senate judiciary and commerce committee is followed by the house energy and commerce committee
and it almost feels like this week they're doing clean up on i'll i'm about to have to testify before congress
okay so this is not just limited to the cambridge analytical problem they've got a number of different issues ranging from how russia use facebook as a platform to in two thousand and sixteen election
to influence the american political process and they just announced something on that too yeah this week facebook announced that it had shut down hundreds of facebook and instagram account that word used by russia's internet research agency this is that troll for that that company that was actively trying to create device
i'd in the american electorate you know trying to incite the laugh trying to incite the right creating fake accounts on facebook and twitter to provoke people and to ultimately boost the campaigns of bernie sanders and donald trump and harm hillary clinton's can end they were indicted as part of the most
solar probe as part of the russian investigation and also i have been targeted by sanctions from the tramp administration that's correct
but ultimately it gets to a deeper problem in the american political system which is how do we know what kind of information
we're providing to facebook and powerful tech companies what do they do with it and how do we know what information they're providing back to us in the form of advertising who controls and the the level of transparency their facebook must provide us when we see information white so so next week zuckerberg is going to go before this congressional
committee and they're all going to grandstand him for a while but that but he's probably gonna have to wear a suit and not a honey
most of this is the most important part of this but the next most important part is about like they're going to a small these questions but do we have a sense of what kinds of policies has anybody proposed anything in terms of how do we prevent this in the future like is it all about transparency is it about it
what data they take or no take well there are a couple of major issues here one is that the internet research agency as an example they spent tens of thousands of dollars putting forward advertisements on facebook and other social media platforms and there was no accountability transparency about where that money came from so there are
proposed regulations that would require just like on television when you see a political advertisement it says it's sponsored by some political candidate some sponsored by is sponsored by the patriotic americans of america exactly i mean what does that mom and apple pie and arena but at least at least of is sponsored by the patriotic americans of america that is a committee that's ready
you could walk wherever they would have to actually register yeah well theoretically that will be the only reason for this kind of regulation right that you would need to have a chain of accountability behind whatever it is so if you get an advertisement on facebook right now there's not there's not a regulation that says hey you must tell people
cool where this money is coming from whose funding this campaign well let me ask you a broader question about congress because i've heard congress members of congress to described facebook in a lot of different ways do you think there's a consensus that facebook is either a giant unregulated utility the most powerful publisher on the planet a pipeline version
began to or some kind of consumer surveillance tool i mean how do members of congress see facebook now
there's a wide variety of views on the hill from left to right right that but ultimately the we have to see facebook for what it is which is that it is taking our personal information as part of its business model and selling it to advertise we're we we're in different if the services for a year the product
that facebook may have money basically by trying to figure out who we are in the particulars of our lives and then selling that customize asian to advertisers right if advertisers want to find people who live in washington dc who own to catch and they really liked a particular book that's the level of specificity
eighty that facebook can offer advertisers so they so advertising in turn need to pay less to reach the individuals they want to talk so you're saying tim that the biggest the most urgent issue seems to be the privacy issue well yes said that there are more than then russia use facebook to corrupt american american i don't want to rank the as problem because
both major problems you know there's the privacy problem and there's the accountability problem right
they're on the privacy side they're on the e u for example has regulations to say you have a right to know what kind of data that tech companies collect on you and you have a right also to be to be shown what that data is and to request it be deleted if you ask
for it you know that's not necessarily something that that congress is totally on board with but mark zuckerberg has said that's the spirit the general idea of regulations that with that facebook would move towards or would be more supportive of do we have a sense of how big of a priority this is not for alarming
but for americans themselves i mean how i know i've seen pulling that democrats favor ability of facebook has fallen by more than it has for republicans but in general how how worried are americans are people giving up their facebook accounts left and right
zuckerberg himself or said look this is not something that has this campaign to delete facebook hasn't had a substantial impact on a number of users and most people aren't paying that much attention you know who the folks here
who a lot of the folks here listening to the pot right now aren't going to ultimately delete their facebook has the thing about this is that it's an incredibly useful social tool them i use it all the time to figure out what what my friends are up to what they're doing who likes wide and what's interesting amongst the people whose views
i care about and we can't forget can just abandon or forget about that in the context of this conversation people keep facebook as long as they believe that the benefits of that social connection that you create with your family and friends outweighs any loss of privacy i mean all all sorts of
things that we do with our modern life now
have cost in terms of losing our privacy whether it's you know i'm going for iran and my tip is going to track my route
you know or
or you know i'm going to use a diet app and i'm going to track a number of calories that i'm using and that's a social thing for some reason or i use van mo and for some reason i need to broadcast to all my friends exactly why i'm doing the financial transactions i'm doing or yes yeah all my friends know every time i ran because that person faced work i my goodness i appreciate
it actually
idea listeners the good news for you is we will be talking even more about facebook we're going to have a pod cast that will come out after that first hearing so i mean look for it in your feet probably wednesday morning is what i would guess or if you're a night owl tuesday night
and now it is time for that thing that we do at the end of the show called can't let it go where we talk about one thing we cannot stop thinking about this week politics or otherwise tim this is your first time in the can't let it go chair
the spotlight is on and i think we should start with you as a result
so the thing i can't like oh is that you had a story this week about the evolving technologies behind the creation of faith audio that we can now create people have audio clips of people saying things they never said you know there's a small monetary i'll start up it's called liar bird and basically you feed i arbor liar e o l y
whoa
firebird and and they basically feed them a minute of someone talking with you or me
or a politician like barack obama donald trump
feed them a minute of someone speaking the new types of tax and the next thing you know you have been able to mimic that person speaking you've created a fake audio clip of them saying something and this is deep deep group repercussions for american society and politics whether we can trust what we're hearing a weather new
news is legitimate or illegitimate and he could be used both to create audio that or quotes that never happened or it can be used because this technology exists for politicians to say oh well i never actually said that that would fake through technology while so i first learned about the sick
the after rogue one the star wars movie came out because i know i know i know
all comes back eurostar where your brand a strong well because my mind was blown with how they had created all of this video that look just like the actors who were no longer living and i called my brother and he was like oh yeah you think that's crazy they can do the audio to and i've been freaking out for like how long has it been since rogue one came out and
now i never even thought to connect it to politics and you're connecting to politics and it's scary you had the technology has evolved into dramatic way i think we have a clip on hi everybody
this is i'm happy to share with you will smaller announcement of articles for wherever they want to bury their website where you can create a digital copy of your wars
you to record one volume
this is just the beginning and they are working hard to improve your results it's a combination of obama and his speak and spell
it's not perfect but that was their original effort when they first launched the beta right
early on a year ago or more than a year ago and here's the thing the technology is only going to get better there are only so many specific sounds in the human voice and so basically they use artificial intelligence to identify how each individual says the sounds combine them together and smooth it out to mimic
real speech well how far away from video being able to be pretty much they're in pretty much there in the sense that you could create a video that audio clip we just heard was that there is a accompanying video of barack obama lips moving along with that audio clip so we're at a place where it could
to me that we can't trust our eyes can't trust our ears when we see and hear things from disreputable sources
okay
that is depressing
mind blown
danielle why can't you like other girl from the ball that i'm in yes series
and i don't know if we can bring you back i'm scared you yeah me too
let me try so i wanted sucked to you guys ever movie recommendation it's for my favorite fantasy movie from the nineteen nineties

i'm out in nineteen ninety two three nineteen ninety three so is so i bring this up in part because like a i rediscovered it you should go watch it
it's ridiculous it's kind of upsetting but also i discovered it is the twenty fifth anniversary
a couple of weeks here
australia makes feel old now if we have seen it i mean yeah a little bit i mean i'm old to hear but like watching it last night i was live tweet to get i was having a hell of a time because i don't have a life and i read but like it's so the plot of the movie is this kevin kline he plays both the president and this guy named dave the president has a stroke while actually hour
if his mistress and so the sort of oily evil figures surrounding the president higher the look alike other kevin kline to go play the president and do their bidding and as it turns out because of the great american myth that any man would be great at being a president that the every man kevin kline strolls into the white house and doesn't
better job that the president did briggs it is see charles grodin to adjust the federal budget
it's really realistic fashion and
also is a better husband to the first lady and sigourney weaver falls in love with him etc etc
it's an absolutely right and and there's a cameo for me to tote murder words yeah yeah

okay but i can't let go of is this really great story that was on the internet that everybody has to go and read about the hotel
tory a british columbia yeah for gave a guest who many many years ago seventeen years ago had trashed one of their rooms and when you read this facebook post okay i'm giving facebook
brand of applause for this this guy was from nova scotia described how he brought a lot of special pepperoni to give to his navy buddies in victoria but there wasn't a fridge in his room and he wanted to keep the meat cool so he left it on the window sill it was a kind of a cold april day
like it is today in washington he went out when he came back he found his room full of sea goals
i've been eating the pepperoni and as he says as he as he explains pepperoni does something really horrendous to the sea gulls digestive
has room was covered with with with chunks of pepperoni and coop and feathers and everything was trashed when he came in and started trying to get them out they flew around and crashed into things and broke lamps and the the coffee table and then he had a he says in a moment of clarity i grabbed a bath towel and through it over one
the birds and then threw it out the window but the seagull wrapped in the bathtub tell landed on some tourists terminal arriving at this hotel for their famous high tea he also tried to get rid of the the birds by throwing one of his shoes at them the shoe and the bird went out the window and then he real
he had to go to a dinner a business dinner any only one shooting ran out he grabbed the shoe we watched enough he used a hair dryer to dry it but then the power in the hotel went off it was like a better than a marx brothers movie and cleaning lady came up and he looked at her and he just said i'm sorry and he went out to dinner he will ban he got a lifetime ban
and from the hotel seventeen years later he wrote to the hotel to say i think i've served my time could i come back and and be a pain gets to your hotel and they granted him a pardon and there is a picture of him talking to two women at the front desk of though tell and they are laughing and tears streaming down their face just like they were when i
