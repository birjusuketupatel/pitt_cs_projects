
hey world this is justin from red check productions coming to you from pop culture trivia night at tapestry brewing in purge been michigan

this pod cast was recorded at one fifty three pm on thursday february we made into february first things may have changed when time year this keep up with npr political coverage it npr that or the npr app or your local npr station okay here's the show
hey there each the npr politics five cast here with our weekly roundup of political news stand off between the f b i and the white house over the public release of a classified memo we haven't read it but it purports to be about f b i surveillance and missteps in the russian investigation prison
trump once released that the guy says it has quote grave concerns plus congressional retirements a fatal train accident on the way to a republican retreat and in case you didn't notice peace love and understanding have not broken out since the state of the union address earlier this week i'm tamer keats i covered the white house for npr
and lucas like over the justice department and danielle coach slaven political reporter on kelsey is now like of congress and i'm ron hundred or correspondent and kelsey enron are currently sharing a microphone in this clown car of a studio there are so many of
we just don't have microphones role of them so that is that and that is because we have ryan here in the studio at least for the first half of the pod cast to update us on the memo the hash tag memo memo good memo released the memo memo memo okay let's explain what this is this is a
not secret because everybody's talking about it he knows that it exists
yes vote at this point yes it is classified it was created by republicans on the house intelligence committee or there was it was drawn up by the chairman of the host intelligence committee a republican by the name of the newness as well as his staff we don't know exactly what's in it yet because it has not been released
remains classified but from talking to people who have reddit what we know is that it alleges beyond the department of justice
abuse their surveillance powers in the early days of the russian investigation purportedly deals with surveillance on quarter page who was a foreign policy advisor for the trunk campaign
basically saying that the f b i leaned on material in the infamous trump russia dossier to get court approval to conduct the surveillance on quarter page that's what it purportedly says we'll find out once it's actually released and depending on who you ask it is either highly damaging
or it is a nothing burger what does the f b i said about it well the f b i
put out a statement
on wednesday that was really pretty stunning and in many ways that came out and said that they have grave concerns about the memo they have concerns about factual inaccuracies i could be misleading
lead to improper interpretations of what actually went down it's rare that you get enough be coming out so strongly against something that the president himself has made clear he wants to have come out now the justice department did come out before them it came out several days earlier and said that it that releasing the memo would be extraordinarily reckless
endangered national security ongoing investigations so you have the justice department and the f b i both same do not let this see the light of day and the white house signaling that we want this out there without having seen the memo do we have any clear sense at all of specifically what the f b i is concerned about
what type of thing the f b i is concerned about we do not we do not specifically they do not get into
details with it was to paragraph statement
it was an unsigned statement from the f b i part of the concern when you talk to to former officials i talk to a couple last night is that in a memo like this it's difficult for the f b i to counter because to present counter arguments you would have to reveal classified information which is something that the f b i is loath to do so it puts them
in this sort of impossible situation of well we don't think it's right but we can't tell you why it's not right and what do we do well the thing is politicians notice you will often hear from national security folks that when they go into hearings they will be berated by by members of congress who will come up with theories about
y z and people at the f b d o j
basically can't count of these arguments they just say well we can't come an ongoing investigations are we can't say that there's an investigation or not could we at least hypothesize maybe looking at and different set of circumstances and another time as to what it would be in a memo like this that would compromise confidential information is it the revealing of sources
his have been we're talking about who we are we reading out somebody somewhere has been helping me feel there's there's always the concern about exposing sources and methods
eventually compromising an ongoing investigation and obviously something that the intelligence community is deeply concerned about and always is would be sources and methods of how they conduct investigations and how they attain intelligence can information
they have and leans heavily on the sources and methods thing talking to a former f the official last night who said he feels that it's largely concerns about being able to push back on what they see as this kind of misleading narrative that concocted in the allegedly concocted in the memo that there could be areas of a mission
exactly and earlier today on morning edition the former cia director michael hayden was interviewed by some of our colleagues and he talked about some of this stuff seeger let's let's hear it from one of the experts let let's i of it the bureau and the broader department of justice has been very vocal and very public which is very hard for career
professionals to do and then there are going back pushing back on on three tracks number one that you really can't do this without revealing critical sources and methods
the second is that you are injecting politics into a process that should have no politics attached and so you're setting up a a horrible
horrible precedent year and then finally they simply saying that the memo itself is so cherry picked evidence available out there that it leads to a faulty conclusion i want to talk about politics and because enron i'd like to get your perspective on this to this does not seem normal in the normal
of course of things that every time i've ever seen the intelligence community and and the executive branch involved in something it has been that the executive branch is working in tandem with the intelligence community to try to prevent something from being really started to trying to protect sources and methods and this time you
you have the f b i and the justice department on one side and you have the white house and the president on the other side that's right you're scrambling the branches in the usual warfare and putting people on different sides if you look at the basics of the f b i and the justice department
i very much part of the executive branch they are not the creatures of congress but what we have here is elements of congress that are determined to defend the president against what they see as elements of the executive branch who are not loyal to the president but are loyal to themselves do something that is sometimes characterized as the deep south
state that is to say the government as it exists irrespective of who has just won an election the people who are the professionals the people we count on to be there whoever wins the election in the military the intelligence services the law enforcement people and what we have here is a very aggressive characterization of those professionals as being
actually politically motivated and in some sense or another devoted to torpedoing donald trump
and now you have the chairman of the house intelligence committee devon nunez responding to the f b i saying well of course they would push back on this
it's pretty difficult to argue with known as if you believe that newness is correct in that there is a conspiracy by the so called deep state then is it that much of a jump to believe that the f b i and the deal are going to push back against allegation that they abuse or surveillance powers to target the trump camping so like the f b i can't win know speaking of republican push back on this
one other thing that i think maybe they're kelsey orion can answer for me is you know
i saw paul ryan saying the following this is a completely separate matter from bob mahler's investigation and his investigation to be allowed to take its course now as a person who does not cover this and is not neck deep in all of this can you explain to me like what kind of a line is he drying there and watch what should i make of that well he's not the only one who is drawing on that loan i spoke with
conway who's basically taken over the russian investigation for the republicans on the house intelligence committee wants newness had stepped side because of an ethics investigation that's a whole other tangent
no longer really stepping aside at all but the let's get back but back to the question of how this does or does not relate to the mother investigation certainly republicans are trying to say this doesn't have anything to do with the murder investigation we're not trying to hamstring it this is merely about a legit abuses by the f b i n d o j and that's something that isn't
the interests of the american people to learn more about to make sure that it doesn't happen again the problem with that reason mean is this does tie directly back into the mother investigation because it alleges that the foundation of the russia investigation is off is wrong it was it was unfairly concocted and is basically
i to try to bring the president down the foundation being the steel does the in the steel dossier which was funded by democrats in there for this is all part of a political hit job we don't actually know that any clear we ran and there's a lot of evidence out there that there was an additional evidence like a lot of it beyond the steel that's absolutely in part
the issue with the the allegations that republicans are making about the surveillance this ties into something known as far as a surveillance and this would be surveilling people in the us
maybe believe to be the subject of a of a foreign power but the thing is when you apply for a pfizer want to conduct surveillance
it is a painstaking process current and former officials say to get this done it's not like you just go to the court and say hey we wanted conduct surveillance on this an individual and they go done know it has a long process that involves many many people former f b i folks say that there are various layers of oversight to make sure within the bureau before you get to the o j
to make sure that this is all above board
and then you get it to the court sometimes the applications are fifty sixty seventy pages long and you have to prove to the court that there's probable cause to believe that this individual may be acting as an agent of a foreign power so basically this is a long way of saying that in order to get approval from the court to conduct surveillance on someone like quarter page
it wouldn't just be the dossier that's it in it would be part of a very kind of expensive bit of documentation to justify it and this is something that republicans in general are trying to do is they're trying to parse the team things and there a lot of people out there who don't understand those distinctions i don't understand those differences and speaker ryan has tried to kind of
say well i've you these things separately what this is not is an indictment on or institutions of our justice system this family's not indictment of the f b i have an armored justice
it does not impugn the muller investigation or the deputy attorney general
what it is is the congress is legitimate function of oversight to make sure that the pfizer process is being used correctly and that if it wasn't being used correctly that needs to come to light and people need to be held accountable so that we do not have problems and again because this does in fact our civil liberties
and voters who don't know a lot about it will listen to that and will understand that i think that there's also are normal give him the benefit of the out but then there are also counting on lots of people can fleeting it all right and it's important to have some context to this is matt ryan has tried to stay back from this as much as he can except for the fact
he has a close relationship with data nunez they work together on a lot of budget issues they were close on the tax writing ways and means committee
ryan has been a supporter of nunez in the past and so he isn't a very strange position here where he is in charge of the chairman of these committees he could say that this person's to step down as we saw today and democrats minority leader nancy pelosi and leader in the senate chuck schumer are saying that
you know that devon nunez should be out and that's a call that ryan could make and he is in a very tough place but i wonder what do you think about these democrats saying that nunez should be gone you think that means anything i think that it's political signaling but i don't think there's any chance that ryan's going to do it
if democrats lose nothing by calling for for nunez to step aside but as you said ryan has been close with with news for a while and he has signalled ryan has signalled that he is going to back us in this fight he backed them when the director of the f b i and the deputy attorney general rather rosenstein
came up
to push back against requests for documents involved in this investigation and ryan stood behind unison said no you have to provide these and we should mention that last year
newness started the year as the chairman of the house intelligence committee and he was looking into all this and then there was an incident in march where he produced some information that he said well this ought to be adventurous to the white house i'm going to tell them about this and it was related to all of these same manner said we've been talking about and it came to light that he had gotten that information by going to the
white house he got the information from the way things out the information from the white house and then proclaimed that he had obtain this information and said he was going to report on it to the white house all of which caused him to have to step back for a period of time recuse himself from the entire investigation and a lot of people had thought that he was still recused but him cause he has
resurfaced because among people paul ryan decided that that would be okay so the responsibility for devon newness and his role in all this at this point is rather squarely in the speakers and democrats will so that newness never really stepped back because he's still held subpoena power
with the russian investigation he was not running a day to day but he could determine who would come in and who had no and that is something that we heard them talk about a lot let's do after he had been removed and had stepped aside democrats were constantly saying that they firmly believe that nunez was heavily involved and let's just say also devon nunez was on the transition team for president
he is one of the members of congress who is most low i mean there are a lot of people who are in congress who were loyal the present and trump he is very very loyal to present and trump this memo it's not out yet there was some thought that it would be out by now we had sources telling us that it would be out by now
and can just walk through the process this is such a confusing process
as a classified memo
using some sort of arcane the house rule i've never never even knew existed that actually members of the committee will say that they've never used before so what this basically transpired is
the committee voted on this memo on monday to release it to the public that the nona purely part on an purely party line vote that sends it to the white house and the president has five days to either give it a thumbs up thumbs down if he gives it a thumbs down then goes back to the house the coming
can kick it to the full house and a full house can vote on whether to release it basically overrule the president now that looks unlikely to happen because the president and the white house of certainly signal that they are in favor of release him as i'm pretty sure he said one hundred percent that he did indeed he was cut on a on a hot mike
said the union same at one of our editor said what did he say that they ship has sailed off the map it most certainly has the i have another question in this is i know smaller potatoes compared to the republican memo but there's a democrat memo apparently as well right like what do we know about that that's an important point the don't cry
prepare to memo to counter essentially rebut all of the points in the republican memo it's about ten pages long they brought it up for a vote on monday in the same meeting where they voted to release the republican memo on a street party line vote it was shut down they are not releasing it to the public right now they are allowing the full house to see it republicans say that they will then
hello a new vote on releasing the democratic memo but what democrats countered by saying is a look what you're allowing happiness to have the republican memo at first that will set the narrative around this question and then a week ten days later the democratic counterpoint to will will come up by that point the republican narrative will be set in
the minds of the american people so a lot of this is really a typical because when a committee issues and report like this we often see and majority report and minority report and then the agency involved gets you issue their own side of things and in this case we're only seeing a majority report and they're there people who are criticizing the process for not providing the full breath
that information and one thing that that people within the legal community m f b r d o j will say is that there is already an inspector general investigation into all of these matters and that is the proper venue for this to be done
unless the reason we're not doing regular word ruin reason we are doing irregular order if you will is because there is a larger met a purpose here and that we are laying the groundwork for the president to justify removing some people from office who he has a problem with and now in pa
possibly include raw rosenstein who appointed robert more to do his investigation is currently the deputy attorney general but he's in charge of that investigation because jeff sessions the attorney general recused himself because he had been part of the trump campaign and it could also include christopher ray who was appointed the of the director
after president trump fired james call me so that's a lot of names i understand and it gets confusing and it's kind of a welter of names but all of these people are in some sense or another
in the cross hairs because they have been at odds with the president and what we see happening now looks to the president's critics as some kind of pretend to being set up for the president to remove all of these people who have been in his mind be doubling in and those critics are not just democrats
the grid
there are there are republican there are lots of people who are very worried about this absolutely and there are a number of people who believe that and paul ryan said earlier this week that rosenstein should remain in the job he should
been doing his work as it needs to be done and he should be left alone
so the top of this we i sort of joked about hash tag released the memo
but is that part of this story
yes
there are certainly groups that monitor online activities by russian bought one is called the alliance for securing democracy which is based in dc and they say that russian bought have been pushing the hash tag release the memo campaign
he's helped drive the conversation on line certainly hasn't been the only thing driving this conversation i mean i a lot of coverage on rattling media sean hannity has been pushing that's pretty hard as i understand that but yes but it's also been a conversation that spent on c n n m s n b c
kind of consumed washington over the past two weeks but yes the russian boats have played into this and you know that
not the first time that they've kind of pushed a conversation along in the us political room end again it's kind of wild that this is all our maybe it's not wild at all it's very partisan this has turned into something of a partisan food side which it leads to all of them you know the usual like well he said
and then he said and then it's just a big money mess and everybody is talking about what did the f b i do wrong
and this is why it's been very effective for republicans to bring this memo to the public which is it one we're not talking about mothers investigation or talking about a legit possible abuses by the f b i and the justice department in the russia investigation
and also kind of laying the foundations for sewing doubts raising questions about any conclusions that special counsel covered mother may come to in the russian investigation and any conclusions that the congressional committees may come to in their investigations and this does not happen in a vacuum
president trump four months literally months has been beating up on the intelligence community beating up on the f b i and calling all russia investigations a great big hoax and which are one of our human players needs to leave the studio and go keep reporting so ryan lucas
thank you for being with this thank you for having me always a pleasure goodbye
we will miss you got a good work
and in the meantime we will be right back to talk about congress and stuff

this is ken jennings from jeopardy this is john rocker from the ban the long winters twice a week we're adding a new entry to the omnibus a time capsule for the future when we preserve fascinating stories from my we don't wait for the apocalypse checkout omnibus today
we are back it has been two days since the state of the union it was relatively quiet two days on twitter from present and trump until this morning and although the state of the union address was billed as this thing that was going to create unity and bipartisanship moving forward
it seems pretty clear at this point that weather was the intended result or not it is certainly not what actually happened and what has resulted today president trump is speaking at the annual retreat of congressional republicans and this is what he said about democrats and when i made that statement the other night
there was zero movement from the democrats they set their stone cold no smile no applause you would have thought that on that when they would have sort of at least clapped a little bit
which tells you perhaps they'd rather not do well that's your country do great and that's not good that's not good
we have to change that was a direct attack on democrats essentially saying like they don't love america because they hate me and were how are we going to get anywhere
and the reality is that this is a potential problem given some things that are on the calendar ray chelsea he out so just for some calendar awareness we are in a extraordinarily messy moment we are between a government shutdown and a deadline to keep the government open again and congress is scheduled to be
in session for two days before that deadline happens to and a half if we're being generous oh my god i don't even realize we do not have a spending bill released yet
we expect that republicans are going to ask for a spending bill that will go through the end of march democrat i talk to you say they don't support that and will not vote for it they have not voted for the previous several short term spending bills this would be the fifth short term spending bill since president trump picking yes there are conservatives who really don't like this
idea people whose to we call them defense hawks are military hoc say this is extraordinarily bad for the military because they can't make long term investment on short term spending bills and there is just disagreement chaos and a sense that nobody has a map and two well and to two
just sort of give more evidence of trump saying these things about democrats and calendar awareness he treated this morning march fifth is rapidly approaching and the democrats are doing nothing about dhaka they resist blame complain and obstruct and do nothing start pushing nancy pelosi and the dams to work out a doc affects all caps now exclamation we are wrangling at least five different
narratives on every important deadline facing us that as a spending bill that is darker and that also includes the debt limit is coming up in february now those alone would be really difficult things to handle but they need to do all of them in a very short amount of time and i have never i've been covering congress for about eight years which is not the longest time in the world
but i've seen varying levels of agreement and disagreement and i don't think even including the tea party came in i don't think i have seen this much disorganization and distrust and the greatest cities in a sense of the dead limit because while we have not talked about it very much and it has a headache of the topic
it has been accelerated as a deadline and this is when they can't keep pushing off it was in april when it was going to be late march now it looks like early march may even be february because hey the tax cuts mean less revenue especially from corporate tax revenues so as a result we're going to bang up against that that limit and all the extraordinary measures treasury is taking now
our going to be unveiling in a matter of a few weeks for all of our pod cast listeners who have not been following every twist and turn of congress for the past five years
the debt limit the debt limit is a recurring problem it is and it is also becoming one of those very familiar arguments where we talk about each side having their own fact now the can we do explain what the heck it gatlin it is that's part of where the everybody's on facts come from is that the debt limit is allows the government to keep
on borrowing money to pay for every day operations now some sometimes you'll hear and republicans particularly those who oppose increasing the debt limit saying that you don't want to give somebody a credit card this doesn't have anything to do with knew that this is this is just dealing with the finances met him
already occurred and now this is incredibly important because if it is not handled there's a good chance that credit rating agencies were downgrade the value of us bonds and that could be very destabilizing to the us economy right what's scary i mean first of all what's scary is what we could imagine could happen and what is also scary is what we can't imagine will
happened because we can't imagine it and i have flirted with this before us and in twenty eleven the us got its first sovereign debt downgrade and fortunately no chaos happened but good heavens it's not a thing we want to experiment with and actually into any eleven there was a fair amount of damage done yet the mortgage for quite a god
and it was the worst year of the markets have had a number of years certain missions two thousand and eight and there it was largely a consequence of that particular failure in washington and to deal with the debt limit and perception in the markets that things were coming unglued
the lovely fell apart
that is true but this time we're at the very very top of a very frothy choppy looking market yes where we're setting new records every day where the dow jones out of the thousand points in two weeks and our major disruption such as the limit could be the occasion for the sell off that a lot of people think has to come sooner or later so for all those people who think
that we now have markets that only go up that's one of those opportunities to learn better there is a lot of anxiety and every phone call that i had made today has been met with somebody who is nervous anxious and has no answer her what's gonna happen next and i'm talking people on republicans democrats house senate there is just a sense that told
know what's coming and that's pretty scary i think for a lot of people on the hill who are used to having some level of understanding about you know yes we run into deadlines but we get things done and that's not always clear anymore
and yet in the midst of all that what is our main focus in washington right now it's a four page memo
people haven't seen yet and that they might not see and that might be completely bogus but that's what we're all focused on and that seems to be with the white house is obsessed with as well as one more way of just stressing how important the debt limit is despite the fact that it could get buried under all of this other and sanity it's just the fact that like global credit markets like one of the
the underlying assumptions is that the you ask pays his debts and it is like that is that is the assumption exactly like that this could be like this could be very very bad it's like that discussion in ghostbusters of crossing that you know out he would want to get into that because that's making a native sale in are you talking about this day facto slip up marshmallow man are you
history crossing the streams i thought that it was very bad that's too silly like really i like this could be so bad
if we smash through the debt ceiling is what i'm trying to be clear we are not hearing anybody say they that there's a chance that they think rows of chance that we will not increase the data limit what we're saying is that they don't have a plan for how to address it and it is rapidly approaching it is possible congress has proven time and again that they can see a rapidly approaching deadline cobbled to go
either a quick solution and move on but as it stands right now on thursday february first we don't have a plan well i suspect we will talk about that a lot more in the weeks ahead one just side note end it was a pretty significant side note is that on the way to this republican retreat in west virginia
yeah a bunch of republican lawmakers were riding on a train i think was like a turn around your isn't as a chartered amtrak there are at this retreat in a white silver springs west virginia
at the green briar resort it's part of every single year both democrats and republicans leave washington for three or four days and they have what they call on issues conference or a policy or tree so they can go through and talk about the year ahead so republicans were headed out to their is when they're trained struck a garbage truck that was obstructing the tracks and one of the people
who was on the truck passed away
it as a result of that that accident there were several more injury as though it appears that some people have been released from the hospital at this point in it was a pretty gruesome scene and it's another case in such a weird twelve months of republican lawmakers all of a sudden finding themselves in the middle of like a trauma see
trying to rescue people are help people senator jeff flake who was also on the scene for the shooting at the baseball practice our last year last year yeah
last year
he had to help then written be one of the first responders in that situation and he again stepped in and was with helping out with this situation there are multiple doctors among the delegation that was on that
and they were involved now
alright so speaking of just like people who are retiring has we got news yesterday right around the time that all of this was happening that a republican congressmen who his name will sound very familiar to a lot of people trade gatti from south carolina he led to the congressional investigation and
been god see the last investigation and bengals you several yeah so he is retiring
and you just add his name to the list stray yeah he's retiring and says he's going back to judicial work with don't know what that means right now there's a lot of speculation
former prosecutor is a former prosecutor he reportedly turn down a job offer from the white house
but yeah we don't know exactly where he's going but he makes number thirty for the thirty fourth republican in the house to decide not to run again that is a record breaking number wait so so what does that mean like as a lady who doesn't cover congress
and some of them had like pretty significant job yes hi so gowdy is unlike a lot of the other chairman who were terminated so republican rules make it so that people can only serve as chairman of committees for short amount of time and by and large one of the only ways to have influence in congress is to be the chairman of the committee
or to be rising towards that now it's it's not uncommon for people to retire once their term women as up as chair but many of these people are retiring without that been the case and most most significant among them would be rotten newsreel inclusion who is the chairman of the house appropriations committee some would say the
prime committee chairmanship of all and perhaps one of the six most important people in congress and he just decided that he had had enough that he was going to leave the seat that he had that his father before him from own suburban new jersey outside of new york city area and he did this with four years left
run as chairman of the most powerful committee in the house in his case it might have something to do with the difficulty of being reelected but in many of these germans cases they would probably be pretty safe to be reelected in november and also critically involved in keeping the government open and funded like that that is the committee that is involved with all of these
spending bill correct one thing i want to add is so our own just taylor has been tracking these retirements and i am looking right now at a table she has made of all of them while i'm thing that stands out here is the overwhelming majority of these seats where are these people are retiring or you know running for senate or doing whatever
leaving the house the overwhelming majority are republican bleeding yes i'm looking at this one is democrat leaning two or even the rest are varying shades of red but there are varying shades of red and states there are varying shades of purple okay and that's an important thing here is that so to answer your earlier question i would say a couple of take always hear things that we should
remember one were thinking about this one i talked to a lot of republicans for a piece couple of weeks ago when this trend was kind of starting about why they were leaving why they thought this was happening one answer is it to them it felt a lot like earlier elections particularly two thousand and six where they had a really bad year where they were beat up on the campaign
trail and then people lost and there are a lot of people who don't want to go through a terrible bruising campaign or a really bad primary and then lose it's a lot of work and it isn't fun or to just end up when after all that and wind up in the minority pretend right edge is also not fun know what being in the minority particularly in the
house is not a fun game
personally have you been very recently in the majority and you are still tumbling down her and there are a number of republicans in the house who do not know what it is like to be in the minority
and there's a real reality check that kind of happens when you have to decide whether you're not go whether or not you're going to run for office again is to look at the prospects for your power because at the end the day in washington power matters that's why people go to washington is to serve it is to get their point across but you can't get your point across
last pass bills and do anything without some power but the part of this i think a take away why this matters is that republicans are nervous and that's something that we should be thinking like that is going to come into play here particularly republicans and the suburbs there is a lot of concerned that there are voters who are just not going to
show up people who are disillusioned people who are not happy with the direction the country is going people who didn't get what they wanted out of this president and in the midterm election after a new president comes into office it is not uncommon for the president's party to lose seats but in this case in particular there is concern
that the president has been so divisive that there could be a pretty dramatic wave and people are nervous as long as we're talking about retirements there's one we would be remiss not mentioning janet yellen fed share had not a member of god not a member of congress pointedly not political that's kind of the job of the fed chair jan
yellen her last day as fed chair is tomorrow friday and it's just something that is worth mentioning one in part because she is arguably
i don't even know if it would be arguable one of the most powerful women ever and i do mean ever like she is in charge of monetary policy in the global economic superpower end the fed chair actually has a lot more power of the economy than say the president of the united states or anyone oh right right
slowly and part of why it's easy to not think about that is because part of what the fed chairs job is to be is to is to not rattle people and just blend into the wallpaper
one and she has had to do that while having the really remarkably difficult job of starting the long process of unwinding these extraordinary measures that the central bank had to undertake posts recession you know multiple rounds of quantitative easing a huge balance sheet it was an unenviable job and your own power
the whole take over after her is going to have to continue that we're going to take one more quick break and when we come back can't let it go

is this to prevent that sounds discounts and zero on it has to do with spotting disease it will scan cows faces then determine a baseline of typical behavior and there they have perfected facial recognition software for camps and immediately
we're like mad cow looking to see if they look mad for any this was it in cargo announced wednesday that is partnering with an irish company that does computer vision company to plot face recognition

oh rod
run my can't you let go of i'm going to go back to politics if you don't mind the state of the union this year which in many respects and in many people's minds was quite successful the president put out that he was going to call for unity and most of the newspaper headlines and money of the guy runs you saw and told me and said president calls for unity but
i believe this is probably going to go down in history as a monumental missed opportunity for the president in terms of just exactly that because while we did get a lot of headlines that use the word unity
many opportunities to create unity in the speech
we're not taken the president could have come out with something concrete about immigration but instead renewed all of the grinding away at the angriest elements of the immigration debate so there were many opportunities he might even have tried to diffuse some of the tension around the mall or investigation
not that that would necessarily have worked but it would have been atmosphere buckley unifying so there really were not a lot of unifying moments real outreach substitute moments in that speech
so he missed an opportunity or a that was a downer
sorry
no no no that's i mean i mean it wasn't an upper like bovine facial that
it's good contacts but like our air danielle what can you know like i i want to talk to you about heroes today to talk to you about a great american hero that walks among us and his name is scott horsley the i really need new year's super human oh oh no you don't know the depths of it

i'm not saying that strip clubs are inherently funny know what's funny is scott horsley these magnificent delivery of the story has everything it involve the police sergeant named and paradise
who was in charge of policing the paradise wow no but he was in charge of licensing which meant of course he got to deliver the line would be dancers have to see paradise before customers get to see them
had so you get these the you get the seat of these dances at a class where a very matter of fact policeman is in front of the though
