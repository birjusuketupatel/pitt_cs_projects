
this is totally and i'm here with my mom gail he's helping me move to california were passing through sewer nebraska also known as fourth of july city years
this pod cast was recorded at the nice monde help you move its one twenty seven eastern on tuesday july third things may have changed both i mean hear this
here's the show
hey there it's the politics park asked here with a round up of this week stories and yes that's right you're not wrong it is tuesday but we're putting this out before the holidays so you can hear it on road trips and your plane rides and maybe to pre game the fireworks i'm scott tetra cover congress and that's my family and
cover national politics a nicer asked i covered the white house and i'm more alliance and national political correspondent a lot to talk about and we're going to pick up where we left off and that is this big swing vote opening on the supreme court we're also going to get into why a lot of progressive democrats are calling louder and louder voice is for the up
polish meant of the immigration and customs enforcement agency and with so many of the mid term primaries in the rearview we're going to take a few minutes and take stock of what we've learned about both the democratic and republican party so far you guys ready yet ready all right so let's start asia it's hasn't even been a week since just as anthony kennedy
he announced his retirement the white house is moving very fast to fill that was the latest yes so president trump said yesterday that he met with for candidates to feel kennedy's see and we also learned that yesterday he spoke by phone with mightily the republican senator from utah the convent
wisdom as the center really is not a top candidate he only got a phone call but trumpeted meet with four people in person so they are a lot of meetings and they say they're looking for someone with the intellect and the temperament and qualifications who will uphold the law and the constitution of course the question is what does that actually mean yeah
who are these people what do we know about them so one of the people is brett cavanaugh he serves on the us court of appeals for the dc circuit and prior life actually sat in awesome of his hearings on like environmental law the thing about him is that he did help right the nine hundred ninety eight star report to congress that he doesn't
remember that that can have helped lead to the impeachment of bill clinton an independent counsel and us to getting the president that would be an interesting truth
so i so he can a known for that partially one of the interesting things about bread cabin is he came to the conclusion after his experience in the special counsel investigation of bill clinton that presidents should not be distracted by these kinds of investigation so there's a thought that
maybe he would vote if it came before him in favor of the president not being indicted or not being subpoenaed or basically to protect the office of the presidency
and that might be one of the reasons that some people feel that he shouldn't be nominated another person that he met with was a beard she wasn't notre dame professor she's nasa's on the us court of appeals for seventh circuit she was nominated by president trumps so she just kind of got on the bench and it was a little bit controversial
nomination process her own she got questioned a bit about her christian faith some people raise concerns about whether she could separate her christian faith from her decisions on the court
so now and she also wants clerk for antonin scalia and she is actually a wife and mother of seven that's pretty impressive very impressive
another person that the president interviewed was a mall for par he's an appeals court judge on the sixth circuit which covers ohio michigan kentucky and tennessee the most important stayed on that list as kentucky because he's a favorite of senate majority leader mitch mcconnell he is the conventional wisdom is that that's why he's on the list he is not necessarily a top pick some
buddy else that the president met with was roman catholic church also of the sixth circuit he's fifty one years old young guy and a lot of conservatives think that he would be an original list in the tradition of antonin scalia and one of the things that all of these potential nominees haven't come
man is that they satisfy conservatives criteria for people that would probably vote to undermine or overturn roe and this was one of the president's clearest commitments in the campaign he said if he gets elected he'll probably have to or even more openings on the court
phil turns out he's been correct and he said that when that happens row will be returned to the states and asked my want to ask you about that because that's obviously hanging over everything here because anthony kennedy even though he was really conservative was repeatedly a vote to keep roe v wade on the books to not undermine abortion rights
and obviously this is a really emotional and personal topic for people on both sides deeply held views there's an annual march where thousands and thousands of people come to washington dc every year to urge the supreme court overturn roe v wade but a couple of paul's came out over the last week that really shed some light on what the brain
down is when it comes to how many people want to see it overturned verse upheld yeah scott generally speaking in the public if we look at some pulling down by the kaiser family foundation that was before justice kennedy's announcement retirement announcement was made and then also by quinney piano and they pulled after that announcement we see pulling of the public that
looks pretty similar you see about to buy a two to one margin most americans say they would support upholding row so i mean within that you can parse out the numbers and you'll see that there is far more agreement among democrats and at the bottom of the less if you look at all the breakdown of demographics republicans are at the bottom right so i mean you
i think there's about thirty six percent of republicans who would support base and eighty four percent of democrats to huge partisan divide but what i find interesting is when you look at the overall public this is something that is now generally accepted no more in though people are pretty split on abortion itself you know do you favor it or not they are
really overwhelmingly support of this law that's been on the books since nineteen seventy three is that one reason why mara you mentioned president trump campaigning for office saying it will be automatically overturn once he had a couple pigs but over the last week the white house said we're not really talking about that just yeah no no no we're not doing a case by case
litmus test with our nominees they've really started to downplay that idea is that because there were going to these samples and they know that how that would go over of that became write the story was about and these nominees are not going to answer questions about how they stand on road that's a time honored tradition from both nominees
who were put up by democrats or republicans they don't like to talk about how they would roll rules specifically but donald trump was the most explicit on this have any presidential candidate that i can remember where he said flat out because he had something to prove he had to prove to the social issue right evangelicals and conservatives that he was one
of them and then he would enact their agenda so he went pretty far out on a limb to say you will like me i will appoint supreme court justices who will overturn roe and return these decisions about abortion to the street smart yeah so how would that even be sending that's determined because to your point there isn't really this litmus test and we saw
when supreme court justice course which when he was appointed in this question was brought up to him didn't he say that he would have walked out of the door if had asked him yes but he doesn't have to ask him because this list was created by the federalist society who knows
deeply and intimately every single thing about these people's thinking and jurisprudence nobody would be on that list vetted and approved by the federalist society if they weren't considered to be a reliable vote against road that doesn't mean that they overturned it in one fell swoop
that they'd start chipping away at it the right has been burned before republican presidents have put people on the court that did not turn out to be as conservative as their supporters hoped they're not going to let that happen again that's one of the reasons that the federalist society has been cultivating and promoting these law professor
answers and judges for their entire careers and so the the president doesn't have to ask someone point blank would you vote against row what's the timeline going forward when do we get this pic in what happens over the coming days so he is going to meet with some more people and then on monday he is expected to make his announcement of
who he has chosen and the white house said that they can move fast because as mine said they've had this less for for fruit since the campaign even though they've added some names to it so is this guy does any of the opposition know that we've been hearing from some members of congress that they would not necessarily support a justice and
the issue of roe vs wade is that just an entirely new talking point then begins tomorrow as point these just judges have largely been already voted on this issue yeah i think a lot of the votes are already pretty predictable susan davis our colleague who covers congress had a good story this morning saying in the end you're probably really need to focus on just five
senators to get a sense of what's going to happen here and that's to republican women who support abortion rights lisa murkowski of alaska susan collins of main you may be thinking they sound familiar yes these were the same key republican swing vote when it came to whether or not obama care was going to be overturned the internet blocking along
john mccain three democrats to pay attention to our the three democrats who voted for neil gossage last year had a high camp and north dakota joe mention of west virginia joe donnelly of indiana all three happened to be up for reelection next year so they're going to get a lot of pressure in their states so those are the lawmakers to folk
hassan right and also but what's interesting is most democrats feel that the president won't lose any republican votes and when you hear susan collins kind of tortured interviews on this were for she says i won't vote for anyone who would overturn roe vs wade than later she said i don't want to vote for someone who demonstrates hostility to reverse this way and so
the big question i think is the three democrats how much pressure do they feel in their own states devote with the president thereby by breaking with the democratic base who does care about this nomination more than they were cared about any recent supreme court nomination or do they stick with their base
vote against the president who's very popular in their state all right we're going to shift gears here and talk about that other big thing in the news over the last few weeks and that is of course immigration i want to talk for a few minutes about a slogan that's been pumping up more and more recently you may have seen it on protesters signed her or heard senators like elizabeth warren and purist and jeweler brand
talking about it and that's the idea of abolishing ice abolishing the immigration and customs enforcement agency quick recap what exactly is what do they do because one of the push tax has been you're focusing on the wrong agency guys ice does two things it tries to go after drug runners people who do
human trafficking
money laundering bad the crime across the borders but it also is charged with deporting undocumented immigrants in other words it does not police the border and it doesn't separate families those are other agencies that do those things sort of the border patrol border patrol h as right
this was created after nine eleven correct correct who it was largely an edifice and it was created in the argument is much the same way the patriot act these were sort of the vestiges right after nine eleven i mentioned this popping a more and more recently for from democrats alexandria kazuo cortez was campaigning on this idea lot in new york she actually and campaign
the border in the final days of their other race leaving the district to drive home the point how important it was for her campaign seeing it other places too
the white house seems to love this they're very aggressively pointing it out in very aggressively trying to pin democrats to this viewpoint whether or not they actually take a guess this is in line with his idea the immigration is a good issue for republicans so what he's trying to do as he's trying to say all luck
democrats are for abolish eyes and the next they're going to be for getting rid of police officers in general so his interpretation is that old they're against law and order but we republicans we like law and order so he feels like this is a winning arguments for a ham and if he can pin that
scratch than that will weigh them down during midterms small with all the voters you talk to do you get a sense of i mean there's this divide that the president trump think this is the greatest thing republicans can focus on and a lot of these republicans running in the suburban districts are saying like you know let's let's talk about the economy you have a sense of the pros and cons of making
this the centerpiece i mean it certainly plays well in certain districts like the new york fourteen three and these are largely democratic districts but no dad i recall going to some places where president term do really well in two thousand and sixteen and i have heard from voters who felt particularly frustrated by the democrats focus on immigration so i do
you think it's kind of a case by case situation what i know have found fascinating sky is the degree to which this idea that you could argue is sort of a fringe idea maybe even just three weeks ago has now become far more popular and you're hearing other democrats talk about this and in pressure down it were to yeah exactly because i don't
recall cure in july brand actually even being so left on immigration before so it's actually just phenomenal to see this sort of pressure being exerted on democrats to become my what are you more progressive and immigration know what i think is interesting as watching the pressure be resisted and there are a lot of democrats who say just one we had the republicans on the
run on immigration just one we had the republican party split on the family separations policy on the dreamer policy when we looked at polls and showed big majority of people agreeing with us on immigration been a good thing in general dreamer should have a path to citizenship family separation policy is is wrong and offensive why should we get all
tangled up with talking about abolishing a agency that doesn't even do
the things that we don't the things we don't like most but but bulging eyes became a simple bumper sticker slogan kind of like build the wall or abolish the i r s that basically express democrats anger at trumps immigration policies in general
people will feel like democrats need to go bigger and they need to stop being cautious in their wordy and then you've seen with president trump that he leaned into some ideas that seem really out there but that played well with his and so then maybe democrats need to lean into some ideas that
maybe don't fit the standard messaging but that can get their base really motivated to get out there all the stuff applies to so many things beyond immigration and the fact we're going to talk all about that getting into detention points in both parties and where the parties are now that most of the primaries are behind us that's coming up next first were going
take a quick break
support for in politics and the following message come from rugged mortgage by quicken loans rocket mortgage give you confidence when it comes to buying a home or refinance in your existing home rocket mortgage is simple allowing you to fully understand all the details and be confident you're getting the right mortgage to get started go to
rocket mortgage dot com slash npr politics equal housing linder license in all fifty states in l s consumer access dot org number thirty thirty ever get to friday look back on the week and to yourself what just happened
i'm sam sam to come up i cast bynum where every friday we catch up on the news and the culture of the week and try to make sense of it all listen on the npr one app for wherever you get your pod cast
and we are back in some primary still to come by and large most of the primaries are now behind us and it's going to be a little while before the next wave of races so we all decided that it would be a good time to hit reset and analyze where the two parties are right now asked my you spend a lot of time looking
the republicans yeah and scott you've spent a lifetime looking at democrats right looking both elected officials and we're the pull of the party is and why don't we start with you because i'm actually really curious to see if we actually are seeing a national poll to the left in the democratic party that some people are talking about under the new york fourteen
yeah yeah chelsea snow and i spent a couple months just every time we were out reporting on one story we we would talk to people about this big picture story as well and put that all together this week
it's interesting because it's a dual track situation like there's no question that nationally the democratic party is being pulled to the left you know that it's got like how do you define that one thing that i keep pointing to because i think it says a lot is that when bernie sanders unveiled the latest version of his bills to introduce a medicare for all single
their healthcare system last year every single person who's probably going to run for president as a democrat in two thousand and twenty in the senate cosponsor sponsored that bill elizabeth warren purist and jeweler brand cory booker karma harris and that was such an outlier even just a few years ago and bernie sanders was running for the democratic nomination but this time around
democrats can't see a path to the presidential nomination unless they're on board with this big picture single payer government plan so that's just one example let's not progressive really haven't been winning in alive democratic primaries they're sort of the exception to the rule when we do see them away and yeah i mean there have been some big examples of that but
but by my by and large like you said they are the exceptions and that's where this dual track comes in because especially if you look at the key races that are going to decide whether republicans or democrats control the house or senate next year by and large it's the moderates winning those races it's the it's the candidates running and platforms of governing and inclusive
in reaching out to independence the exact stuff that that a lot of progressives dismisses republican lite that's the track record at winning in these key suburban races they're trying to flip and it's and look this is really really good reporting and the interesting thing is because the highest profile progressive when and
democrat district fourteen in new york came recently she was a giant killer because she knocked off a member of the leadership and because she's this very compelling attractive young latina and she kind of embodies all of the turmoil inside the democratic party age gender ethnicity it and she got so much pubs
the city and such a big platform after she won it made you think wow progressives democratic socialists are taking over the democratic party when in fact when you look at all these races that's just not true the democratic party still more diverse ideologically and racially and it's still more united around big things despite all this diversity than the republicans are in other words it's for
or some kind of universal healthcare minimum wage it's pro immigrant and that's what's so interesting about this it seems like there's a lot of turmoil and there is huge generational fights but it's a diverse party that's relatively unified ideologically an asp of the one example that i think really jumped out to calcium mean the most
where did this obviously most of the focus is on the house of representatives because that's that's the one that could flip but he actually if you look at the senate democratic primaries that's what's interesting is you have this whole group of really conservative or moderate democrats running and states where they have to play defense states that donald trump one by large margins none of them got a serious
primary challenge job managing job donnelly and heidi high camp or vote for neil gossage they don't get a primary challenge claire mccaskill regularly dismisses medicare for all know primary challenge bob casey at times vote against abortion rights no primary challenge the party leaders said we need to be pragmatic about this we need
no with people who can win the states and the progressive wing actually fell in month yeah that that that really belies this kind of meth or story line that the the democratic party although the energy is on the left and i think we're going to see much more of this in the two thousand and twenty fight for the nomination for president but for the most part democrats have the huge to kind of the first commandment
of politics which is you've got to nominate someone who can win their district or state the idea of a question about how you govern scott rate because you're talking about the idea that the energy is on the left that we're hearing policy platforms
that are calling for medicare for all and yet you're describing a situation in which case after case democrats are opting for these more pragmatic people there doesn't seem to mesh with what you're describing a base want and then what does that mean for how you actually eventually govern they're trying to get in line to be in opposition party right now they're nothing they're going to be providing a check and bad
once to donald trump
we can have this discussion about governing only get to two thousand and twenty but right now they're just trying to be an effective opposition party which means you try to win one house or both of congress and i think nancy pelosi would love to have that problem every time this comes up her answer is just when baby we just need to win this race
and in president trump speaking of nancy pelosi that he even though a lot of these candidates are actually moderates who as you said are winnie president trump really wants to talk about nancy pelosi maxine waters he wants them to be the face of the democratic party he wants to say that these people are very
dream and out there and so that's why you should put democrats back in charge so let's let's talk about your reporting now because a lot of the democratic confidence is based on the premise that voters are getting tired of president trump and mirror some weakness especially in the suburban districts with high income higher education
voters may have voted republican for decades they feel like there's an opening their did you see any evidence of this this weakness among republicans what the president so if the question is right about the weekend within the president's base i'm not seeing that i spent the past couple of months like he's got you know going out around the country specifically i would talk
voters that made up kind of key constituencies of the president space so we're talking about evangelicals veterans white working class main and your kind of traditional establishment country club republicans among all of those people and i spoke to about fifty sixty republicans only one woman told me that she regretted voting for president trip
one hour and fifty yeah the rest of them told me that if they had been perhaps lukewarm on the president they now support him even more and it's got that in sync with polling we've seen we are seeing that the president has roughly and ninety percent approval rating among republicans and that's phenomenally strong okay so you said you talk to more than fifty vote
voters here were there any different groups you ended up sorting all these voters into yet right so we look specifically hunting veterans white working class main country club the republicans and evangelicals and what i found really interesting is that their interest mean are always a line but most everyone spoke to me about a little treat
they feel the president given them and those were different rates when i was in say the sixth district in georgia which is a very highly educated area i heard a lot about the tax cuts when i was in ohio i heard a lot about tariffs when i was in other parts of the country i would hear a lot say with veterans in west virginia i heard about just some of the prestige that they felt the president
giving to veterans in the form say of the veterans' day parade and now is a common theme i will say even though not all of these planks you could say if his coalition have the same interest there is a very common feeling they have of being a victim of being marginalized and they all point similarly to the fact that the media does not
give him any do credit they feel that the president has done good things they pointed the tax cuts they point to the relationship or the negotiations with north korea and they say that look if this was a democrat the media would be treating this entire situation differently and scott that's what i found remarkable is that that's not a sentiment i hear from you know
just as die hard supporters that something i heard from even some folks who would have say that they were lukewarm supporters of the crazy
not so his bases does definitely seemed to be i guess among republicans growing and kind of solidify but does how does that translate in mid terms because isn't that isn't their question of whether they will actually get out and vote because trump is not on the ticket so is he gonna be like
are they enthusiastic enough that they feel like they me to go out and vote for these republicans who are not donald trump that is an excellent question i don't know i mean there were some people who told me they were not sure if they were going to vote but i can say the amount of times that they would tell me they were so enthusiastic about voting for another term for president europe so that is a question i just don't know the answer to
martyrs any of the surprise you know actually we live in such a tribal moment and the media is so divided and most people who consume conservative media are told over and over how elites look down on them and their disrespected and donald trump has this whole kind of grievance the ideology of grievance so it doesn't really surprise me
the one thing that i would watch for and i'm really curious about is when donald trump said i can stand on fifth avenue and shoot someone i would lose any voters what i want to know is could stand in a soybean field and undermine of farmers livelihood and still not lose that guy's support
translator and they have to translate that metaphor to us to the farm belt which is total trump country and just burn it him
when there were they forgive him because what we've heard is that these farmers are losing like ten twelve fifteen percent of their livelihood because of the tariffs well they say look he's just trying his hardest in the right place i'll take the hit for donald trump or will have to press their enthusiasm for coming out and voting for a republican won't vote we saw a sneak preview of that with harley davidson
huge company in pennsylvania and wisconsin too important states for tromp you went around to just blamed harley he said you're looking for you to excuse this is your fault not my policies this is harley davidson his fault but i guess if there's not an obvious villain like harley davidson when you're talking about broader agricultural markets that might be harder it might be harder and also
i don't know what those attacks on a harley davidson have gotten him in other words it certainly hasn't changed harley davidson's behavior they already made motorcycles in different parts of the world before donald trump was elected into barnes point the big question is the folks who work in factories and manufacture harley davidson motorcycles you know whose side will they take the president
or their companies are well we've been talking about big picture looks or the republican party that asked my own and a big picture look at the democratic party that kelsey snow and i wrote both those doors will be online soon it and their politics dot org we're going to take one more quick break and come back with the one thing we just can't let go of this week politics or non politics

just wait or higher
and we are back and we're going to end the show like we do every week with the one thing we can't let go politics or otherwise
europe first this league something happened that i just found so fascinating in france there's this guy this gangster read one i believe and he was in he was in jail supposed to be in prison for twenty five years but he escaped and it was like a helicopter
escape in real life in real life so i got was fake but then i lifted up this recently have been so apparently it was this elaborate scheme where the these gangsters working with to break out fried that they hijacked a helicopter from a training school they flew
fluid in on the one part of the prison who didn't have the anti aircraft knitting they use smoke bombs and then these i cut that to cut through were five he just happened to be visiting with his brother and the visitors section and they had like guns but they didn't shoot me batty and the prisoners were like clapping as fuck
he went away and got on the helicopter flew off and he's like there's a massive manhunt for him now i don't i don't know what he did they can't not root for him once they start well so he's accused is obviously he's been in the game for very long time he's like done bank highest and all this stuff so you so use in prison for something serious i probably shouldn't root for yeah
yeah years i think i think is escaped before i think he has he said yes to this is not as far as escape the other escape he likes snuck in explosives or something but he did say so he says that he was inspired by hollywood i'd heist movies and like michael mann yeah heat and that
he's also inspired by scarface okay gone back a while
i'm going on at work and that's a little bit of the beginning of air force one in the cisco systems same so i have theories on this that i won't get into for for legal reasons
i think that of crazy that this man was able to like given the helicopter and fly away and he still on the run and redirect the helicopter know love that he they landed the helicopter burned on the size than they like hijacked my door like stole two cars they've abandoned those images on the run he did break out before
like years ago and he was on the run for maybe like six weeks before he got caught again so we'll see what happens but is pretty crazy and this is why mounted police commissioner because i'm sarah
you put in the
know you can pull that off
it's it's pretty impressive mara
can't let it go this week is about amy barrett who we talked about earlier in the show is one of the people that trump is considering for a supreme court seed and what i can't let go is that she and her husband were the members of a group called people of praise
mostly catholics and as part of this group it's a
devotional group people swear a lifelong of loyalty called a covenant to one another but what i can't go is that they are assigned a personal adviser and those advisors if they're men are called heads but the female advisers are called ham fades
what i'm imagining in the image i can't get out of my head is that if she is nominated and there are hearings you're going to see a lot of protesters in red capes and white pundits milling around in the back of the hearing because of the because of handmade his tail yeah i think that this is just a
piece of trivia about a potential nominee that's made for this moment so i'm going to go to next it's a holiday coming up a holiday there about traditions and sometimes you have organic traditions that have been going on for a long time and sometimes you have to force their tradition and kind of making a thing and that's what i'm doing right here morning edition morning edition
as a wonderful annual tradition of the reading of the declaration of independence and a couple of years ago i thought we should have our own tradition here on the part of a reading of an equally important independence day document and that document i don't think any of you have been around for this and the previous years where i have forced the song have anybody to that document is
the climactic speech from the nineteen ninety six film independence day
was president thomas more an area fifty one it is up on the back of a truck and gives it an inspiring speech through a megaphone and i think we should all do guys i have parts for everybody i hear handed out
we're apart
here's your part i got my part asked where you got your back and asked awesome i know we've talked about the millennial generation so yeah cause you support this kind of course i do think break out here who's doing the last part because it's the best who's are you doing as
no i'm that myself
because i started out
everybody ready reading grant
good morning
and less than an hour aircraft from here will join others from around the world and you will be launching largest aerial battle in this history of mankind
mankind
words to have new meaning for all of us today we can't be consumed by our petty differences anymore we will be united in our common interests perhaps it's fate that today is the fourth of july and you will once again be fighting for our freedom not from tyranny of christian persecution from annihilation were fine
adding for our right to live to exist and should we win the day the fourth of july will no longer be known as an american holiday but as the day when the world declared in one voice we will not go quietly into the night we will not vanished without a fight we're going to live on we're going to survive
can all do the in today
one airline
i have not
the third annual rating of thomas whitmore speech
and asthma if you can if you can top that go ahead
what can you or
i cannot lego is legit the fourth of july the declaration of independence but it's a little bit more solemn and a real ra raw patriotic moment for me not nearly as funny as you're a scout you're sending me from within
i don't want to talk about the actual cause know so so what i will say is on july fourth seventeen seventy six you had this decade continental congress who voted to approve the declaration of independence and now all these years later i use think it's i mean that we all take for granted and my family is from so
south asia and india and pakistan were not free they did not declare themselves free from the british empire until nineteen forty seven
so my grandparents were born subjects of the british empire and to me i every fourth of july it is actually my absolute favorite holiday and just sort of blown away by the idea that this simple document
in essence kind of just and hundred us to the british empire
so merry go and every year there's a whole bunch of places i knew that in boston actually the old statehouse balcony they read the independents ally they've been doing this and seventeen seventy six i have never gone before but you will catch me there tomorrow i intend to go and check it out and rely know be you should send pictures i will write and on that into
aspiring note from asthma
that is a rat for today we will be back the next time there a headline a quick note i will actually not be back for a while i'm going to take some time after hanging out with my baby so i look forward to listening to everybody on the pod cast and i'll talk to you again the end of august i'm scott detroit congress and less mccollough political reporter
i'm sure ask the white house and i'm more elias and national political correspondent thank you for listening to the pure politics
