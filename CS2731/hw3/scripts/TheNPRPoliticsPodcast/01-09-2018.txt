traffic choir plane tickets to boise so expensive
i'm of garcia coast of the indicator and every episode we take on a new unexpected idea to help you make sense of the day's news listen and every afternoon on npr one whoever you get your pod casts
hey this is david cohen north attleboro massachusetts where i'm already know the bomb clone this broadcast was recorded at one ten eastern on monday january eight things may have changed by the time you hear that keep up with all of them peers political coverage and pr dot org on the pier one up
and under local public radio station okay here's the show
there it's the npr politics pod cast president trump spent much of that weekend at camp david with other republican leaders they were there to talk about an agenda for two thousand and eighteen but that was not the headline from the weekend instead we're talking about the fact that president trump is in his words a very
a stable genius trumps defense of his mental state that debate to the forefront will talk about that and we will also yes get to some of the other government news that overshadowed i'm scott metro i cover congress friend the are i'm tamer key think over the white house and i'm holding hundred your correspondent good monday to both of you i suppose
i suppose you could say the tam there's a lot of stuff to talk about from camp david but i want to start with the fact that house speaker paul ryan wore a shirt
then he wore a fleece then he wore a blazer over the fleece slot people so i better yet
i have a thought my thought is we know it was cold there we also know that they were supposed to be on a retreat so paul ryan probably thought he could wear retreat close and then all of a sudden he shows up for this avail and everybody's put on their blazers and their ties and stuff and he's like so take the fleece off i'm pro fleece i'm pro casual blazer mix
but you know
my only thing is just zip the least make it a quarter zip any could have gotten away with it but like the the unzip down to your belly button fleece doesn't work by way of actual explanation wisconsin paul ryan he's from wisconsin and people who is going to learn to dress in layers let's get
let's let's table this conversation and i don't even know where to start on the rest of it
tam why what's just start with this why was present and trump feeling the need in tweets and and statements at a press conference to tell us all that he's a very stable genius who went to the best colleges or college we could go on like set the stage for why this was the thing we're talking about right now there are two reasons that this is a thing one
there's this little book they came out on friday that people have been talking about a little bit overweight people have been talking about it nonstop it is called fire in theory it is written by a man named michael waltz there are lots of questions about this book that we can get into later and we've gotten into before but there was a fox news
news fox and friends segment about that book and in particular about parts of the book where wolf calls into question president trumps stability and sort of ability to do the job of president of the united states
quoting as sometimes by name and sometimes not by name members of the trump administration and then this tweet came very quickly after that segment aired on fox and friends and we should say the book fire and fury did bring a lot of this stuff up but this has been a lingering conversation for a while let's go back
this summer when bob quarter republican from tennessee this is one of the first things that quarter said that was really critical of president trump of course he has said many more critical things of president from but this was bob quarter that summer the president has not yet
not yet and then i'm all in demonstrated ability
nor some of the components
he needs to demonstrate in order to be successful stability incompetent so again this is something that that critics especially democratic critics have been increasingly loud about and we should say it's something when it comes to stability and trumps temperament that was a big part of the two thousand and sixteen campaign
but but ron president from made a decision to defend himself on this front and of course when he does that it becomes all we talk about can you walk us through what specifically trump said this weekend let the record reflect that i am reading the verbatim tweak of our president as noted actually throughout my life my two greatest assets have been
mental stability and being like really smart
crooked hillary clinton also played these cards very hard and as everyone knows went down in flames i went from very all caps successful businessman to top tv star to president of the united states on my first try i think that would qualify as not smart but genius and a very
stable genius had that so he says that this is something he goes on to talk about at the press availability he had a camp david
warning or thinking about sure why did you feel the need to tweet about that
college

what
drew decisions
with
hear
new
into the
there's a broader conversation here and that is a lot of people in the political system and and observers saying the present is not mentally stable and that's a problem because he's the commander in chief it's a serious conversation and it just so happens we have someone here at npr who recently wrote an article
called why mental health is a poor measure of a president seems like a good person to talk to you that is john hamilton and science correspondent john thanks for coming to hang out with us my pleasure
hey so you made a lot of good points and that and let's work through them one at a time one is that there is a lot of skepticism in the professional mental health community about the idea of diagnosing someone based on what you see on tv and what you read on your twitter feed the it's absolutely road
more than skepticism it is considered unethical to do armchair diagnoses a public figures in one of the reasons of course is that if you really going to diagnose somebody with a mental illness you need to have sat down with that person and talk to them for a very long time and there's been sort of a long standing tradition of not doing that
but the in the last six months or so it seems like the mental health community some members of the mental health community have said we're making an exception that's exactly right in fact the professions have stayed out of this since barry goldwater back in the sixties and that was because a number of mental
professionals weighed in on his mental status and it ended up in a lawsuit and it was pretty ugly and so ever since then both the american psychological association and the american psychiatric association have had policies that say you won't do this they in you do point out though that aside from those policies being in place this is kind of a
semi regular conversation or arm chair diagnoses are analysis of a lot of different presidents throughout history bill clinton john kennedy you could go on yeah there seems to be a little less hesitant to talk about previous presidents the current ones and indeed
there was somebody did a study a few years ago that looked at all the presidents up until i think it was nineteen seventy four and concluded that that about forty percent of them a little more than that actually had some sort of diagnose mental disorder so this is not necessarily uncommon this is fascinating because there's been a move in american culture and
in medicine to have parity between mental health and physical health and to and to say that mental health challenges are not a disability that it should be treated just like diabetes or other healthcare problems and yet there's this stigma that exists around mental health and politics politics could be said
to be the last bastion of prejudice on this as so many other subjects but but john and iran you make the point that it's a waste of time and it's unethical to try and diagnose someone based on on your news consumption or based on what they post on the internet there's a real argument that using it as
as an insult are concerned he's mentally ill raises a stigma for people in the mental health community but what is the right approach if you're a policymaker if you're in congress which has the job of oversight and you see the president saying things taking actions that take mental health out of it make you question his approach
watched of the job his seriousness of the job the erratic ness of his behavior well i will say that one of the reasons that people bring up mental health is because they're trying to think of some way to explain his behavior which otherwise is so far outside the presidential context we haven't had a president who communicated in this way and so as a result
just takes so many people by surprise including his own staff it looks erratic and that begs an explanation john you talked to a lot of experts about this what's the best way to think about this and talk about this well
lot of the people in mental health professions say is they say why make this about mental health you can have a president who is completely unfit to be in office yet has no diagnose mental health problems so why make this sort of leap for saying that if somehow you could get a panel that decided he had a disorder
you could put a label on that that would somehow qualify to remove him from office and you talked to a lot of experts but you also talk to people in the mental health community who frankly are kind of insulted by the tone of this conversation walk us through their concerns well understandably this kind of talk is is really pretty disturb
being to people who have mental disorders mental illness
because to them it looks like you're saying if you diagnose me that gives you the right to remove me from my job and that's not a message they think is fair or is when they want to have out in public is there a different way to make that same point that that they would suggest instead of the president is mentally ill
i think they'd say is that the twenty fifth amendment goes to fitness it does not talk about whether you have a diagnosis of a mental illness it talks about whether you are fit for office and i think people in the mental health community would like to keep the conversation on do your words and actions show somebody who is fit to be in that office or
or not
john hamilton thank you very much for talking to us about this her a few minutes my pleasure john's a science correspondent on npr and he wrote a story on this exact topic you can find it online it's why mental health is a poor measure of a president definitely worth reading or listening to as as this conversation continues hope you and your at the park
yeah i did with he's and tam tapping into the thousands of hours of your life that you spent following hillary clinton around in two thousand and sixteen which you know what is not last year anymore also realize that in two thousand and sixteen tam you are there for most of the clinton campaign true
jumps approach to governing trumps stability was a big part of her campaign wasn't it yeah in particular as she made the turn from the primary to the general election began main this very much an issue of the campaign had on talking about present in trumps stability
as she did at the democratic convention imagine if you dare imagine imagine him in the oval office facing a real crisis
a man you can pay with a tweet is not a man we can try now play are
and here we are two years later and a week ago president trump tweet it about nuclear exchange is i mean this is exactly what was she was talking about and you can make the argument she made that argument lot of democrats may have that argument then he was elected president within like a week before the election maybe two weeks before the election she actually had
this campaign event where she brought in a man who worked with nuclear weapons who was one of the people who have the president had said it's time to push the button he would have actually made it happen and i mean talk about dark and grin and and laying out the stakes in the clearest way you possibly can and that event
an ohio hillary clinton lost the state of ohio and handily so wrong again what steps can you take if you're someone in a position of power who is worried about this
or do you just have to accept the fact that america voted present interim president he's president for four years and part of president being president is making these decisions
those things are clearly true he is president he is going to be president for four years unless he is impeached there have been quixotic efforts to have some sort of an impeachment road on the floor of the house near not realistic in any sense perhaps if the democratic party were to recapture control of the house in november of that would be a different conversation but
as things stand now that is the only way that someone could actually interfere with the president's authority unless you do hear people talking about the twenty fifth amendment to the constitution it does have a provision whereby the executive branch with the cooperation of the vice president and the president's cabinet could move to
have in some sense or another strain to or a removal even have a sitting president who was deemed by that group of people to be in some sense unfit but that would be of his own cabinet and vice president so tam as is often the case when trump tweets about something when he
he defends himself in an extended way that becomes the focal point of the conversation but he was responding to the claims that came out of his book over the last week that that's what started this latest wave off and in the book michael wolff says that it's a near universal concern among trump advisors but the
fact is we did have a lot of trump cabinet members trump advisors on the air this weekend same they don't actually do it that way and i guess that's what you would expect them to come in
they they certainly whether they were saying it privately or not lake publicly they're going to go out and support the president which they did in a big way new had steven miller who is an adviser talking on cnn about how president trump as a candidate was totally sharp end they'd they'd find out some new
news item and in twenty minutes he'd have
a whole new section of his speech sketched out and deliver it perfectly you had the cia director mike pump hail out on television as well my observation is that
my dealings with the present on some of the most important issues that the president has to face our as professional and they start for as the american people deserve the presence handling these duties in a way that i'm incredibly proud to be part of his team so last point on all of this let's take the mental health issue out of it because we have to
oct just now about the ways that that can be misleading or troubling but let's just talk about president crumbs approach to the job and it's statements i think the fact is that this book and a ton of other reporting that their continued to be more and more questions and more and more blind quote from advisers making their way and the news at least about trumps approach to the job
about the seriousness he takes of the job and about you know the way he spends his day watching tv and treating as opposed to working all the time
what comes next because this seems to keep being wrapped up and it seems to be a unique point to be in just a year into anyone's presidency so there does appear to be an end this was observed in national review this is a little bit like those comparisons that were made during the campaign of taking donald trump literally
we're taking him seriously
his opponents were trying to take him literally but not seriously where as his supporters took him seriously but did not hold him to the exactitude of every little thing that he said
this is probably true of this wolf book as well there are errors their inconsistency is there are things that don't stand up to fact checking
there is however the possibility that there is an overall cast to what he is saying about white house
book carries with it a certain amount of weight in the media community and certain amount of weight and political community in part because it does not come from nowhere it does not come into an unprepared consciousness everybody has heard clings to this effect before we are going to take a quick break in when we come back we will
talk about the rest of what happened at camp david beyond the unfortunate fleece blazer combination and beyond the conversation about president trumps mental health
each and every morning there are a whole lot of places you can look for news try this instead doubt listen to up first first as the morning news broadcast from npr one tap and ten minutes later you have started the day informed kind up first on the m p r one app and wherever he listened to by gas
right we are back and as we said at the top of the show there was actually a lot of conversation this weekend about policy about what congress is going to spend the rest of the year doing things that are really important and have a big effect on the government of the united states that were of course
was overshadowed by twitter as is often the case but let's walk through first of all what happened at camp david this weekend tam what was interesting to me is that republicans are coming off this big legislative accomplishment passing attacks overhaul but they're not quite sure what they want to do next and it seems like this
can did not fix that problem so last week we speculated about possible trust falls and other team building exercises they could possibly happen at this retreat and in some ways it sounds like that's the biggest thing of what it was not necessarily that they were transpires we have not gotten confirmation on that and we don't think it actually happened but the republican leaders in the president watch to move
together they spend time together and they talked about what they wanted to be on their agenda they didn't come out and say and here is exactly what we've figured out but we got a few clues that some of their priorities may be shifting a little bit so so so for example what is happening with the idea
of poverty reform as paul ryan sometimes cause it or what other people might call welfare reform and where the president has called welfare reform and what before this retreat president trump in the last few weeks of the year was saying as soon as we do taxes to in taxes are down it's on to welfare reform and he'd center that rallies and they'll be big applause at least one
a huge applause
not so much anymore is basically the answer and does that also mean that they will be going after entitlements that people might not consider welfare such as social security and medicare i think social security and medicare are have fallen way off of the agenda and something like food stamps or
or maybe like the temporary assistance for needy families program could still be something that they would consider may be trying to go after but what the president said and he was pushed on it because he didn't bring it up himself which is generally a sign that is not a priority for you what president said was that all of this is going to need to be bipartisan
the remarkable thing about this retreat is that he went in sounding like president trump and he came out largely sounding like mitch mcconnell the senate majority leader on policy and on things like whether he would support challengers to republicans in primaries
suddenly he was he was like it was like all hugs and channeling mitch mcconnell so there's the big picture stuff for the rest of the year that they were talking about that but they were also walking through their approach to a much more short term issue and that's what to do about dhaka it expires in early march but there has been a push on both sides for some sort of fix in the next few weeks
so what did they decide on their approach for doctor also there are a bipartisan negotiations that are underway well underway as we've talked about on the pod cast before president trump in his remarks at this press conference at camp david made very clear that that he's still very much wants his wall that
did he wants to to draw a line on the wall it says that he needs wall funding in order to do a dark effects but nothing is done until it's done
and at the moment the wall could be immovable object don't trump very good at negotiating this kind of thing you insist on exactly what you want until exactly the last minute and then you take something a little less and you say you one and and real sense you would be winning as oh joshi ate in reserves for him in what universe
think it's both
you framed a negotiation
as something that has to be all or nothing you get a little bit less maybe a lot less but then you say you one and you say you got your wall and who's going to actually go down there and inspect who gets build it's going to be less probably than what donald trump wants certainly overnight it will be less and in the meantime both parties would really like to have some sort of solution
to the deferred action for childhood arrivals doctor the dreamers and the framing is important on the democratic side too because democrats all along have said they'd be willing to vote for increased funding for border security beefing up what we already have been do anything that looks like trump getting his way on expanding a wall they're not going to vote for their saying and they will say they didn't
and donald trump will say i got my wall okay so there's other stuff going on to we should say that this meeting with paul ryan and mitch mcconnell came right as trans relationship with his former chief strategist steve ban and totally blew up that's something we talked at extended length about in our thursday round up
but over the course of the weekend steve ban and tried in a little bit of a belated way to walk things back what he said about donald trump junior praise president trump ron is steve ban and if he doesn't make a comeback if he hears off the scene in terms of the conservative movement doesn't make much of an impact or with steve ban and really more hat
than cattle when it came to his influence it may now seem as though he was more than cattle but what it was inevitably was a threat to certain republican incumbents in states where they might have been challenged from their own right if you will challenge by populist conservatives a little bit the way roy more shut down and through strange in alabama with the
help of steam ban and now it's a lot more difficult for them to do that if he has not seen as being kind of out of the white house wing man for president trump that was the true source of his power the other source of power aligned with donald trump was the money that he was getting from the mercer family that's robert mercer and his daughter rebecca
they seem to have cut him loose at this moment at least temporarily as you say if he does not get that source of funding back or a substitute for it he's not really in a position to run a lot of candidates in those red states that are reelecting a republican senator this year to threatened that republican incumbent last question about
this retreat
historically some big pieces of legislation has passed and even numbered years and midterm election years obama care is a great example but that's something that had been worked on for much of the preceding year historically if you don't have an agenda going into the second year of a congressional term if you don't have stuff you're already working on does much tend to her
happen in it know historically the second year of a congressional session the even numbered year as you say is about the election and so people don't want to take on something like entitlements social security and medicare people probably don't even want to take on popular programs that might be called welfare by some people one of the things we would
spec them to do would be to not show the government on on january nineteenth so some sort of a negotiation there between the dreamers to the doctor the different action and poor childhood arrivals program and donald trump's wall on southern border those kinds of things we do expect to see but some big new initiative and that kind of the president has talked
about maybe not so likely in an election year i went effect about one more really important thing that happened this weekend and that thing is oprah
let's let's first well let's take a listen oprah winfrey one the cecil be demille lifetime achievement award at the golden globes last night and she went up on stage and gave a barn burner of a speech
interviewed in portrayed people who have withstood some of the ugliest things like can throw at you but the one quality all of them seem to share is an ability to maintain hope for a bright and morning
even during our darkest nights so i want all the girls watching here and now to know that a new day is on the horizon
in a world where donald trump is president of the united states we have to take the possibility of oprah winfrey running for president of the united states seriously just in general but she got all this buzz last night she has been mentioned as some sort of outsider candidate before and her partner steadman tells the l a times last night it's up to the people
she would absolutely do it
in the world of power rankings of who would or would not run for president how seriously would you have to think about oprah for president
as seriously issue that if she decides she really wants it really wants to get into it really wants to try to put something together she would be obviously a highly unconventional candidate but s has says for itself as speaks its own name the comparison to donald trump is going to be very hard to avoid he had a car
kind of celebrity that no other person running for president in two thousand and sixteen hand and osha with oprah winfrey very hard to imagine anyone else eclipsing her in that regard in the democratic field or as an independent and any other way that she might choose to do it so if she really means to do this and she's been highly ambivalent about and to put it mildly if she really means to do this
then i believe we will be talking a great deal about oprah winfrey time she has a lot of favors to cash in with among other people president and michelle obama she was a very big endorsement for a candidate obama in two thousand and eight and her endorsement was was significant that she came out and sort of made it
okay for people to support barack obama and and i think that she does raise this other idea and talking about obama races this other idea that you know we've had now two presidents elected in a row who do not have what you would traditionally consider their resume of someone being alive
president president obama came in after he was running for president after he'd only been senator for two years that is not very long and in america likes president trump and and it is an interesting concept that the the reaction to trump would be to run to another celebrity
and oprah is not the only person who's been discussed you also have like mark zuckerberg a facebook or mark cuban from shark tank and the and the dallas mavericks
about iraq that child remember running away and then as are ignoring the rock but there's a broader i mean you can make the pendulum argument of of there would be a really compelling argument for someone with a lot of government experience of the steady hand but you know what can you make a point that we elected to people in a row without the traditional experience they've also
so if you go through the list of presidential losers most of them actually did have the on paper resume experience to be president and found that used against them will invariably john kerry an election and
voted for romney year
yeah so the point is it's going to be very unknown next couple of years and i guess that's why among other things we pod cast multiple times a week to translate it
going to end on that will be back in your feet thursday in the meantime you can catch our coverage on npr dot org on your local public radio station and on the npr one app there are still a few tickets available for the live show were doing up a warner theater on january eighteenth in go to npr presents or to check that
yeah i'm scott that heroic effort congress for npr i'm tamer keith the white house and i'm ron hoving editor correspondent thank you for listening to the npr politics part
