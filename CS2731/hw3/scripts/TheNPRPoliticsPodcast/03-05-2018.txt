
this is lucas brawn calling from raymond ohio where i am about to listen to the audio of the musical hamilton for the first time ever why haven't i done this already
this pod cast was recorded at one forty pm on monday march fear things may have changed by the time you listen to it keep up with all of them purest political coverage and pr dot org the npr one up and your local public radio station
okay here's the show
hey there it's the npr politics pod cast and primary season officially get underway this week texas is a first tomorrow for the first time in years democrats are fielding a candidate in every congressional district there and in early voting democratic turnout surpass
republican turn out but how much if texas could really be in play for democrats and president trump has driven a wedge between himself and a big chunk of the republican establishment on trade today he said he isn't backing down i'm team or keep i cover the white house for npr i'm susan davis like ah fuck
congress and just retailer political reporter and i'm run over your correspondent and take oh god don't oh yeah we need it
you need to explain on the last pod cast scott death row admitted that he had only just recently listened to hamilton all the way through for the time
i know i thought learned and he'd never know that certainly josh recent just recently i've never worn like wow it's not overrated actually that sounds pretty interesting scouted have a lot of people seen and heard this before
i feel like maybe i've heard it a few times you know i don't know most people can only hope to someday see it once in a high school production in twenty thirty two
which is when i plan on
so guys i have to admit that i have been in denial about the fact that the year is two thousand and eighteen and that means it it is in fact an election year however reality is smacking me in the face the sleek because texas is having primaries tomorrow
yeah voting people will be voting people already have been voting in fact what has early voting so it is under way it is underway and texas is getting a lot of attention probably in part because it's first but just tell me why for people in the rest of the forty nine states
we should actually be paying attention to tax senior we've seen the signs of democratic enthusiasm happening for a while there have been thirty nine state legislator districts that flips and trump was elected flipped from republican to democratic hands we had big wins last year in virginia and new jersey and ever for democrats and of course the women's marches in protest scenario
too so there's been evidence of this but this is the first time we will get actual concrete voting numbers and we're already getting some dad and because texas had eleven days of early voting and the enthusiasm that is there for democrats in a red state like texas of all places is astounding so not only did democrats surpass republicans in the early
voting numbers and the largest counties in texas that we looked at which comprise about two thirds of the state's population
they outpaced their thousand sixteen numbers which is when you typically have larger turn out certain way because it's a presidential year and they doubled their numbers from two thousand and fourteen so you know the democrats have been talking for our texas is eventually going to turn blue because it's trending that way but i mean this is sort of the first concrete evidence that
yeah i've seen of real swell and the fact that it's happening in our state that typically vote so republican is certainly noteworthy how many open seats are like there are there were a bunch of retirements right is is there a potential and this seems even crazy to ask because it's texas but is there a potential for demo
crashed actually pick up seats
in texas that when how many right so they're eight open seats six republicans and democrats are retiring the majority of those are really safe republicans eat whoever wins the primary is going to probably be the next congressmen or congresswoman i think the ones that we are focusing on here are those three seats that were won by hillary clinton so it's john
person's suburban houston seat pete session suburban dallas eat and then we'll heard seat which is usually only been the one swing seat in texas really after they did the redistricting and he's someone who is sort of cut more of a moderate profile and the house and he may not be as easy to knock off as the numbers would show and it's still a
lime and even democrats that i talk to for my story on this even admitted you know it's going to be tough even with this surge as we mentioned before but let's just like actually talk about it for the first time in twenty five years democrats are fielding candidates and every single congressional race and taxes
they're not going to win and a lot of these places but it shows that people are willing to step up to run and you know given the crazy political environment that were and you can't rule out some type of scandal or something happening and you can't win a race unless you have a candidate there and democrats have seen that happen in races before also it when you have potential wave years like twenty eight
team is part of the argument to have just a candidate on the ballot is that a lot of times in a wave your candidates when in places were not even watching that they washed out incumbents who nobody was wasn't on anybody's radar and you can't beat people if you don't have somebody on the ballot this was the same tactic that republicans employ
in two thousand and ten were some of the candidates that one night year the and r c c which is the counterpart to democrats didn't even know who they were when they won their elections is one more race in texas and it's getting a lot of attention and that would be the senate race texas senator ted cruz a republican is up for reelection and he is
getting more legit than usual challenge that's right and people have been ask you why don't we hear so much from ted cruz the stage was he not as noisy as he's been in his first five years in the senate and one of the reasons is he's back home trying to get himself elected trying to do the right things from that he doesn't suddenly find his political career could
short before he can run for president again and the democrats have an actual candidate and better rourke who is a young guy some people call him the texans version of young john f kennedy that's probably not long while lawyer
not would you want to hear in some parts from texas he's quite liberal for texas but he has a populist air and these are populist times and perhaps the most energy and the democratic party even even in a texas is now on the left so he is a man of his times he may not very well be ted cruz that is probably
a little bit high as the bar but he was going to make it more competitive than anyone would have imagined a few months ago and the more democrats turn out to vote and congressional districts because they've got a candidate for the more state wide enthusiasm there is even in very deeply republican district the better chance there is the crews would be in trouble and he out raised cruise last quarter to and that was
largely from small dollar donations like ones so we saw bernie sanders getting so that's another measure of enthusiasm for a candidate as well yeah and that iraq has been having these town halls and the his rallies these events in the parking lots or fall people are showing up in it's in republican areas yeah and it's march some of that is anti trump
someone that isn't a cruise and some of it is twenty two
although i think we should say that i think ted cruz still enters this race heavily favored in the general election and if if texas does become truly a competitive toss up ray says the field of the year developed than democrats are in a much better position to gain seats or even the majority in the senate if texas isn't play on the senate level and absolutely yeah
they crazy thing about texas is dead in two thousand and sixteen hillary clinton actually lost by less in texas than she did in iowa and ohio and there's another weird thing that's happening in texas right now that i think has another reason why people are watching what happens in these primaries it's also a state where
president trump is not doing very well right now according to tracking poll data his approval rating is hovering at or just below forty percent which is a really weird position for a republican president to be in texas one caviar about this polling data is that the approval ratings track all adults
not just likely voters so there could be a different kind of microcosm of where voters are but to have a republican president so upside down given all the other atmospherics just could make for some very weird outcomes in texas run do you have any idea why trump
probably not be doing as well in texas as in other places because his immigration policies which would please in the republican party of the texas so the mentality but do not by and large please the average person in the southwest even people who are not hispanics even people who are anglos
are not happy about the divisiveness of solve the president's rhetoric they're not crazy about the wall the not crazy about the way that it changes their culture
certainly true and parts of arizona obviously true in new mexico even more humble mostly drew in southern california so all across the stage that would actually be affected by the wall there a great deal of disaffection about it there it's also what they have in texas is a considerable number of a lot of the demographic we're gonna talk a lot about in the mid term elections is white college educated vote
voters the texas economy is doing really well right now in the suburbs of cities like houston and dallas are popping and the kind of affluent educated voter there was kind of a very traditional bush republican in a bush style republican a mitt romney style republican and they are less and number of donald trump's republican party well and those
so you just pointed out those are there were actually three congressional districts and texas that are held by republicans currently that voted for hillary clinton you have john cooper since suburban houston district you have pete session suburban dallas district and and will herds he represents a border district that's really expansive reach saw the way from el paso to san antonio
and republicans that i've talked to i talked to one republican strategist there in the state derek ryan who's been doing a lot of analysis into this data here and the thing that he pointed out that i think should really worry republicans is that democrats are getting low propensity voters to the polls and what we mean by that is that typically in mid term's you see republicans turn out that we will
older voters wider voters and things like that but democrats are getting their voters to the polls in this election and he found that nearly a quarter of the early vote through last week was new voters that had registered since two thousand and six team that first time primary voters they may maybe voted in a presidential election but they hadn't voted in a midterm election before
democrats that made up twenty two percent of the early vote up from fourteen percent in two thousand and fourteen but for republicans it only made up about ten percent or so of first time primary voters and that's actually a dip from twenty fourteen for him mid terms that have typically been lower turnout election into big big
number when you go from the mid term elections where we elect congress and governors and song to a presidential election the electorate nationwide goes up fifty percent it's half again as big and the difference is almost entirely accounted for by women voters hundred thirty and people of color and also texas is always
in the bottom five of states a voter turn out this is not a state that has a lot of voter turn out so this big surge and on the democratic side that's another thing that i think is really really important to note i think specifically to you were watching hispanic turn out i mean that texas is a state that has a critical mass of hispanic voters who historically don't show up in winter
collections that's exactly who you're talking about just that low propensity voter that shows up in a presidential year but since this one out and considering the immigration debate we're having in this country over dhaka and dream mac legislation and and everything is fresh in voters' minds mean today is march fifth the eve of this election was originally the deadline that the president had said
to end the a program obviously that's going to be extended and we're going to continue to have this immigration fight but it's kind of the first real test of how angry are hispanic voters are they showing up and are they voting for democrats to i just want to put a pin and something you said which is this is march fifth this is the day that as an interim head set for the end of day
aka but it's not ending because of various court rulings including the supreme court last week saying hey we're not going to rule on this early and kicking it back to the ninth circuit if yo would like more detail on that we have a pod cast in your feed from early last week where scott death row and dominica montenegro and moralizing get into way
a more detail about that case but suffice it to say congress' not moving with due haste at the moment
okay so once texas is over then you know we have many other states to come are there any mistakes in particular primaries in particular that you guys have your eyes on think california will certainly tell us a lot and new york these big states are places where democrats need to pick up seats if they are going to win
back the house but also ohio pennsylvania know we have so in two weeks we have illinois will be the next primary that we have and then there's little bit of a break it doesn't start again until may but then may june there's a break in july onward it's going to be primary primary primary enron the this isn't a prime
mary but next week there is an election in pennsylvania a special election
it outside of pittsburgh that is generating a lot of heat this is the southwestern pennsylvania district that is absolute ground zero for donald trump and his issues he has been very popular he wanted in two thousand and sixteen handily going away absolutely clobbered hillary clinton in this district even known twenty thirty years ago it was kind of a democratic district
it's a perfect example of how blue collar voters have shifted over because of donald trump now the two candidates are pretty strong reaction a cone has raised a lot of money on the republican side you've got the president coming to just outside to change would be district to district ruins running we expected he would probably say nice things about the guy since he's certainly said a lot of nice things about donald trump
on the other side we've got the democrat
connor lamb young man very attractive very well spoken democrats are very high on him normally we would consider him i'm sorry a sacrificial lamb but in this instance he may have just personal characteristics and again it's because twenty eighteen the energy is running the other way even in very trump district and they're spending so much
both parties are spending a lot of money in this district but it's even going to exist in november as the crazy advice district is because of redistricting
pennsylvania is going through the court ordered redrawing of the lines this district simply doesn't exist neither of the candidates will even live in the new version of it but you know i remember talking with homework and strategist even two months ago and didn't even seem as competitive as it is now and them saying this is the canary in the coal my yeah this is the day
we will look at to see whether this is going to be a really really bad year for republicans bang on watts of canaries to work out for in the next week or so
and we are going to come back and talk about trade just you are leaving us thank you for bringing the knowledge and you for having me and we will be right back

invisibility years back for new season new stories about small personal battles in a different person now your fate and huge cultural issues this is probably use somebody killed so tune in for invisible season four
we are back and last week president trump announced his intention to impose terrorists on steel and aluminum imports and the reaction from republicans has been less than positive the decision isn't final yeah he says it's coming this week
president has signed anything yet and so there is this intensive lobbying effort underway to get him to change his mind and one of the people doing the lobbying to his house speaker paul ryan how speaker paul ryan and i would say essentially every congressional republicans i mean this is an issue where probably for the first
first time since he's been in office this is really an issue where donald trump has broken with the republican party this is his decision to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports go directly at the heart of traditional republican philosophical views on trade in the free market it is fair to say how speaker paul ryan strongly
opposes the president on this decision as does ways and means chairman kevin brady his committee overseas taxes and trade policy senate republicans are you know almost unanimously again said according to senators we talked to on friday so the president is really at odds with the hill on this and the question now is can they change his mind
mind and what would they like to see him do if they can't can they mitigate the effects of this in any way we did see the president today at the white house is well one of his top advisors peter navarro show no indication that they are willing to wiggle it all on these new tariffs if anything the president said very explicitly today we're not going to back
down
no end up back in mexico
had a very big deal with mexico very big deal with canada from africa
or factories have left our country our jobs have left our country for many years nafta has been a disaster
we are renegotiating after as i said i would make a deal alterman nafta
what if i do make a deal which is fair to the workers on to the american people that would be i would imagine what are the points or will negotiate and will be care of storms feel for canada
and from mexico so we'll see what happens but right now one hundred percent here's the argument that people like paul ryan are making and republicans on the hell are broadly making that their fear is that new terrorists will mitigate all of the economic gains that they are hoping to see from policies like their tax cuts and
mitigate all of your economic gains in this election year you put your majorities in congress even further at risk so they think it is policy wise the wrong thing to do and politically a loser for the republican party enter the thing about president trump as he has been talking about how america is getting a bad deal on trade for like one hundred and fifty years
or at least thirty this is of all the issues that he has dealt with as president of the united states have all the things that have come before congress
this is the thing where he has a rock solid ideology yeah this is an issue on trade policies donald trump as a real estate developer as a presidential candidate as a reality tv star now as president has always been consistent in his views on trade and on cracking down on china and on cracking down on trade
it's and is your right sam it's not like tax policy or gun policy that we saw last week or other immigration or integration where he is shown of flexibility to change his mind or be hard to peg down or or say one thing one day and something different the next on this issue he has always been very consistent so that's why i think one
that there's more concerned coming from capitol hill that this is going to happen and they won't be able to change his mind because they know that about him that this is a strongly held view and that could mean consequences and let's also congress in some respects invited back some years ago when they gave the president's authority to impose certain
tariffs in situations where the president determined on his own that there was a threat to national security and donald trump believes that are steel and aluminum industries are on their last legs and obviously we need to do and aluminum in national security terms in the long run to build new tanks and new weaponry
president has basically carte blanche to put in these terrorists and congress is not going to be asked for their approval they're going to have to figure out some way to actually express their disapproval
so i heard from a g o p source that congressional leaders won't roll out potential action down the line but so i don't know what that means theoretically congress could undermine the president unless they have given the president the authority to do these things and they could technically take that authority to a way it is in their constant
juvenile we'll house to pass some kind of legislative recourse if they wanted to combat the president on tariffs oh wouldn't that be something to say well it's it's difficult for a lot of reasons one just take the raw politics i think reasonable people can conclude that there's probably not a huge willingness among republicans to take on president
trump within the republican party in an election year
and from a practical matter as it was described to me by one republican saying it would be an extraordinary move to try and do something like this because philosophically the way these trade deals are written the trade authorities given to the president are written in a way that we give our commander in chief a very long latitude to decide the rules of internet
national trade so if congress isn't really interested in setting a precedent in which you get to second guess the president on any kind of decision that he makes year but i do think the fact that congressional leaders are sort of winking at that time and saying well we're not taking that off the table speaks more to the fact of how much they oppose this and how much it
odds they are with his white house and i think right now the most they can do is talk a little tough and if they were to move forward with this which is many many many steps down this process they would likely need veto proof majorities in the house and senate to be able to undermine the president on this and this is one of those issues where the president has some allies in congress they just happen
to be democrats democrats what here we are again and there are no good options other than to persuade the president not to actually carry through with a talk tough i want to trade war they're easy to win rhetoric and i once had a top aide to the president tell me that the best way to get donald trump
to do something is to tell him not to do it or tell him he can't and if you want to make further make leaders heads explode like senate majority leader mitch mcconnell to of the voices that were quick to come out last week when this decision was first announced or democrats like shared brown a democrat in ohio and bob casey a democrat from pennsylvania to traditional steel friendly
it's coming out and applauding the president and talk about giving democrats pretty good cover on an issue that's important to their home states in an election year in an election year when those democrats are on ballot for goes to n just to make this more fun and i think we've talked about this before but leg among the products that europe is talking about placing
it's own tariffs on our harley davidson motorcycles from wisconsin they don't tell in retaliation for nothing
tackle you urban from wisconsin cheese right so our allies in the rest of the world that are potentially trying to make this even more painful for the people who should be the president's close supporters shore and the president for his part has been very dismissive of those concerns i would say that those concerns are very real
when you're someone les paul ryan from the state of wisconsin or mitch mcconnell from the state of kentucky but trump just kind of waved it off today at the white house and said i don't think you're gonna have a trade war he just does not believe the threats that are coming his way and he thinks that the us will come out on top of this
i don't think he has also treated that trade wars are good an easy to when they're easy to wear while we're gonna find out
