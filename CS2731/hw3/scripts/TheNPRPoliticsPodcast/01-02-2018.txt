okay here's show happy new year
hey there it's the npr politics hot cast its twenty eight team it's an even ear and for a politics pod cast like ours that means one thing it's an election or preview that in a little bit will also talk about what on congress is plate as it returns for a new here i'm scott debt heroic effort congress
npr and tamer he thank him for the white house and i'm susan davis i also have a congress at the new year everybody happy new year
can i can i push one thing i stole this idea for my cousin on new year's eve and it was a great idea and i'm an evangelist for now in addition to the phil collins midnight thing which had to do and it was great
she and her kids take a lemon and right bad things from the last year on the lemon and then shortly before midnight throw it out the window you're going to say they make lemonade they don't make lemonade
throw it out the window i co opted that and used a large sweet potato because they're are a bunch of people in my house and then just toss the sweet potato where did you throw at you live in the city i have a yard i gave it a high arc in the yard i did not throw it into the street so there's just a sweet potato laying in your yard and the next morning i pick it up and threw it away okay and that i was really really frozen my dog was like really and
agreed but i threw it before the dog could the sweet potato i think you should bury it in your yard that seems like more of a symbolic thing about saying about of the year the thing is i thought of this to do at eleven fifty seven so there wasn't time got it
so listening to your intro it made me think oh gosh i can no longer say it's too soon to talk about twenty eighteen know it's twenty eight and we're doing like we're it is now game on we get to talk about the midterms and we don't even have to apologize well this will make you feel better we will talk about the mid terms in the second
half of the pod cast we will start with what's coming up in congress the tax bill as we know is behind us that it's signed into law but congress has a lot on his plate and sue the to do list sounds to me very suspiciously like the december to do list and to do list that sounds suspiciously like things we've talked about a lot
the number one priority is to keep the government open before they left for the christmas break they passed a short term stopgap funding measure it keeps the government running until january nineteenth and in the meantime they're trying to negotiate all sorts of unfinished business with the intention of hopefully using this final say
funding bill as a likely vehicle to pass all this unfinished legislation so there was a lot of stuff in the air that was secondary to the main funding the government issue
just the mix of them dhaka chip healthcare stabilization five of all of those what is the most important in the short term the first thing they have to do before they can move forward on pretty much anything else is they need to find bipartisan agreement on what the spending levels for the government should be that is why that is the first
priority this week for congressional leaders who were meeting with senior white house officials to try and basically just get an agreement on a number for both how much money the government's going to spend on defense spending and for all the other priorities they can't really move forward on all these other negotiations until they just kind of get that top line figure tam there's a meeting with with white house
officials and correctional leaders tomorrow and then over the weekend present and trump gets together with mitch mcconnell and paul ryan at camp david are there any priorities the white house is pushing for when it comes to shifting funding around adding some places taking it away other places
the main priority that president trump has had his big he wants more money for defense obviously he'd also like to fund his wall but that may have to come with the negotiations over dhaka and in reality that may have to go by the wayside during the negotiations over over the dream a given
so what's actually talk about that for a minute because in september
we all talked about the fact that that dhaka was probably going to be pointed to december because democrats had leverage than democrats chose to not use that leverage in december so the question is what do democrats push for in a couple of weeks when it comes to saying we won't do x or else when it comes to dhaka but i guess the other question is where president trunk actually stands on that because remember
he initially was on board with the big picture idea of some sort of compromise but then he had that real hard one document that came out but said you know these twenty things are my immigration priorities
yeah where where as he between those two positions right now i he at the moment i think is closer to that hardline document in addition to saying that he wants funding for the wall he also wants to in what's called chain migration that's what they call it where it's immigration policy based on it least
in part on family ties he wants it to be based on merit and like who has a lot of education or the potential for a good job that would be like a complete rewriting of the immigration system and is a complete rewriting of the system that doesn't actually even have a ton of republicans support much less debt
craddock support
and now comes the moment when i would like to for my first time in this calendar year read a trump tweet he has been treating about doctor just this morning he says quote democrats are doing nothing for dhaka just interested in politics dhaka activists and hispanics will go hard again stems will
falling in love with republicans and their president exclamation point we are about results so important reminder here
the deferred action for travel arrivals program is ending because president trump made a decision to end it he set the date for march fifth sue at the time he said that seemed pretty far off march fifth not that far away at this point into he did and we should also note he made the decision to end it because the program was being challenged in the court system it was an obama error prone
graham which many republicans believed they would have been victorious in the courts that the president does not have unilateral authority to do that kind of immigration policy now the challenge that they're going to have and i think the challenge or going to see if he magically throughout two thousand and eighteen
is there is no solution to the immigration question that isn't bipartisan there is no immigration bill they can pass the house the two hundred and eighteen republican votes nothing can get through the senate without sixty votes they're going to need at least nine democrats can't do anything unless the president agrees he's going to sign it so the challenges are the dynamics the legislative demands
what thousand and eighteen is asking for fundamentally call for more bipartisan solutions than the big legislative priorities of twenty seventeen which were we're appealing and replacing the affordable care act and passing comprehensive tax legislation and there was talk about some sort of group forming jeff flake from arizona was one of the people talking about that saying we feel like in mid january
have some sort of bipartisan conversation on the center for absolutely and i will say that one of the reasons that democrats left town without putting up a bigger fight over immigration is by every measure as in the senate there are sincere bipartisan ongoing negotiations going for a comprehensive immigration bill and jeff flake said that he's been given
in assurances by senate majority leader mitch mcconnell that that will get a vote potentially as early as january mitch mcconnell and said he will bring an immigration bill to the floor if he knows it has the sixty votes to pass the democrats have said all along they're never going to vote for a wall ending chain migration is a pretty drastic change that doesn't seem like it would have sixty votes
what do either of you think democrats could realistically except in exchange for protection for these eight hundred thousand or so people who are in the country i think democrats would give a metaphorical wall they would be more than happy to have significant increases in funding for border security
drones along the border of things like that
but an actual physical walled the president trump compound on and say this is my thing that i got they are not going to say yes to that and they're going to make the case and they already are making the case like you can't hold these seven hundred eight hundred thousand young people hostage for your wall but the president has me also been sort of
he's waffled a bit on the wall as well right i mean it at times he said it's going to be a big beautiful wall going to be a physical structure but he has cracked the door to negotiating a wall in terms of you know he's talked about using drones are other forms of border security i mean it seems like the intention is really to give some measure of of certainty
the us mexico border is more tightly controlled for illegal immigration which in the past many democrats have also said that they do support yeah i mean i think it depends on the day gather it is a physical wall that he can touch whether it is see through or not see through how tall it is what it's made of and you know we could be
this comes down to how do you define wall and can president from claim victory in this case so we've talked about this and the cover from different parts before and this is something that that as you said is complicated has been tried and not resolved several times in the past when there were a republican majority is when they were
democratic majority is when it was mixed government so seems to me like it's very unlikely or at least a very high bar to reach for this to be resolved within the next month
there is i don't think we have a good read yet of were those senate negotiations are like i said todd negotiators people like illinois democrat dick durbin who the dream act has been one of his driving issues in congress has also sounded like he believes there is a bipartisan solution to be had we know we know what democrats want right
know that they won a path the either legal status or citizenship for the so called dreamers what we're not entirely sure yet is how much they're willing to give and how much they need to give in order to get republicans and president trump on board they've done this before the senate has done this before they know how to do it they have the tools they probably have the votes the
question is is the timing rate is the political incentive right and you know for democrats how how hard do they want to draw red line and not negotiate on these issues because i do think again as we enter this midterm election year they see keeping things like their base and hispanic minority voters and others excited about this issue they have an incentive there
okay so the things we just talked about are probably going to dominate the next few weeks and as i mentioned before or mentioned again here just just to some other thing still in the air the children's health insurance program that had expired
put enough money to keep it going for another month or so but they're going to have to resolve that in a long term way soon same with a law authorizing foreign surveillance finds a law that was renewed for about another month and then there's the question of again something we've been talking about for several months is there going to be some sort of stabilization for the health care market susan collins had a sister
damn it in exchange for a vote on tax cards it didn't happen but she feels comp and up and this month
that all being said turning the page to a broader look at two thousand and eighteen it was pretty to multi this year for the most part for the president and his own party and congress but it ended on a really positive know getting that big accomplishment done i mean does that keep things going in a smooth way for twenty eight hundred is that all depend on what happens in the next two or three
luke's well i didn't want to be predictive in two thousand and seventeen and i don't want to be too pretty do two hundred eighteen either
january second you can just turn that resolution out the door that's
you're absolutely right sky i mean they ended with a republican party ended two thousand and seventeen
on a very high note the party in terms of the relationship between capitol hill in the white house is probably the strongest it's ever been i think they have found a path to how to work together i think the president sees what it feels like to have a big legislative when and probably wants to have that feeling again in two thousand and eighteen
the demands of an election year just different historically the bulk of the legislative work in an election year tends to be pretty much wrapped up by the summer time
you don't really get a lot of big legislative victories in the fall of an election year so i think we're looking for a january through spring time crunch in terms of the big legislative push and how successful they're going to be and the thing that i would look to and maybe this will all be worked out by the end of the week with this
retreat at camp david and they will do like trust fall and everyone will be on the same page but at the moment the president the house speaker and the majority leader all republicans are all emphasizing different priority yeah for the year ahead and and that seems like not the best
way to proceed rapidly two words one goal so you have have mitch mcconnell saying everything needs to be done in a more bipartisan way i mean he's either looking at the reality of the senate he's looking at the numbers he's looking at the midterms he's looking in a lot of things you have paul ryan who wants to take on the so called entitlement reform possibly met
care medicaid social security talking about doing reconciliation again this this process that makes things have a lower bar
fifty one vote majority in the senate and then you have the president talking about infrastructure dhaka and and welfare reform which is somewhat different than what paul ryan is talking about the president's idea according to aids spoken demoralizing of what welfare reform is sort of means to
tested government programs so that could be medicaid but it wouldn't be medicare and it wouldn't be social security it would be things like food stamps and possibly medicaid i think it'll crystallize a little bit more later in the month i do think that congressional leaders when one party controls everything they are certainly looking to the president to set the tone for the agenda for the earrings probably
going to do that in his state of the union address later this month and then shortly after the sea of the union republicans and democrats do this too but republicans will have their annual retreat where they they leave washington they go away for the weekend and they kind of fade out and work out what they want their priorities to be for the year
i need a circle back and something the term said
if you had to be caught in a trust fall by donald trump paul ryan or mitch mcconnell who would you pick as most trustworthy palmer morality ninety x baby mainly because he is the strongest yeah yeah he's going to catch you based stuff o'connell trump has treated his allies and cabinet members he would be picked number three for me to to be caught in a trust
i could just see him walking away i also the people really trust mitch mcconnell but if we're just going on strength here you want the guy that sky like the six pack that you mentioned and strength you actually do you want the guy that's made like fitness a priority because you know that he's going to like any like still when he's like i got this i'm going to catch you yeah ok
so paul ryan to mitch mcconnell three donald trump that's our power rankings trust for interests while he has fire okay and i think that's a great point to take a quick break will come back

we are back as we said it is an even number year it is a midterm election year and much just start by looking at the big picture historic picture and this is generally not great news for president trump and republicans because why marge no matter who you are in your second year as president there
it's a good chance your party is going to lose seats if you are not popular there is an even greater chance your party is going to lose seats
so what all do you think about when you think about is this going to be a good you're a bad year for the incumbent party in a midterm so i think the most important thing to remember out about them mid term's especially in the modern era as they are essentially a referendum on the president it's your first chance to cast a federal vote since the president's been in office so one of
the most important things that people look at is what does the president's approval rating and right now president trump is going into an election year with an approval rating that hovers in the high thirty's i think it's around thirty eight percent right now
oftentimes they say they use forty five percent as the bar for over under on how well you do if the president's of polling about forty five percent the losses tend to be less severe than the deeper you go under forty five percent it tends to get pretty ugly and actually in two thousand and ten president obama was just around forty five percent and he lost sixty
three seats so in sixteen of the last eighteen mid term elections the president and power has lost seats in the midterm election one of the most notable in recent exceptions to that was george w bush and that was after nine eleven so you've got that in another number that we've been hearing a lot about lately is the what
be generic ballot number and why don't we have just explain what that is to start with tam can you walk us through the so that is like a pollster calls you up and says are you more inclined to vote for a republican or democrat it's not are you more inclined to vote for your representative it is do you ah
republican in the congressional seat or do you want a democrat in the seat because it is not looking good for republicans on that front either we're talking about consistent double digit lead for democrats on that and over the last month it was something like fifteen point eighteen point advantages for democrats and the other thing that i would just point to and
we've said this time and time again that special elections are not necessarily indicators of anything or they are they are special for a reason and there they can be out layers but there has been sort of a pattern in in almost all of this special elections in two thousand and seventeen which is dead the a democrat
it's outperformed significantly hillary clinton in the special elections and the republicans significantly underperformed donald trump
now that doesn't mean in most of those raises the republican one anyway because they were safe republican seats but if you were to sort of extrapolate that out that enthusiasm the democrats showed no lot of these races to see to with narrower republican majorities then things get interesting into any eighteen especially when you to talk about those generic
numbers that you brought up scotty in the polls that have them if if the polls are actually in the polls hold and you're talking about a generic advantages of fifteen eighteen points those are not wave numbers or tsunami numbers i mean that those are numbers that should scare speaker paul ryan and the he should be thinking about that number when he goes to bed at night if they hold obviously we're going to say this
yeah but it's still really early but the signs that we're seeing the tremors that we're seeing are potentially very encouraging good factors for democrats to have a good men term but there are a couple asterisk and course i feel like last time i said asterisk risks i got yelled at a lot by the internet so how did you say it as direct now i actually don't remember when someone or
let us know caviar it's just a cat and some caveats here play it safe one is that when you're talking about the generic ballot number there is not a national congressional election of course the seats are divided into districts and the districts do not exactly reflect the the populace they lean republican because republicans by a march were the ones drawing
i'm ten years ago so they've got that in their favor republicans do the other thing is that the one other thing you tend to look at is the economy the unemployment ramp and by mars that doing really well lately it's been doing really well and i also think you're going to hear a lot and we saw a lot of of russia these news stories before the holiday and i think republicans are going to do
their part to make sure every voter is aware of them going into the mid terms is not only that the economy is doing well but that after they pass their tax legislation this wave of stories about companies giving bonuses or raising wages are doing things like dan and i think that they're trying to make an argument going into them in terms that you are better off
because republicans are in control you're going to have more money in your wallet your wages are going to go out whether that's a compelling argument or not i don't know but that is that is the ground that republicans would like to be fighting the twenty and ten terms tam how much is the white house as president trump planning on actively campaigning and how much do the republicans in the tougher
aces want to be campaigning with him i think that remains an open question and something that they are trying to figure out i mean if you if you look at the way president like in that new york times interview last week or in his tweets perceives his ability to affect candidates fortunes he sees himself
as a kingmaker he sees himself as somebody who can bring you up twenty point even if both of his candidates in the alabama senate race ultimately ended up losing but his perception is that he is the best thing to happen to any possible candidate and why wouldn't everyone want to campaign with him be me like past press
residents in mid term years here thank you but no thank you from people in competitive races and i think the other thing to look at is also what happens with steve bannon or not just steve ban and but what he represents which is this idea of more trump be in outsider away
outsider republicans challenging the the incumbent republicans and do those do those people make it through the primaries do those primaries beat up those republicans and give democrats openings particularly and senate seats were they the map is not really in their favor when democrats favor but
does mitch mcconnell is worst nightmare come true and and you have a bunch of primary challenges i also think in twenty eight thousand in the senate
republicans just have a really strong built in advantage the way the map shakes out this time around they're much more on offense democrats are much more on defense and i think he magically what you're going to be hearing about all of twenty eighteen is these democrats in red states running for reelection and say to the downtown not just one but one big people like joe mansion in west virginia
camp in north dakota and how did democrats navigate this path of trying to run for reelection in places where the president has actually still quite popular yeah and i'm thinking like claire mccaskill in misery also but then on the other side of the ledger looking at nevada for instance where there's a challenger to dean heller and dean heller the republican senator there is
wildly unpopular there's a republican challenger who happens to be someone would like the losing his record in congressional races but still a challenger with a name to arcane in which is familiar to you in l v basketball fans because i think it was his father was the coach at you and l v one race i'm going to be paying attention
to that has absolutely nothing to do with control of the senate but it's still pretty interesting is the primary in the california san race i'm going to be yeah fixing a lot on democratic dynamics over the next year and that is a race where you have dianne feinstein running against to challenger kevin daily own who's the president of the state senate who has really carved out a lie
hash tag resist her persona for himself against someone who's been criticized for trying to be one of those governing lawmakers in the senate trying to reach consensus deals not always coming out with flaming criticism of donald trump so where's the democratic electorate right now it's incredibly one place to watch and sue we also keep waiting for more shoes to drop
on the sexual harassment stuff yeah absolutely i mean that's i think that storyline is going to continue into the midterm election year we have to sitting congressmen one democrat one republican who are facing these allegations who are in the middle of ethics investigations both and said they will not run for reelection but they're not going to leave congress and we know that this month there is
bipartisan legislation being work through that's going to introduce this month the chief sponsor of greg harper he's the chairman of the house administration committee says he'd like to have that bill passed out of the house by the end of the month essentially what it would do is remake the process on capitol hill by which people file sexual harassment complaints and would do things like if a member of congress
is involved in a complaint personally that they'd have to pay any settlement out of their own pocket
there is so are running tally for twenty eight team of the election is a long way off his as of this pod cast one a believe i think we just sit at one time we will probably say three hundred times this year
but let's let's end this shifting from an election that's eleven months away to be consequences of a recent election and that is the fact that this week doug jones will be sworn in as the new senator from alabama
how much of a difference does fifty one forty nine make compared to fifty to forty eight when it comes to the republican democrat breakdown in the summer
when you're talking about majority's this narrow every vote really does count the thing that we said so much in this pod cast in two thousand and seventeen when we're talking about what the senate could do as we said how many times that we all say there is only fifty two republican senators they can only lose two votes and still pass it i mean i don't even italian
i can't even imagine that was the election is a long way off of twenty exactly and the context for that was always that republicans were using a special budget process to try and get through on republican votes alone their bills on health care and taxes this year if you take mitch mcconnell and his word that he wants things to be more bipartisan really to do anyway
bipartisan legislation in the senate or any legislation through the normal legislative process you need sixty votes so the number i think we're going to talk about a lot in twenty eighteen is not in which is the number of democrats for people like mitch mcconnell are going to need to get on board to pass any kind of bipartisan legislation so one other one other number ten maybe you might know
this because you've covered pence such a narrow margin means that my pants is probably going to vote for more tie breaking votes he had six votes last year that was one of the most every first year vice president does anyone know the vice president who holds the record for tie breaking vote in this century dick cheney no not in this country he's a statue you pass them in the capital sometimes
i don't know john c calhoun
renault wanted know that we shouldn't we also know to that there's another new senator this week there and it's yeah lieutenant governor genus months she's a minnesota democrat will be sworn into the seat of former senator al franken one more reminder of the repercussions of the sexual harassment allegation stories that have affected us politics she's close
political ally of democratic governor mark dayton and she is expected to obviously be the appointee for the sea but she is already indicated that she plans to run for the seat in a special election this year to carry out his term and franken resignation was effective today believe he had lingered in the senate after announcing he was going to resign and created some awkward
some some questions about whether he was rethinking that but no as of today al franken no longer than minnesota senator
all right that is a rap for today happy new year other fun fact this is the fourth calendar year with pod cast it now
if it's like a new thing and twenty fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen array happy new year would hold me back on your feet with our second part gas to twenty eight thousand on thursday the meantime you can keep up with all of our coverage on npr dot org on your local public radio station and on the npr one app i'm scott debt relic of congress for npr i'm tammy ricky think
