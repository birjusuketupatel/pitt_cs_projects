
hey this is when in cincinnati ohio where i just get done dropping off my son for his very first day of kindergarten this pod cast was recorded at two forty one eastern on saturdays september first things may have changed by the time you hear it all right here's the show
it's the npr politics cast it's been a week of memorial services for senator john mccain first in arizona than the us capital today leaders from around the country gathered at the national cathedral the site of so many big memorial services to say goodbye to john mccain
i'm scott detroit cover congress and cause it's now i also cover congress and i'm going to cover the white house so we all just watched this funeral it was about two and a half hours president's obama bush clinton were there a ton of other dignitaries scott horsley you and i were here in studio and npr but kelsey you were at the nash
no cathedral just tell us what it was like to be there to really solemn it was very quiet around the cathedral it is in this part of upper northwest washington dc that has already kind of a quiet part of the city the cathedral itself has at the top of a hill and it's very isolated and it felt like it was just a quiet solemn moment and it's just an enormous building in it
it's the closest the country has to westminster abbey type national place for big events we don't do royal wedding is there but we do go there to to honor the lives of people like john mccain yeah prayer services are following the inauguration of several president including obama and it was the site of the national prayer service
for ronald reagan after his passing sort of the official religious home for official washington so we're going to walk through some of the key moments from this funeral in a moment but scott i think one of the key moments was was when they went to the vietnam memorial on the way to the national cathedral absolutely and you have to remember that this entire pageant
that we have witnessed over the last week since john mccain death on the twenty fifth has been carefully planned out to illustrate the various stations of john mccain life his adopted home in arizona his church and arizona the the capital here really and state and then obviously the
normal stop in route to the cathedral this morning where the motorcade paused at the vietnam veterans memorial cindy mccain place a ceremonial wreath there and obviously not only to john mccain own time as a prisoner of war in hanoi which is a central piece of the narrative of john mccain but also a tribute to the tens of
thousands who served in died there and that's particularly important because mccain was central to the normalizing and relationships with between the united states in vietnam and it's something that he thought was very important
in their country needed to remember the war but they also needed to move on and even though the mccain family and said they didn't want president trump at today's funeral or any of the events this week when cindy mccain wouldn't leave that wreath secretary of defense gym maddox was next to her as was chief of staff john kelly the two of them have had a long relationship with nick
pain and part of his job in congress wants to work directly with them so for them
more than just their role in this white house it was about their relationship between the military and john mccain their well i can't think of another person in congress
deeper and more and it involves relationship with the military it's funny though course those are both generals and we heard yesterday from vice president my pants
my parents who sort of course is is a marine
no one was kinder to the enlisted men and women of the us military and no one was tougher on the generals and admirals and we heard similar points during the service today so let's get to the funeral and the national cathedral is jam packed with former president former centers celebrities at one point her as a cutaway shot to
john kerry sitting next to jay leno
and looking through the list it struck me that if you include mccain everyone who lost a general presidential election in the last twenty years was there hillary clinton bob dole mccain carry out gore but i think meghan mccain really set the tone for the whole day with with her eulogy early on john much
keynes daughter she's coast of view on a b c
talk about a lot of personal thing she talked about his public career but also talking about just his role as a dad and mom and she shared with them as a dad and and conversation she had like this one
when my father god's sake
i asked him what he wanted me to do with this year he said
show them how tough you are and i guess she proceeded to do that because after all of these personal stories
she made some some pointed comments that it was pretty clear even though she never said president trump who they were directed at the america of john mccain is generous and welcoming and old she is resourceful confident secure
she meets her responsibilities
she speaks quietly because she's strong america does not both because she has no need to
the america john mccain has no need to be made great again because america was always great

i think it's really interesting
plus start out kind of feigned but then people are kind of testing the waters she's a first person to speak and this has just gotten very political and then the applause really grill at one of the bigger applause lines i think we saw throughout the entire service yeah i mean there were a lot of laughs it at some of the jokes and funny stories that were going to hear later but that was that was definitely a moment that
you know and i was wondering what people like a bunker triumphant jared kushner in the audience thought but there was a lot of applause for that there was one other moment from from meghan mccain speech that we should listen to and it was a mix of those two themes were talking about because she was talking about her personal relationship with her dad but then also contrasting him with with
the way that politics has devolved into personal insult politics he was a great man
we gather here to mourn the passing of american greatness
the real thing not cheap rhetoric from men will never come near the sacrifice he gave so willingly nor the opportunistic appropriation of those who live lives of comfort and privilege while he suffered and served their we hear mccain making a veiled reference to the fact that president trump received a number
or of deference to avoid going to vietnam some are related to him being in school and there was also a medical deferment but he yes he did not serve and it was added the time than john mccain was in a prisoner of war camp when it comes to serving are not serving in vietnam you could go through the whole front row of the funeral and in and look at that as well with president bush and clinton but i think a thing that
meghan mccain was saying pointedly there but that other speakers talked about as well was the idea that john mccain was clearly a partisan person he had a point of view he liked to pick fights and he did so regularly with obama and bush and they both noted that but it wasn't it wasn't a petty lowest common denominator insult just just
trying to tear people down in a way that that a lot of politics seems to be right now but i also think the partisanship that was kind of a repeated target throughout the service today is bigger than just donald trump it was there was a lot of bemoaning of the the pettiness and hasn't affected our politics going back farther than the current presidential administration
appeals to the the ability the john mccain showed two years to be a partisan brawl at times but also to work across the aisle on issues such as immigration reform on issues such as campaign finance reform and there were attributed that from both of the men who beat john mccain in his efforts to win the white house for president george w
bush and former president while and they both were pretty candid at the top of their their eulogies saying that they had pretty nasty battles with the two thousand republican primary was pretty tough the two thousand and a general election was pretty tough and they both joked about it bush said that mccain could be a pain in his side but over the years they've talked
they would go over those old campaigns like he compared it to football players going over a big game moments before my last debate
ever
with senator john kerry in phoenix or are trying to gather
some thought and the holding room
i felt a presence
open my eyes
and six inches from my face was mccain who yelled relax relax
that sounds very relaxed good story
so that that were a lot of the speeches were like them and joe lieberman had all these stories about traveling with with mccain and other countries it's kind of ridiculous moments they found themselves in but speakers like bush always kept back getting back this idea that mccain had this cold he lived by bush talk about it kind of like he was a western character
john was above all a man with a cold
he lived by a set of public virtues that raw strength and purpose to his life and to this country
he was courageous where the kurds that right and his captors and inspired his countrymen
he was honest no matter who get offended
presidents were not fair
he was honorable always recognizing that his opponents were still patriots are human beings he loves freedom with a passion of a man who knew its actions
he respected that dignity and in every life
the that does not stop it borders and cannot be erased by dictators
perhaps above all john detested the abuse of power obviously john mccain had been himself a victim of torture as a p o w and one of the things he and george w bush tangled over was the torture or enhanced interrogation tactics that were used by the united states in the wake of nine eleven
former president bush alluded to those disagreements they have but he said he wanted me to be better he wanted america to be better and before with this into obama i totally missed this when this happened did one of you did either of you catch this cough drop moment in the front row and do we can we explain what what went down it seems like me
maybe michelle obama had like a typical if throw it away as coughing or something and then there is that is little flurry of activity and laura bush handed george w bush something and then he pass it over to michelle and some people thought they were passing notes suddenly turns out it was kidney or a cough drop or something
she was coming through with cough drop in the per
very sweet little moment
i was curious to hear what obama would have to say because we just don't hear that much it from barack obama these days he aside from facebook post is not waited directly into current politics that much and given the tone of the week services of these these subtle and not so subtle rebukes to president true
i was really curious to hear what obama had to say and i think i'd say by and large the bulk of the speech was these themes we talked about before mccain as a statesman mccain is somebody who who tangled but tried to be honorable about it the most important thing i think obama said was that when he and john mccain would fight on policy he said we knew we were on the same team we didn't we
questions each other's views were questions each other's policies but we didn't question each other's patriotism or sincerity we respected that we were both trying to preserve what we thought was a vision of america and the former than obama let is what i think has been closely guarded secret until now which is that while he
was in the office mccain would occasionally make unannounced visits and they would spend time together just talking out of the spotlight talking about family talking about politics talking about their respective visions for the country and disagreeing and obama said that he was fine with that because they disagreed very passionately and thought that was a good thing to talk about the areas where they disagreed
and to still keep talking obama also made reference to something had happened in the two thousand and eight campaign and we've we've seen a lot of reference to this during the course of the week because we've been remembering john mccain that was a moment during that campaign when john mccain confronted one of his own supporters who had falsely claim that
obama was not american
video clip has been shown repeatedly this week and barack obama said at the time he appreciated but he wasn't as he was not surprised and he thought that in doing that john mccain was not defending his on obama is on but also america's honor and the way that campaigns or to be conducted as met this spirit we celebrate this week
that striving to be better
to do better
to be worthy
of the great inheritance that our founders the
so much of our politics
public life our public discourse
can seem small
and me
and petty
trafficking and bomb best an insult
and falling controversies and manufactured outrage
it's a politics that pretends to be
brave and tough but in fact as more fear
john called on us to be bigger than that
he called on us to be better than that and we heard a lot of that during the service today now away from obama and bush for pro other speakers as well who said that one of the reason we've seen such an outpouring
of emotion during this last week surrounding john mccain is that i think a lot of americans do hunger for some sense that we are better than our current politics and there was wish from joe lieberman the former connecticut senator who was almost john mccain is running mate in two thousand eight even those of have been a democrat turn independent
who said it in his death
john mccain has really given americans kind of a reminder of who we have the potential to be i will say i'll be the down or here and symbol of it on is that this is the kind of sentiment that we hear a lot when there been a tragedy or a loss in washington there's us to talk about coming together with happen after baseball shooting
whereas discouragement currency policeman shot just a little over a year ago
and as much as people in washington i think would like their it'd be the spaced for that to happen it just hasn't really happened and things that if anything after the shooting
i've seen one of the most bitter political years museum in a long time whether or not mccain is ever greater stature and or have more weight and that that another question altogether this was the last public ceremony yesterday john mccain was became just the thirty first american to lie in state in the us capital
scott can you fill us in around the last part of the ceremony is what happens next
john mccain is going to be buried on sunday on the grounds of the us naval academy were course he was cadet and he he he racked up a lot of demerits while he was there he was a rebellious cadet courses his both his father and grandfather were highly decorated maybe admirals he is three
asked he hated his time at the naval academy but some of his great old friends have been laid to rest there and that's where he chose to be buried so we're going to end with this we've we've obviously talked a lot about john mccain this week in we're going to and playing a clip that we played earlier this year when it first came out and this was a clip from the afterward
of of the last book that mccain wrote that came out he wrote it knowing he was dying and this afterward was kind of recorded as a as a good goodbye message from john mccain who knew he wasn't going to return to the senate or return to public life for speak through anything to statements three to listen to part of that again have a great good fortune this spend sixty years and the employ of our can
three defending our country security advancing our country's ideals supporting our country indispensable contribution to the progress of humanity
it's not been perfect sure wish to be sure and there were times when the country might have benefited from the last of my help
but i've tried to deserve the privilege and have been we paid a thousand times over with adventure and discoveries with good company and with the satisfaction of serving something more important than my shelf
of being a bit player story
mark has true
