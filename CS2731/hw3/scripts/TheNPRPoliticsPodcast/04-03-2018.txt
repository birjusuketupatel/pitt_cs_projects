
guys this is patty daniels and i have a marriage test morocco at the night market downtown this episode and of the npr politics pod cast to it's recorded at two forty four pm on april third and things are probably changed since then keep up with all your politics news with envy
at first i pod cast at n p r dot org or by listening to your favorite in yeah i remember station
okay
where's the show
hey there it's the npr politics pod cast president trump said today he's considering sending the military to guard parts of the us mexico border because what he calls week immigration laws or two we could have a proper security we're going to be gone
our order with the villager the president has been treating for days about immigration we'll talk about why and a whole bunch of cities and states are suing to try to remove a question from the twenty twenty census i'm tamer keep the white house for npr i'm i'm medical much in our own political editor and more elias a national police
correspondent hello amara you were in this press conference the president trump just had that's right i was it was an interesting press conference and it leads to watch on t v because it was president trump and three leaders of baltic nations sets right so there are four liters altogether in the east room but right before that when he sat down
with the baltic leaders in the cabinet room he talked for fifteen minutes so he kind of had to press conferences today and he kind of set a lot of staff yes he answered a lot of questions and in particular he talked a lot about immigration which happens to be this thing that he has been treating about ever since he treated
happy easter well the president has been really focused on immigration for the last couple of days he's been treating that there's not going to be a doc a deal he's been very fixated on this caravan this group of mostly hondurans that have been traveling through mexico headed for the us border that something that he has been seeing a lot
what about on fox news and he announced today that he is going to be sending the military to guard the border with mexico or two we could have a wall and proper security were bit of regarding our order with the villager that's a big step we really haven't done that before certainly not very much
well he knows that we have done it before and that's why he added that qualifier because both george w bush and president barack obama did deploy national guard troops at least to the border but he said he's going to be meeting with defense secretary matters to talk about the details of this it's not as easy as he makes it sound because the us military does not patrol
in civilian areas unless they're unless the national guard is called up by the governors of those states and president obama did that for a couple different reasons most notably politics because he was trying to get a comprehensive immigration reform bill through so couple of years after when he had sent more of those national guard to go there but also because
cause of the increase in border crossings or were far more people coming across the border in two thousand and ten than there are today except that they are anticipating a surge because we're getting to the summer season and they're anticipating a surge of and accompanied alien children is what they call them you a sees but you know what's really
interesting about this is that if politics were behind the president obama deploying national guard troops to the border politics are definitely behind donald trump's current moves he wants to be seen as being active he's worried about his base for the first time ever donald trump did something that angered his base which was he say
sign that big omnibus spending bill which did not include full funding for his border wall and he's gotten a lot of push back because of that and now he's trying to show that he's an activist he's working hard stop illegal immigration he's been talking about sending military troops to the border talking about know dhaka deal so
he is intent on trying to satisfy his supporters so all of this to eating and talking about the border had me thinking about i did this story about president trump and and how he performs in depositions and in two thousand and sixteen he sat down for a deposition
related to an argument over a restaurant and his hotel and it stemmed from his comments about mexico not sending its best people it was a dispute about that and in that deposition he talks about how you know he's really tapped into something that talking about mexico talking about immigration he
has tapped into something in america and that it's working for him and he was very assertive
clear eyed about the naked politics of it all in that deposition and this just feels like he's going back to this thing that worked for absolutely i mean look in august of last year went back and looked when i wrote this piece about president trump going back to grievance politics and his poll numbers were sliding and that's when he brought
in tom cotton and center purdue from georgia cotton been senator from arkansas to talk about trying to reduce legal immigration so he always seems to come back to immigration as the thing to try to fire up his base and let's be honest congress is to do much of anything between now and november so
so in order to keep the republican base of the base that was buying prison trump behind him and behind republicans he brings this up and brings up it seems immigration almost out of the blue to be able to have something that he can push a message on this is something you're gonna see i think regularly between now and know
ember he's going to look for every opportunity he can to join up the base because as we know from polling the democrats are more excited and energized than the republicans and he needs he's always paid attention to his bases never seem to care much about expanding his base but for those thirty to forty percent of americans who like him he's going to be looking for opportunities whether it's him
gracious stories about a caravan i wouldn't be surprised if you see other things like athletes kneeling during the national anthem things that are cultural flashpoints that he can focus on because this is what got him to the white house and he thinks this is what's going to help him and his party in november third dominican can we just quickly talk about this caravan
it is a caravan of people of migrants that are mostly came from honduras
we don't even really know if they're headed for the united states necessarily would you know that mexico has basically stopped it at this point
president noted in that press conference that it happened twelve minutes ago as of twelve minutes ago i don't think it was that specific
it had happened a little bit before that but that i guess you know he was watching this supposed caravan of people coming from honduras which by the way hundred vs one of the most dangerous countries in this hemisphere you might remember in two thousand and fourteen there was the unaccompanied minors crisis because of the uptick in violence in some of those central american
countries and then those folks are seeking asylum and they're also interestingly according to our colleague carry this is sort of a publicity stunt like in part the caravan was about trying to generate publicity for the plight of these migrants and then bam they get picked up
by the president of the united states and it becomes it's good politics all around right i mean they get to be able to raise the issue get some attention president trump is always going to take this paid because he wants this to be an issue the white house did this conference call yesterday where they were saying that they have concerns about the immigration was da
the deferred action for childhood arrivals that doesn't seem like the white house feels like there is some sort of a legislative fix for that at this point and it's caught up in the courts but they are talking about maybe a new package of legislation earth does that just feel like not really it almost feels like sometimes the president tweet something
thing and then they have to back filled with substance and potential the legislation they also say that anytime the congress discussing conveying some kind of a benefit or relief on people who are in the country illegally it acts as a quote poll factor it encourages other people to come to the country and be here illegally
so that's that's their argument but donald trump started this whole discussion when he ended darker when he lifted the protection from deportation on these kids and started talking about perhaps legislating darker doing something he said he loved these kids and the question this raises is when and if the courts resolve this
well he began deporting them or will the courts not resolve it in that direction we don't know we don't know okay
so there there was some other news or kind of a lot of other news but we're just going to pick a couple of things from the various times that we are from president trump today
one thing that he has eluded to before but he put a finer point on today was syria the us has boots on the ground in syria we may not technically call them boots on the ground but the us has military operations in syria united just have a casualty in syria there was an american
soldier who was killed by a roadside bomb as well as several other coalition members in an area by the way they used to be fairly safe according to our correspondent tom and and this is a big deal in his rally in ohio last week the president said he wanted troops to come out of syria very soon and this is not just something that the president bush
about he had already frozen about two hundred million dollars in assistance for syria in the effort to rebuild the country and he is said today i want to get out of syria i want to bring our troops home i want to rebuild our nation we've spent seven trillion dollars
in the middle east over seventeen years we haven't gotten anything out of it he has said that many that many times he said we've got nothing except for death and destruction but the interesting thing to me is this is exactly what he campaigned against pulling us troops out of syria now would be a huge gift to iran and russia and potentially isis which the press
that and says one of the reasons he wants to pull out his were pretty much done with our job of decimating isis but he campaigned against obama putting an end date on military involvement in certain countries he said the bad guys just wait you out when you tell them that you're leaving and this is something that i know he's getting pushed back from the pentagon about
but this has deep instinct he ran against getting involved in foreign wars his base doesn't want the are spending money abroad they want the us government spending money here so this is something that he feels very strong about it's kind of along with immigration and trade not getting bogged down or involved with boots on the ground in other country
is something that's really part of base trump isn't it but it almost sounds like it it sounded like you were just contradicting yourself
i mean it always morals
no longer so i know the i'm united states the fact is this trump doctrine is unclear this foreign policy doctrine is inconsistent when it comes to the ideological doctrine of like what do you wind up doing what do you believe you should do it's very unclear for the united states and for its our
lies around the world it's unclear because it's hard to be a hawkish isolationist i mean yeah yes i'm a and wants to project strength strength and toughness is the bedrock of the trump brand as he sees it he wants to be strong against iran against north korea but he doesn't like spending
money and doing the hard slogging work of not just vanquished thing enemies like isis but once they're vanquished what do you do to make sure they don't come back what do you do to make sure that a country like syria can be stable and what do you do to make sure that iran and russia don't fill the vacuum that
you're creating by pulling out so those are those are questions that that you know he doesn't really have the answer to but we know that jim mantis my pump hail and certainly john bolton when he arrives do have opinions
i just wonder looking at twenty twenty and the president going up for reelection how he might have to wind twisting himself into something of a pretzel in china make the case because it's really easy when you run against something that you're so the polar opposite of to be able to make a very simple argument rather than
a nuanced one trying to defend what you've done because he was able to save and we should just bomb them and take the oil
just say that today again he said yeah i always said we should keep the oil we didn't keep the whale isis got the right but when you look at what the united states is undergoing with emissions that they're trying to put in place he owns the stuff now and it's not as simple as saying bomb them take the oil and then people look and see what is actually
opening on the ground in a place that's very complicated like the middle east like iraq like syria those are areas that don't i've never had simple solutions he had campaigned on those but what's so interesting to me is i get why he's talking about mexico and the caravan his base is upset and he wants to show them with his signature issue that he still
working hard to build the wall stop illegal immigration etc
syria to me is more interesting because it kind of came out of the blue it's not like we're seeing syria and the headlines every day it's not like there's a kind of big discussion in the united states about whether we should be in syria i think we have a couple thousand and true blown syria
that's pretty interesting that's just his deep instincts
one more news item and we will keep this brief but this week all eyes are on scott pruitt the administrator now we have no reason to believe that he is eminently leaving however he is clouded in controversy there are a number of stories about potential ethical lapses
around him and their mara has been some word coming from the white house on that well we know the donald trump talk to scott brewer and everything else that i have heard is that proves on thin ice i think if you had a white house pull and asked white house aides whether he would survive and
not they would be betting heavily against him there are people in the white house who feels that his ethical problems are just too many you know he was accused of renting a room at a below market rate from a lobbyist and he'd made a ruling that was in favor of that lobbyists client he's been criticized
for high price travel and other expenses and these thing the kinds of things that are mounting up are very similar to the kinds of problems that put an end to the career of tom price the ha just secretary so i wouldn't bet that scott drew it is going to stick around for very long though this is all coming and it's really interesting time at the
just today scott pruitt announced a rollback of emissions standards vehicle emissions standards this is a reversal of obama era environmental policy it's a big win for president trump this is part of his regulatory roll back and pruitt is doing
exactly what president trump and many republicans want the administrator to do however the other stuff is getting more headlines in many ways there's been no more important time if you're a supporter of president trumps for what's happening at the right now because of the roll back
it's that they are undergoing and yes of course they could put in place somebody who could push through president trumps anti regulation agenda but scott pro it is somebody who knows where the bodies are buried at the he he sued the several times when he was the attorney general and okay
palmer this is a job he was made for the undoing of the regulatory structure at the and i think president trump ban trouble with the white house know that and maybe maybe they're going to push through some of these rollbacks and then you might see him depart who knows yeah and the other thing is that one of the keys to surviving
the in the trunk cabinet is to not have a higher profile than the president on anything and there has been some grumbling in the white house about scott prove it's obvious ambitions to either be the attorney general if jeff sessions should ever be removed from that position and he also wants to run for hire
office in oklahoma and i think that he hasn't kept his head down and played by the rule yet because there have been a lot of rumors that if jeff sessions goes because remember president trump had his sights focused on jeff sessions for quite some time on twitter and there are a lot of blind quotes in a lot of places floating scott
druids name and there's a lot of suspicions within the white house of where that came from was talking to a republican yesterday who was telling me you know it's probably not a coincidence that all of these articles are coming out about pruitt right now that all of these documents are being leaked that in this environment with this level of backbiting
that scott peru it has found himself in the cross hairs also remember a week before a charming master was ousted from the white house president trump had said that he has confidence and make master sarah sand or so that there was no problems
they both get along so maybe it's a little bit like a scene from one of those bob movies you bring them closer he give a big kiss on the lips might be close but he's never good for the roi yeah so let's hear what that sounds like president tramp was asked today about his feelings about skype
i hope he's gonna be great remember when he said about rex tellers and after he fired i'm i'm sure rex is going to be happier now
has anyone checked in with for extortion
i bet he's happier now
okay we're going to take a quick break we're going to say goodbye to demean ago and mara bye bye guys think you and when we come back we will talk census you know you guys want to hear about the us census and the tramp administration has announced it's adding a citizenship question to the twenty twenty census and it's causing a
a lot of controversy you gotta knock some sense essence of this pod cast who whole group
and that's pretty good
billy right
i'm linda hand there's more stuff to watch these days than you can ever get to that's why he made pop culture happy hour twice a week we give you the lowdown on what's worth your time and what's not find pop culture happy hour on the npr one app or wherever you get your pardon
and we're back and we are going to talk about the us census there are a whole bunch of cities and states suing to try to remove a question from the two thousand and two thousand census the trump administration said last week that every single person filling out the census this time around will be asked
whether or not there a us citizen the justice department had asked for that information and i am join now by none other than ronaldo being hello term iran and we have a very special guest huntley low long hello honky hate him hey hey so we have you here with us because you
anything census i do end you've been very busy here
so we're going to dig into the controversy surrounding in particular this one question about citizenship and some other things but first let's just bare bones why does the census matter so much sense as manner so much because it's one of the few requirements the founding fathers wrote in the constitution so
something that we actually have to carry out which is a head count every person living in the us every ten years in order to reapportionment seats in congress every ten years yeah so ron the politics part of this matters enormously how many people there are in your state because that determines how many seats you get in congress above the minimum
mama one and then matters within the state because where these people are then becomes the guide for drawing the maps for determining how you're going to elect those representatives from among the people in your state so that's the first thing and then after that the federal government relies on this highly important statistical base to do strip
butte all kind of funds basically all kinds of discretionary funds that are spent domestically things other than social security and medicare are distributed on the basis of where the people are where the population may live so these numbers guide the dollars for the next ten years and by the way we should mention because it might be
more than casual interest to some people that how many seats a state has in the house of representatives also determines how many votes it has in the electoral college that chooses the president of the united states are the analogy i like to use is that the census it's like the plumbing that makes her democracy work you don't think about it but when it's not working
no it's a big deal so
i want to get to this controversy this thing that was sort of sprung last week in was i guess it wasn't a surprise to your hands he because you've been covering the census but there is going to be a new question on that form that goes to every american what is that question so this question
going to ask is this person a citizen of the united states and you'll have five options one of which obviously is no not a us citizen but if you are a us citizen you can specify if you're born in the united states and puerto rico guam where the territory's born abroad of us citizen parent or parents or your you're a citizen by naturalization
and you print the year of your naturalization and this is the wording that's currently used in a smaller census bureau survey known as the american community survey goes out to more than three point five million people a year in the united states now sarah sanders the white house press secretary last week when this announcement was made sheets
it down played it
let's hear what she had to say this is a question that's been included in every since the since nine hundred and sixty five with the exception of twenty ten hour when it was removed
we've contained to this question that's provided data that's necessary for the department of justice to protect voters
specifically to help us better comply with the voting rights act there's some nuance hear what is true is that the last time the census asked all us households about citizenship was in nineteen fifty
and after that the earth
census that was presented to all us households did not have a citizenship question but there was a thing known as the long form questionnaire the census which broken up into a short form and long form questionnaires and beginning and nine hundred and seventy the long form questionnaire included citizenship question but the long form did not
go to every us household
and that long from is now known as the american community survey which goes out to more than three point five million households every year but three point five million is not one hundred and how many households do we have in america one hundred fifty million two hundred twenty seven oh thank you and but i think the point is that for more than half century
every household in the us has not been required to answer a question about citizenship soaps who it is a really big deal
so sensitive question too because the the fear on the part of many who advocate for the community of immigrants and people who are recent immigrant is that if you do have anyone in your household who has any question about their legality you are going to be highly wary of filling out a form that identify
thighs that pack and identifies that person and then of course when someone comes to your door following up because you didn't turn in your census form you're going to have the same set of fears you're going to think well this is the law this is ice this is the homeland security department coming to look for that person in my home so
it's not going to be a great incentive to cooperate to fill out this form completely an answer all those questions about everyone who might be in home and this is actually confirmed by census bureau's own research it does research leading up to the big count and its own researchers in the field testing out the questions i'm actually not including the citizenship question because we only just got this
news but they have noticed especially an increased fear amongst immigrants when just doing testing of the senses and we should say that it is not legal to use census information for law enforcement purpose
federal law prohibits the census bureau from releasing any data that would identify and individual but something to keep in mind is that the census bureau can release to federal agencies information about specific population groups so wouldn't specify someone's name but it could identify specific characteristics of a group and i guess a lot of people probably i mean like what
oh that this is part of the the roll out of the census every every ten years
is a big advertising campaign
to put that messaging out there yes i'm from the government i'm here to help you and you can trust me i won't use this data in any way that might be inimical to your interests except of course but the reason we're asking this citizenship question is because the secretary of commerce wilbur ross says he's doing it to help law enforcement
he's doing it to help the department of justice so what is one to conclude from that statement what is one to conclude from that arrangement between justice and commerce if not that this is being done in some sense to help law enforcement now maybe people are going to be able to parse one kind of helping law enforcement statistically
came from the kind of helping law enforcement that means turning people over to the man and this is really the core of the arguments that new york and sixteen other states as well as california which found a lawsuit last week
this is part of the argument they're trying to make in their complaints against wilbur us and the census bureau yeah let's talk about that this suit is being filed today there was the one filed last week by the state of california what is their main legal argument what is their main concern first that adding a question about citizenship is unconstitutional because the constitution requires a government to do
what the actual warnings actual enumeration and so they're arguing that we know that based on research and based on the current anti immigrant sentiment that this will they alleged decrease their response rate of the census especially amongst immigrant populations and so therefore the government can't carry out its constitution of responsibility of counting
every person that seats and so therefore it's unconstitutional and then the other main argument is that this is against what is known as the administrative procedure act and essentially prohibits federal agencies from taking actions that are arbitrary and really is a misuse of discretion
it's citing number of reasons these different complaints of why it feels that this is very arbitrary partly what i just stated about the decrease response rate also that this question has not been tested which this is a point of contention between the commerce secretary and these different states here
cities and the us conference of mayors that has this question been tested commerce secretary argues that since we're using the wording of the citizens strip question that is currently on the american community survey therefore we know how respondents may may take to this question but the seats are arguing you see these are arguing the earth's conference of mayors arguing
arguing that the census bureau has not tested this question in the context of what is known as the sentinels census is not tested it in the question that's going to go out to all us households so this is kind of new territory and the census bureau generally does not do this because this has could have big impact on dave equality and wed wilbur ross
in his commerce secretary and his justification for this what he said i think is that while there is no empirical evidence that it will do that bad things that everybody says it will do and it sounds like what you're saying is there's also no empirical evidence that at well that's the rub essentially and secretary
ross saying this is on its memo that they came out a monday night which kicked off all of this proving the justice department's requests he basically said the need for a better count of us citizens outweighs all these concerns my impression is that there is a good deal of evidence that if you ask people questions that get them started
wondering about whether or not answering them honestly is going to get them into trouble
you are almost automatically and i believe there is evidence for this you are our most automatically a depressing the number of people who are going to find so for example it's been estimated in past years and i'm not talking about this next census where the last one but that in past years as many as six percent of all the african americans in the united
states were not counted because for one reason or another they didn't cooperate with a census perception is a really really big part of you know whether you get an accurate count or not and the census bureau has as run was mentioning a long history of their number of what what is known as hard to count populations they include immigrant populations especially on author
the many immigrants and communities of color so this is a big concern and there's also another lawsuit filed by the end of p last week really concerned that the sense spirits not prepared to carry out a full accurate count especially of communities of color now these these states and cities that are suing to try to block this are they all blue
states is this lake another red stay blue state thing or what are these states have in common
a lot of the seats are blue states but it's also a number of cities like new york philadelphia seattle san francisco but also includes a bipartisan group of mayors in the unites in the us conference of mayors i was at the recent conference of the us conference of mayors a recent meeting in d dc and you had a republican and democratic marriage
saying were really concerned this will affect our population counts and and also affect the case that we can make essentially saying you know our population has grown or or specific changes within the demographics of our population is going to hurt them when they're trying to make their case for more federal dollars from or services
and also affect them local for local planning were to improve roads where to invest more in schools based on the population count
but this isn't quite answer your question camden
well you know there are a lot of blue states that are suing it's true but the effect that this would have might very well be more broadly distributed for example texas and florida have very large populations of people who might have either an acquaintance who is undocumented or might have someone who is undocumented living in their home arizona also far
in that category and if we're talking largely about poor households people of color or people who for one reason or another
might have some concerns about filling out the census those are also disproportionately states that voted for donald trump or that would be considered red states states with very high proportions of low income households okay so one question that i saw a bunch floating around on line is this idea of or why
should even be counting people who aren't citizens so let me pose that to you guys why why why is the us counting people who aren't americans the constitution doesn't make a distinction between citizens and non citizens when doing this headcount is a rate run that is correct i was gonna say the simplest answer is because we
i always have the effect of the matter is it supposed to be measuring how many people are in the country not how many people in the country are citizens it's supposed to be measuring where people are and who people or and that is what it is all about an actual enumeration so the constitution is pretty clear
people would like to be well people would like not to use statistical sampling to replace the actual enumeration because statistical sampling if it's done scientifically would not have a lot of the problems of inaccuracy of the problem of people's refusal that we have with the current enumeration but the supreme court decided back
nineteen ninety eight that the constitution was plain about saying actual enumeration a nose count a headcount whichever you want to call it not statistical sampling not the best evidence of what science can produce but an actual headcount and the constitution is also plane in terms of including every one so for those who want to stick with
constitution they would have to take the part of that they don't like as was the part they do although it's important to remember it originally the constitution required that are enslaved people be counted as root three fifths of a person so before he leaves your hands there are other questions that are sort of new or then the work there there's potential the
learn new things in this census that's right tell us about that well when really interesting changes to the race question for the first time people who mark off the boxes for white or black are going to be asked to rate in their non hispanic origins and on the form the census bureau going to provide examples
something like german irish african american or jamaican and so that's good to be a really interesting
that's going to be really interesting set of data and then the other interesting change if we have time for it is relationship question so the census spear always asks within a household how people are related
for the first time the boxes among the boxes are going to be options that will differentiate between same sex and opposite sex couples how does it differentiate between married and not married or yes so there's a box for same sex and opposite sex
husband wife spouse
and then also another one for same sex or opposite sex
unmarried partner and this is not the first time the census bureau bureau's tried to count the number of same sex couples nine hundred ninety when it added a category for unmarried partner
it started basically taking how people respond to the relationship question and matching that with how people answered the question about their sex and then figure it out okay these are the people were same sex couples he are people who are opposite sex with different sex couples and
in two thousand and twenty ten actually
reports about these numbers and what it found was that difference some different sex couples accidentally mark the wrong box for their sex and so they were accidentally counted as same sex couples in the census bureau's initial estimates so this change adding this change of differentiating between same sex opposite sex couples and it is
way the census bureau says in order is a way to collect more accurate data about same sex couples which for now is a really small percentage of the population and so just having a few mistakes demographers you're telling me that can really distort the numbers that we get about same sex couples estimates that spirit puts out so in terms of controversy these days
two changes do not rank anywhere near this isn't citizenship question or do they well certainly we haven't seen a lawsuits over these changes but i think the thing is is that it's only two thousand and eighteen
and unless you've been listening to n p r you may not have heard about these changes and so when i'm really curious i'm really really curious once all of america sees the actual form
in the mail on the phone
when they try to answer on the phone or they go online for the first time to respond to the census what they will think about these new questions these new check boxes
i had i think that is it for today hands he thank you so much for joining us you're very welcome bring in all that census knowledge i suspect we will have you back talk radicals again that's that's fine thank you for having and for the rest of you we will be back in your feed soon i keep up with
