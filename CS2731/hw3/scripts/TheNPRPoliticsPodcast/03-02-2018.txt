
hi we are britain and kristin after currently at the winter beer dabbling in saint paul minnesota which is a beer festival outdoors in february and it's snowing this broadcast was recorded at winter beer devil or is a great name it is two o five eastern on thursday march first which happens to be all say it my half birthday happy
thank you things may have changed by the time you listening to keep up with all of npr political coverage over it and pr dot org the npr one app and your local public radio station
here's the show
it's the npr politics pod cast here with our weekly round up of political news guns are still dominating washington but congress has come and gone this week without taking any major steps toward passing anything president trunk took the gun debate and turned it on it yesterday with another me
made for t the meeting where he agreed with democrats more than republicans and at the end of this week president from finds himself more isolated than ever one of his closest and most trusted aide hope x is stepping down and his son in law jared kushner has lost his top secret security clearance i'm scott debt heroic of congress for npr
i was going to work with the white house and less mythology political reporter and i'm wrong and of your correspondent has everybody doing can i just say i'm very excited to be in a pod cast me to scott study see cleared been in the pod cast which is before that's true yeah because you had left before the to scott era really fully began this is quite novel for me
so i just like this national very honored
this was yet another one of those weeks that i've started to think if we didn't start the fire weeks with there's so many different stories you could just kind of round the whole song now if you wanted to but the main theme this week as it was last week was god's we've been talking a lot lately in the pod casts about guns that about the moment we're in for the shooting at marjorie still
douglas high school in florida whether there's something different going on that might actually lead to policy changes or not and this week felt a bit more like it was in the or not category at least in congress but on the other hand there was one of those off script white house meetings with trumpet lawmakers were once again at least in that
meaning and that is something we will talk about trump sounded more like a democrat or republican i like taking the generally like in this case just impatient
as far as shit
she couldn't lose shit but the goes first go through precious
so i said it sounded more like a democrat but in that moment saying take the guns that's the character of the democratic views or something they push back on but here he is a republican president saying that ended me say this like in response to mike pence his own v p coming out and and suggesting somewhat of a more nuanced stands i mean that sort of amazing
yeah there's a lot here and there's a lot of specific moments and exchanges with democrats than republicans but you know we've done this so many times before where we're kind of standard gawk looking at a live unscripted moment that does not have much president so i think in this conversation let's try and like take a step back and ron just the setting
scripted miss what trump were saying are not saying what stuck out to you about this moment having seen the movie before scott we've seen it a couple of times we saw it back in the fall when the president sat down with quote remember this chuck and nancy
and also a bunch of republican leaders from congress and sided with the two democratic leaders of the house and senate on a raft of issues that the republicans thought he was going to stand firm on and said you know i think we can get a deal on dhaka and we can get that done really quickly check nancy didn't know what to say they were so taken aback and then we saw it again on immigration just a few weeks
oh and the president had another one of these live white house gatherings whole hour live on tv when you've got a bunch of republicans and bunch of democrats and he starts right in insulting some of his own republican members of congress sam to pat toomey of pennsylvania for example you sound like you're afraid of the and our a because you won't raise or the gun age to twenty one
and then and then saying a lot of things that implied for example to dianne feinstein that he might be okay with going back to the assault weapons ban yeah that was the biggest anathema of the last fifty years for the end so this was an astonishing thing but the first two ended with president not doing any of those things that he said he would do in those comp
francis and an act aggressively tanking proposals to do those things the parallel would be as if to me and mansion and chris murphy and john corner and come back to the president and say mr president we did just what you told us we've put together a package deal to have universal background checks we think we can get sixty votes and then trump turn around said okay that's good
but now you got an ad concealed carry and torpedoed it that's that would be what we saw have been on immigration and ran and veto that's right
if they don't what once wasn't one of those moments that ron you mention in i'm on it and what get your thoughts on the whole situation because it's a back and forth with pat toomey who's a republican senator from pennsylvania who right after sandy hook he and joe manage in west virginia democrat put together a background check measure that got more than fifty votes in the center
but not the sixty it needed pat toomey really in that moment put his neck out and was criticized by the and are a and here's what trump says to to me in the cabinet room will
well think the fed
they were doing great people are great
but that doesn't mean we have to
it doesn't make sense that the weight off twenty one thing going to get this it
searchers just curious
we didn't interest think annoying
so awesome a pat to me is one of the republicans who clearly kept trying to keep trump as far away as possible in two thousand and sixteen he never rejected trumps candidacy he tried to do the arms length dance he did end up voting for trumpet he clearly wasn't happy about it but he
like many republicans have made this really uncomfortable peace with the president and where do they get for it they get him insulting him on live television and pushing these policies that republicans disagree with it is in in scotland strikes me so much about what we heard the president say in that meeting is the in some ways it seems like he's speaking to his republican base voters are
what do you mean by that is actually we just pulled recently with abscess on essentially what both republicans and democrats feel around gun policy and the football come out tomorrow but just a glimpse of it is that actually over ninety percent of americans do support mandatory background checks for organ buyers
we're seeing an increasing number of both republicans and democrats calling for stricter gun laws and when i hear the president makes me feel as if he actually understands what the republican voters want any speaking to then perhaps you could argue he's even a little bit maybe more in sync with them then sort of traditional republican
medical officials who do seem very loyal to the energy and who knows where the president's going to be right in terms of the enter a one day he saying that other folks have to sort of in bed with the and hurry but the next day he's talking about in treating about his support for the enter a but i think that we're we're seeing him talk about overall wanting some comprehensive gun reform bill
thanks to the fact that a lot of republican voters at this point also feel that way what exactly they want in it who knows but they want some sort of change and were beginning to see that in polling as well and joe mansion the conservative democrat from a conservative state of west virginia made an interesting point yesterday were
the president was suggesting that the reason to me mansion failed in two thousand and thirteen was the former president obama just didn't try hard enough to push the bill across the finish line president obama put an awful lot of political capital on the line early in his second term to try to get that done and just couldn't imagine said is what's different is trump hands credibility
with gun owners with second amendment supporters with and are a members that barack obama did not and so there is kind of a nixon in to opportunity here though and trump to win some kind of gun safety measure that would have been out of reach with a democrat in the white house the ron it doesn't seem like trump were saying i firmly believe this
specific thing is the solution it seemed like there were a lot of moments where he just wanted to say i stand up to the enter a more than you do more than obama he seemed to have a scattershot approach here jumping on a lot of different proposals arming teachers hardening schools as sites
making sure that this age for long guns is raised to twenty one a number of things by the way that all paul well all paul well and when the president had his television do dog several weeks ago on immigration he was again taking a series of positions that all paul well then the next day he's treating to is
space and even back last fall in the budget issue nobody likes government shutdowns so the president was trying to avoid government shutdown but then in the end didn't do any of the things that he was offering to the democrats so he has a very high sensitivity to the polling results were the american people are he likes to speak to that but then he feels to play
deeply free could turn around the next day and do something utterly different on policy from enron you're so right about how acutely aware he is of a polling rate i mean we've seen sort of widespread support for a whole number of gun control policy suggestions and actually in our poll that's going to come out tomorrow the only gun control policy
that was opposed by a majority of americans is the idea of training teachers to carry guns in schools but would i find so interesting is that is something for which there are clear deep partisan divide and the issue and you do have a majority of republicans supporting that idea so it kind of makes sense that we hear the president speaking out of one side of his mouth that he wants to raise the age they to purchase again
also favors the idea of training teachers it's precisely what we see some voters want the persons report cold water on a related idea to arming teachers though and that's this concealed carry reciprocity bill that has been pushing their number one priority has been a bill that would let someone who has a permit to carry concealed weapon in one state carry in all fifty
states and even though the present himself says he's for that he argued against folding it into this overall bill because he said it would it's chances you couldn't get the votes in the senate i think
maybe some pitch
if you're going to put conceal carry between fit into this pill which talking about all the wall
you know i'm when he would let it be a separate
this conceal carry to this you'll never get
he's right about that so as were all saying it's hard to put too much stock in meetings like this and the question is what comes next right so soon after the meaning chris murphy democrat from connecticut who has been probably the leading democratic voice on on gun measures tweets of the present it just committed to support universal background checks protective orders and
raising the age for rifle purchases if he he's the deal maker he says he is he only has to get a few republican votes to make it all happen republicans came back from this meeting pretty agitated just a couple statements that summon up ben stats from nebraska though i don't know if he was actually enemy me a chance was not the meeting but but but he points out that statement saying i'm going back to that first quote we heard from
we're not getting any constitutional protections simply because the last person the president talked to today doesn't like them
and let's listen to a clip from john corner in texas republican number two republican in the senate who was pretty agitated walking back into the capital

the
and he went on to say it's it's still unclear to me what can actually pass my experiences these things are harder to do than they sound so any sense what happens next i mean osment we've seen what pulls well but there's usually a pretty big gap between what polls well and what happens
today we saw as ryan said the exact same thing with immigration what i will point out there is that maybe this is slightly different and i don't know because we are leading up to a midterm election and the president has remarkably had a really good handle on what his they supporters one and i actually just was
in ohio i spent some time talking to folks who specifically had voted for president obama you know either in two thousand and eight or two thousand and twelve and then chose president trend in twenty sixteen and i connected with former retired elementary school teacher her name is lisa more and some how we ended up talking about guns and she actually had this
about the idea of arming teachers in schools i knew i wouldn't volunteer to be trained with a guy that i know there would be teachers that would cover have them come sign up to see who has to be concealed carry they should have one for each grade level
thain either force and you know and i think they'd be a good idea what strikes me as she's the type of voter who switched over to support donald trump he is very aware of those types of voters wine enzo so add me know he he is going to be talking a lot about it but whether that will actually the lead to any legislative action
i am somewhat skeptical given that we sort of feel like we've seen this movie before when it comes to immigration one last reaction to this that's worth flagging this is lindsay graham kind of acting like the political analyst that he often plays the role of as well in addition to being a senator it's the president has another one of these sessions and he doesn't follow through it's going to hurt him
it's going to hurt the republican party i've seen this movie before it ends up like immigration he's done himself a lot of harm wonder if the audience limbs or grams talking about their though is the millions of people who might have watched the television program but the the one hundred folks on capitol hill who who were actually counting on the president to broker something and whose words
been tested once might not withstand being touted as i can turn so while congress has not made much progress on this there was some action on the corporate side of things you had dick's sporting goods and walmart both making big decisions that said basically will congress may not be raising the age anytime soon
but but that's what we're gonna do yes
dicks which is an enormous sporting goods chain has decided to stop selling a are fifteen that's a change that are other notable walmart which is of course the behemoths of retailing as said that it's not going to sell long guns to people under twenty one we've already seen of course a number of car rental companies and other about number of airlines people saying we don't want to have
counts for the array anymore we don't want to endorse the organization in that fashion they've had some blow back on that as well so this is also being fought out in the courts public opinion and also in the marketplace so we are in a different space in terms of talking about guns post parkland i interviewed chris murphy right before he went to the white house yesterday and i asked him about the dicks
decision it's often the private sector companies that lead congress to make changes so take a look at the fate for marriage equality
it was fortune five hundred companies that decided to treat their employees the same regardless of sexual orientation that finally led state legislatures and the supreme court to make the same decision
so i think it's ridiculous that congress hasn't passed legislation that ninety seven percent of americans support but i do think that this wave of private companies that are standing up to the gun lobby
will ultimately be dispositive the debate we have here in congress like is that a chicken or egg thing to the company's only start to act because public opinion is already shift and i mean end of the opinion that yes they do re the he even gave the example around gay marriage but we began to see public opinion change i mean companies have a financial responsibility to dig into their share
holder's they're they're not gonna be jumping into a hotly debated political issue unless they believe in addition to the moral argument they don't have loads to lose financially yeah i think i think fixes made the calculation that there is more downside risk of being the company that sold a gun to a guy who goes into
a school and shoots a bunch of people them there is the heat that you might get from some one hundred and come in and find the shelves empty of a particular weapon that they were looking for dicks had sold a weapon to nicholas group but it was not one of the weapons that are used in the shooting but that still seems to clearly alarm dicks executives are i were going to take a quick break and when we come back the
staff turmoil at the white house long time prompt eight and oil is hope he takes his resigning
jared kushner has lost his top secret security clearance

okay we are back and the white house confirmed yesterday that communications director whole picks his resigning likely sometime in the next few weeks hicks has been communications director since august but she's been with trump for three years longer than many people at the white house she was a day one campaign staff
you almost never heard from her even read that many quote attributed to her but she's one of comes closest and most trusted aide scott this was a little bit of a surprise like i guess like most things in the trump white house but this this was one of those things that kind of snapped a lot of max when it when it was announced it's always surprising when you see hope picks his name in a news story because she did
good job of staying out of the spotlight until two weeks ago or so but as or murky said on the radio yesterday and she she's been in the spotlight and in the headlines in recent weeks for all the wrong reasons she was being questioned this week by congressional investigators is looking into the russian affair and she acknowledged
doing told white lies for the president although not in relation to to russia before that she was tied up in the whole rob porter scandal she was having a romantic relationship with rob porter help to craft the talking points that were initially used to discuss the staff secretary who was ultimately forced out of the white house with allegations of domestic violence
so the sort of behind the scenes player was under the microscope
even though the white house says this departure was in the works for a long time and not related to those recent events
get all hot for opec's ron depending on your generation communications director is either drummer for spinal tap or defense against the dark arts professor of the trump administration i'm all those generation
what first of all how important is the communications director what is this person do in the typical white house and what does this person done in the trump white house most people think of the spokesperson for the white house that is in this particular case or sanders as being in a sense the real voice of the administration they don't really think
indications director and back through a sequence of communications director is back over many administration's that job has been relatively faceless sometimes we don't even see that person at all and that is what hope he would have preferred she was trying to be behind the scenes and have role in shaping communications policy for the white house deciding with the white house might say about things
but then having somebody else go out front center and actually say them and be on camera that was not a role that she wanted that was not an impact it was a role that she quite actively shunned and throughout the time that she worked for donald trump so this is a moment in which people will ask the question what does a communications director do i think it's varied quite widely from what i've been
illustration to another some of them have been enormously important critical even and an administration but in this particular one it's a title that's been passed on so often
no anthony's caramel g at it for a period of hours and this is something at this administration who knows what the communications director and totally responsible for but even though her public role was was was largely invisible her made the most important role as a security blanket for donald trump with somebody he liked having around she had traveled with him for years
and this is one more way in which this president has kind of losing the close allies who have been around him throughout his short and stormy tenure in the white house and in skype can ask questions
which ones came
got to clarify scott h is came a day after she testified for hours and hours and i understand you're saying that people are saying that this is a predetermined decision but she's also a white house or saying my yeah but she's a cons director and that's when he don't understand is like there's clearly the optics evidence and if field
cons directors jobs they're supposed to be too you know and understand the optics of communication decisions that they make you mean a communications professional might say if i let it be known that i'm quitting the day after i testify between before the house intelligence committee people might connect the dots and think i'm leaving for that reason exactly on the other hand there's probably no great time for the car mr
hector to walk out the door when people won't ask isn't this a bad time isn't this a bad moment when you talk about the president security blanket he had a person who had been his body man for a number of years who is a security person but who also was clearly a confidant of the president somebody who he felt comfortable around his name was key schiller and he is gone
and it has been gone now for a number of months
these are people that the president relies upon to maintain his basically comfort zone and his comfort zone is getting to be quite narrow monday so yeah this week on we also learn the president's son in law and senior adviser slash sometimes shadow secretary of state slash guy who early on was assigned every single job and the white house jared kushner has lost his
top secret security clearance it had been an interim clearance and even now more than a year into his time at the white house coaster still have not been approved for a permanent clearance scott first of all what does this matter that he loses this interim clearance that he has been knocked down to secret how does that affect him in the way he does his job
well it depends on who you talk to the the strokes people for the white house insisted will have very little effect on the jared kushner will still be fully able to carry out his vast and wide ranging duties when you talk to people from previous administrations they say they don't understand how he could possibly for example be in charge of the middle east peace process said
no longer have access to the most sensitive classified information hell no longer for example be able to read the president's daily intelligence briefing which is something he had been able to do under his his interim clearance know can trump just override that on an ad hoc basis if he feels like it he can however he told reporters last week that he wasn't going to do that
if he would he would let his chief of staff john kelly make the decision about what jared kushner got to read and didn't get to read how do you get an interim clearance by the way it because i mean i was an intern man just a lowly intern at the state department some years ago and there's like a pretty lengthy process to get through just even get like a basic clearance for an intern so
i don't fully understand how you get an interim clearance and how that just isn't resolved within a defined amount of time run that was the problem right among many other problems questioner kept not putting all the information he needed into these applications especially when it came to what people from foreign governments had you met with that's right there was delay after
delay and that eventually led to more suspicions and more suspicions and one of the things about this process is that if you push back on the process the process has ways of along gaining itself and seeing your push back as in and of itself a question mark on whether or not you should be getting a final clarence so this was a serious error on the part of the
white house allowing that to happen and it now has reached this pretty point as far as why this really matters and whether or not he can continue his duties let's assume he really had all those duties that he was putative the carrying out the it's called hamilton here i want to be in the rumor and happens you aren't in the room where it happens unless you have full access to all the intel
you simply aren't you might be physically sitting in the physical room but you are not possessed of the information you need to be part of the process can i meant something really embarrassing
i did not listen to hamilton start to finish until like three weeks and they don't have any or heard him on data is if as happened and it costs a lot of money to see a i now when it doesn't cost very much money to hear it and it's really really where i found that it lived up to the hype and it was really like me into two thousand and eighteen to listen to it
that's actually a year behind me i'm and early man who was gonna and i he's listeners but i think i'm really hip and cool
now they be like she'd never listen hell it
get a lot of email now i own an adult link and eleven either what is this a hamlet and thing
so last thing i'm kirschner and then we've gotta move on but cushion or this comes during a week where it just headline after headline that that's pretty damaging be him there's there's headlines about foreign governments trying to target and manipulate him there's headlines about companies giving loans to his family business possibly right after they met with kirschner about official
business his spokesperson is stepping down somebody who'd worked very closely with kirschner and his wife of august so not a good stretch for somebody who's in the pretty close orbit and one of the remaining close orbit people got a lot of that has like pretty serious stuff it's very serious stuff and what was new for example in the washington post reporter
based on intercepts of foreign governments communicating amongst themselves just confirmed what i think a lot of foreign policy professionals
i had been worried about which was the suspicion that jared kushner was in over his head he was giving being given a lot of responsibilities for which he was not prepared and he was not a veiling himself of the all the support and all the experience at the state department and in the foreign policy apparatus he was out there
freelancing while the middle east on china
and that he was ran the risk of stepping in it and also that he ran the risk of serious conflicts of interest because even as he was doing this he was part of a family with deep debts out there trying to raise money to finance various real estate projects and even though cushion head
nominally separated himself from the the family business in most ways it's still the family business and what is thicker than white house disclosure form right to one more quick break we're going to come back or no talk about terrorists and can't let it go

okay were back in one more thing that happened today present trump announced that he's imposing new tariffs on imported steel and aluminum one thousand five percent on steel ten percent on aluminum scott can you explain to us what trump announced today what he didn't quite announced today what we thought
do you might have been announcing today and why all of that matters years he announced plans to raise not lower res terrorists
imported steel and aluminum this is a response to an investigation that it's been going on for them about the last year looking at whether those imports are putting so much downward pressure on the domestic steel and aluminum industries that they could go out of business and jeopardize national security and so
commerce department recommended that he raised not lower rain on
got a pair of
showbiz this is choice but to tend to you the flavor this and the congress were mentally that sort of several options
a combination of tariffs are quote is to to try to curtail steel imported steel and aluminum the dow jones as as we record this is off five hundred sixteen points as the stock market anticipates the likely retaliation from trading partners and the potential for a mini trade war here so this isn't this is a controversial move certainly
in the economic world it's also controversial within the white house there was there was a lot of tug of war within the white house and so much so it didn't appear that trump was actually supposed to make this announcement today he didn't actually have an order ready to sign he said i'm going to order this the next week
maybe you will but that that at least hints at the possibility that maybe there's still a little tug of war and there have been times when the president's announced that he's going to do something only did not actually do it so we'll see if these materializes but it's a it's a pretty major market moving economic move that the president has taken here in defense of the domestic steel and aluminum indeed
trees but one which could have negative rebound effects on both businesses that use steel and aluminum what you're going to pay higher prices but also other companies that want to export to other countries and other countries have already said they're prepared to retaliate in a pretty politically targeted way for example going after kentucky bourbon a major industry
in the home state of senate majority leader mitch mcconnell or wisconsin cheese maybe that same at the house bigger and as or a florida orange juice and important swing state that going to have a senate race in the upcoming midterms so the the the rest
the world will also have a say in this but but the congress will not know this
the president acting under existing legal authority he doesn't need a congressional vote on and it was also widely reported that this morning both gary coleman who's supposed to be the number one economic advisor and the president and also steve minutiae who is in the treasury secretary and also a major and guys are on economic policy to the president had both strongly in aid against these tariffs
kind of like how the defense secretary and secretary of state where both strongly against undoing their own deal that's right and they're very upset about other countries being upset about these tariffs as well so you've got a big chunk of the senior most members of the top members of the cabinet all being against this will be ross was in rural and he was there and a not an approved and say over it commerce
we think that these tags are just great to me this is just so clear that it rain we've systematically seen president trend really not often care about the consequences on a macro level that he cares essentially what his base voters things and it just feels like in some ways it is a genius political move to shore up simple
from a key part of his coalition right he's already please say the traditional wealthy are republicans with attacks now is already plead similar social conservatives many supreme court pack and and now he is purportedly at trying to please send these more blue collar working class democrats who became republicans is
supporting him all throughout the midwest in and again like i was just in ohio who hear a lot of this really resonates with folks in whether or not it actually is going to make the situation better for towns were still males were essentially the only industry in town i don't know that that actually matters to people it's just the fact that it indicates that president trump cares and that he's paying
attention to them and i think for seventy six that may be enough and it just to me shows that the president again care is most about his popularity among his base of supporters perhaps more than he cares about really the political consequences or the economic consequences and and donald trump has strong protectionist instincts i mean this is part of the core
trump brand going back for decades it is something he campaigned on very strongly so this is not something you know even the tax cut was maybe sort of a break from what he what he campaigned on this is very much in line with the trunk campaign right
to the disappointment of everyone who wants to hear another extended conversation on tariffs which guess they are very important and this is an important story with broad implications but i still even talk about the quotas i'm going to do the unpopular listener move here of shifting gears to can't let it go where we all talk about one thing we just can't stop thinking about this week paul
takes or otherwise scott honestly
well i was reminded of this by an interesting essay on the fox news website today about laura mcgann the headline is when this whole picks get to be a wunderkind instead of a former model and sort of complains about the fact that every news story about hope he makes reference to the fact that
in her teens she worked as a fashion model isn't it just a question of wunderkind to being a little too long a word for headline
to your point of this thing that she did briefly as a teenager that makes it into every profile what is a random thing called that she was also a model for ralph lauren it's not like a no name brand that we've never heard that i feel like ralph lauren is kind of like classic iconic american ray like i actually do think that
a lot of can like who we are and where we come from matters about sort of who we are where we are now a wunderkind is somebody who is amazing at a very early age at something that people don't do all that well at that age and so in case of whole picks one could argue that to get this far into the inner circle of
any powerful politician let alone the present in the united states to have risen from job to job a job to have survived through many many purges in his inner circle and to have been this powerful whatever exactly she was doing as communications director to have that title
means that she must have a great deal of talent and then she must be contributing something of great importance to the work of our president at the highest levels of our government speaking of things that shavers asthma we have been trying out a new thing on the pod gas where nobody tells each other they're can't let it goes accent an editor and
except we had the same way light so we were flagged because you and i even though we do not sit next to each other anymore because you're in and had the exact same can't let it go and you can do it for both of us so thank you for letting me have this can't let it go so what i having not been able to like go is jen whites pod cast making obama i have been
weirdly obsessed with this car guess what i have and so fascinating is it's a glimpse into the biography behind the president as it relates specifically to the city of chicago say no around you would actually you might actually quite interesting i mean it basically goes through the idea of how this man came to be president because of the place that he came
from and i can find that a pretty profound idea that like a lot of us are products of the places that we came from and those places shape who we are and ultimately what we end up doing i mean i yeah as a price sick and tired of hearing the time that indiana but i always do because i feel so fundamentally that it
it is a big part of who i am and it helped me understand things that we saw during the last election cycle and i don't know that i would have been able to understand those things if i had not come in from indiana so anyhow i was listening to one of the episodes where they talk about harold washington last night i don't know how much you knew about him but for me like this this is basically like a forty five minute detour
into the media to chicago his first black mayor who i i guess i knew who he was i knew his name but i didn't know the details that much and it was just like this this this total detour but that gives you so much context about the political moment and and just kind of what obama was thinking and feeling as he was thinking about going into politics any helps you understand this that obama
came to chicago that at that point was under the may all lead you could say the city's first black mayor and that was really unusual and apply to have you added no part of me i guess is like a thought experiment always wonder if this hadn't happened with this have happened if this hadn't happened it's dangerous to go too far down he may end up at the civil war but i like to think of what historical
tracks could happen and i think with president obama you could make the case that had harold washington not been mayor of chicago when obama was there that are arguably maybe obama would never have really engaged in politics the way that he did and arguably perhaps never become president it's a really good park so asthma we're going to have to keep comparing notes
just a new episode drops ron what can i go my can't let it go scott is about to solution that i have experienced disillusionment i didn't think i could still experience disillusionment after thirty some years in washington but in fact i have and worries it's pretty shocking okay
i have just learned that people who are nominated for the top orange in the oscars my best actor
they and they don't when they leave there
some of them don't stay for the rest of the ceremony they actually get up and leave the dorothy chandler pavilion or wherever they're having it and they actually have people who come in and sit in their seat in their place so that it won't glare as an empty seat so the cameras might be attracted to show that so until until it so might have left in peace
leave after not being named best actor best supporting actor what have they don't stay and carry on in the general honoring of their colleagues and i found that very disheartening added you on this i learned it through the media skirt
the best ever because i usually when people lose they have a good like i'm happy for you face but the best ever earlier and not pretending was bill murray when he should have won for lost in translation one of the best movies ever soldier a man it's been in atlanta way he was stricken and he was he was another way because he knew that i don't even remember see i don't even remember both denzel spaces
casey affleck oh yeah well as a total denzel for a while at least then they'll know he'd get back there bill murray was like i'm not on my show this is my short lifetime achievement with kerry shack or so
okay so i'm going to go last and this is a true can't let it go because it is a song that has been stuck in my head all week and it is great so here's the setup it's a youtube video it's a six year old girl named charity joy and it's her dad see more harrison charities a girl scout
as we all know it is girl scout cookies and we have all inhaled sleeves girl scout cookies here on the newsroom but she and her dad came up with a cookie selling song to to read bone from childish gambino and it is great
good
music

sitting in the backseat of a card arenas
here


the
and then he comes in he sounds great
cool
just so impressed with the modern girls can do that girl scout we went door to door well this is great i think she is sought a lot more cookies because of this include sell as many as a little girl in colorado who set up products are the marijuana oh yeah man
yeah i've got a good clique to but donald glover met her on steven cold air show and bought like more than one hundred boxes of cookies from her she is doing while i call that a normal porter
