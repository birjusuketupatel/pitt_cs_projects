
oct on this a specialist l'amour what charlie company to forty eight speed it's poor operation inherent result located in southwest asia you are listening to the npr politics pod cast which was recorded on i feel like i should do the military time and i'm blanking it's to forty two tim what does the military fourteen forty two forty and forty two on
thursday may third things might have changed by the time you heard it keep up with all of your m b our politics coverage on the npr one app m p r dot org and of course your local npr station now here's a show
it's the npr politics pod cast here with our weekly roundup of political news it has been a week of big revelations in the russia investigation and surrounding legal challenges the president trumpets facing last night former new york city mayor rudy giuliani provided yet another one giuliani
new member of trumps legal team said the president did in fact reimburse a lawyer for a payment made to a porn star and he suggested the president would not sit down for an interview with the special counsel will get to that and everything else we learned about the muller probe this week plus the rest of the week's news and of course we will end the show with what we just
can't let go of this week i'm scott death row i cover congress i'm carrie towns and justice correspondent and nicer roscoe i covered the white house and i'm to mac i cover national security and politics and everybody so we were going to start with all the mall stuff right like that was already planned and then rudy giuliani just threw a wrench in that let's just
just dig into rudy should we their hits keep countered with rudy absolutely so let's just go rudy giuliani of course is a new member to a legal team that has seen a whole lot of shake us we will get to those shakeups momentarily so he goes on fox news wednesday night and says yes present interim did reimburse michael cohen for that one hundred thirty thousand dollar pay me
may two stormy daniels in exchange for daniels keeping quiet about an alleged affair that was money that was paid by by his lawyer the way i would do out of his for from fun so whatever funds doesn't matter the president reimbursed that over a period of several made so there's a lot of context
work through here but let's just start with this what rudy giuliani said and prompted on fox news to the surprise of sean hannity asia that really contradicts what both president trump has said and what michael cohen has said right yes so president trump was asked about this on air force one not long ago and he
he was as where did the money come from and he said he didn't now and sell wow that and maybe could be technically true that he didn't know where michael cohen got the money it seems relevant to mention that he might have been reimbursing cohen for the payment and the implication when that question was asked how he didn't know him
anything about the payment and sold there had always been this kind of lingering how did this work where you have this personal attorney for down or donald trump
going and making this arrangement and the president didn't know about it he wasn't present at the time but the he didn't know about it and so now there is there still questions
giuliani was saying that the president did he knew generally what was going on the he didn't know the specifics and he giuliani and saying that he only found out about ten days ago the full extent of the arrangement carry can you connect the dots for and i feel it the dots frequently need to be reconnected in this com
decision about what this payment made in october two thousand and sixteen how that ties into the broader legal conversation right now why this matters
mostly manners because michael cohen has been raided by the f b i in recent weeks his hotel room his residence and his law office where all rated and we know investigators took a lot of material from those premises and their sifting through it right now michael cohen is under active criminal and
masturbation by prosecutors in the us attorney's office in the southern from new york which rudy giuliani used to lead by the way and there's been a ton of speculation about whether michael cohen is going to be under so much pressure that he might flip on the president of the united states where the he knows something about trumps activities during the campaign or some other active
cities that he might want to share with a special counsel team or other prosecutors now of course michael cohen is wrong doing says he's not gonna flip on the present a united states but the legal pressure is getting hotter on michael cohen and rudy giuliani didn't help them all that much last night yeah now
a big payment made that benefits somebody running for president in an election just a few weeks away might not be a payment right there's a lot of campaign finance implications here right so the big question here is whether or not this payment was made in order to influence or affect him election in some way and there's the law and then
the application a little odd though so before we get too far ahead on whether they're going to bust michael cohen for suppose it violation of campaign finance law have to really take a look at the reality of how that might work the federal election commission is really deeply deadlocked and in order to actually investigate and then
impose penalties for violation of campaign finance law it would have to almost unanimously agree to go ahead with this and republicans on the commission are unlikely to let this move into the investigation stage let alone
the point where we'd have penalties
so how would we describe the planned or and big sure of out what is the best way to describe the tone and the frantic this of the white house reaction after rudy giuliani just share information on fox news will it's clear the white house staff
f was caught off guard sarah sanders said today that the first time she learned that president trump reimbursed michael collins was last night on fox fox news so it seems like some members of the team were not clued in that this was going to happen in their first response the first responses from the white house on
this were essentially we're not gonna comment on an ongoing legal manner but of course that contradicts because they had talked about this issue maybe not deeply but they had talked about the president he's made clear his position that he didn't know anything about it they've talked about sarah is even talked about arbitration with stormy daniels
throughout all of that it was notable how little president trump said about it because this is someone who can not not comment on anything cannot not comment on anything on television and stormy daniel sits down with sixty minutes and trump doesn't say anything aside from that brief back and forth on air force one that change this morning president trump went on twitter whole big tweets store
from taken full advantage of the world of two hundred whatever characters and i will just give the highlights here mr cohen an attorney received a monthly retainer not from the campaign and having nothing to do with the campaign from which he entered into through reimbursement a private contract between two parties known as non disclosure agreement or these
agreements are very common among celebrities and people of wealth in this case it is in full force and effect in will be used in arbitration for damages against miss clifford parentheses daniels the agreement was used to stop the false and extortionist accusations made by her about an affair despite already having signed a detail letter admitting that there was no affair
prior to that violation by mr clifford and her attorney this was a private agreement money from the campaign or campaign contributions played no role in this transaction we should i mean these are a paragraph form tweets that while and it is announced just like the way president talks and
there is a typo it the okay little bit of authenticity
you know these tweets i would guess that they did go through an attorney because they're not necessarily in president trumps the usual vernacular but he's making the point this has nothing to do with the campaign and giuliani kind of further elaborate on this morning on fox news saying this was a personal matter
so they're trying to make the argument like this happened yes i i am connected to it in the sense that i reimbursed
michael cohen who's this guy who deals with these kind of crazy issues for me he i think president did refer to it as the crazy stormy dan use isn't but nothing illegal happened let me just jump in here so while both giuliani and trumped maintain that no campaign funds or campaign contributions were used to pay
this alleged trash money
that doesn't necessarily matter under the law what matters is if the money was used to influence the election and we know that this payment was made to stormy day and yours aka stephanie clifford before the election so the timing is suspicious and interesting to lawyers here the other thing that's interesting is the notion
that according to rudy giuliani these funds were paid throughout the course of two thousand and seventeen rudy giuliani says personal funds of president trump obviously investigators are going to be able to see those records and see exactly how much money went out and howard carter michael cohen the question of when the original payments were made
they'd really dies kind of indicate the purpose of the payment right because rudy giuliani on fox and friends this morning he said well look imagine if it came out on october fifteenth in the middle of the last debate with hillary clinton he understands that there is a political dimension to this payment
undercuts the argument right there i mean really giuliani is a long time veteran of the new york tabloids scene but he does have a history of shooting himself in the foot not only on this kind of undercuts the whole legal point which is hey this is not a campaign payment this is a personal payment by
the campaign ramifications of it and you recall that he also shot himself in the foot previously when he insisted that the travel ban that the trump administration and put out there was actually a muslim which undercooked the entire legal rationale for the administration trying to put forward a travel there okay there is so much more to
talk about on this front but this is only the first of many different up to its we need to get through here giuliani talked about a lot of other key things but first we should point out that he is part of trumps legal team now he has a new member of the legal team and there have been shake up since he joined the legal team last night another big change tie
cobb leaves the legal team he has replaced by a lawyer named emmett flood carry why does this matter well ty cobb has been the leading voice within the white house of cooperating with a special counsel he's turned over lots and lots of documents made available dozens of witnesses more than dozens of witnesses inside the way
it has to talk to the special counsel investigators and com is always wanted to be the path of least resistance he is now leaving and they're bringing in a guy from ah what's known as a scorched earth law firm in washington williams and connelly this emmett flood really smart really conservative pedigree former supreme court clerk to the lady
justice antonin scalia and emmett flood has a very interesting background he's one of the lawyers who helped offend president bill clinton during his impeachment travails and emmett flood was also brought in to help vice president dick cheney and george w bush white house when they were having fights about executive privilege with members of congress so it floods arrival
signifies a new phase in the white house approach to the special counsel and maybe a more pugilistic face and so we might expect to see even more criticism directly of robert mahler by the president well i will say this sky the formal announcement the white house put out saying am flag was joining said that in flag was joining
to respond to the witch hunt by a special counsel robert more i don't know how much more how you can get the that of this oh let's get something else giuliani said on fox news last night there's been this ongoing conversation about whether or not president tromp will be interviewed by robert or what the circumstances that would be here's what giuliani said i would lie
to get one not on the rolls i'd wanted a videotaped and not videotape and audiotapes want to make sure that all misrepresent as and shoes but this is an outrageous
miscarriage of justice
do you typically get to make that many demands of how you will talk to investigators if investigators one of the
don't do this at home rather frightening
the point here is that the present in the united states is special person he may have more sway in trying to negotiate with prosecutors who won his testimony than a normal person but the point here is also that no man or woman in america is above the law and if robert mahler really wants the president's testimony
he can always send a subpoena live the white house to try to demand it
rudy giuliani has engaged in trying to set a whole bunch of conditions these are conditions the special prosecutor
might not want to abide by and has no obligation to abide by in fact the president may be better off in agreeing to a voluntary interview because ben his lawyers can show up in health i mean maybe interrupt if he's getting jammed up or you know he can do it in the white house as opposed to go to the courthouse which would be a major league lollapalooza extravaganza
spectacle so rudy who sophisticated about the legal system a former us attorney himself is acting as if he's the man with all the cards in his hand in in fact i don't think he is i could you catches up to speed on what we learned about conversations about possible use of subpoenas this week from a couple different report there was a report that mother
his team had told some of trumps lawyers that they might subpoena hand that they might actually go through with that but it does seem like that was a way of saying look we don't have to play around with you guys you're trying to make all these demands we don't have to do that we don't have to play ball okay so we read these reaper
towards the there was a subpoena floated as part of the ongoing back and forth and we've known for a while carry that there is this ongoing conversation about whether there will be an interview the other big report this week that kind of shed more light on this was a new york times report of a list of forty nine different questions that muller's team is interested in learning the answers to
what jumped out at you from that list of questions there was a whole bunch of questions about possible obstruction of justice the president's relationships with an alleged mistreatment of his attorney general jeff sessions the firing of f b i director james komi various attempts to possibly fire robert muller talk within the white house of getting rid of the special counsel him
self and then there's a whole bunch of questions about the president's business dealings and relationships in the campaign with people who may have had contacts with russia people like national security advisor former national security advisor michael flynn who's gone on to plead guilty and cooperate with investigators there was also a good question in interesting question about former campaign term and pa
oh man afford and whether metaphor may have been engaged and back channel conversation to with russians during the campaign that question may suggest that the special council has evidence for a man fourth right hand man rick gates who recently pleaded guilty to yeah i mean as a national security reporter or what what interests me most is the questions that relate to russia
one question was shed what so what sort of discussions the war there during the campaign if any about possibly meeting with vladimir that was really interesting question to me there were questions about possible real estate deals that he may or may not have been engage with any possibility of of real estate deals in the future is
in russia and one of the things that we have really never understood during the twenty sixteen campaign is why did the president come out with such a a foreign policy that was so friendly towards russia and consistent consistently not only towards russia but on the issues of sanctions and on the issues of how to address
what's going on in ukraine the president has always had a view that's more favorable to the russian point of view there was nothing politically advantageous about taking these positions during the campaign and so mahler's trying to understand how did you come to that conclusion and that is the heart of the quote unquote collusion question yet even though the president we did that
none of these questions
involved collusion and all maybe the word collusion didn't show up as we've discussed here and infant item collusion is not in a federal crime so whereas i certainly won't certainly plenty of questions about that would raise the question of collusion or in what the trunk campaign did or did not do with regards to to russia but i think this
the white house and what backers of the white house when they look at those questions the argument that they are trying to make his aunt look this is a fishing expedition you're looking all over the place you're only supposed to be looking at did this campaign have ties to russia and you're asking about you know when i was thinking when i was fine different people and so that is there
argument that the scope of this investigation has gotten too broad let me just say this if this is a fishing expedition the robert muller special counsel team has already caught rick gates michael flynn george papadopoulos thirteen russians whose names i can run off a taboo who allegedly were engaged in the information
warfare and the course of the game in there there are a fish on the table and just a more recent years

hey i'm kelly recovers from embedded below spencer works at a coal mine in kentucky
when i start to ask him about a future without call and i'm gonna say so
learn whole story on npr one apple or wherever you get into guess and we are back we were mentioning just before the break president trump supporters and the vocal critics of this investigation in the white house in congress the clinics in congress had a pretty loud and eventful
week first report of the washington post that some members of the house freedom caucus which is the tea party wing of the house republican conference had drafted articles of impeachment against rod rosenstein the deputy attorney general who is tasked with over seeing the mall or investigation and in that position has become the focal point of a lot of the
the anger from president trump and and his allies about this investigation rosenstein like robert mahler is often pretty quiet about this often doesn't respond to this criticism that change this week he was giving an appearance at the museum and he had thoughts there were people who the than making threats privately and publicly against me
for quite some time and i think they should understand by now the department of justice is not going to be extorted we're going to do what's required by the rule of law and any kind of threats that anybody makes are not gonna affect the way we do our job carry given how much or how little rosenstein usually says and public have spicy is the statement this is super spy
see for our videos
not rosenstein is a very smart guy he's a career justice department official almost thirty years in the o j five attorneys general nine presidents doesn't normally like to pick fights this was really bold from rod rosenstein i'm liking i'm calling this rods last stand or maybe second to last and here he has
had enough he talked about how these house freedom caucus members didn't even have the courage to put their name on these draft articles of impeachment he said if the justice department when we you somebody of wrong doing we use credible witnesses and evidence we don't just wing documents out there and have people forced to respond to them and he pretty much
he said
he's drawing a red line here he does not want to make any more concessions to some of these people who are acting in bad faith in big picture this is about an investigation that they see as a witch hunt but it's also more specifically about information they're requesting from the department of justice from rosenstein what exactly do they want at this point remember
these members of congress mostly chairmen republican chairman of house committees and others have been demanding from months now information about the or page wiretap application information about various applications for the foreign intelligence surveillance court in other things and related to the hillary clinton investigation the clinton foundation and rescue
and others what appears to be the last straw though is this the mark meadows picture of a leading member of the house freedom caucus wants the justice department to turn over something that rod rosenstein himself wrote in august twenty seventeen memorialize is what special counsel robber mahler a supposed to be investigating and we know someone that mature
ariel involves paul me and a for because it came out in the course of manner fourth case but a lot of fat material is redacted the house members want to know exactly what robert morris investigating the hurt me end of the ongoing criminal investigation in the justice department says no way so behind the scenes there
he is an agreement between the house judiciary committee and the as permanent about the transfer of documents right well there appears to be in agreement to which people like trade gatti one of the one of the chairman has body and to but this faction of the house freedom caucus is not on board with that him and remember the president has
threatening rod rosenstein himself all year long or really since last year and the thinking among democrats in the house is they are just itching for a reason to get trump to fire rod rosenstein and members of the house freedom caucus among others keep throwing issues in the air wondering will this be the one will best
be the one and so this guy has been walking on a tight rope since the special counsel was appointed in may of two thousand and seventeen that's not a great feeling
trump weight and yet again after after the he did so he treated about this is a rig system they don't want to turn over documents to congress referring to the justice department what are they afraid of why and less redacting why such an equal justice so he said that at some point he will have no
no choice but to use the powers granted to the presidency and get involved so that sounds bad what does that mean what is so it's not exactly clear he has said that he could be more involved in the justice department the president does a broad powers he certainly has powers to fire people and to get who he wants in in so that that
authorities pretty unlimited and so if he wants to get involved he could he has kind of done this will he won't he he's kind play with it flirted with it but not actually gone through yet in some people are betting are republicans in congress in the senate
our senator grassley and other people are saying don't do this this will be a political suicide this could lead to your impeachment if you got rid of rosenstein blood the president is kind of sinning out some signals that you could consider some taken action in terms of the draft bill that we saw in the report i think
often things they get introduced in congress get over simplified and people think oh this is going to happen now i mean a draft bill from one corner of of the house republican conference is a long way from a vote on this is a long way from anything seriously having a chance of passing house speaker paul ryan
senate a majority leader mitch mcconnell have repeatedly said that they support the investigation they support mahler but i think it's really important in this one sense that there has been so much conversation about his congress going to protect robert mahler how his congress going to step in here
the house for your caucus as we've talked a lot especially when it comes to spending bills has a huge say on on what issues will come to a vote on because there are a lot of republican vote and this shows you that the momentum in corners of the republican party is not to protect robert mahler but to in fact do quite the opposite to try and tank this investigation this investor
location that focused on the inner circle of the white house and may be headed toward an interview with the president of the united states himself in other words is their house freedom caucus trying to get information about the investigation to help the president protect himself that now what the the or day is about you and if these are remedies or shingles like you said
likely that these types of legislation would be successful at all but it's kind of the analog to what we saw in the and we discuss in this cast cast this legislation to protect mall or that made its way through the senate judiciary committee that mitch mcconnell said that will not make its way the senate floor but these are signals these are signals to the white house these are signals to the president
on the one hand from the senate hey don't fire mahler on the other hand from the house
we we can mess around with this investigation all here
we could talk for hours more about all this stuff we're going to end it there but i'm pretty sure this will come up in episode after episode after episode of a future pod cast
we're going to shift gears here and talk about john mccain for a few minutes the republican senator from arizona has been battling the brain cancer since last july mccain has a new book coming out and fear was actually given exclusive access to a segment of the audio book this is john mccain reading from the lab
last chapter of the book the clip is about three minutes long and we're going to listen to it
i don't know how much longer be beer maybe i'll have another five years maybe with the advantage i'm in college you will find new treatments for my cancer they will extend my life
maybe i'll be gone before you finish my predicament as well rather on predictable
but i'm prepared for either contingency her least i'm getting prepared
some things i like to take care of first to work good need finishing and some people i need to see and i want to talk to my fellow americans a little more i may
my fellow americans no association more to me
we're not always right well impetuous and impatient and rush into things without knowing what we're really doing we are you over little differences and loosely and exaggerated them the lasting breaches we can be selfish and quick sometimes to shift the blame for our mistakes others but our country tis of the one
very good we've done in the world so much more good than harm he served ourselves of course but we have my gutters free safe and prosperous because we weren't threatened by other people's liberty and success
we need each other
we need friends in the world and they need us
the bell tolls for my friend humanity concern as we are to take measured pride and have not been an island we were involved in mankind so this is john mccain talking at the was clearly the and of a very long career in public service he was in the navy
famously shot down several years as a prisoner of war in vietnam he goes to the house of representatives serves as an arizona senator for decades and in two thousand and eight he was the republican party's nominee for president before i leave i'd like to see our politics begin to return to the purposes in prague dishes the distinguish our history from the history of other name
patients had like to see as recover our sham said we're more alike than different where citizens of public made of shared ideals forged in a new world to replace the tribal enmities the tormented the old one
even in times of political turmoil such as these we share that are some heritage and the responsibility to embrace it
whether we think each other right or wrong and our views on the issues of the day we all each other our respect as long as our character marriage respect and as long as we share for all our differences from all around girls debates and enliven and sometimes to mean our politics a mutual devotion to the ideals our nation was conceived
porn that all are created equal and liberty an equal justice have a natural right of all
those rage and have with the human heart and from there though they may be assailed they can never be wrenched i want to urge americans for as long as i can remember that they shared devotion new human age is our cruised heritage and our most important and loyalty
then i'd like to go back to our valley and she the creek run after the rain and hear the would whisper in the wind i want to smell the and a breeze and feel the schon on my shoulders i want to watch the hawks han from the sycamore and then take my leave town for a place near my old friend check larson in the
cemetery and the severn backward began
that's from john mccain new book called the rest last wave tim what's the best way to describe the space that john mccain is carved out in american politics of the last few decades you know i listen to that last three minutes and he sounds kind of sick kids old he's tired that's not the john mccain i remember
well remember the i'll remember john mccain who
we called him a plot hole maverick but before that he was a genuine american war hero in hours and hours in hanoi traveling a few months ago and i happened to go by the lake where he was shot down in vietnam and there's a monument there and it calls them and air pirate how many among us right
it will ever be known by a moderator like that he's also a really funny guy you don't really get that sense from the book or that segment but one time
there was a foreign trip and we're both on it together and which talking it happened be around thanksgiving and he was talking about frying turkeys he says you know whatever you do make sure you don't do it on your deck i set fire to my deck
but the then came the punchline he said well i've been in worse tech fires
of course to hurricane was on the us as for are still what it when the deck caught fire and a bomb destroyed his airplane and he managed to scramble off the the top of the airplane get to safety
it's like in the senate
typically the more high profile you are wrong less likely you are to spend any time talking to reporters or reflecting on things elizabeth warren literally never talks to reporters at the capitol she'll just walk right past and not talk to you john mccain would stand up and talk as long as you wanted to funny about it
and be irritated about it in snap at reporters elections he thought were irritating but also give you a long explanation and thoughtful explanations and in digging for as long as reporters one would walk up to reporters and his signature line was what
what what do you know when when yeah what do you want and you know and he has he is a very short temper if you ask him a question that he was stupid he would tell you sell and when i least twenty four show just starting to cover the defense industry for political new to the capital john mccain is obviously a big
deal and he just yells at me for a question he didn't like he that it was silly are dumb or whatever but he's the only senator who after casting votes he came back he was looking for me and he wanted to personally apologize for being rude to me earlier i mean he's the kind that's the and he did that out at least two occasions
he does have a hot temper but he also has had of a deep well of conscience like it bugged him it bugged him that he was mean yeah i think it's him which he said i think that really stands out to have a policy and come back and apologize i mean yeah no that's not news
standard the kazan i think that
senator mccain has obviously but come on icon of the senate in recently you know in these years
part of the the thing that or part of what critics would say about president trump one ended things they look at his treatment of senator mccain and even after his diagnosis he still will bring that that senator mccain did not vote for the healthcare bill this is something that he still bring and even now and so critics and president
grant will say that that shows a lack of graciousness on his part and obviously even during the campaign he never apologize for saying that you know he admires people who don't get shot down writers kept her you don't get captured yeah you know i gotta say listening to them as three minutes the quality of his voice
where he is now in his life very moving
i heard him saying once you know what the legacy of human rights the accomplishments america is already great i read that in part as a sub tweet of the current president and i also thought about that famous picture of ulysses ask grant who was dying dying of cancer
and wrote an autobiography to save his family from financial ruin the better of him on the porch finishing that book
john mccain voice in that clip we just heard brought me back to that place another incredible american
well we're going to take one more quick break and we will come back with can't let it go
this message comes from in he our sponsor lisa the mattress with over eleven thousand and five star reviews and mission to and medalist this in america the lisa mattress was designed to provide support and pressure relief to everybody type and sleeps time for a deeper night's sleep
lisa plants a tree for every order and donates a mattress for every ten soul get a one hundred and twenty five dollars of free shipping and one hundred knights to try the lease a mattress go to l e a dot com slash npr
we are six months away from the midterms and i am already passed for predictions wow i was wrong about trouble i thought he lose by about three million votes he
cincinnati a republican strategist on a possible blue whale next time on it's been omitted from npr
okay now it is time to end the show like we do every week with can't let it go where we all share one thing we cannot stop thinking about this week politics or otherwise i'm going to go first and i think mine is a little bit of both now we start the show every week with the time stamp saying things may have changed by the time
here there's pod cast the last time to hammer keith was on the pod cast couple weeks ago her can't let it go was about seth meyers and his wife having a very crazy baby delivery situation that you mention that my wife and i had a little less crazy than seth meyers baby situation that we had a new baby so tam tapes that pod cast
pam goes home later that night before many people have heard that pod cast things changed and tam had her baby little boy named gibson
and then not only that are produced a date or farrington had another baby named agent so three boys have been born to the npr politics team in the last few weeks that as a lot of it is it's a baby boom
congrats to tam tam of course will be hanging out with gives him for a while and she will be back on the pod in a little bit of time asia budget okay so this week i can't let go of and we talked about this guy a little earlier ty cobb but not ty cobb his moustache
it's long and luxurious and a will maintain his hand law i don't know exactly how he gets the curl it's got a buddy some sort of some sort of its it is impressive
he reminds me a little bit of yosemite sam from learning to i really love that that cartoon way it's i mean of course is curls up whereas it's the sam's is down but you know people on twitter when ty cobb it was announced that he was retiring they were saying that
there was a competition between john bolton mustache jump on the new national security advisor and cards mustache and that bolton one out and so that's why
a one much that is exactly and so i can not let go of that mustache john bolton was once asked if if he could repealed iran deal if he just shaved off his master england
and he said he would review review
some things are just too much to ask man is because the thing is for all of the other ways that facial hair has been in the last few years and it seems like it might be going out a little bit but everybody had been everywhere it didn't really penetrate the world of politics that much but you have a lot of robust mustaches the in the trump orbit while remember that many of these gentlemen
our after tom selleck magnum p i era
they're not doing in brooklyn and there are doing like tom selleck now in the array journey i heard the question or coming in and worth
hey bush he must have
moving on from mustaches or not i don't know what you're going to say to him what can you not let go
just as related or know it's it's it's basically i was watching the fox news debate oh they hosted a debate with the republican candidates for west virginia senate and one of the candidates is this guy don blankenship he's a former mining ceo he was convicted to a year in federal prison because
he is mining company who was involved in the upper be branch mine disaster twenty nine people were killed and he was convicted of conspiring to willfully violate mine safety standards and i should say that actually npr did a ton of investigative reporting about that case at the time howard burgers one of our investigative reporters
so that's the best to set up and he's running for senate now and he was asked about the more investigation and essentially he is responsible was hey i know something about the feds i know something about how the justice department rolls over people and he got applause you got tears really yeah i thought that was it was just something i've been thinking about
that about how the current environment where in with the president going after the deal as he dies is really changing the views especially amongst the republican electorate about justice law and order and how are laws work while you know this white house has i've been in some interest in giving people second chances
jared kushner is leading this kind of prison reform
effort and we know this week on approached for clemency bid by kim car to actually in of our people so maybe they're trying to appeal to the redemption of power of redemption
there are a number of people who are running for office this year jaw pio low seriously little harder he was a a grim who's running for congress in staten island
so it's it's really interesting to see how the public see at least some parts of the public seem willing to forgive these sort of criminal convictions
or will see and elections now
they are i don't know if you need fifty plus one but you know
some percentage of americans are willing to overlook this and support you but forgive not in a way of like can trade apology and reform forgiven a away of like the feds came after me absolutely it's almost it's almost like it adds credibility in a way that you have been that the feds have come after you i think our pio
feels that way and i think that by a kinship feels that way well carry you know more about justice stuff than any of us
what can't you go
well i can't let go the twitter habit of george conway or conway of course is a very prominent lawyer
who was up at one point for a job and donald trump's justice department took his name out of a running towards conway also happens to be married to presidential advisor kelly yet conway interrupt conway from time to time tweets things that could be viewed as jabs at the president of the united states this morning for instance as we were
we're all dealing with a fall out from rudy giuliani his remarks on fox watch conway happened to tweet provisions after campaign finance law that have to do with personal gifts and loans and talking about how people even if their relatives or friends of candidates
give money for the purpose of influencing an election for federal office that's not okay under federal campaign finance law so i only time to point that timely time to point that out when you're why a phase one of the people are responding to crises in the white house it just seems to me a very interesting dynamic it's so fascinating that this
keeps happening in kelly and commonly was asked about this and she got very defensive but could you i was just thinking could you imagine if during the obama administration like susan rice had a husband who is treating like look into you should look into being gassed
okay the law is just it's unheard of all right well that is a rap for us for this week we will be back in your feed soon all the time in between our pod cast everybody always gets in touch with were saying hey are you going to do a pod cast about this about that aren't you broadcasting about this in between the pod guess we are always do
