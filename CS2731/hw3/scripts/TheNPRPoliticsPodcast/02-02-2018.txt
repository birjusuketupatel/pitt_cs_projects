
hi this is in from the u k
where we just had our brand new us embassy open on the south bank of the river thames in london this pod cast was recorded at four twenty two pm on that second of february keep up with all of npr political coverage on the npr one app on your local public radio station
okay is the show
he there it's the npr politics cast here with another special edition the much hyped classified memo put together by republicans on the house intelligence committee is out president trump fully declassified it and in short order it was posted for all to see this
despite quote grave concerns from the f b i and the memo alleges among other things that top officials are both the f b i and justice department used information from a source who they knew was biased against trump to get a warrant for surveillance of a former trump campaign adviser and they didn't tell the court i'm jammer keith i covered the white house
for npr i'm running look like over the justice department and i'm kelsey it's not like our congress
right now we have it we've reddit mine has yellow highlight are all over it
ryan
i attempted to describe what it says but let's just walked through it it's only four pages
three and a half to be generous it's i'm four pieces of its own four pieces of paper so
basically the broad outlines of this have been known for a week two weeks but kind of drill down a bit as to what it says more specifically the allegations in it revolve around a surveillance warrant that was obtained by the f b i against a former trump foreign policy advisor by the name of quarter page a name that has been out in the public for quite some time and
he was former at the time that it was obtained yes although when page exactly left the trump orbit is difficult to say i'm not sure that there's an actual concrete data on that but yes he's by that point he's he's basically basically able to campaign so as as the memo tells it the f b i and justice department relied on the
he'll dossier the trump pressure dossier the dossier that was put together by a former british operative by the name of christopher steal at the behest of a political research firm that was hired by the democratic national committee and the hillary clinton campaign
according to the memo the f b i and justice department use that dossier to get approval from the court to conduct surveillance on page the memo says that the f b i didn't tell the court that the democrats were paying for the dossier that's a big question in this in this memo that it raises the other thing that it says is that the f b i he allegedly left out that the dark
he is author christopher steel dislike trump had told f b i or justice department officials as much and that steel was leaking information to the media that was then used in the f b i surveillance application before the court okay so what republicans who are in favor of this memo coming out said in the white house said is that the
point of this is to look at this this surveillance system and and how the weren't was obtained and whether that system which is largely unseen by the public whether it is operating the way it should be operating
very complicated procedure and i spoke to a a former senior official who used to oversee counterintelligence investigations i spoke to her today
and asked her about the dossier and kind of heard her take on it and there were a couple of things that that stood out and stood up for me and it's up for her and it's the question of the warrant that were granted by the court to conduct surveillance on on quarter page the fact that to get a surveillance weren't under
the of court you have to present a ton of information to the court in order to get approval it's not like you show up with a piece of paper and say this is who we want to conduct surveillance on in the courts as good you're going to go fifty sixty one hundred pages i was told that as many as thirty people at the justice department and f b i will go through this application
for it actually gets presented to record this is not one person who just deals with there's all kinds of own it's a long time it takes a long time it's a very labor intensive process to get done now
the deal with the surveillance on carter page the memo in a sense provides justification for the russia investigation bolsters the case for the russia investigation because it says that the f b i and justice department obtained the warrant from the pfizer court repeatedly these warrants run for ninety days in the case of page they got
it renewed three times in order to get it renewed you have to prove to the court that you are getting intelligence from the surveillance you have to prove that it's pain off so this means that on multiple occasions the f b i and justice department could go to the court and say this is providing us intelligence in our investigation
and possible coordination between the trump campaign and russia and the court saw probable cause to continue this surveillance let me turn some math in hearing you talk about these applications being fifty or one hundred pages long
steel dossier was like thirty pages long so there had to be end the memo the republican memo here is a little wishy washy on this there had to be more than the steel das yeah we don't know what always in the application but what we do know is that the dossier was not the saw part of the application was not the sole justification for the app
occasion and the other thing that's important in this memo that that undermines the narrative that we've heard from republicans and ties back into the question of the broader russia investigation
is the memo says that the f b i was russia investigation began in late july twenty sixteen because of information related to george papadopoulos not quarter page george papadopoulos another foreign policy advisor on the campaign and someone whose name we've heard a lot like a few months ago because he pleaded guilty to lying to the
about his own contacts with russians and is cooperating with the mahler investigation exactly but the memo really makes it seem like aside from this little mention of the papadopoulos thing it really makes it seem like the steel does is the crux of the whole thing is is the centerpiece of
pfizer worried and all of the renewals it does presented case that way remember that the f b i have said that there's a lot of omission in here and that was a lot of the concerns about releasing the memo
you're right the memo certainly does present the case that it is the dossier that is the foundational document of of the investigation and actually it even quotes the forward deputy director of the f b i andrew mccabe it says that he testified before the committee in december of last year that no surveillance warrant would have been sought from the court
without information from the sealed us you can just jump in because that really stood out to me also as like whoa that's a thing and then i tied gosh why didn't i see that testimony and i went and tried to find it and it's because their testimony was behind closed doors so then i tried to
if there was a transcript of that testimony because they don't actually quote mccain testimony they just sort of paraphrase it and there is no transcript that has been released to the public so like we as readers of this memo can't verify whether that is an accurate characterization or not
a senior democratic official with the intelligence committee told me that it makes mischaracterized the testimony but we know we can prove that either
this is something that's that's that holds true in this whole saga of of the memo
it puts the f b i and a very difficult position in that it cannot and i've said this before it cannot fight back because to counter the accusations in the memo would likely require them to reveal classified information and that's something that they are loath to do this is something that a helix we have talked about so many times here where it's that conundrum
an elephant in the dark you don't know what part of the elephant you're touching i mean is there ever a time when we will be able to see the whole elephant are we just going to have to be okay with the fact that we're only at a and see bits and pieces of us
if you're asking about the full russia investigation i doubt that we will ever see the for elephant in terms of the memo and what it is alleging i think that we may learn more from the the democratic response which they have voted on in the committee they wanted to have
democrats wanted to have released in tandem with the memo mother came out today
republican shut that down along party line boats
they say that they will bring it back up for another vote soon so that this can be so that the democratic memo which is purportedly a point by point rebuttal of everything that is in the the republican memo
so that it can be released to the public as well a different view of the elephant a different view of the elephant but still not the whole elephant and as we learned today that has peter paul and does want to see their mental come out at some point in time
we had a statement from his spokesman actually strong saying the speaker is in favor of greater transparency if it is scrubbed to ensure it it does not reveal sources and methods of our intelligence gathering the speaker supports the released at the democrats memo and the white house also put out a statement saying
i'm gonna paraphrase year we hear there's a democratic memo and we are open to reviewing it for sources and methods yeah and as we discussed yesterday's pod if people wanna go back and listen to it typically these to report would have come out at the same time
and
cases like this they would come out at the same time but this is also this is very different than than a traditional report that comes out from the congressional committee this is not a typical congressional committee this is the intelligence committee this committee in theory in the past has worked largely in a non partisan way it certainly would have bumps from time to time
see some see some turbulence but generally the idea would be to set aside partisan concerns to focus on national security and the countries and the country's interests
what this russia investigation has done is largely blow that committee it seems like it's totally scrambled political alliances till and the i'm sitting here swimming in a pile of press releases about this memo
and they came all over the place like this grassley really is in front of me what the headline is investigation should be about fact finding that undermining political adversaries that would be chuck grassley from ohio or who is chairman of the senate judiciary committee as ira yeah so yesterday
our own moralizing heard from sources that president trump had been telling friends that he thought that this memo would undermine robber mahler's special counsel investigation into russian meddling in the election and possible involvement of
trump campaign and also possible obstruction of justice by present and trump or those around him that is of course not the stated purpose of this memo
but it it does seem like that has to have been part of the goal of this memo it's certainly dovetails with a broader campaign that we've seen from republicans over the past couple of months particularly republicans in the house
to raise questions about the integrity of the have to raise questions about a legit political bias on the special councils team in we've seen them really push that line for the past couple of months and folks and the conservative media pundits on fox news in other outlets of certainly pick that up and run
so if the goal if the goal as we have heard through mars reporting is to discredit the investigator to how's that fit in to the investigation i mean is that on the that they will take into account that there was an effort to discredited well it doesn't matter first to step back quickly and so why why it's important that
what discredit in the in the investigation how that helps the president any conclusions that the special councils team comes to in its investigation
would then be up for question if if this is a team full of hillary clinton supporters and democrats than the president's allegation that this is just a witch hunt well that rings true with a lot of people in the american public when we got this memo and i opened it up when i got my highlight and i started reading and then i got to the end and i was like
he wait a second i feel like i've heard basically every thing in year on fox in conservative media and coming from the president's allies in congress for weeks now
it didn't feel like there was a huge surprise well and that's perhaps perhaps that speaks to a degree of over hyping among a lot of republicans on the hill in the house who were talking about this been an epic scandal and bigger than watergate and there were some republicans who are saying
let's not get too carried away with this let's just talk about this and com simple terms but they didn't this was really ginned up as a massive massive scandal and when you look at the three and a half pages in their it follows a little flat a little short of a of a scandal though maybe not surprisingly win
the president was asked about what he thought of what was in this memo today he made it pretty clear that he thinks it's it's troubling i think it's a disgrace what's happening in our country
and when you look at that and you see that and so many other things what's going on
lot of people should be ashamed of themselves and much worse than their earlier this morning and what i considered like a pre game to eat president trump tweet it out the top leadership and investigators of the f b i and the justice department head politicized this sacred investigative process in favor of democrat
and against republicans so basically if you're a person who is inclined to leave the president you're probably going to be the president on this if you're a person is inclined to think that democrats are right about the broader russia investigation you're probably going to agree with democrat on this to this actually move the conversation forward i don't think so no
two points that i want to make about what the president has said today one in the tweet and then a little bit later in the at the white house one this is he has consistently gone after the f b i and the justice department
and there's the russia investigation aspect of this and then there's the potential long term damage to the institutions of the justice department and the f b i and there's a lot of concern among folks from the d o j and the f b or about what this is doing to those two institutions and the fate of the american public housing them this is not a
day by day thing this is something that has long term impact potentially the other thing is that he was asked about deputy attorney general rod rosenstein and rosenstein is the man who is overseeing the russia investigation his supervising it as deputy attorney general because attorney general jeff sessions has had to recuse himself
yeah
figure that one out you figure that went out not a ringing endorsement yes i am a few months ago i with the reporter shouting do you have confidence in rex tellers and the secretary of state and president trump responded firmly quickly absolutely i have confidence in him and guess who is still at this moment secretary of state
eight rex tiller cent now when president trump has been asked about whether he has confidence in michael flynn steve ban in tom price these are all people who are no longer in the administration and in every case he gave sort of a wishy washy like you'll have to see kind of answer an answer
there is much more like what he said about rod rosenstein than what he said about rex tillotson so i checked in with the white house about this with spokesman brian shaw and i was like what did he mean today and rise pointed me back to what sarah sanders the press secretary he said very recently quote when the president know
longer has confidence in someone yell now okay so i don't know that clears it up then
it does he really doesn't clear cleared out no not at all but it definitely leaves that cliff hanger out there well and i think it's important to make clear why rosenstein matters and all of this is because as i said earlier he is supervising special counsel rubber most investigation into the trunk campaign events
possible coordination with russia
and the concern is that the memo and these attacks on the f b i and the justice department will be used as a way to push rosenstein out to allow the white house to potentially put somebody in that position who is more amenable to the white house has concerns about the rush investigation and at that point the star
watching all those people who said that it for as i was pushed out of my was pushed out that that would be a bright red line for them and that they would view that as a serious infection by the president and that's why it's important to remember that there are basically two parallel worlds exist right now you have the criminal muller investigation and then you have the police
local room
and the question in the political realm is what are republicans going to do if it gets to the point that the president is moving against the special counsel or the justice department questions that we will not answer today certainly because we can only see a tiny little piece of the elephant is chris cornell er tale
just don't now
and that is a rap for tonight we will be back in your feed soon heck we don't even know how soon at this point keep up with our coverage on npr dot org npr politics on facebook and of course on your local public radio station you can also always catch one of us on up first every weekday morning and if you're in around cleveland
