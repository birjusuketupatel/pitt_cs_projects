of the side of the mountain to my happy place this pod cast was recorded at twelve twenty seven pm on monday make seven things may have changed by the time you hear this so keep up with all of the npr political coverage at npr that org
one app and under local npr station go care cc in colorado springs
it's the npr politics park cast tomorrow is another primary day so we're going to take a look at some of the big races in west virginia and elsewhere
talk about what to look for and what we could learn this week's results i'm scott tetro congressional correspondent i'm jessica taylor political reporter and under medical mountain air political editor earn everybody so we had a month or so more it was a bit of a law we didn't have that many primaries going on but tuesday's another big primary day and then we've got a steady stream of elections to
care about and cover going forward this is the big kick off very texas and illinois were kind of preseason games and away and there are some really big states on the ballot indiana west virginia ohio and these are big senate races to that are happening i think those are the big states were looking at because of the storylines we should mention north carolina
also has a primary that day to their whole lot of elections coming up from here until november but you know lots of primaries the primary season really kicks off here and there's a lot that we're gonna see when it comes to turn out and the enthusiasm who is really got this fired up mid terms are always years for activists and we're already seeing
the wings on both sides are the most fired up and heading to the polls here okay medical mentioned turn out that's one thing that i think this is the first big tell because we had big democratic races and the other two states we've already had and there's very competitive primaries in west virginia in indiana is that going to drive up turn out republicans going to get out to the polls that
enthusiasm gap i've talked to a lot of strategists over the past week that's something that's really worrisome to them so let's start with west virginia just who are the republicans running in the center primary so there are three major candidates you have evan jenkins who's a congressman he sort of the establishment favorite and republicans really think the he can best eat into democratic senator joe mansions base
sort of appeal to sort of these maybe traditional democrats and independents and know patrick moore he's the attorney general he's running a sort of i'm the true conservative he sued the obama administration a lot on regulations and different things too but he's been sort of pegged as a carpetbagger he ran for house in new jersey before he moved to the state in two thousand and six and he also was a
lobbyists for some pharmaceutical companies and they've really hit him over that and then the big wild card is don blankenship now he is the former ceo of massey energy with actually spent a year in prison after there was a mine explosion that killed twenty nine miners he was convicted of a misdemeanor over federal mine safety regulations he's still under parole
his parole actually ends tuesday night at midnight so right on election night and he is just come out swinging he saying you know i was a victim here of sort of federal prosecution and run run amok and is just hammering at his other opponents and and not just as other opponent mitch mcconnell and he has come out very much against it
the senate majority leader lectures take a moment and listen to one of his ads because i think that that sums it up more than any of us can mom
your gun and for you assume and wrong
mcconnell has created millions of jobs for vagina
so much has gotten route in fact those china family was given in terms of move about to swarm reborn are running false negative herbs are nourishment
oh child ocean recall him english speaker bought and mentally ill
lord and growing the swamp and create jobs for west virginia boy
begun will be joe mentioned image go move crusade to be so what he's referring to their with the china comments that mitch mcconnell is of course married to a chinese american woman elaine chow who is also transportation secretary has a law has had a long career in government her father owns a she
shipping company that's what blankenship is referring to but dominica cocaine mitch china family is this another potential roy more situation for republicans have blankenship gets the nomination yeah and blankenship is engaged sure woman who was born in china so it's just a whole lot of cross currents going on here but
republicans over the past decade have had a huge problem where they've been nominating candidates in places where they should win and it's cost them almost half a dozen seats so when you looking at this race here's another example where they could be nominating somebody who is seen as so odious image
general election that you could cost republicans in a state that donald trump one by more than anywhere else in the country trump in fact this morning tweet it out don't vote for blankenship vote for either of the other two candidates he said remember alabama so remember alabama could become a slogan here and for mitch mcconnell who very well knows what his
majority could have been it's remember delaware and remember nevada and remember lots of other places where republicans could have one in didn't write in because the news cycle moves on somebody times very quick reminder if you forgot this story already alabama roy more former state supreme court justice
this of course was it was accused of soliciting in approaching underage girls for relationships earlier in his in his career when he was in his thirties and as a result of that and a whole other bunch of things a democrat now holds ascendancy from alabama just one of the polls and like a few weeks ago i think republicans were feeling a little bit better they
blankenship kind of drop but in the past few days there's been a lot of concern so i watched a debate last week between the three of them and one thing that was notable was we saw morrissey and jenkins go really really have the against each other blankenship almost kind of felt like an afterthought but i think that negativity really might have propelled some voters to him there was almost
thirty percent of voters undecided here in the primary just today we've had both the more see and the jenkins campaign leaking internal polls showing them blankenship is now narrowly ahead it's almost a virtual tie and there's real concern that he could bomb back out because he's putting his own money into the race he spending millions on air in west virginia where
that some goes really far in a really inexpensive state and he saying i'm sort of this anti trump type person you dominica mentioned his tweet he's almost trying to frame this as okay well the swamps coming coming for me and everything to so i guess president trumps part now part of the swap
this is great news for joe mention the democrat in the race because you know he's got huge name id in the state he was governor of the state people know who he is he's had very favorable ratings in the past with republican voters
so this is again democrats looking at it and saying here's one that republicans should pick off or have a great chance at doing so and shooting themselves in the foot in just before we get to indiana i want to talk about a story that you published on npr or today that get into this there are so
many democrats on the ballot this year defending senate seats in states that donald trump one big in two thousand and sixteen and going into the republicans lot we can pick up a ton of senate seat yeah but the winds look much different and people like joe mansion who on paper should be losing by a lot really seemed to be doing well yes so democrats are defense
ending ten incumbents and states that president trump one of many of them like in west virginia by easily double digit very heavily i think of mansion sort of people i've talked to the kind of think of this and tears and he sort of a second tier race right now and mansions very similar to heidi high camp in north dakota john tester in montana on paper they should
easy pick up speed these are democrats that have been able to sort of solidify their own independent brand they have a lot of crossover appeal and the state and they're really not going to be as easy to knock off and i think in west virginia especially where you have such a messy primary but i think you know if even if it's more see your jenkins that comes out they've been bloodied so
much i had one democrat tell me you know they're airing their dirty laundry for us these are just ready made attack ads that we're going to use made the odds of democrats same at the senate right now are still long i mean they'd have to pick up a total of two seats net and to do so they'd have to win in places like arizona in tennessee which democrats are feeling
a little better about but i still think that they're more difficult
than they are likely because one of these democrats who you know last year when when everybody started first think about twenty eight eighteen they thought wow this guy's going to have are really hard time winning is joe donnelly the democrat representing indiana state that have gotten more and more republican every year it seems bunch people running to go against him in the
fall just give us the rundown of the republican indiana senate primer so this is another three way race you have congressmen toddler akita and luke messer running there and then my brawn is this outsider business of mine he served in the state legislature and he's port a lot of his own money into the race to again he sort of positioning himself as the outsider here saying you know i'm a job creator
the best as he had i've had a lot of people pointless to me as he actually walked around with cardboard cutouts of messer and rookie to and a debate they actually dressed almost similar and red ties and their kind of white middle aged congress man asking people to pick them apart and they couldn't so he sort of lump them together though to be fair it's probably hard for most voters that
most senate candidates area
and very trivial but he's he's been able to of lump them together on the way that they are creatures of washington they've been there and everything to the thing that braun has run a going against him as he was a long time democrat and they've sort of try to pay our way of sort of a wolf in sheep's clothing and you've had both rock to and messer run to travel as much as they can
roque to had an ad where he know he puts on a trump hat and says know i'm going to be with him every way and then messer actually this past week circulated a petition and congress to nominate president trunk for the nobel peace prize for his work on north korea so each trying to get out the base in this election yeah i mean the monaco
such an interesting dynamic and and susan davis to the store and this last week that for all the talk that we here in washington about look at donald trump's approval numbers is he a liability for the republican party and certainly in a lot of suburban house districts he is a liability and that's why the houses and play but you have center is and it's not just in the end of this is happening and so many races occur
across the country where the argument on the republican side is i'm more like donald trump the you even west virginia yeah we just which we were just talking about but yeah they're trying to out trump each other on this and you know the facts here is that you've got rookie to in his tagline of his as he says i'm pro life pro gun pro trump and there's a reason for that right interrupt
vulcan primary indiana is a state where only four counties in the two thousand and sixteen election went democratic now when you add up all of their votes there are a little more than one in four of all of the votes in the entire state those four counties but that's not where republican primaries are won and lost their won and lost in other parts of the state but when you do pivot to
general election us president trump won it by a lot but remember barack obama did when it and pull it out in two thousand and eight so there are some leading democratic voters in some of those places in the state where democrats are hoping that their be able to buoy joe donnelly come the fall and the more than these candidates out trump each other the more liable that make
some and the general election that's going to be tested and i think that's going to be tested in this entire twenty eight team mid term in a lot of different places year and a lot of money has been spent on this to right yeah i mean already we're seeing in this race more than twelve million dollars been spent on advertising in this primary which is a whole lot of money in indiana to be
spending so you see what the stakes are here the thing about india though to republicans feel comfortable with any of these nominees the i don't think they worry about being saddled with someone like blankenship so i think it is a real test their running closer to trump is that going to turn out their base in a general election or is it going to hurt them so just before we shift gears and talk about democrats for a minute any other
is there any particular thing you're looking for in tomorrow night's results when it comes to the senate primaries that i'll tell you something a bigger picture about what we can expect this fall i think that the big as wild wildcard is how blankenship dies if he's the nominee i think that's a race that becomes almost off the table for republicans and they're going to be saddled with someone that to very
like you said and alabama it's very annoying more like with sort of these outrageous comments they can sort of dragged down other nominees we saw this happen in two thousand and twelve that's how claire mccaskill and joe donnelly are still on the center because they had these nominees that said these things about abortion and that sort of drug down people
candidates across the field and then you can turn out these are big republican primaries are people going to come out and vote for them or are some of these trump voter still kind of not really caring or engage and if there's not a big numbers coming out for such competitive races where there's been million spent that's a big worry for republicans were going to take a quick
break when we come back i'm going to talk about some democratic races to watch

okay we're back and i want to talk about the gubernatorial primary in ohio
oh but before we do that i think it's interesting to point out that as we talk about these contentious republican primaries on the senate side the democratic incumbents in the senate by and large have avoided any nasty primary fights and i think that's so interesting because you have so many conservative or moderate democrats running for reelection and there was so much as
energy and the democratic party of the bernie sanders type when trying to pull the party to the left and yet the joe mentions the bob casey the job donnelly is of the world didn't have to fight off the left in the primaries i think that it's also in some of these places north dakota and montana there's not had deep democratic bench so i have been getting someone even on the ballot that would pose
a real threat is going to be harder i think it's much easier to find people in these house races and different things who you're seeing that i am a play out in a lot of house races that really could end up costing democrats unwinnable sees but again these comments are entrenched they have a lot of money in their campaign war chest and probably and high in north dakota heidi hi
kim's the only person that could win their john test or the only person that kid when in montana and i think yet only pragmatism hasn't stopped primary challenge
true but again i mean it's just i just don't know how active they are some of these states that are on the ballot well it's certainly going to affect this next race that we wanna to talk about when it comes to ohio governor's race and we should mention this is a seat held by john k sick for two terms he's term limited so that up for us and an open sea yeah it's an open seat and on the democrat
that side you got richard corliss ray who was an obama appointee to run the consumer financial protection bureau
can you give a quick ten second recap on that before you keep going the consumer financial protection bureau is been set up during the obama administration as a reaction to the two thousand and eight financial collapse to be what it is a bureau to protect consumers against fraudulent activity in the banking market now elizabeth warren's
child getting upset at us she helps set it up people were think that she was going to run it until it was clear she wasn't going to be able to be confirmed and she decided to run for the senate
it's worked out for her which worked out for her she's endorsed right now no one's gonna say elizabeth warren is not a progressive okay but that's been the knock on richard core dray in this primary because he's running against dennis cousineau watch the presidential candidate former congressman from northern ohio also
was the mayor of cleveland don't we can get into solve his tenure when we talk about this race so this has been one of the more interesting damn on them primaries quarter is really still outspending astonished by a lot though and has a lot of the institutional momentum behind them know
he has the establishment candidate in the race but i mean he's not a centrist are sort of squash by any means but the one not that they they kiss in it has hit him on his guns he had passed a rating by the and are a and know he supports tougher background checks but maybe not as many regulations is a lot of progress would like and of course but
you're talking a lot about this with so many tragedies happening democrats really sort of see a momentum on guns and again in a base election this is something that you can capitalize on where to find these wedge issues and city and announces matter for democrats because that's been the biggest storyline of the past decade or so is democrats just losing ground and governor's office have
governor's office state house after state house there's hardly any democratic governors in the country compared to where they were in early in the obama years so this is a state where they feel like they can claw their way back in the competition and the thing is here there's a lot of places in the country where you know politics is on national now like it seems that politics normally we always said
politics is local right but what you have there's a lot of people running on ideology stuff that would matter to a to national electorates but when you have someone like dennis percentage running for example when you try to become a governor of est being a governor is about trying to run the state he's running to be governor here he's not run
to be another congressmen who's talking out against president trump that has nothing to do with what you're doing as a governor in a state and we've seen some republicans actually in other states have difficulty because he ran as ideological candidates and now when it comes to the rubber hitting the road and trying to govern it's
been a lot tougher and they've seen their approval ratings dropped i think sam brownback in kansas is a great example mary fallin in oklahoma when when you put these these talking points into actual policy sometimes the result is not pretty is as kansas saw with its budgets was was but then you have some really centers republicans that are going to be harder to knock off for republicans and places like maryland in massachusetts
that that sort of have run as pragmatists and governed that way and think about that that's why all right so that's the big democratic race to keep an eye on anything else any house races in any of these states that bad yesterday monaco you'll be you'll be watching when you have the seventy five tabs open late tuesday night as results are coming on
there's some that you know we'll see in ohio which nominee gets on the republican side how competitive this can be in different things but i think again
a big big night especially governor's race were also of course looking at but some of the state primaries setting kind of tell us the most about the energy of the electorate and what type of candidate to get nominated by i big picture you've got big senate races but we're going to see where the momentum is do the democrats continue to have the kind of momentum that
side for enthusiasm and what kinds of candidates to they pick are they going to be more pragmatic are they going to be more going toward the wings
it's all going to be tested
once we have result we will be back in your feet on wednesday talking about those results if you can't wait for that pod cast will be telling you about this on the real live radio and your local public radio station also on npr dot org and on npr one one more exciting thing to tell you about we always get tweet from you when you're going to do a live show
