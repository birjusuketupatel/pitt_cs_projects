why why not do it do it was all of the fail children yes why why isn't william kennedy smith why doesn't he have a joke teddy kennedy's seat yet all the alcohol kennedys give it to chelsea clinton that cousin who killed the girl because
michael scott should be and then all the all the southern all the southern conservatives other sons were all murdered dogs for some reason put them all in there who kills rom thurman to the fifth now let's dig up the really weird kennedy's the ones that they don't want you to see that live in basements the grey gardens canada i went and around thank you
gotta figure they're at least like seven kennedy's who are white people with dread locks right oh totally their my masters in a habit but rosemary kennedy and there show raise the i q of letter
okay so i mean i read yesterday
in his will he requested that both barack obama and george w bush speak at his funeral at the national you draw they're going to play the paul walker was khalifa saw definitely but now i mean i mean weekend these the takes right themselves like we can i can see what's coming as clear as
my hand in front of my eyes
barack obama and george w bush are going to speak it mccain funeral and everybody is going to say you know just for a brief moment america was united again and they spoke to our better angels and they raised our nation but also and most importantly sort of slyly and implicitly condemned
donald trump
kind of kind of was a great friend to the cause of the global celtic like alan thrall a george w bush is a big background player
here's what you wish evolution was cooler to john mccain the donald trump ever wood's oh yeah all donald trump like donald trump's biggest sins against mccain was being like use a bad pilot which leg it was mccain was finding it it's funnier if mccain was like a cooler person yeah i kind of soft
it's like music video games like to believe i'm very good but after around like i'm not so good you became could do that was being a pilot but he can't do much of an asshole meanwhile george w bush did robo calls and the two thousand and republican primaries his campaign saying that mccain adopted daughter was an illegitimate black child conceived in vietnam and mccain was
forgive you cares
cooler than anything to trump couldn't get it together to do a robo call or anything the advice the thing is that george debbie is like in his prime was really kind of focused frank point bully and also a obama and bush those the guys who owned him those are the guys who were stood between him and his
lifelong ambition of being president getting to initiate global nuclear war and they're just going to stand there and be like are vanquished oh we respect him i mean trump just said some hilarious insults about them he never he didn't actually stop him from being president the ultimate cut move trump also like
he was so nice to he wanted to make out with john mccain so much that he passed and signed a tax bill mandating it's from know mccain shitty kids would ever have to work like he knew that they were as dumb as their dad usually here you go and became was still not big enough of the man to make up with them
talk about toronto because one of my favorite things happening right now is always the people how dare you sir that that trump is not have the official white house flag at half mast for trunk and i have literally seen i've seen people being like this will not stand if you have a flag fly at half mast everyone
faggot
oh my god
oh my god they're going to be liberals arrested for civil disobedience but it's like putting the obese flag and half now
climbing the flag all now
yeah i mean are we also know that the the white house com shop like sarah how be sanders had apparently according to news sources a pre packaged be written statement ready to go for john mccain about what a hero and an honorable man he was that trump personally spiked can put out a twitter state
you saying thoughts and prayers hanging out with king prayers how you run and how you do that shit you know though that like sarah how could huckabee state sanders for all of her bullshit is like a real like student council president kind of breeze or yeah like she definitely like she she birds that have been into would in a pirate
she's a real pick slick
a third thing about the trump thing is he put in instagram could dance john mccain over a picture of himself
that's a lead to such a powerful brain it's like he does even he looks so bad in every picture but particularly bad in this picture and he's like oh damn looks like you lost again by the way here's my disgusting part it
oh he's sober he legitimately things he looks good in aperture like it just such a thought you as a continuous thing where i feel like the kind of lives or gas lighting like every time i read anything where they're like look what he's doing he's sending secret messages it's like
so see i'll he is he is so simple a dick or something like it's just so obvious and this is why i think we need multi generational households because you should be able to see with a brain dying
this is all agree it's watching the trails of has of bird
i believe is probably my favorite thing i saw today just score for coming years and robbers in some unrelated meeting with
state or something
prime minister of niger ask him why he gets to use our
the white house press corps had to be assured of the room
because they were yelling at trial and asking any comments on john mccain what do you think that john mccain when he the majority in your terms of his seat are aspiring the screening there like an eighty and everyone is just in high dudgeon about this including for israel john walsh shoes blurb can be found on the front overbooked know i mean this is the overall thing like the next week or so like as you list
into the show you were going to be hit with just a tsunami of the most sanctimonious bullshit imaginable from the political press because john mccain really was the avatar of everything they believe it and i want to go into why in that like he was someone who got infinite mileage out of occasionally going against his part
and putting country firsts but again only doing that like he would make statements against his party but it would almost always end up signing onto the bad thing as well but the thing is like in the washington media you only get press for doing good thing if you spent your entire career doing bad things like the fact that john mccain came out against torture during the iraq war
one was like a huge standing over that that he broke with dick cheney and george w bush but like whereas if you'd spent your entire career in politics like a dentist's fuselage or mike ravel figure just generally being opposed to pointless violence and dehumanization and slaughter of any kind you would get no credit for that whatsoever what they like is a massive war
hark that nonetheless has lines yeah and here's the thing what you're seeing right now
you seem like hey remain are like all these people just saying that like the nation is in mourning right now and i just want to be like what you mean we white man
like everyone is more no fucking and most importantly shitty mean old man know most importantly here she's not morning john mccain not us the shitty dirt bag leftists all of the republican base every single trumps supporter is pissing on his grave right now if you look in the comments section of any fuck
the news story or any right wing forum or any major right wing media figure everyone is talking about what a traitor he is he's in hell right now
trump has ninety again
ninety percent approval rating from his base so who are all these people talking about what a hero what a great figure john mccain is it's journalists and it's liberals my cue the queue theory
is that he killed himself because he was about to be arrested for doing pizza good yeah i know he did it was a military tribunal you're going to be put before by a military tribunal for doing military pedophilia with the worst kind
eight years old hot they put them before the star chamber and they gave him the option of the roman
a suicide where you inject yourself with brain cancer
so yet all of all all of the republicans all the conservative movement none of the people who really subscribed to this or believe in it like john mccain or think he's a hero it's only liberals and the political press the political press i understand but for everyone else who is like going you know party over country right now now is
the time
talk even bring up even any mild criticism of his actual political impact on this country my question is why why why why
why why are you doing this
while i think some of it is that he was having all these death bad regrets but they were no way a concession of his own moral failings like he would be like while the iraq war was a mistake he means it was a strategic mistake yeah he doesn't mean that it was like murderous and completely unnecessary he means like well that didn't work
out well for us yeah which he was doing like as soon as bush's popular resorted to take a little bit he's like
running this thing that we absolutely need to do one hundred percent had little better like that was that was the republican like fuck in chicago's same way that was the move if you were like one of the last of the dying breed the republican moderates in two thousand and six and two thousand and seven was to admit that the iraq war was going
which was he doesn't won one hundred percent still thinks we should have gone there yet but i mean and
so i would have accepted like a true like deathbed confession like i would have been like fuck you old man but at least you did something good on the way out but he wasn't like there was no clear weighing on his conscience he's like it was a mistake he never used words like atrocity or anything
i will go ahead and selleck he stopped after the iraq were promoting every fucking military adventure crimes hands on he was he was he wrote about up until his death he was annoyed that we didn't go into syria was knowing that we didn't send more arms and soldiers to the ukraine he was basically piss that he missed world war three and getting a little bit
the man's life
there were obvious reasons why the press like mccain so much he was nice to them like he would business
parties for them like his street art barbecues he would talk to them you would give them quotes he knew how to play these people because to be a journalist in america you have to be for the most part the majority of national level journalists and local reporters but the majority of national ones you have to be just a fucking cretin who believes cretin nice things
and we'll just the moment
huge fucking roll over on your belly yes suppose both move but mccain mccain was also a bit of a hero to them because mccain was somebody who unlike you know his successors that he sort of brushed up against and republican and democratic party he was someone who it seemed like he had gone through some struggle now if you
look at it mccain was he the trend in his life was he experienced maybe point all one percent of the punishment he deserved like he flies or vietnam just dropping death and chemicals and what he gets the same prison sentence you get for unarmed burglary oh his his shoulder doesn't work
no talk to the people that he just flew over after by the way he can't the plane respond to keep getting in and
okay so he gets that he gets that and he gets out and it's like oh my god what a hero what a hero this guy who how many bodies to be have the monument app on how many fucking bodies to this fucking wide faced cretin have at this point then he you know after savings and loan for everything he looks a little contrite he's a little sad and that's enough
that's enough for journalists in the early nineties then after just years of larceny after years of abusing his power getting and made band in america all the shit know what he got banned in america because it's fucking wife who he left his other wife when she was on her fucking sick bed area in a line that learned a lot
like sarah palin yep mary cindy mccain this air to this anheuser busch distributor who bird woman you burn woman hearn calista gingrich actually hurt no one talks about this
their family
deep deep in business with boxing somehow gets the up and coming competitor band
just savings and all this evil shit he's done forever then it's two thousand and oh look who's throwing me barbecues oh whoops oh george w bush is mean to him than his punishment for the rest of the time is that he has to hug george w bush smile at this man he hates and he stands up to him two or three times and that that's enough
want to go through the mccain legacy before i do
tuition as the press love them because he's nice
i would dispute even that they all love him but if you read all these like touching remembrances about how cool and fun he was they all have a weird quality it doesn't really seem like he's being nice to them it seems like he's being a massive asshole which i can only conclude that every other senator is either the most blank person zero personality imaginable or like a
albert fish level like that
international because these journalists are hispanic their yes their shame pigs they love being neg and again to extend it also the other
little nerd lives and they they want to daddy to damn them yeah they want to get basra and by a father figure like the one they never had or whatever
why jim webb you've got any coverage at all
there was like
he needs in ancient memory now but there were like mark halperin
and who's the other fucking guy john hammond yeah john allen the profile exhaust their profiles of jim webb and what a maverick he was and it's like what do you think like jim webb said to these fucking around fleshy journalism oldest what do you think this man who brags about killing people and talks about reverse racism on a national
these guys why we want to be all around by a military daddy and let's not forget the purely kind of economic motivation they have for is that he moved to a lot of ink people loved reading about quote mccain and which to garber he was always my god he would show up to any for him
bullshit event or or show oh yeah you talk to anybody give drop a cold for anything and that's huge a media creature of i knew he knew how to play the game to like you remember when he was drawing out the boat like his last great he he says right before he finally goes against the
seventy literal seventeen percent of the time you vote against his agenda he goes you want to see i'm going to do stay tuned it was all showed him it was all showed him it was pro wrestling but these people ages
they bought the face oh i got i just figured it out
trump is reality t v mccain was prestige v
oh okay so i want to go through like the mccain legacy right now where it goes through some of the greatest hits of his career which were going to hear you know like i said prepare yourself for the week to come beginning with the centerpiece of his you know his courage and
everyone loves about in the most his service in vietnam in particular his time is appear to be you and the thing that everyone references is that he had a chance to be released early but he chose to stay and made sure that all the officers who are in prison there were released in the order if they got their right which
like in that context yeah that's an honorable thing to do in that situation to let someone else had been there longer go first however the entire political press and everyone he's referencing this is completely unable to reckon with why he was there in the first place now
he got fucking kidnapped by the he liberation army and i am in shanghai and sent to fuck in hanoi
he was the son of an admiral who volunteered to be you know
a navy pilot
you drop bombs on vietnam in from nineteen sixty eight on by the way i think trumps coke or someone else pointed this out most of his imprisonment in vietnam took place after nixon had purposely prolong the war another four and a half years so thank him for his stay there as well
but again like he was the bad guy in that war know
pilot is especially vile class in my view it's a george w bush she was a navy pilot in world war two and he was and over when the war started and here and elvis in all of his say no no we need you to stay at your fancy perhaps or and already yale and
you need to graduate and become the leaders and let let the let the draft or it out what the chaff unified but bush was excited make a name for himself and he was just excited to be a night of the sky
what they viewed being a pilot as and became to safely resume builder to it's like the equivalent of doing like teach for america for legs that are going to go on to become corporate lawyers entering
in another feudal society and saudi arabia the only prestige the military just sort of a jerk off professional other except for being a pilot he says the cavalry the twentieth and twenty first century and for mccain that's where was he was that was the aristocratic military position i assume their ground truth was just like a fleet of lamborghini
something here
man i think you said on a recent show like vietnam didn't happen
it's only like movies and like yeah i'm your man from movies and tv show that as american heroism and suffering
that's all that it was there was a pageant of american trauma and mccain is just an example of that yeah and he offered and recently suffered so greatly during the vietnam war but again he was part of a war machine that drop more bombs on southeast asia then the united states it on germany and japan during all of world war two i think just
during operation rolling thunder the hatch meted out and told civilian casualties
one hundred were talking about millions of people that were killed by the united states military during vietnam again another completely unjustified war of a crushing also again
it's not just that people were killed the environmental devastation of that war left congenital like violence on their children that were produced by the people who survived without what people in laos and cambodia to this day are still killed by unexplored unexploded us munitions drunk on their country
birth defects and shenyang my agent orange yeah i mean the list goes on and on of high clean war or anything like that this was like physically really so horrify again like the inability of the political presser anyone who references is like i said in that context honorable decision to stay longer than he you know passing up the
opportunity to leave i'm sorry they're completely unable to categorize like you can of the vietnam war as an atrocity which is what it was yeah and so this will probably go under that was johnson's and westmoreland campaign i'm north vietnam
with no real military purposes is just to inflict hair and force to the bargaining table in advance of the election and afterwards mccain said that i will this one of his biographer autobiographies that
the problem was we weren't bombing
useful military installations generals and know what they are doing we should have pumped more stuff
we had that's the that's the refrain of that was sort of a very popular there was sort of and underpinning to the reagan revolution that conservatism the people who mccain kind of the rock someone didn't let us win the aim is line from rambo too so don't say that you know john mccain was just a cog in this warmer
and he was wondering this there's just no he wanted more you want me to do more than when he came home he was a propaganda
he was a propaganda tool for for the war effort know you praised exit
i mean by the way it's not as if the entirety of like us servicemen and women at that point were totally brainwashed to i think the degree they kind of are now it's much more homogenous opinion that whenever we're doing and acts foreign country is going there is an incredibly vibrant like gee i anti war movement
at the time like you saw visibly a time of soldiers who were like defecting and going to jail for refusing to serve so it's not like it's not like
you could be attributed completely to group think there was there were dissenting servicemen and women that refused i mean so would you will about john kerry release he comes back and says oh yeah that's bad we're just doing war crimes over john kerry john kerry sees that john kerry goes in front of the goes
i would like to america statement like he can do that john mccain gant yeah
ernest just heard over talk about mccain and rational
prefer
yeah i know what
in the pro bowl on the vietnam talk imagine when people are talking about john mccain just replace take all the fucking breathless bullshit all the other hand wringing all the fake tears
everyone replace
still he still can still vomit and replace john mccain his name in any obituary any breathless article any smarmy to replace his name with crispin want
actually i mean john mccain significantly more people than men was absolutely and while i was by the end of his life not really responsible for his actions as brain and slurry by city i don't even like wrestling with been walk contributed way more to humanity and john mccain actually at least he made those in
people was wrestling somebody gave their lives better commission make one of those browser plug ins or just changes the name of john mccain a crisp and why
what started now you're going i would like a room to start believing this isn't true but i want you start believing it a big mccain is secretly kurtzman was nothing
i'm twenty two is john mccain zil gym it's on i don't care of it is dark and start believing it i need you to help me ruin his man's legacy
here's my thought on the vietnam pegged his legacy i've read today that the current the vietnamese colonel who is in charge of the hanoi hilton is his jailer and tormentor issued a statement today that said was very very heartfelt condolences to the mccain family and so the he pretty much admired john mccain particularly
for his efforts later in life to normalize relations between united states in vietnam to which are it's a good for that guy you can always feel sympathy for your enemies when you defeat them just all that we i mean i don't like sportsmen i would honestly like i would have kind words for john mccain as well if we have defeated him in this country meanwhile his way
words for that guy were a little difference
yeah if we were to believe him he hated that ma'am and everyone like him right up until the moment
a poor sports i mean to be honest like the torture of any p o w is wrong and not to be celebrated however
those american officers were treated for better than americans treated any vietnamese burst and absolute during the one hundred percent i mean they could have just been killed
just kill them all anxious that like torture
fuck out of people in vietnam yeah ok so just as ever
like loan at coney island yes okay so when you get to the very top of the first strap this is the oldest functioning rollercoaster in the world you see an american flag an italian flag and a p o w m i a flag and you're like god i've made a mistake
when carry came back to the of monks those has not been torturing charles is
so okay moving on to another another big peg in the the career of john mccain this was when he was already a senator a well established
the keating five savings and loan scandal he was one of the keating five for those you don't remember that you basically helped swindle the life savings from thousands of americans one of the top political scandals in american history basically the link in savings and loan collapse ended up costing the taxpayers in america
three point four billion dollars for his role in this he received only a reprimand citing his poor judgment and the senate ethics committee what the thing is that's why you became is to dim campaign finally had a while he was the name ever talked about that but he started running for in two thousand he was mr to them
campaign finance reform and just the fact that he had decided you know what now that i got caught just blatantly taking money from the book and crook i've decided that you know the thing that i did lately is wrong
because i got caught doing it
it was never frame that way they never work it was a fucking pr washing move and it worked and then the mother runner he gets one piece of legislation passed mccain feingold which is immediately fucking overturned by citizens united ruling that was vindicated that are there was decided by judges that he had all voted for because his use of i think it's zero
but of and it was just the whole political fucking the first of all campaign finance is while those classic said loop things like when we can fix this that we can we can slap some paint we can throw some bombing on this thing will get it across the finish line if we just get money out of there but beyond that it was just a goddamn pr move to be cut to become associated with
the thing that was one of his big ethical lapses so gradually fucking nations for basically once again just rolling the press i feel so bad for people who are like really into campaign finance reform
that's just like one level above being like oh man what if we played the song imagine for donald trump
just like when just a slight level above that thinking that would work moving on the receipt vote against recognizing martin luther king day is a national holiday
he's probably talking about that with aretha franklin right now
read were referencing possibly the worst we'd ever made possibly the worst and
where she was like it makes me smile think
john mccain and aretha franklin are hanging out there which is like like like neither of those people are happy to see in one
very differently
friend was feelings i was thinking about you when i was reading all these tweets about like heaven is like the best concert ever in your there and you got front row seats and princes serenading john mccain with i would die for you
talk about protestant mindset that is just like pure the the idea
your conception of heaven is just like a really good even cooler version of earth with all your friends and cool people whatever was having a big party and they love their loving it
it's a church like bake sale and narrow lemon squares in everyone's just milling about quietly but there's still a hierarchy so all the fame and you to hang out together
vip roped off section of heaven yeah yeah yeah we're game as sir anthony and
but yeah i know i mean like think about that though i mean like if that is your actual conception of how you're going to spend eternity is that it's just like earth but like you have like a slightly better a hotel room and there are famous people around you get to hang out with for eternity that's been with having your soul be with god feels like that
that is why we literally pray for death
whom i understand islamic like suicide bombers i understand the depth drive there were like we're going to get to see
an access
hear them talking about while i get i get you know go to heaven and i'm like oh yeah we have that to the boomers are so fucking awesome that they like they think there is in everlasting omniscient omnipresent being who just is you can't conceive of his my and power and knowledge and law
love and he is infinite and he is everything and also you go to his house he has it equals cancer
lucky you i gonna say respect to judaism respect to the jews for not believing in any of that harsher yeah it's a huge of and is like
you can come here if you want we really don't have one
yeah you might see god on and such small portions
mormon have it is a mormon have oh that's that
related at all not outlast to christianity at this point because they solve the problem of it's forever you realize because you can talk all they had it's basically like it's like a hawaiian vacation right but you know it for ever means right there's no way any of that like okay yeah have talking all my favorite celebs and then you know five billion years later you talking
jesse camp from him
you like this fucking sucks ass whereas the mormons and like you get to pee god which seems like that be more fun
green goddess the only way the return of these anywhere anyway interesting mormon heaven is like the game no man's sky
my that forever it's assets that algorithm the creation of new worlds i know now i think it's like gore with milk instead of beer ground
mormons
for the marvel universe the mormons in america
universe is the best one there they iraq
back from our religious digression your some highlights
this is a throwback how the forced removal of navajo from their ancestral lands to open it up for coal mining interests he did that he sold the with er rada who are already rough that call he brought back clean coal has had a while gave away the water rights that were negotiated for again by it
americans in in arizona he sold them out
okay let's get to this one the iraq war
that was good i mean he boost that real fucking hard
a member of the surge that was she didn't want it works he is so happy with spending nicer
that surge work you a member and human lindsey graham went to that market in baghdad and they had like helmets and kevlar vests on in like ten apache helicopters circling over know like this is great i'm buying a rog it safe
as an industrial be open in the next six months i'm just kill in baghdad now john mccain was like the john mccain and thomas friedman were like the king of like the next six months are crucial for the iraq war yeah and we're still that the six months never ending not store fucking ongoing and his problem of course if it on it was well surge was good put a fitted better doubles
search if it had been a mega quintuple surge them there would be a dave and busters on every corner and better
six votes against apartheid sanctions the bill written by ron dellums which he managed to get as have veto override run those who died a few weeks ago and strangely did not get so yeah we're not become the great american statesmen according to these fucking idiots will i get this goes back to where
i said earlier because if you're someone who has been on the right side of virtually every issue in then you die the political press doesn't like that because they know it all that this asshole
making us feel bad or whatever where is john mccain who continually saws from like you know atrocity to mild moment of conscience they relate to that that's like a human quality to them about the moment of conscious is is is what i'm saying that a scout his his his conscience isn't a conscience it's it's just he's antagonistic yeah
he was as that life because at that point he hated bush because bullshit own him in the two thousand and election ages bitter yeah and he was just a bit or piss then he's like fuck you bush and so he will vote against tech stuff like that just too fucking pissed them off and he voted against the obama care because it didn't like revolted against obama can european because it didn't like trump and it was amazing a was about
there he became much more down the line on out and
raised by yeah exactly this is pure spite and also of course his own perception of himself as this thing that he got the media to believe you why the way him being opposed to obama era penal total bullshit that they did multiple votes on multiple times are appealing a skinny repeal for appeal and all of a repeal and he voted for some of them he just gets credit for not voting for the last you pick the spot
there were all their to lap it up like a little pissed hogs that they are heights area
i'm rereading the exact quote when and cindy mccain said you're getting a little thin up there and he said me say don't plaster on the make up like a trial up you can't like he decided trial it was too soft he had to double down in front of reporters this
oh at all yeah he said you're from reporters because he said clinton like the british way it was a term of endearment or so
he's a role and as a proper legit all the
to be playing
okay here's the next one on my on my list of mccain achievements the bom bom bom bom bomb iran iraq wasn't enough for him he was also completely gung ho for iran and for everyone who is like everyone is going to listen to this show or is or saw our tweets during the past day who are so
so disgusted that we make a joke about someone dying
bom bom bom bom bom or and hey that was a joke to what's your problem he was joking about starting another fucking war that would kill another few hundred thousand it's just jokes he was just joking around he's just joke that's why we fired him from the park here
just joking these are just jokes were talking about right now which is sad that way with such he was so good at writhing that that's really just jokes and in that spirit i have i have a joke as well he may not be a peter jackson splatter film but he is brain dead
so he advocated for the around war that you sadly didn't get before he died
although i'm sure you know it's going to be called operation rolling mccain
but libya down for it
siri intervention good start with why not more could we have some armed moderate rebels and and maybe a us intervention their ukraine yes more war please please give it to be his whole thing was everywhere and at all times maximal conflict ratchet everything up to the point of violence
loved it
he will hear it satisfied some honestly deep and horrifying bloodless that was very helpfully in coincidence with the imperatives of the military state
that's why any income me into this guy any one of these fucking sweets or or articles about how he's an embodiment of american decency you're basically saying that a lifetime spreading bloody imperial may him from southeast asia the middle east means nothing that the lives of those millions of people that
he helped and mean nothing
if he can be a paragon of decency he was exceptionally militaristic yeah
a standard just like conservative capitalists we're not necessarily as enthusiastic as he was because they like what will this do for business hey you guys over this one were all georgians now
calm down
not a final
oh my god i am i going to sit in a field is just fire off nine millimeter rounds into the sky for an hour and a half thank you know thank you
pretty awesome
the actual allies best origin
george yeah we are all georgians now yeah that was another theaters again i'd say their word
we are all georgians me after a deal
soundtrack is my okay is my last item on john mccain is greatest hits and it's one of the best sarah palin
for everyone who is again all the liberals and all the journalists were talking about how he represented some some last sense of decency and honor in american politics everything that these people hate and fear now que and on pizza gave birth resumes just the general mainstreaming of just absolute ignorant yahoo conservatism sarah
alan open the door for all of that he chose her is the right
running mate and yeah way to go buddy
circus yeah he brought the circus to sound you remember that one rally where he's like users dying up there like all the crowds of more runs we're just waiting for like trump and cute around fucking eight years later he's just like and another thing ass who is sick of it
just fucking die and then our he's like he knows he knows he's dying because it's just a lifelong media and crowd operator he's like while about sale or pay my ass and i have on her up there
hearing more and just start cheering is the most iconic moment of the mccain campaign as besides the spending his campaign to fix wall street
yeah that was good
again
you know for for everyone who is just like what happens like a decent republicans where where is this last you know these great statesmen of your
trump and all of his mega people sarah palin that was ten years exactly ten years before all of this she use the mother of two years key open that fucking door and as amazingly inept successful purse and like she really was the preemptive trump where she just kind of like trip
silver own deck into success and even when by then she got kind of showed that she that
but by failing to win the office
showed that she did not have what it took to like keep going because now she is genuinely hawking like tummy t on instagram like she's just the instagram thought now because she just too lazy and stupid to keep a grip going with the most reputable people on earth and yet my old ask him be one heart but one heartbeat
between her and the nuclear but she man is a a aggression but i appreciate herpes yeah to figure the other crazy like michele bachmann and all those people that are like they are they still do live this like upper class lifestyle their kids will go to prep schools all the shit but not the pilots the parents are just always like the dad and son are always
getting into fist fight over some snowmobile lane
yeah keeps your heart out bastard kids one afternoon a mansion white trash it's all i do the i am here for it like that his reputation for a year for a messy that they have been there i wish they got imagine if they were vice president ever is just like someone who is on the vice president official twitter account
you know some people say they'll be there for you but the never forgotten or thought fuck this shit listening to avenged sevenfold right
really good hard would get a hold of sarah would get all that leave remember levi jobs and
oh my i brought him at gunpoint they are and are now is so
without of and then as soon as it was already was fucking our respect of the parents who are really being those pieces of shit those kids are never going to said well for
can you imagine them at yale you like they can't hold they're never going to work at goldman sachs now
there could have said they're going to sell our these they're going on
only some going to try to put track pale and in the skull and bones initiation ceremony and he's going to be like and scrambled up your whole or can't believe this shit this is all said they won't reject all that kind of gay though
i thought current law
my amazing night hides they will become the number one like journalist of politics in the country you get he would finally people like you decode their way yeah you would be the he would replace mark halperin which is what you again most importantly sarah palin spell children unlike you know john mccain or bill clinton
will will be safe from whatever depredations and one out on the us state we are not safe from chelsea clinton and meghan mccain now they're coming for yeah they're coming for all i mean i have to say meghan mccain i chelsea clinton is just she's just a dummy that's a she just a dummy and it's like her main functions easy writing books
chills and doesn't seem to have a lot of ambition know she has been doing a better and she just wants to write books called like the kids guide to resisting and like you know she'll get insulted by like mega pete nine hundred and fifty three he was like i'm going to kill you
stupid bitch and she does is very student government and where she caught with them goes actually a bitch and a female dog and most working dogs are very smart and be more like that was classy chelsea yeah and i mean she has been called ugly since she was a child by a major media figures i think she's like i'm pretty calm
well at the fact that she's kind of kind of try to stand ever had that doesn't mean that the democratic party isn't going try and to address try to drag but she's like more of a sympathetic character he didn't meghan mccain who is just like she was when she was born she called the manager of the doctor that
she is just oh my god what a fucking tiring you can tell you can fucking though the way she built she basically wrong or hands around her dad spongy tumor for about six fucking months and just wrong all this him to be out of us demanding people apologize for being mean to her dad fuck you
you i am just so what a fucking entire why he days
he's kind of like a divine character from a job
she's dummy thick and just
i i'm still thinking about that
people keep posting this is a power car about mccain and you write about her book is that rally were
is swine woman comes up and as i heard obama is an hour is bad and he he's he's he's ever
yeah yeah yeah she like what what about that clip is that that woman like she felt because she was our cameras had a making fun of a she knew she knew like what she was saying wasn't right so she kind of like mumble that she should have stopped yourself a little bit then it just sort of like stopped and pause and started again it has not been there he's an error
spit it out real quick and then he's like no no he's he's he's decent person and doctor does seem to lead the and
have eaten it seems i've have camped out in the fan
the stadium tick area
cbs receipt of happy
absolutely
see some people defending mccain there and say i was there are the campaigners the rally is like the real deal also became was acutely familiar a campaign knew that
their supporters believe that barack obama was a scary muslim so they had they knew they had to have it off in the past and
media types of these liberals the centrist whenever i see them bring their hands and wonder what happened to the republican party ninety percent approval rating for trouble
the assumption there is that donald trump castle spell over over what was fundamentally a decent chunk of the populace and that's never been the case in two thousand a mccain over the summer and seven rather over the summer mccain campaign imploded really didn't look like he was going to get the nomination and the two things are really hamstrung and more one his opposition
torture where he was getting booed are on at debates for that and to was because he signed on for amnesty he signed on for the aborted immigration reform in two thousand and six i rammed with the she amnesty to have do and six which really really riled up
the only way that he could inject any kind of passion into his campaign any kind of enthusiasm was by one appointing sarah palin and to ivy
winking at what is fundamentally a and has always been a white nationalists pace of the republican party and two years after that when he was being challenge in a primary airy and he was really fighting for his life they're against some disgraced former congressmen who was doing
infomercial hey we're worth the i with that as that big boy or many here a big ass him in haiti
i'm like get a drunk weatherman pain had to the base himself by playing to the jaw pio pace and the arizona republican party and he was going on t v and saying why i think we need to build the damn fence
the damn fence that was in his campaign at so you get to pick one here one he's he's actually a decent man who's just pandering and lying to
his stake holders who are bigots or two he really believes that he was not of avatar for fucking a way of doing politics that honorable now there's there's no degree it either way now and that's what i mean what i say the problem isn't the problem is it has always been the republican party when was the last
time the republican party where they get guys the civil war price of yeah
oh my friend you know maria
after a good compromise
okay
every seven
oh wait actually teddy teddy epic bacon roosevelt
roosevelt is like he was the first mccain does he oh yeah irritating imperialists blowhard
i'll tell what he was epic they were also half on
he would write these really self and he had like an email period because that was one like that ran a rare sight man of letters did at the time like a fashion themselves in a sense of these like pretty sure norwegian explorers so you do a lot of correspondence and he was just such a whiny bitch
he would just right right these like long self indulgent just like bad let like if you you've read it before because we live in new york and there is a guy who you know who wrote a novel about a white rapper you're familiar with the cadence of it i totally recommend reading a read
belts correspondence he's a complete whiny bitch
if i said on the show before governor great lot about teddy roosevelt
i'm going to say it again give a sissy a gun and kill everything and so
the thinking about it they were kind of less racist they were kind of less actively beholden to the kkk the nineteen twenties so maybe you can make the case nineteen twenties maybe i would like to transition to so of my favorite media reactions to john mccain is passing
no the shit out of me and i'm going to begin with olivia nozzle who had a great three the other day where she basically said hey it's not cool or edgy to like you know talk bad about john mccain you're not christopher hitchens you're just an asshole met as you rightly pointed out the categories asshole and chris
hitchens not exactly mutually exclusive yeah but i mean if anyone's edge year cool is olivia knows he wrote
this woman who was born warning to be on the new york times editorial masthead who fucking will just do perform any transaction or relationship with anybody for any about
as apparently will be his friends with meghan mccain so obviously if your friends with yeah
if you're obviously friendships often do you take precedence over your abstract political principles i don't really think that's a bad thing here's the thing olivia maybe someone who has not been so well established as being quite also chummy with milo you annapolis and ann coulter
should maybe pipe down a little bit about other people being mean to others publicly and here's the other thing what i say fuck john mccain i'm up being a being edgy i'm not trying to be i'm being one hundred percent sincere yes
absolutely
i think he was a bad person who had of poisonous effect on the world we live in this cause untold suffering of countless others as we've related before
again this is sincerity and i'm sorry i'm not going to put up with this phony national bath those and morning i'm not going to take partner office terrible man who made the were world a worse place by far and pointing it out has it's not just getting likes it or tweets it's not just being edge year or you doing like helen
hello jokes in high school or something what you're doing is you're pointing out this is if this is the model of the american politician according to mainstream political discourse the mainstream media mainstream
members of both parties and he's this much of a rancid piece of shit then that tells you what their ideas of what the fuck and politics are actually me all the it's just it's the way this is the american media the language falls apart from them falls apart
the edge
edgy thing to do is to talk about the implication of this career criminals foreign policy choices and domestic policy that edgy that's opie and anthony did any of you guys are browse sorry for the biggest fucking nerves of that
pros everything everything is a bully to me this is just these are just like transaction or warms move like wanted to be inside on the inside of a social circle forever and older resentments just sort of fucking shoe guy doing no fat cutting himself shaving and just come with eight
time that a anytime that like they have any disagreements only any interaction with someone who isn't like them so and who hasn't wanted this is there were fuck and twelve
it just comes out it comes out their lack of socialization they're they're complete alienation from the normal world that everything i don't like is it's a bro it's edgy it's it's shock jock curry every it's just completely alien to anyone else these people are fucking freaks she
brought up she went to christopher hitchens you know who shit on a lot of dead people he was quite good at that pat robertson among the best that or follow those orwell he had a great media hit for he was rude and means a lot of people who died but then again it was also funny as hell and christopher hitchens died i'm sorry every one of these when every
variations would be fine with people laughing and it's yeah here's the thing i'm sorry every one of these racks of war supporters when they nothing kill them but i'm saying when an eighty plus year old man dies of cancer that sort of like that's just nature take its course christopher hitchens was a drunk who smoke ten packs of cigarettes a day and and die
lying is not so huge fucking tragedy when every single one of these iraq war supporters these fucking ghouls dies for whatever reason it's funny and good and the world there's a better place
next ross doubt that ross doubt it had a really funny was the boss
he was going on and he said he says here
i also can't condemn the case along thread with is he showing his thoughts on mccain he goes i also can't condemn mccain choice of pale and in two thousand and eight because i sort of to upon him at the time though she was
also shows i'm not sure how he owns he goes
actually i don't say like processor grow meat always one of these be i think it's a little bit more honest than most of the media
england's was i'm also enjoying the later orson welles style
a lot of applause it leads like a character he at least has their like he has a personality like i pretty much know around author going to have on this list just they just all their personalities
he had an hour principalities she's just a chin their personality is just being like oh it's wednesday and i've had three beers fake news like just so depressing
cause i wrote this entire book where he's a curse gyro cursed damien child and he goes to jail and freaks out when
oh no don't they know how you know they were the road trip or harvard what he's at harvard in mikey doesn't have to put on a condom
it gets molested by william buckley like
it's like a moving sideways and so magical
but the rest of the people on this list there is just the lowest their lower like chivers of personality than any of these lotteries ranking any of barclays come
i'm getting my ass fingered on that's just great
i'm not
i can't condemn the teachers you feel and because i sort of urgent and upon him at the time she was chosen to be something other than what she turned out to be on the basis of a record that implied strength she turned out the lack she was the governor of like a state that's just fucking an oil pipeline and just the world's largest t g i fridays you're get a fuck it
two years and you're like yeah she's going to do it
of alaska has like a naturally occurring
ventures flat brimmed hat on tackled at the best thing to be said about mccain is record is that he took being a senator seriously
i appreciate the powers of his office
why is that me again i don't know i sat behind his desk
choo choo choo
what does it will like what were their like the early ninety others just fuck off senators who were just like ah damn i forgot to go to war
sure add round shows up in board shorts
going down the halls of the senate and a board had added cool aw dude i've actually going to the agriculture building for seven years for come up for reelection i forgot
because he appreciated the powers of his office and try to exploit them to the hilt for his conception the common good not something you can save some many of his colleagues and he goes it goes on to go i cannot find the link but ramesh a route wrote a piece back in two thousand and seventy thousand and eight about mccain the politics of honor
but i don't think it was one of those measures of the man he was most roman legislator for good
piece of yeah man on the same mark foley was their most i think his record shows became probably would have loved to own slaves if they've given the option as well
agent napoleon pointed this out actually calling of our most roman senator is actually very pathetic of him
son of a big military man who you know
took that position seriously if you also engage in imperial warfare slaughtering entire populations of people who are resisting are giant imperial death and suffering cafe under our he didn't do a very good job of even doing that if we're going to be there is so
he suggested that
and then went into a career in politics where he talked endlessly about honor and service basically only was motivated by self aggrandizement you know that sounds pretty pretty pretty romantic also you got that amp are effectively as neck model
that's rushed out that my last of my favorite mccain death reactions is certainly cut the opposite way these you guys see ben garrison and cartoon
i didn't say okay
you're in for a treat show her than will describe to the audience you have to just really weird that this is anywhere other than deviant i like it's strange to me what become successful and this kind and obviously weird sexual fantasies the whole world is kind of big deviant art at this point no now deviant
has bled into the real world and the process where does this the process of the deviant art application of the entire world
would you describe this cartoon
oh okay
so he's in a plane
that is he going into a grave
his
said here songbird mccain what as well as is how it is it engraved
he is
had is exploding
i don't know if they met that to be a little rough a literal reference didn't like his cause of death or why i like what does see what is he saying though he saying go to hell
off two days may angry a he's shyness sort of portray him as as you know like a slim pickens steam coming out of your it's a giant head that is exploding and on fire in a jet plane flying into an open grave
so i could draw i wish it like that's awesome it's so weird
both and things cancer looks like when you open someone out there is like goya to me
is so weird how political movement that is able to fucking identify its own enemies of appropriately hate them as more successful than one that seems to not even know what i mean oh my god you know what it only recent pew will surprise there
the new york times like
art spiegelman i'm in the new york times in the atlantic get they want to actually represent their voices just give half the appeared space to ben garrison cartoon
give him a job because no one in america believes with brad stevens believes rain these people ben garrison represents millions of people now there's a third of the country that is completely on board with ben garrison so a queue and on white again loving this is what real conservatives think about john mccain this is how they regard yes if they have no respect for him
there's no reason for you to either were better than them sir ember i just thought you said it's like art spiegel then i'm now imagining ben garrison mouse but all the mice just have you written on them
and the cats have not german

i mean you guys only other favorite mini reactions to john mccain we are i'd rather than and navarro on that one was taught not to edinburgh has to be one of the worst posters of all time just it's like i also she's an auto or because you just always comes up with me my friend spent a lot of
time like trying to make each other vomit basically with like fake post and stuff were internist earnest
or body but an unabridged always she of the one where she like took her twenty three and me was like
point four percent african and choose like i knew i was a sister
because i hate drop at it was like oh my god
like foot and i'll just delete is this just wipe out the server and of ora ora i may not be a classic eighty side scrolling actually an arcade game but i spent a lot of time playing contra
it's i mean i'm not gonna lie it was bomber seeing bernie sanders and they'll see do the people yeah but the thing is people say you gotta say something hit you get shit post a few months
but like you don't have to go that far you have to call you a paragon of human decency you really fucking don't know one in your district is going to punish you for saying that anymore not saying anything at all about as funny
sandler
sometimes you just have to say there you know your thoughts and prayers whatever they are suffering
to all the time now gets away with a truck had had a less discussed here the the least nauseating political tweet about this asshole just like thoughts and prayers with the family all you got it and then added a picture of his own hot body
for and i don't know you guys live era my favorite reactions and a generic one it's it's all the liberals who posted about oh what a hero he was and of these honorable the man was and then the next day after this horrible shooting happened in jacksonville just supposing you know hash tag thought the array we're going we're going to do with this time going to get rid of the guns
you know just what a day hence there were praising the center who took the most from the and are a part of twelve million dollars
you guys
oh
has a lot of john mccain tweets he loved and like a lot of this when his gear cindy mccain a grief stricken nation thanks you and your family for sacrificing your own time for him and sharing john mccain with the rest of us she said
is the third is the polish
it's a to have twenty good person paul
oh i'm going to get ahead
the city became loved it every time that asshole off the fucking house he's on a regular this is being a fucking cruel to her
oh my god you think anyone who's ever wiped off as much flops what actually probably got the botox and
yeah but
cindy mccain after john died jesus christ dude
she's going to eat pray love her way around the world and good luck sister health on what the family what does family that we're stuck with them forever oh yeah i hope you guys like him soon to troop mccain like his his son that like volunteered for iraq and somehow didn't like crashes bradley fighting vehicle into a bottomless pit
he's going to come
yeah measured in bend oregon had some cursed egg
who are using dna wizardry and create some immortal monster that in the senate for the return of when they're going to create the ultimate wedding graduates they're going to create this child who was born like dabbing for the deficit
didn't have the worst should have to come out with a shiny
now i need a nominee megan filler dad see that's going to rule when she votes for some build a convert the poor into slavery and he gets mad or and she says like my dad died and my god tells me that i'm doing the right thing here you can criticize me and all the fucking soccer is like joe walsh we're going to sign on to it
version you talking about all the suckers are going to wrap it up i want to return to where we began which is my question is why are all these liberals so torn up about this why are they having this perform it is being of you know he was a good man even if i didn't agree with him politically and i just my race for them is
certainly didn't like or respect you
there's not a single person in the conservative media who would extend you or any of your favor the same level of decency if obama drop dead tomorrow there's not a single person in the right wing press or politics who would wait even a second prefer they started gloating or critiquing his legacy at the very i'll just go back to the robots for ted kennedy
yeah obese for ted kennedy or yeah if if bernie sanders died tomorrow and all these same people all the centrists all the right wing people will take a big shit all over him and you know what i will be the last person to say how dare you or don't do that or that's not fair
i would i would expect nothing less than are we fucking disappointed if they started talking about what a good and decent person he was no exact
say you really are exactly so if i see you respecting very sanders every i'm going to be right there first reply on to your tweed going the a chief
yikes for me
bam so i guess my advice for them or advice or just my message to them at the end of the show is free yourself from this high school play pageantry of politics as martin said many times before we live in the age of horace know everything is permitted nothing is forbid it absolutely
they kill you and they would never send you the same courtesy and this idea that with three other eighty and what they're going for with this is they don't really like john mccain they don't really like this person if they ever met him i'm sure they would be be rude to them they be terrified of him what they're doing is they want this they think they're they're going to cash out
if they just do enough performance of dignity and virtue that like that
the other side will finally respect them this is no they won't yeah this is lisa and
those fucking tokens
at the game and then you go you get a big stuffed animal kolb comedy but as you say like the takings you collect the tickets you use the tokens to play the game and then you get it you get a big stuffed animal at the end of the river
he assures you that you know what we're better than them know you're not you're not better than them you are weaker than them
because you have no power if you did you wouldn't be bleeding on about how unfair it is to be mean to him or what a good man he was if you had power like they do you would say and do what you want and you would make sure that the historical record reflected what you actually believed you wouldn't be don't really believe in any this
you're just doing like i said a school play of what you think a smart political person should do well and they think that sunday if they simply long enough they will be rewarded yeah they think the eventually they'll like the the mass of people will see the one side being so awful and so
oh so partisan and so small minded and see the other side being always so reasonable and always will
hey handling and not inside the public enemies it will someday respect them rolling over in showing that bally's
reposted
the liberal fantasy the liberal crucible fantasy of the last seventy years is fuck and twelve angry men it's henry fonda twelve angry men being the one voice of reason and logic
and compassion and a room full of people riven by prejudice and small mindedness and greed who over just by being decent by by being decent over and over again eventually turns them all to your side and never literally once perfect your everyone yeah you'll never grovel your way and
being respected get off your knees like i said you'll feel better it's much for the grey just set your friend out your free but another one where you just sort of divide the people the people take this should seriously it's like yes they have this fantasy
comedy in their head and this delusion that they can use they can politeness their way into power and respect but also a base a lot of them they don't have a problem with the john mccain view of the world they don't have no problem with the harvard of governance they just wanted to have a a sheen of compassion over it a sheen of bipartisan cool
operation
this meant the fantasy that these are people in operating out of a good intentions for the betterment of all instead of just this endlessly humiliating and dehumanizing capitalist process of stripping everything of all dignity and meaning and we're just fucking slurry right and
that that thing for them mccain often voted for trumps agenda and he was pretty much every logically in line with him that just doesn't process for a lot of them because it's like mccain and trump are the two polar opposites for them because is how politics feels to them with it feels worse with mccain at least it feels
they can live the rest their lives when really they lives are totally unaffected they could just read the news less if they want to feel less bad even though i in name alcohol in a in one of these are people that like beat off to the western front christmas cease fire
that style is an his success that's what success it i mean the out of your enemies i mean the christmas truce would have been cool if when their office or showed up and said get back in the trenches they fucking shot them
well let's leave it there for this week one little postscript no matter who it is cindy a job io kelly ward
because john mccain didn't have the foresight to resign and seat one his brain was pretty much more at that point
an unelected republic in will be sitting in that seat two twenty twenty mobile for all of drums agenda we wave congratulations again last last thoughts pairs up for a real one plus a stable us extra prayers for other people out there hating one last thing and may still going strong john mccain or in the fucking ground if i don't
final the one last virtuous thing we have to do on the show an honor of john mccain just reminder we are going on tour
