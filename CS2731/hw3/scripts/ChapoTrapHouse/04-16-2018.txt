
did you might you be changed his interviewed she just in memorial barbara bush like your thoughts

they get to live the jack with hot
in houston a here's the thing about me dude of your fucking problem with this i literally thing barbara bush bush's the same way she was portrayed in the simpsons
counter argument to that i thought not feel i say she got you on spin magazine confusing it with the rapper a logic i love those i love that happens
one of those things that only gets funnier to me every time he's one of those guys he's like a good technical rapper but he's like i'm going to talk about i'm going to rev about psychology
when he was and
the rick and morty rapper
you mean the cool one is the hierarchy rapper
there are going to be a rick skin and four
no but i've already unlocked the bill maher




hello friends it's your shadow for the week
we've got a jam packed show for year we've got a double shot of interviews for you for stuff is dan fan
to discuss the rather serious allegations of anti semitism been leveled against jeremy carbons labour party and then after that we'll be talking with eric bonk about the oklahoma teacher strikes that's going the future that and as well as teacher strikes on going around the
the country but before we get to either of those probably the most pressing international news at the moment regards our recent airstrikes against syria so without further ado we finally let felix tell the truth about syria chopper let's go
i was laughing that assad is stupid fortnight guy because one of three in the article it was like
parts of it it's like they hid his secret chemical weapons base and it's like sounds like a pretty bad secret but then i was thinking about assad last year at conferences
use like
whatever you do don't hit my secret base yo yo can know about that one
when they hit it
we use like damn this is such a hassle reminds me that that they're actually as a way that we could have stopped this i mean some people have blamed us literally in part anyway for allowing this to happen when not talking enough beforehand about how the attacks on syria prompt does lives every athlete alerts for us so that's what i read
lies though i think obviously that's not true nobody in positions of informed citizens listens to the show but fortnight
you felix if you could get baron
on your fortnight squad
and then tell him the truth about syria he would then tell donald and that could literally save the earth yes i am not i'm not bumping anyone i'm apparently so
saying that donald trump isn't involved father yeah lay down trump talks to his kid at all yeah i know i'm sorry but barons like okay but i'm not bumping chat chat was a halo when we were para baroness okay
that is bullshit night again
you think he's like a good panic those are amazing i guarantee you baroness an amazing for bipolar
i look in his eyes and i see it he's got that shared this is the expert he's talking about i wasn't
many where we get accused again of skirting the most important issue for us to talk about fortnight
you know the united states with great britain and france
launched about one hundred quote precision missiles at syria from cruisers in the mediterranean on friday night
we saw about nine o'clock trump address the nation and said you know the gas killing animal aside has gone too far and we're going to do strikes against his air force and chemical weapons facilities
sort of a replay of almost exactly a year ago when the trump first launched airstrikes on syria this is i guess a slightly bigger version of that we don't have casualty numbers yet
it's still murky like there is a reason that you should immediately react to every input you get on this war because everyone's like oh it's the most documented war in human history and it's like
you can still be misinformed you can still not get probably because of that yeah
but
yet so we did hit apparently we had a very populated suburb but i don't know what the casualty numbers on that and probably will come out right is supposed to damascus
and there's debate over whether we actually directly hit it has a has a camp or not
if we did apparently was totally evacuated the point is a lot of it seems like we had a lot of empty buildings and a lot of the response i've got that i've seen from this has been oh well you know this is what you stand up against hitting the empty buildings and it's like oh yeah i know these strikes really kind of
stupid side shows and away but we did a lot of similar strikes like this on iraq in the nineteen nineties and the reason that they're bad is because it sets this precedent like that all the strikes before that it is well like all the times under obama we had them or when we drop that fucking bomb on the mosque in a lap oh
that wasn't against the syrian government it was against newsroom
still killed a shit load of civilians or when we hit mosul like we did last year and just fucking iced hundreds of civilians
the reason all these are bad and the reason that you see people freaking out about these in particular and you can make a lot of all all this is hypocritical i personally don't think the antiwar movement in the us is so strong that i want to talk an armchair quarterback it right now
but it's because it just becomes a normalized we love that world word now normalized running things like al yeah every year six months we're going to hit this part in syria and then when the time comes that we actually do a ground invasion because policy changes you know but we didn't always we didn't use to have such a strong oversight and
role in the saudi intervention and yemen under bush and than we did because if there is precedent for these things and if there's a running thing that we see is normal becomes easier for the say to do it yet felix i agree with you and i think we talk about this lot about hypocrisy not being a good holiday
cool strategy first of all because no one likes a smug asshole
and second of all because people aren't consistent ever none of them doesn't make any difference but there is something truly shocking about like
okay france is there which is hilarious because half of the people freaking out of a trap during this i like micron is my boyfriend like i mean it it there is
there there must be a way we can point out the fact that there needs to be some kind of consistent attitude towards war without being well you didn't care about acts because those people are also completely politically useless that are not going to bring anyone over it
i mean we really are starting from scratch right now trying to produce an anti warmer than i literally have no idea how to do with what i find interesting about the reaction to these korean airstrikes and the fact that trump is doing them
see when i watch that press conference his address the nation on friday i felt sick to my stomach thinking about what might happen should this idiot decided to take too big of a bite and actually kill russian soldiers or artillery or something like that i mean again the potential for this to spiral out is of course
gray or it could just be one of these and i think that what you said the word normalize this kind of almost ritual quality to these airstrikes in the way it's being talked about wanted to two examples of these sort of liberal foreign policy establishment that consider themselves anti trump consider him a the grave threat to american
secrecy and agent of russia etc but nonetheless support these quote precision airstrikes on a side because they think the use of chemical gas is so beyond the pale and so ghastly that only america can enforce those norms i just want to buy provided by the way
rebels also use gas on kurds
in this exact war and we've hit opposition groups before but we did not hit them for that powerful do er jo and marie slaughter and samantha power slaughter in power yeah perfect dickensian names for these two emery slaughter says i believe that the u s u k in france did the right thing by striking syria
over chemical weapons it will not stop the war nor save the syrian people from many other hard it is illegal under international law but at least it draws a line somewhere and says
just really and legally in defense but at least we're weapon at our decks it put it out and then the next one son at the power says i see the case for opposing us strikes and hash tag syria trump is anti muslim deceitful trigger happy he lacks a syria planet any seeming regard for international or domestic law
but please share views on what the us should do to deter chemical weapons massacres nothing he may be stupid as fuck fat lazy racist and cheat on me but he's still my
i mean we could get rid of our chemical weapons as a show of good faith that's one idea does a starting point did not sell them what you go there is well
there are other people might not help other countries do use them be nice my favorite thing i saw was this the slaughter of power was like i'm surprised that iran would backup assad power after you used chemical weapons after it was used on them the iran iraq war and it's like first of all i wonder who is
the bill of sale for those that
check out but also like what a fucking dumb argument it's like oh yeah
it's pretty surprising the united states government's use bombs after so many other marines died in beirut know
is while you really got on there but i think is so interesting about power and slaughter here is if the both acknowledge that this is illegal i mean i know international law is of laid up can't believe what they're saying sorry it's her baby
the illegal by the standards of international law unconstitutional by our own law slot or even says it won't help the syrian people war
know why they all think it nonetheless is right thing to do because for them like the thing that absolutely cannot be acknowledges the idea that the united states can't really shouldn't try to stop these quote chemical weapons massacres like we are the absolute authority and the world to to enforce that norm by
any means an arbitrary norm because
a fraction of a fraction of people killed the sort of war been killed by chemical weapons
and you could kill another one hundred two hundred thousand people with with conventional weapons and it wouldn't cross any lines so it would be fine but i think what it really shows is so much of the elite opposition to trump is we know it's a aesthetic they don't like him being president because he's a grotesque but beyond that the even know
deep down that now is he not only are you only grossed out by him because he's this disgusting huckster but you don't even think he really has power
you this guy that you know is corrupt and ego driven maniacal and possibly senile possibly see now at least deeply stupid you're comfortable with him and send in cruise missiles into the heart of a
it's the other nuclear powers
and not be too worried that it's going to turn a world war three and because you know that he's not really in charge of us he knew know that this this imperial military system operates under its own logic and under the supervision of its own real deep state the military state and that he's essentially a hood ornament
so it really makes you have to ask people like this
why do you give a shit about trumpeting more like when you care that he's corrupt what do you care that he's dumb if you know that he's just the asshole and the front front of the white house mood around the steering wheel without it actually piloting anything that why do you fuck and care i have a theory about this i think it is to maintain that
the exact same foreign policy in line etc
and to maintain the status quo but to say yeah by because they know it's very popular i mean this is not going to pretty is
you know the sort of daily life that most americans are extremely excited to wake up and face by with truck there they can be in charge yet also at a greek people's complaints about the way the government is operating with well it's because it's this guy let us let us put together like a sensible
republican you know maybe just like just a moderate they would could have easily find a democrat who would have the exact same policies easily what we know for fact that hillary clinton presidency would have involved strikes and syria by now at least as many as we've seen i think be in venezuela
maybe maybe you don't hold don't hold your breath because my pump palmdale gets in there i mean we're already in there in some capacity were already in all these places in some capacity we have over fifty five hundred contractors in syria as one contractor for every us troop we have their and all these places and work
or operation condor to was just starting but i've got to say that his book but her emails that's right he tried to already all when she was running for
oh god shut up
but whatever investing about like what you're saying what you're saying and the slaughter in power line and the sort of foreign policy blog that considers trump a dire threat to democracy but nonetheless seems to support his ceremonial bombing of a country in a civil war which as you said also includes russia and iran
is that like there is this almost ritual quality to it where it doesn't matter who's giving the orders to send these cruise missiles into syria what we're really doing it doesn't really even matter who the actors are what what they're really doing is an acting a kind of ritual by which america once again gets to say that we are
are the elites that decide what is good and bad in the world and we just by shooting those missiles like we are telling not just the rest of the robber what we're really doing is telling ourselves that we're still good and that are far and elites and in charge whole thing is a ribbon cutting ceremony yeah i mean that's very unfortunate
president donald trump
he did the independence day
oh how cute because he loves a ribbon cutting ceremony like i get to sign something he did that did the independence day speech but we have to stand up to not let people be killed with the center with their friends is real john bolton to not let that happen
and then he talked about how he could for carol tiegs a gun to do harrier jet and he just crash into into the ceiling
i mean he's ready to do the vertical takeoff in the hangar displays yeah this air force guy was like mr traub don't cut to throw was like okay great very great you wonderful day i could have i was the best pilot in new york also in other said is john mccain was just doing solo says in a prop fight in arizona and he somehow
crash in damascus
if theory said if these anti trump knapsack people were a little smarter they would realize that they should make they should keep from president forever they should dejected with with stem cells or stick his head in a jar yeah you have a that the fuck it and see like oh we don't like it either they are just keeps do i can like that idea
situation is the have this horrifying grotesque ogre that you can dump all of the bad consequences of the eternal imperial foreign policy on too because he's the one is fucking up the implementation but still have the actual policies that are that are necessitated by the logical of the empire
when when trump is prison for life when it just his head on a policy mo machine
you'd be on a severe i
going up there is also had in the crowd like
new
you guys see the clip of glenn greenwald talking with eli like ours is euro he got so are you i lake
look and beautiful beautiful though some people like they don't photograph well but you see them like in motion just gorgeous
there's a point in it where you i lakes trying to say like glenn made the pray that if you know assad is so bad he cares so much about his terrible massacres are good allies israel is literally shooting journalists in the head for approaching a fence and then cheering about it in watching like laugh
soldiers watching and laughing civilians
oh and down civilians your stance with yeah and even for more than that are again are good friends saudi arabia their charm offensive they're wonderful new prince is carrying out what many are calling the worst humanitarian disaster in the world right now he was response to that is look
our allies for all their flaws are not perfect and then he tries to start in a second point in glen just goes oh they're just flawed eli they're just they're they're simply just a few imperfections there and then you are mad sometimes he played a i leave the doors open and then he follows it up by saying
i don't think you can compare saudi arabia to iran because iran is responsible for the deaths of two thousand american troops in iraq and in iraq because they gave the shaped charges
hi and glenn greenwald said what were those troops doing in iraq
and he goes on securing the constitution and protect the government says like you can't compare saudi arabia causing a famine that is killing probably a million people who are the three thousand americans have forgotten lower manhattan
who were not in vain
the only get israeli
just kidding everybody i think the black eagle did
again anyone who is trying to make this argument that like oh we just simply have to do something about aside i mean they're they're talking out of their ass like i don't get why why even if you believe that we we have something has to be done about it why the fuck was you could you possibly think that america would be the ones to do something about it or make it back
here's something we could do we could let in more than eleven refugee yeah that and refugees and are millionaires that's a lot of the ones we let in a lot out of the eleven
in areas yeah i'd still be let it but yeah we should let in then
and then a massive policy of geographic ignorance built into our public education system because people always do this down share where they like people can't even find north korea on the map and then they pull people who can't find north korea and the map and pull people who can the people who can or leg by the way we do something about then
and it's like you know at this is why you should be somewhat skeptical of anyone who claims to be an expert in any kind of region or foreign foreign policy because usually they become an expert because they're fascinated with the conflict of the area and they want to you know to a man with a hammer
and and it's just you're not going to find something you're less likely to find a sensible foreign policy position from someone who has spent twenty years studying a region it's just it's were also getting paid by one of the forces in the region with a vested interest in in proposing
their side of it i mean that clear but i mean it it's the same thing with university like with media like anyone who gets really fixated on foreign policy like there is a good i'd say a four out of five chance that they end up arriving at the conclusion that well
that means we need to go there again
when it comes to this
foreign policy apparatus they don't seem to care who's in charge as long as they perform these ritual acts of america being tough and exhibiting leadership on the world stage and they don't seem to care that it's carried out by a unitary executive it's now largely completely on tethered from congress or the constitution or even
any democratic accountability
and they don't even mind that the person in charge of it is a doddering lunatic who they regard to be a danger in every other respect so i mean again it's a it's sort of an old chestnut but i just brings to mind
the old adage the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result
these
libya iraq like the list goes on and on the these people ever think that some good is going to happen out of this or they're going to they're finally going to get to the moment where like they get to be like the way the world war two conquering heroes or something
the point really isn't the outcome for these people for just the more rank and file cable news talking heads the point for them is that it feels reassuring and strong and a way to call for airstrikes to see the to see them meted out with the same thing
precision that we always say that we have it feels good to speak with for with this authoritative manner on what needs to be done and then for everyone above them who's actually part of the state are part of arms manufacturers they directly profit off of the i just have returned to the samantha power thing which is very indicative she says please share views and
you should do to deter chemical weapons massacres like the onus is on us to be like well i don't know we can do to determine that i don't know that we should word is really good at making things better that's that's our biggest talent at in a city of it's the same answer is i don't know what we can do to stop stop fucking stop fucking up
following fucking kindling under the fires exact got their god why isn't the question the first part of her statement which is i see the case for opposing us strikes and and lists all the reasons it's insane so why isn't the question to her samantha why don't you come up with an answer about what good you think this is going to do yeah why she that way it's not going to deter these luck
it will deter oh it blew up the korean factory i guess i'll just go back to killing people by this thousands with regular bombs and guns
like the classic samantha power thing where she writes an entire book on a problem from hell us policy and genocide and doesn't even devote a single chapter to any of the genocides actually carried out or abetted by the united states that she isn't mention indonesia
in her book i don't yet know that and that's the thing we see now it's like oh why are the same people who are against these are why don't they talking about russian air sorry cancer or what they're talking about a thousand maybe because
everyone
measure that you want to pose those with his ground invasion of the no fly zone maybe that's why i mainly because we're talking about our country and what our country aid and abet but this idea that you have to condemn every single that i'm against all bad things okay great bags but by the way people who also pulled out
oh this is what about his on everything else do this
what do you think the effect would be if there was a protest with like a thousand people in america against russia presidents and syria what do you think the effect would be would it be nothing would it be less than nothing
speaking of which one can and can't affect in terms of the countries that we live in and whatnot i would say
even if you don't think it matters if there is a protest against us intervention in syria anywhere where you live or that you can attend i would say do that i think it's important for yourself to be seen and heard about this if even if it's it's not nothing but it it is something and just again be oh
only same position on this is one hundred percent opposition to any us intervention and also if you go to a margin annexing have to go to a or whatever but if you go to emerge there is literally zero chance that it will kill anyone so you're already being more of a harm reduction este in terms of for
and say
well the good news for everybody who was a little worried all these all these miss power slaughter people who are a little worried right before the bombs started following that trump of serious above his little relieving syria immediately were getting the ground troops that are in northern syria out a up
emanuel mccall has just said that he has convinced trump to stay in syria long term with the troops that we have their northern syria so that's good news great everybody i mean you can take that with a grain of salt because a man whom across as self glorifying maniac and trump doesn't literally have a continuity
thought between two consecutive seconds in his life but that's what he's saying a really really sad news and getting just after your bolton manual crown has given himself entire body cancer by stepping into nuclear reactor to become dr manhattan and and civil war era rules
the guy king of japan and let's make let's make the vatican in charge of france again i was what i thought he was like a boring like neo liberal guys are fucking hate this is guys just french trudeau and then he actually gets elected and he's like i'm actually a mortal i'm like this guy rule guys rule
cause that's the that's the thing behind the veil of that neoliberal pose of rationality and thoughtfulness and clear headed miss is that
when the when the world refuses to conform to your dictates you basically go insane and you turn a new him and humor crowd that's not all of these people are though they're all this is this is we're veering into a different nerd territory here but this is the your ale thing where they're like okay it's it's very dangerous amount of power but i personally
should be able to wield it and that's that's the lead mindset but i do actually want to talk about this to send out of here
charlie kirk who is just a just a turn responded to ted lose his tweet and congressmen
he loves to post
we had a better tweet and congressmen everyone's prospector exactly bow drill
but
ten and the use of force by real donald trump get serious unconstitutional this is not self defense in net nothing covers these chemical weapons is horrific but our constitution is not bottle
and charlie card responded to it you're a moron war powers act and eight everything he clearly as a president sixty days she's military force and so having to go in front of congress every president has he is the thirty constitutionally that last four years including obama where he stayed selectively silent
now again i don't want to be lake
well where were you then but also this does point out a wheel
problem with trying to rely on procedural us and we need to start making moral arguments against war because the procedural arguments against were don't work because the entire rule book is set up to foster war
yeah now the entire international law argument the entire you didn't ask congress permission just yeah as just like well into your wheels yeah you didn't have a cover cover page on on your report say you get an fun you're on your midterm like now it first about doesn't work like that second of all you can do everything by the book and app
salute havoc all over the world it reminds me of those videos libertarians make words like know if you ever get pulled over by a cop and are being detained
they have this delusional idea and end this is this is the problem with like these these nice lives in these nice dance who are just now discovering that like a maybe wars kind of horrific is that they think that like look if i play by all the rules i'm going to get chen you're not going to be able to just follow the rules harder than anyone else and it's like you can't goody goody your way out
shit i think a interesting point about the rules at least as it pertains to the us executive branch and war making is like the her structural point here is that the presidency has way too much power in these matters and it would be better if we had an executive branch that of basically withered away
ammonium position or a country that whether away honestly but the point is like the presidency is basically the office of imperial manager
it's basically understood that foreign policy is too important to be kept in the realm of domestic politics which is you know that that's just something that people vote on our real power like that what's really important his foreign policy and our military and how we govern the world and it's basically everything we do isn't popular even
among the right and left but what we need is a presidency it doesn't matter what party they are in or who voted for them or wide that all toe the line as imperial manager and carry out his foreign policy that is as i've mentioned completely until from our threadbare constitution or any kind of democratic input from the
cool and i mean burn the constitution whatsoever but you know there's been multiple kind of paul's on this and the engineer
class and the media class in terms of foreign policy are right wing more right wing on average than the average bumble fuck american in the middle of nowhere this is ideas that there are these like crude and educated meat heads that are always wanting to go to war that's absolutely not true americans everyday are being subjected to war
again to constantly and yet they're still last right wing in terms of war then like fucking samantha power
yeah in fact because there's been a slight right wing
blow back against trump for alex jones got very the crime and real many times didn't really show some of the the the the the saddest alright people are very unhappy about all of this but
i just wanted to share one message from a diehard trumps supporter bill mitchell for you have these things wrong any of these people who are doubting their big wet boy just because he went back on his explicit promise to be less material and less less aggressive in foreign policy and got us more involved in a war that he
he said he wouldn't and tweet about over and over again can i just said before this
when alex jones was crying he said trump betrayed us is no one in this world pure say that about donald trump
donald trump was that very moment i thought this list mean they thought he was salmon are reading and monster was was my poor boy but but
johnson the rest bill bill mitchell says when you only back your president when he does one hundred percent of what you want you're not a supporter your user
oh shit
aw bill is for really aren't really an hour with tammy wynette stand by your man
ah do that is the rebuke that is a twenty eight thousand rebuke of fake friends i'm sick of people manipulating president donald trump
but that's the end result were politics is basically your instagram feed you know he's he's just another thought that you follow
people need to get off his back is the best ahead
a user
easing that is this is what have any when your politics are formed by lake highly hostile into personal facebook means you want your you want your you want a politician to do things that you want that dude homey what that's not a friend so we'll see how this all turns out we'll be paying attention to it
again on case you needed someone like me to tell you it the only sane position here is one hundred percent opposition to military intervention in syria has any annihilating and continually yeah and anyone who tries to make the make the argument seem like it's really more complicated than that is
selling you a bill of shit
today we are here with dan thin who is daddy editor of the new left review and he recently he has something and jackman called corbin under fire
i don't know who has been following this
but if you caught that fantastic
daily mail headline
it was they held it beat route in the air and shouted fuck capitalism
now there are a lot of differences and similarities between like u k media and american media size is a huge wooden but they're both very insular they're both very sort of like close to power that kind of thing but i have to know just the daily mail not have
one you in their room to tell them that it is a horse radish for the seder plate and not a beat rate
yes like they totally did that
oh you know the political say though you may
you lie
love leavened bread
so we're talking of course about jeremy corbin was invited to a seder
with a left group that is very sort of tongue in cheek named a judas spelled do and and us and the sort of both the right wing and this sort of right of labour has been running with it and been terrified about this or at least feigning terror over so called anti semitism in the labour party dan
can you tell us about this why is generally carbon leading pogroms
well the judas though was one of the most borrowers go low some of the people who were giving note about it obviously knew so much about and subject got bass boat
cedar sieber
and of course the urge to be true to know that sort of thing
it did have a positive side to it but this here are two very obscure marginal left wing jews group in britain old song became nationally famous they managed to overtake on twitter for the number of followers
the border deputies were cheeseburger
i would say a very conservative establishment voice of the british jewish community and was one of the reasons or judas was set up in the first place that they wanted to challenge the monopoly you jewish political expression for people who are very right wing support the conservative party don't support israel would support netanyahu people who say
messages and congratulations to donald trump without mentioning any dog whistles about george soros and his campaign
those were the very people who have been pointing the finger jeremy colman along with daily mail and telegraph in the times know he's very right wing newspapers have a history of openly flirting with racism or just getting down and dancing with racism
including anti semitism
when corbett looking on the record here during the main thing is to focus on the big picture because people often get caught up talking about individual cases but the big picture there's a narrow that's been good about a large parts the british media and not just the right wing press the liberal press and while the bbc which sable own priority is
with our anti semitism top to bottom
it's cold hosts for jews that was a phrase used by columbus for the guardian newspaper liberal newspaper
it's a party for the many not good you that's fantastic that as as like a title that we would have come up with a bottle narrative is just completely force i'm defamatory
and when people are asked about this you know the question that's always put the labour party members whether their senior politicians are ordinary members they always say do you accept that labour has problem with anti semitism
and as a trick question because nobody's going to say no idea have a single member with anti semitic views starts a problem how many people in the labour party right now
over half a million so there's going to be one or two anti semite yeah it's about one percent of the population the out of population britain's now memorable a priority since this surgery membership post carbon
on the cases that are been brought to light mean i certainly have been cases of labour party members making anti semitic comments on social media especially but their courage and in the tens and twenties not in the poses and the plan
so you don't ten percentage in october one present you're not even don't break point one of one present
and of course you know that doesn't mean you should say that's fine
there's less anti semitism in the labour party under his in british society as a of course a laugh when priority should be trying harder they should be going the extra model which be doing everything they can to root out any kind of bigotry
and that's perfectly fair to say to labour that they should do that but that's not the the arguments put their the everyone has not been bought some labour party members of an anti semitic comments or even though the parties own disciplinary structures aren't up to scratch your but the leadership has been go to some failings
again the main line
idea that wouldn't me the smear that want to be an ally and i think the majority of people including cobra themselves would respond to class in good faith they would have seen as as a constructive engagement but instead of been bombarded with this hysterical still absolutely hysterical
given the impression but the labour party has the kind of atmosphere of munich beer hall in the nineteen thirties
some of it it's just completely hallucinatory just to give you one example of a story that was published in the new york times by howard jacobson was best known as a novelist
he's a very strong to tractor of carbon in the loan guarantees well he wrote an article after the labour party conference last year in which he claimed it was emotion on the conference for proposed to question the truth of the holocaust know that just never happened it was completely made up it's not even an exaggeration of something going happened on the government's floor he just made it and i would have open
a new york times or fact checkers both they allow that to get through and people must have read that and thought well it's in the times that asked him of being true
it was true be a really shocking thing to read about it but it just didn't happen
there's plenty of examples of there's all kinds of innuendo where people are accused of anti semitism just because of think they said about israel
i'm sure you're familiar with some of these arguments were it's not quite said that to criticize israel as anti semitic or people are accused of singling out israel they have an unhealthy interest in israel why don't you talk about syria why don't you talk about other countries in to people who protest against israel and low party also protest against countries like turkey saudi arabia
involved in major human rights violations and aggressive wars and oppressing people the kurds
and waging war in yemen their the very same people who are critical of netanyahu's government but they're still accused of being obsessively focus on israel and there's only real one real explanation of why they should be so obsessed be focused on israel yeah a one thing i forgot to mention that story was invited to speak today
is like i had never heard them before and i sort of reading pretty heavily about that you know accusations of
anti semitism against the labour party for a while now
and by he was invited and he brought the horseradish from his current because he isn't angel
really is the best type of seder get either
sometimes you bring what a guy
it's a different goal is to the theater
it's nice because it interrupts the traditional lake
sniping at each other out
some redoing some tax assessment or whatever
yeah and corbin is the idealized boy that you bring to your seder is he's a platonic guy he's the absolutely it's just that
one of the things about it was but it wasn't even meant to be a political intervention by carbon you know and he just these guys were his friends because the people behind judas veteran left wing activists in london a lot of them in north london
and i've been friends with them for decades so they invited along not because he was the leader at a low priority you know they would have invited mom when he was just an order it a grumpy
i'm he went along with some political calculation but just because he wanted to counter to stay with his friends i mean one of the most surreal
stories of the male got two or three days of outrage if airbus and one of the most real stories they heard was exposing the shocking fact that corbin had shared a table with a man called david rosenberg i think just first time they've rosenberg ever made it into the national press but everyone has been around the left in london with know pretty well
he's a great guy and you know he's he's a story and he does walking tours about the jewish history of east end of london
he helped organize the march for the eighteenth anniversary of the cable street demonstration in the nineteen thirties which is to jewish community and the east and came out to confront britain's fascist movement along with non jewish left wing activists and beat them all off the streets
and you know the the male models to get a whole story about the shocking fact that carbon were sitting down to stalk with this man named rosenberg without mentioning the fact that he was jewish and and they quoted out of context some some things that they've rosenberg said arguing about as i would say though narrative around
they were aren't exempt his was completely exaggeration largely manufactured and he was presented by the mail or some kind of sinister apologist for anti semitism when anyone who knows his name is david rosen back while
you know he's also have been someone has been very careful of speak up when i read or sci anti semitic attitudes creeping into left wing circles or people picking up certain jokes that they don't even understand fully conspiracy stuff you know stuff about the rothschilds or george soros are are kind of trash
he's always been very clear and speak out against that
and yeah she's know travesty by the daily mail as some kind of
galileo figure
while i think to you said curious get snag as these kind of self loathing choose to you because they like
gotta or whatever they did they did the palestine supplement to pass over prayer that kind of lake
it's it's it's it's a very common thing for left wing palestinian said that this choose to jail but i think people that and one of two ways with it like oh look he's doing this cynical pr move or they said oh lucky found the most anti israel jews he can't possibly could
and people managed to call those to view simultaneously as well
right
convenient that i guess one of the things it's kind of hard to trace the origins of this story and you saw i mean it's it's a common tactic for sort of liberals and we see it a lot of this weapon as a nation of identity politics to take down left wing figures we saw
during the campaign attempts to sort of spear
the momentum in the carbon campaign as as sexist or whatever
it didn't really take hold but this actually has sort of a lot more juice behind it i mean there's a lot more ink being spilled over the supposed edge of this bugaboo the anti semitism and labour party where did that come from and why is it still delhi
i think some of it
involves tactics that have been important new us because i'm sure you know the the way the palestine sold early activists and lot of american university campuses are targeted by pro israel activists rather than just engaging with the politically and trying to refute the arguments that you accuse them of threatening jewish students of having been
made anti semitic remarks not sort of thing and then you the university investigates these complaints
there are found to be groundless but in the meantime
people have how to expand a lot of energy defending themselves against these calls are allegations that a lot of pretty traumatic experience and very often they've had their names
spread through the internet with ease with these accusations
that was actually the beginning of
the country with the low priority also involved a labour party ceasar easy in oxford university where they were accused of making all kinds of only anti semitic remarks
you could tell right from the start up there was something it'd be better because the guy who made these allegations the main thing he seemed to be concerned about it was that labour has endorsed the israel apartheid week
tim burton some of rents some of the protests subsequently it was investigated and found to be oh by the university and boy
low parties does plenary bodies he was found to be without any basis but in the meantime
putting a been allowed snowball
i think one of the things that does give it legs is the fact that you have organizations like i mentioned earlier the border deputies of british jews
various other organizations which claimed to be representative of the entire jewish community in britain and they do represent a certain section of jewish by noon and britain but definitely not the whole the whole community for example jargon irish the guy who's the president of the border deputies as i mentioned earlier he
russia and a statement congratulations to go trunk
after he won the presidency the u s
when trees may last her election
lost her parliamentary majority in the election last year he rushed out a statement bemoaning this he welcomed when she formed an alliance with the democratic unionist parties far right party from northern ireland
a sports everything at night knows government does to the hilt so he represents a very very right wing political agenda is not just about israel of course he's very pro israel and kronor in yahoo but it's a wider agenda as well
and of course going to be completely on unsympathetic to a laugh when navy should labour party so there is a kind of feedback loop there were a particular people you claim to be represented a huge community and britain but aren't necessarily so
they make these allegations i mean it's signal boost by the tory press because obviously they want to throw as much modus they can at the lower priority and it goes back and forth like that and that's been the main source the country obviously that's why people haven't step back and said i am what is what does the actual connection between the of the moto here on the are that we've been
caution because if you ever did that you'd say ninety percent of the hype on the stereo and this is just groundless what you have is a problem which is real to the extent but you still have some people low priority we don't him on on the wider left with anti semitic views and you have to do something about that but this audio a party where it says
dammit where it comes from the leadership down the whole party is rotten with anti semitic proceeds from top to bottom it's just not true and the facts don't paradise and anyone who's tried to do any kind of serious empirical investigation as hard to say the fax number of other i wonder if there's any anti semitism in the northern ireland
an irish unionist party
any be actually they love is real
they're big fans of subtler colonialism and apartheid yeah they have they have like marvel infinity war mural of every several group cologne
then in they love with earlier
the club no have union jack the israeli flag and then the apartheid era south african rhodesian flags up there i mean it's let sam and then it's pretty clear that you can be as personally anti semitic as possible provided that you support yes i can component
dan i wanted to ask you like it seems pretty obvious what's going on like when you said with the telegraph for the mail or the right bring press in britain which will do you know will hit any stuff
stoner club at hand to hit jeremy carbon with an anti semitism is the easiest when they have now but what do you think is going on with like the traditionally liberal press in in britain like the guardian and members of the labour party who are also unhappy with corbin and are also sort of flirting with this idea
hey we need to get serious about this or we need to talk about this or make an issue yeah i mean you've got people are examined him already
there's a significant group of a ramp beings who are assigned to the friends of israel group but that's just part of a wider global agenda
signed up to in terms of foreign policy but very same m s or a very keen on saudi arabia
be very keen on of our e in colombia
they pal around with area on one particular labour and who's been extremely vocal on the subject of anti semitism
was was outraged like corbin judas went he went to turkey on junk paid for by relative
since then has come back pirating the line at the turkish government on everything to do with kurdish right
clinton the sand and so on
you know he's he's known as the
the only champion
britain
i am and
nice also extremely interest in sports only arabia i mean that's what other reasons why people are so asked to court because it's not just about opinions and of israel you know his position on israel and the palestinians on paper it's not especially radical he's engraver a two state solution as european governments are also meant to be the troll
what carbon is that people think he actually means us
he doesn't present the conflict as being between two equal sides you know he talks about the oppression and the palestinians he talks about bringing real pressure to bear on the israeli government uses but he is also a very critical of may selling weapons to saudi arabia as well
yeah i mean this is one of the the issue studies have trouble with some of his employees over that but a year and a half ago they for an emotion that i already brought forward emotion to have an investigation into the sorority war and yemen and and mean time arms sales would be frozen and this is something about britain is up to their next game it's not just a question of selling the weapons they're are being used
yeah man they got british military personnel and that of the control room helping them to call in airstrikes that level of cooperation and about fifty lay rub breeze refuse to support that motion and some of them were a bit slinky and shameful about it you know they just didn't show up for the votes they pretended that they were sick that sort of thing but summer
of them were extremely proud they got up and parliament voted against this motion and explained that they fully supported the war in yemen
completely brushed aside all of the evidence on a humanitarian disaster that it was causing and all the civilians that are being killed
so you know these guys there in there in the tradition of tony blair witch
if you follow tony blair his career since he stepped down as prime minister he's set himself up as a sort of your mom for her for the war criminals the world goes around from kazakhstan and nazarbayev okay army in rwanda
first mubarak and no cc and egypt and saudi royals all
the last week or so he's been ardently calling for war in syria to overthrow saddam some people have i'm currently suggested that it's like a protection racket because assad doesn't pay for his services and minutes
any dictator who doesn't pay for tony blair this is what's gonna happen to you
you know that's us to tradition of these people were reared in you know they don't even question that the alliance with saudi arabia and britain
is one of those unquestionable thousands of the foreign policy establishment
they really high carbon because he just asked the question of why why are we alone with these guys why is it ok to be like with these guys but not with around for example why is around beyond the pale saudi arabians perfectly respectable force you know a couple of months ago
the up and coming to the real power
in saudi arabia the young royal there he came to london on a visit and it was extraordinary been around here at the were like billboards in the street
full page ads and newspapers to welcome this kind of thing
it was sort of thing you'd expect in in really does stuff the extent of the lot to say the arabia and then with the guardian newspaper
has been better the austro carbon from start to ludicrous extends to a point where they really alienated a large part of their readership not not aimed at people who'd be hard core left wingers just people who were in some way to pathetic to the labour party has stood for and record one
and some of them along with some of the labour and peace they were quite and down for rubbish by the election result last year because it much better than anyone expected went much better than they had hoped they were hoping for labour to do very badly and this would set the stage to as carbon when you got forty percent of the vote they were there completely startled and put them back for
but it's these issues around israel saudi arabia but they started to find their boat dirt find a voice on rather
the first example actually the first time they were both the park but after the election was over venezuela summer where all of a sudden a group of labor appease he never asked a question about venezuela or said anything to do with anything and latin america and their whole careers set up an all party group parliamentary group en venezuela to demand that
corbin denounced mulder through and support an opposition and all this kind of stuff
you know us us gonna shoot after their first loyalty and politics is to nato it's to washington and all the stuff that goes with that whether it's whether it's netanyahu whether it's already on whether it's to saudi royals the war in yemen
that's about all that all agenda and everything else comes close behind it
that and p talked about is john would tack
that's right yeah yeah woodcock he was actually in a video but phosphorus global which is a weird turkish think tank that has some like weird links the isis oil
bragging like lucca just stood up for us shower to her home region woodcock but going back a little bit corbin stance on israel and palestine and a lot of misery
i feel like the service center right that sec press in either our country or the u k they'll go harder against a guy like that who will just take it sort of what is generally if you actually look at on paper like a very moderate stance like this is an occupation and gaza we shouldn't sport
but not like let's nuke tel aviv man that they'll go harder on that the kids they're more afraid when a middle of the road here we just want to give palestinians in it just like one
a deterrent
they go harder on that i feel in the same reason that they sort of when hard on the iran deal and i think it scares them to see the window in their world in their roles of respectable politics push just a little bit more than anything else exists in the world they know there are more
works extreme positions out there and there people more in line with those positions but it is more terrifying to them someone like you remember the stuff about keith ellison oh yeah he doesn't has even more like to the right stance on a lot of this is in america we don't even really have that much of an anti war movement
basically haven't had one since obama but he just says the word palestine and just fucking nuclear freak out
they these institutions rely on they're not even being presence of a reasonable moderate counterweight ethic
go back a little bit good phil donahue fired from amherst
the way that he opposed the iraq war they're more interested in even just the sort of like new deal liberal type war opposition they're more terrified at that than anything
even if you actually look at it on paper it's like this is really you
half the half people are probably calling this guy a cock because don't tell you
but that that's still too much the position the the presence of their position is acceptable is seen as an existential threat to them just like you know how the not completely embargo iran is seen as legitimizing them like it wasn't already you don't like it wasn't already a country
became there anything that threatens their general order is the most terrifying thing in the world they rely on setting the narrative every time yeah
i think one of the things that mania opponents especially don't like about government is that they know full well he does speak for a pretty big section of british public opinion
a classic example about was during general election campaign last year there was a terrorist attack in manchester and you know really horrible attack were suicide bomber blew himself up at a pub cancer killed a lotta kids really horrendous
jeremy carbon his first public reaction was to make a speech and and she said of course nothing could ever just for this and the responsibility lies with the terrorists both we have to look at whether the war on terror has made things worse and make things better and the overwhelming evidence is it's made things worse it's aggravating instability was it's create conditions for groups like al
and ice is to grow and spread on the whole experience the war on terror since nine eleven has been a failure
and when this was being flagged up the previous night i remember all the why his political commentator saying this is suicide this guy is going to blow their whole election campaign they're going to drop ten points in the polls people like strong leaders day like someone who are tough on security this is not the time to be making these comments and then the next day he made
speech she was very good at it was very cogent articulate very moderate on the apollo has done that day and the majority of people agreed with them even conservative voters agreed with him because it's so blindly have it then i remember that the i remember being like oh shit
this is going to blow the election far out and because people are know
people act rationally when they're scared and like lo and behold it just didn't happen everyone somehow kept a cool head it was like really really hardening people freaked out because no one had ever really in our modern age it really really ever did with carbon did there
it was one of the most amazing things i have seen an electro baltics in my lifetime yeah people really surprise me it's like really encouraging i had a little oh humankind are not monster a ya
the night before when it had been planned a magnet speech are deprived with this kind of getting sense of anticipation can always actually gone for this you know even if it goes horribly wrong at least they didn't chicken and then the next day when you're watching the coverage old only saw this opinion polls are watching football match and cheering
but that's that's the kind of talk that's not meant to be spoken in public because they know it makes sense so you have to just declared were bold and you can't even say these things in public i think it appeal to people because there's been there's always been a learning curve over the last fifteen sixteen years you know if this is now the day after nine eleven people can remember what has happened before
there were terrorist attacks in britain or in the us or in france and what the reaction was that the mood reaction going or boggling and country invading a country whether many people safe or not
once they can see the results so people have been watching put the last fifteen or sixteen years even though it seems pretty clear certainly reading all the commentary from
the prospect of bombing syria who last week the people who are paid to write about politics and about foreign policy and the british media have learned to ping
there's a whole generation and pundits who should have been cleared asian penchant for after they got things so wrong about iraq and they are allowed to carry on in their positions and they've learned absolutely nothing
but the great british public aren't quite as blind them and this this
awareness understanding it's not just restricted to people on the left i would say there's a pretty
wide range people and center and even on the right
you don't agree with carbon about taxation or public ownership requests like bass and think he's a bit of a bit of a loony left the but when he says these things they just know their head and say well that's just common sense as much in just really wrap things up here from from an outsider's perspective of course you know what you're
described is jeremy corbin is being knocked as an anti semite for attending a passover seder with jewish people and it seems ludicrous but are you worried that ember alluded to earlier like the original line of attack when the election was happening was a labour and jeremy corbin in particular and momentum and problem
with women in that didn't really stick are you worried that this
semitism line has more purchase or more staying power then the the idea that
a problem with women are that their means of women i certainly think it has more purchase but i think the real danger of the stuff that's been talked about so much in the last couple of months because it wasn't the anti semitism control receipts before the us
this chair or three weeks dead against the idea that corbin was a czechoslovakian spy
that did think it all because people are like cool
well it sure it should have done to death and twenty four hours
it was making this claim also claimed that he had organized the library conference
oh a gilt das this
while i like the idea of being an eastern bloc spy
but that was allowed to run for a couple of weeks and then the is there was a story where a former russian agent was poisoned and britain
corbin was accused of being unpatriotic
not because he said this death and he wasn't the russian government just because he said let's not rush to judgment here let's look at the evidence let's look before we leap sort of thing
so this has been ongoing since i would say the start of february
and it means that while labour is tired of with the stories it doesn't appear to have how much of an impact on their polling figures you know their polling figures have held up
jury moto that whole period but it means they don't get the chance to talk about their actual policies their manifesto they're gone into the local elections are going to be held here in a few weeks time and labor has all kinds of ideas for her to change the economy not especially radical you know it's not like they have some sort of revolutionary anti capitalists program
i've got a good repost social democratic program
and whenever people are asked about the policies that they put forward a very popular in their resume people and they stand against
the conservative party which was increased need discredited on every aspect of their economic record and is left to policies that are deeply unpopular
but the longer they spent having to be back these allegations and even if the controversy itself doesn't stick in the long run that's time wasted on i think a large quantities manufactured controversy is tit to tie them up and prevent them are looking at work and prevent them from using their energy stocks went over new people
finn thank you so much for joining us and
and congratulations on being i think the second irish person we have allowed to be on the show wait he's irish yeah we did not have
moscow you never can
we are here with eric blank
he has been covering all of the teacher strikes for jack of then you should go back and read everything he's written so far
we talked a little bit about west virginia when we interviewed a teacher a few episodes ago now things are going off in oklahoma
can you tell us about what's going on
yeah so oklahoma has been on strike basically for the last two weeks
very similar issues to west virginia for those who fall the west virginia catastrophic conditions in the schools do two years of austerity by both republicans and democrats and teachers and staff reach a breaking point
in response to west virginia oklahoma teachers in particular
rose up maybe a little early the he excited about trying to win some semblance of public education which has been really decimated
and for the last two weeks have organize a really massive
unprecedented strike what happened and that remains to be seen but i think the big story is that despite the lack of organization by the lack of labor traditions you still seen that in a red state quote unquote working class folks early sick of what's going on and says very similar to west virginia in that sense so i was virginia i think
coordinated three different unions
is that sort of players and oklahoma right now
yet the thing to keep in mind is the level of organization and oklahoma significantly lower as far as both trade union organization and what we call like molten minority as far as radical workers who have been organizing have more of a class to have a prospective said both of these forces are significantly weaker and it's a major factor
in the way that the strike has played at and so you have one major union which is the oklahoma education association
and like a lot of other unions most other unions it's focused on lobbying the democrats in a really effective way and that has led to an impasse which is one the reasons why we see these wildcat strikes both in west virginia and in oklahoma because the strategy didn't work the going and
pleading with the legislators and or voting and the democrats didn't work because when you did vote them and they kept on cutting taxes
people against you know what that means than is a lot of people just tune out right
if you don't see any alternative you're going tuna and that mobilization from below therefore has taken a really what people call spontaneous but really what that means that people organize without
any institutional framework to hear their mobilization and the dynamic than is that there was a facebook page like in west virginia
that created some vehicle for the rank and file teachers who want it to organize a strike on the model west virginia and said the two main forces i think if you want to think about the overall control the movement are the union and the rank and file largely organize third to facebook pages but unfortunately
the difference with west virginia is that it's remained up until recently almost all on facebook
organization building that went in to the previous drake where there was really months and build up actions a lot of really important steps to build organizational capacity that type of dynamic didn't really happen in oklahoma so you had a straight called with very little of an organizational base to push it forward and so it's a little
bit more hollowed out of a movement
we're recording this on sunday
i sort of like to the term really what is the status of the strike as of now
this idea that they may persist into a wildcat strike on monday come tomorrow when the show probably comes out
yeah that's an excellent question the current situation looks pretty bleak the union leadership after
more or less two weeks of fighting to their credit through in the tower without consulting the membership last thursday said it's over we're going back didn't put up a vote to the ranks and pivoted to same we're going to get him in november will remember november which basically me
china like democrats in november even if that was the a that things are counterproductive strategy even if that were the case you would still want to win the strike it doesn't actually make sense to end your straight and the support is there this is the remarkable really sort of tragic dynamic of the strike is that seventy two percent of the population supports the strikers winning all
their demands and so the current situation is that there is widespread anger because teachers didn't want to go back they were fighting for funding this is the crucial thing is that they had one a pay increase before the strike even began when six thousand dollar pay increase which is chump change it shows that organizing frustrate can win real
way more than beta whenever before so what they've been striking for these last two weeks as an increase in funding for public education because as i mentioned the schools have been decimated they haven't won that some people wanted to stay out the union leadership through in the towel and unfortunately it's unclear
whether there will be a wildcat on monday there's a lot of anger people have over the weekend have tried to cobbled together the facebook the some in person meetings calls for people to stay out on monday my guess is there will be probably hundreds if not thousands of people at the capitol mandate whether that's enough to really turn around the momentum which
has largely dissipated
is an open question well i mean i don't know where you're proposing the electoral strategy worked great in wisconsin
that's why now the number one place can get educated there is chuck e cheese
but what what is the thing that made the leadership essentially blink in the face of popular support and continued him enthusiasm among the actual teachers
what we should keep in mind that the leadership
was pushed much they wanted to go there is not a leadership but it is a raging for a while waiting for a strike they saw what was happening from below and they realize that the ranks would go beyond them if they didn't get on board and so
in some ways was a convenient excuse the excuse was that the republicans after two weeks hadn't given anything so their explanation as we tried the pressure we had wasn't sufficient so we have to go back now there's two ways of looking that you could say yeah that's a logical conclusion they tried and now we have to pivot but with people from below
argue i think correctly is no there's an alternative would you do you have to deepen the mobilization there's all sorts of possibilities to deepen the mobilization for instance what about state workers state workers have been screwed just as bad and there was push for a state workers initially to come out in the first day of like of walk the walk at so that happened and there is cause for that they didn't do that
there was also the case that if you keep the strike going the pressure would mount on the politicians to cave really what this was isn't and durant test he's going to stay out longer unforeseen the leadership
through in the towel really before the ranks we're ready and i think before the struggles
was over
what's interesting to me is that they got the pay raises and where they in in leadership during in the towers on improving the schools usually people only like teachers when they are you know seemingly these selfless people who are willing to work for absolutely nothing
but they are
you know they're their their sympathetic when they're saying we need these conditions to teach children this is sort of
i mean again they they walked away from the table at least the leadership dead but it is interesting that they got a big pay raise i mean was the pages so low that like public opinion was just like had to concede that no one could survive offer
yeah the conditions for teachers in particular were so bad that even before the strike there was talk amongst republicans that we have to give them something the obstacles has been that you have to have a seventy five percent super majority in oklahoma to pass any tax increases and so despite so
some of the modern republican saying yeah we should give some pay raises for years now
there have been institutional block the strike was sufficient the threat of a strike was sufficient to a forest everybody to grant the teacher periods but even then even then it barely makes up for the years of no pay increases whatsoever and it doesn't do anything to the conditions in the schools so the pay is great
poop through that like that's a real difference here and people feel good about that but what do you do if you still have no functioning chairs in your classes still these textbooks people might have seen his pictures of over a decade before you have ceilings falling in so in those conditions it's understandable why teachers would want to stab him
students would want their teachers to stay up for their own conditions as well here
on the issue though of of concessions and least the the pay raise which as you mention shows that the a straight can accomplish way more than not striking would have but by comparison to west virginia when we talk to that teacher
he said that their main thing was they wanted to pay raise to be funded by a new tax and when it ended up happening is the pay raise ended up being funded by cuts elsewhere which is sort of a pyrrhic victory because if you're raises getting paid for with cuts the social services and things that people would otherwise be sympathetic to you rely on they begin to
blame you for the first place so that they weren't able to get a new revenue source to pay for their increased by how do that
how did that check out in oklahoma
the first in west virginia it's a little bit more complicated there was a surplus of a lot of the funds that paid for the raise it wasn't that it came out of deep new so that got pushed by the republicans as a way also to spin it when they conceded and the actual amount of cuts was relatively minor so that's importance
which isn't to say that the issue you raised his secondary it's actually crucial because clearly there has to be increase revenue both in west virginia and in oklahoma if the teachers winning anything is not going to come on the backs of other people so that issues very central still in west virginia in oklahoma the dynamic is as follows
the cuts to
busy of the tax breaks upwards of estimation is that one point five billion dollars a year or last from the tax breaks that have been passed just in the last ten years that is a huge astronomical amount of money that plus the really low level of taxation that goes on on oil and natural gas these are the conditions in which there is a cool
don't quit funding crisis
people aren't dumb people see that if you looked at the signs that people up from below lesser the union leadership but the signs that people have said money for schools not for oil companies
and people know that the funds or their students know that their funds are there it's a question of putting the pressure on the corporations and the politicians that are bought by them to can see this so
the demand has been for instance in oklahoma you have to pay for the schools for instance by raising was called the g p t which is that
the it's basically a tax on extracting oil and natural gas right now
up until just as last concession that was made to pass the pay raise it was at two percent which even just three years ago it was at seven percent said the big concession that now the republicans gave to pay for this race only brought it up to five percent of didn't go to where it was just a few years ago people are talking if they were added tax oil
and natural gas can measure level to texas or alaska they would have literally hundreds of millions dollars to pay for schools so it's just a question of political will and political pressure to force them
wondering if you could talk a little bit about the politics of the striking teachers now in west virginia we haven't a very good authority that they're quite a few milton leftists involved in coordinating that strike
you wrote in
an article and jackman called reddit bahama about a sort of
a history of left activism go home and that isn't really present but it does seem length there is potential for that growing at this point now and i think also i want to have to say this point because people are extremely insistent on sorry that's wales cat
his senior year
they offer you a lovely
oh oh yeah people you to
it just paint the entire middle of the country with a broad brush and there's this sense of like they're red states and blue states and the twain shall meet could you talk a little bit about the political landscape the idea
people and between because are these dupes of the republicans is clearly widespread it's also been very disproven by recent events
people need to wrap their heads around that that mass strikes that we're seeing our by these so called
really people have been written off for decades now and we see is when there's actually a class perspective put forward people season it meant in west virginia we saw that a lot of the people who were on strike but if a child
these are not by any means imagination radicals are left us or even liberals yeah so the question of just their sheer material interest in not having to leave the state and being able to pay rent plus they're very sincere
commitment to their students both in west virginia in oklahoma push them to fight back irrespective of what they might think about the republicans many of whom they voted for it even very recently so the difference i see in west virginia in oklahoma is that there is somewhat still have a as he mentioned a living leftist militant labour to
edition in west virginia and i think that it's a little exaggerated sometimes there a really romantic view west virginia that doesn't actually correspond to the
recently i've been very recently that labour tradition
was pretty dormant and yes and so when you when you're actually on the ground right to work past people didn't try to fight for that so sometimes there's a danger of explaining west virginia's as anomaly because everyone there just remembers the coal mine or as and that's not really what's going on have a very small group of radicals who correctly
beginning in november started oriented towards a straight and i think there's big lessons there because what you see in oklahoma there was also radicals in oklahoma who have organized but they weren't involved in labor and i think this is a crucial lesson for anybody who wants to revive the socialist movement or working class movement is the role of a small group of
dedicated radicals in the labor movement is crucial if you don't have that then you get oklahoma right now in which workers were just as militant the support was just as high but the accumulated organizing experience and lessons that the leadership of radicals in west virginia was able to push forward through the struggle hasn't existed and oklahomans one of the reasons why it's
more disorganized and why the strike appears to be at an impasse yeah you brought up one of my favorite blake buzzwords earlier which is spontaneity people i i think now really love the idea of like elevate is spontaneous protests which is like one not true
like it's these things require like a lot of planning and to i deeply insulting because the amount of coordination and especially experience that goes into this is is just mind blowing and the problem with the union organizing to is that you are actually going to lose more battles than you win
that's especially now
you you loose some things in you make mistakes and you start to build organizational capacity and then you do better next time
do you think that this could be sort of like a long fight kind of kind of situation will clearly the struggle on a national level isn't over and even in oklahoma
there's no way of saying what will happen on monday and and the struggle by no means an imagination is over people are mobilized and there is a dynamic when when you have a mass drag no matter what happens the amount of people who have gotten politicize in the span of two weeks is really remarkable started to put that genie back in the bottle right
people have a sense of power no matter what happens people have a sense of power that's gonna be hard to dissipate so i think both in oklahoma and more generally what we see after west virginia is a real strike way it is a strike wave and the ripple effects of that are continuing very probably just this coming monday there's going to be a walk out of teach
teachers in colorado arizona is still potentially planning a strike north carolina is going to have a walk in may so you see is because these conditions of attacks and public education or said generalized the sense that these aren't inevitable that you can fight back and when that you can strike and when that idea has already caught and i think
we should expect that to continue to rumble across different states the big question is how we get that to the clinic cup blue states where you have entrenched liberals who don't want that to happen and that hasn't happened yet and that's going to require more organization as the as this moves to other states you alluded briefly to what some alternatives to and electoral model or just
members remember in november as being kind of a dead and you alluded to some other alternatives for these other states what were your advice be about what a winning strategy that has a potential to win would look like
right well the diverse and it says people are really like too much advice from new york are saying what i'm going to be a little i'll be a little general on this the conditions on the ground are very particular in every place and one of the things i would say about oklahoma is the danger in assuming that there is a model that you just
one two three facebook group strike bam you in that being said there some general lessons that we can point to one is clearly
strikes work
this is maybe controversial in the labor and what shouldn't be but the idea that the way you're going to win is by withholding under labour has not been an idea to save at least that widely accepted that the norm and that labour movement generally has been lobbying the democrats work within the legal confines that exist and it's been a dead end
the first thing is strikes work even threats of strikes work and that also requires breaking the law
the law right now
his makes it almost impossible to have a successful work stoppage
particularly when it's not just in one job
so i think if you're talking about the necessity for the need to break labor law the need for solidarity one of the big reasons that west virginia succeeded and why oklahoma such widespread what's such widespread support is that the teachers clearly weren't just fighting for themselves they were fighting for staff workers that all of the people on the education system and they were fighting for
more broadly in west virginia healthcare for all right which is obviously an issue for most working class people and they're fighting for students the working class movement historically has been for the class as a whole and not just for the individual workers involved in bringing back that level of melon see that level of solidarity those are generalizing lessons how you do that as as
civic moment in place it's probably best left up to organizers matters here but i think that there's a lot of inspiration at the very least going to disagree with you and say they should definitely listen to people from new york city in brooklyn and particular about everything on this and with this show only this show may or may not be wearing their slippers their grandpa celebrities insider now
i'm inside of slippers or for not everything but definitely labour strategy and salsa
we make the best salsa and fossil and now as a supposed to wear slippers
i remember
i think is no is nevada it emerged under said
and a labour talk said people are really concerned about breaking the law but when you actually like bridge the topic in your lake
you said they're like we can't break the law of cigarettes that guards item break the law like just break the law
she later repercussion who she is that there might be repercussions and you should measure out do a cost benefit analysis but this is fundamentally you know what a moral fight that you're doing and sometimes that involves breaking the law one of the really remarkable things in west virginia was the amount of people had signs
explicitly tying their struggle and breaking the law to the civil rights movement so you have a lot of lily white teachers who many of them probably voted for trump and who you could easily dismissed as backwards racist reactionaries which i don't think is generally the case
holding up signs saying rosa parks was right to break the law we should do the same thing so there's a level of continuity with the civil rights movement that i didn't expect and which again undercuts this idea of deep red state conservatism that people are such and trench racists and dupes of the republicans aren't capable of understanding solidarity with other people or even their own uninsured
just wanted to ask if there was any kind of across state coordination it seems like people are in contact but i can't tell how formal it is obviously a lake
west virginia has been building this kind of for lack of a better word parallel union structure that is more active and militant into the left of the union leadership for a very long time
and oklahoma has not but it does seem like they're sharing notes
would you say you've seen any of that are spoken that anyone who says as much oh definitely well
the first thing that says just because the strike was so recent everyone follow it very closely
the level of knowledge of what happened there
my score activists was relatively widespread and there's been because of facebook to one of the good things about facebook has allowed for people to have these back and forth relatively easily so yeah there has been active discussions west virginian leaders really to their credit see this as a national movement and feel a responsibility to reach out
two strikers elsewhere there's been a real outpouring of solidarity
hundreds maybe thousands this point of solidarity photos including by west virginian teachers you it is really kind of hearing can't where you have teachers taking their time off to say we're with the oklahoma and they really do see that they really feel like they started something and the amount of discussion has grown a lot and
i think also one of the things that we're seeing more now is that with the oklahoma straight potentially having reached an impasse or it's unclear what's happening
there's more interest in learning what actually happened in west virginia it was maybe was more difficult so even just this last weekend is very intense discussion the monks west virginian straight leaders the militants with people in oklahoma on how to organize a wildcat or what they actually do it wasn't just facebook so i think that sometimes maybe it made it look too easy
west virginia just as you said just spontaneous people rose up and then you'll have that idea it's never to every time you straight you when it's clearly is not the case and it's also clear not the case that it's easy to organize it strikes they just systematically made right tactical move after right tackle move in west virginia for months and that type of organizing that type of political strategy is
is hard for others to replicate without learning from them so luckily they are reaching out and i think we should expect more of that well because people are having a you said we learn what it means to even have a labor movement like literally i mean people even the few people left in this country who are members of union
like that basically just means dues and them you sign off on the contract the idea that carries any more of a deep responsibility or you know action that's kind of been so lost that it's like it's play dead nerves being sort of reignited to even try to figure out which means if you say west virginia is going to be very important because
if oklahoma does end up being sort of a disappointment then all these other nascent movements and these other states are gonna have to deal with that and not be discouraged too much and so there has to be learning like you say from the other movements that are room have been more successful races there's different ways you can look
you could look at this and say well was virginia
was on one off right they had labour tradition and they one that's not going to happen anywhere else i think that's not the case and the proof will be in the putting we'll see what happens in arizona
in other states but really the factor that change it was the level of organization and that is hard to build but it's doable and luckily some of these other states are also learning not just from west virginia but also oklahoma now and they haven't by a by everything we've seen they haven't thrown in the towel
in other states yet in fact that continues to spread so the political generalization of all of these experiences is going to be ongoing for months and luckily we can actually have these debates now rate in the past we had to discuss thirties or what happened back then and seemed like the distant past for tens of thousands of men
titans teachers and young people and socialist were able to look at what's actually happening and try to draw the lessons i think that's very exciting
yeah i think it's just it's incredibly exciting to me these i've been waiting for very long time for people to be like oh remember these old tools like the strike in the slow down in santa to hush things like that those worked and those are still the tools at work and we have to do i mean capital is very cagey so we still have to be creative and organizing
and everything but it's still the same tools and
literally only workers can shut it down a lot of unions if i think shifted over the shredded you sort of kind of social movement based staff which has been very kind of mixed at best and you've been generous yeah it's it's been a big fucking failure
and i understand because you want to go where the fire is and you're like well people are marching in the streets with this and that and if we do this and we can associate nino build off their fire that it flake know this kind of like general free floating sentiment is she's never going to give you the
kind of material political power that a militant organized
labour and with them well
that's the big lesson i think is that still our power is primarily at the workplace and our ability to withhold labour now that is a really simple thing we don't need to reinvent the wheel but that as an idea is something that even most socially i would argue in the country haven't yet been fully one too
there's this idea that there's a bunch of different struggles we're going to support a are which is great i think we showed we need a fight against all forms of oppression we need to do all of that at the same time when need be strategic where do we focus our energy where do we focus our work and that hopefully will be a lesson that can be learned from this is that yeah if we're going to fight and win and not just fight
bear moral witness then we need to have a real base in working class communities and workplaces that are strategic and i think that's teaching health care and logistics and either that's not it's not a mystery people have an argument is proven the putting balances question of doing it yeah nurses teachers truckers drive or is things that are not easily replaced we really do have
be strategic about this stuff
thank you so much for joining us talking about the teacher strikes in oklahoma and now awfully much of the rest of the country as well we have to be in touch again because
keep happening producers have passed through the note chopper trap else does not support industrial sabotage
