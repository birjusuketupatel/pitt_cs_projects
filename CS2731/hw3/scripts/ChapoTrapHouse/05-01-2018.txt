felix news yeah i just always have love the jersey because
they like made their branding to do ethic twitter clap barracks like when someone to be like donald trump estate and then we're not affiliated with
so to be like
justin bieber is worse than to say and worship her and they we go big news and it was totally epic and people just thought it was like a goofy twitter thing but now the church and state in israel

well you guys were you in virgil were awake getting getting an award
you guys were in your best behavior as well you know i don't want to go around you know our party high jinks you know upset and the
prestigious stiff upper lip types
university
we were behaving like the marx brothers or for instance you know action cigars into the blouse of a wealthy dowager or anything like that though i did a classic prank
movies i had him was revenge and nerds and i sent a very credible bomb threat to the
yeah they did that in horse feathers
now what are you guys were collecting an award
i guess the thing that happened this week and i don't even know what was happening and so i saw everyone talking about it and you know it's just like oh god
i guess we're going to have to talk about this the white house correspondents' dinner movement weekend
nerd brom gotta love him i was really hoping it would just ask completely on remarked upon but that wasn't the case because you know that comedian they booked rochelle wolf of the daily show
the headlines the last forty eight hours nonstop debate about whether it was whether she was mean sarah how huckabee sanders whether it's ok to be mean to can alchemy sanders what is comedy are comedians heroes and should the whole white house correspondents' dinner be to hit with
you know a living in hell is a lot more boring than i thought it would be yeah
a conversation that is designed to dominate everything on your social media and the news and the news media talking about itself and entertainment and just like our i just i want to turn it all off i don't lick
i don't care about any of it it's just like anyone taking just to her really really hard stance on any of this is just got i just don't know what to make of it while the most and fame thing if if the fan battle star galactica of the path of a whore and all of the full happen again because fame fucking good they happen
people have pointed this out the same thing happened ten years ago with called bear when he the corresponding i believe two thousand and he roasted bush to have faith and everyone was horrified and there was a whole debate about to go too far there is such a thing
of too far where a comedian supposed to go but real have no that actually awful happened when years ago because of in nineteen ninety six don imus was the comic at the white house correspondents' dinner and he did a bunch of jokes about how
bill clinton was a horny freak and that cause the giant wailing and gnashing of teeth revoked
twitter but if there had been everyone wanted a lost their shit
the same fucking argument over and over and nothing ever changes about it if it's enough to make you go and fame because first drunk been elected every bit of real estate in the op ed world have been elite pete media people worrying about the free exchange of ideas oh no
the twitter horde from the campus police they're going to get rid of free speech we're not going to be able to exchange ideas were not going to be a lot a marketplace of free expression anymore
i mean forget the fact that we've got a domestic a stop or running around and i gilded age level inequality or an impending climate catastrophe that could and all fucking life on earth the only thing that mattered these people is whether or not we have enough shape realm work for for
respectful debate because according to these people we can't solve any of these problems unless we have a public debate that can them out our differences and lead us through a harbor mafia and compromise that can be good for the majority of people but this is a perfect example of why that's what complete rod we've had the same
argument for twenty fucking years and it never change it and it can't change it's going to be the same debate in the same side and the same argument over and over and over again because the structure of power in the relationship between the media and the white house with such that these people are always going to feel more social connection with each other then they do with the american people
and or
anybody who makes less than six figures a year for are always going to have this jocular and they're always going to want to be buddies with each other and nothing like the invasion of iraq were a white supremacist president is going to change any of that but that's going to make them uncomfortable crucial they're always going to bring in these comics were try to push the boundaries and then they're going to push too far and the never even a map into a
friend to try to reestablish the boundaries so that we can maintain this convivial relationship but then we have the argument for and nothing can change that because the social and economic structure pc means is that relationship is always going to be there and the debate is just a relief valve could mcauliffe mechanism that will persist as long as the system from does and so there is no
change and has been they're not building that anything the debate isn't creating any movement and indifferent shifting anything it just totally barrel and into them as the marketplace of ideas as much like the free market it's just this illusion of agency disguising it's discouraging a rigid economically determine status quo
that i all your human freedom or even meaningful expression because how his expression meaningful if you can't fucking anything did either as you guys actually watch any whole set
no i saw her abortion joke because concerns
regis and it's like that's a pretty good joke
really not bad but now i'm not watching not going to watch the entire thing that is
everything gives in severe mental illness but i prefer getting mental illness still fight like
i just i can't bring myself to do it but yeah this is the same stimulus and response pattern from the same bottoms eating creatures
it's always seen it's good because it you know
got one hand goes people who work for donald trump
just saying that you cannot be rude your political opponents and just no shame no contradiction nothing and the other
her and like people who think that the height of civil disobedience is late night this yeah oh yeah of expression
yeah i just i mean
we did though we didn't get a good mike huckabee because it was his daughter stake
it was his daughter
you know being rotated on the open fire michelle waltz flaming barbs and he goes
after seeing the young female hired to verbally bullying anyone who works for real donald trump
now understand why he tied pods is so popular
now level vulgarity is best had over with a mouth washed out with so some more tired pods
third pads burgers the tide pods are you shit that is as or happened ever they cannot process and that now without relating it back to tide pirates will they think they think it's like a perfect example of how dumb millennium goals are but i mean like like the all these kids are show
doug their sure condoms sooner those and eating tide pods because the internet told them to and it's like where his back in my day you're just breathing in the exhaust of leaded gasoline and dying and easily preventable car acts like every one of his mother hundred didn't have a fucking pet rock or or a pet dog
from
well i mean i mean that is i mean so most of this controversy or whatever is rotating around sarah huckabee centers right
and did he the show was attack her looks or was it to mean to go after someone who are you know
is that i shall i put this of visually appealing
that's the thing if if they really though conservatives really gave away their own feelings about their offenders because they're really worth of anything in the routine about her being unattractive or her weight or anything they all added that afterwards how much do you want to bet that donald trump has called sarah huckabee centers of pigs
all course
that really made me feel like my brain was melting of yes the same argument we've been having for literally twenty years now but the fact that it still happening when donald fucking trump is president is really what makes me feel like we can't be living in a real universe and the fact to me some sort of dark malaysian i mean literally did the carlos months
the voice and wrist action to someone was terrible for i'm sure the person but the first supposed to think is one of them right now
only care when one of their fellow fucking journalists gifts in any way and convenience and it was one of their precious try who got mark
hey i did he did a mocking our own gesture to a guy with cerebral palsy was a journalist he he wasn't at the fucking thing for a second year in a row he was at the correspondents dinner he was whipping up an arena for swine getting them a flatter who's together about how much the him we're going to come in
destroy their lives because of a conspiracy between democrats and the puck and pratt i mean it's shit again this is so easy to get like i almost hate saying it but it should like you know anyone who works in any presidential administration much less the truth administration did
deserves to be bullied in his or to be insulted so their face and more importantly than that they should be made aware of the fact that they are loads that they are loads some people and that once you pass a certain threshold of both power and evil it really doesn't matter how what
someone insults you or how mean they are two years yeah
he said everyone who's like oh republicans you know oh good but you need a safe space now for almost speech you don't like hearing about it
you when you're really hear what real comedy is about you know why you act afraid of jokes i just got to say actually that's that's very good because there is no such thing as anyone on the last are like liberal side of politics who would ever get angry about jokes or in souls or comedy or anything like that so they're all perfectly on on absolutely
the one hundred percent glacier from ice getting riled up about this or pointing their finger you guys want to hear the mike huckabee parity song i wrote when i woke up today more than entering on the world okay
woke up this morning made yourself opposed to serves arguing over who could kill dog
got the
a million got the shot gunshot more under a blue baby you also need a lotta boot
yeah i woke up this morning tied bug the forty is
died but
you're seventy years old that's the only go you kid
and the tires sopranos it turns him driving through different drive through
oh by the way i need a big boss that people to get to the main through
you need a small meal to get to your bigger
or else you're going to be too hungry to think about what your ordered for your big man never order on an empty stomach
to country secret
now with your order food
you don't want you going to be order the whole menu unless you got a little appetite for on
by the way i what how could michelle wolf leaves on the table the the fact that sarah how could these brothers killed a dog for fun yeah you're not really being gloves off of here not referencing the dog murderers and like you know a key she made fun of her smoky eye shadow and people when
didn't go to the dog mercurial her fucking law or any older brothers kill dogs for fun
it's actually a very sad story about way sarah could be sanders has that eye makeup
mike huckabee was doing one of those photo shoots where you know it's like oh my daughter my daughter's boyfriend is here to ask you to prom
the rules if he points a gun at him but it was the makeup up to the simpsons and is fired
the water
a much larger some material but you leave it for me as a leave those guys are astounding you just put a picture of him up there than you just talk about him for twenty minutes when you're done
just imagine them sitting in a lump his room smashing fluorescent bulbs with a hammer or the like homer him and barney and dressing in one giant pair of overalls and play a huge harmonica
then the op ed that would be like there's nothing funny about the two large simple minded the cruel huckabee sons bathing each other and a cloth with bathtub
absolutely nothing funny about that
but it is not forty how they constantly see to get trapped in barrels of molasses there's nothing funny about the fact they were no pamphlet winnie the pooh
yeah

although had this is devil
delights me for no reason enough to they would cheat codes for feel like here
oh man that really should win an award yeah
right are you wish they knew i agree with box
i don't know i mean i don't even know i don't know what else to say with the white house correspondents' dinner
one thing which is that the only good thing to come out of the smattering of and maybe there will be a change in that they might get rid of it
when she would be awesome
there there was apparently i saw i saw that they were considering a number of options to fix this problem one of which was hiring a singer good that's the case can i put my vote in right now for a con doing the no label song at the next white house correspondents' dinner and number two hiring one liberal and one
conservatives community and it's like of a response you know oh my god the dueling banjo them yeah
awful get that amazing
that would be fantastic
it crowd crowder in there yeah crowder and
who the whole new the loot high myers yeah how the area virus oh that would be amazing
i wow i would actually watching it
feeling he made the jokes it in an alternate universe tom liars did host the correspondence that and but it was
when hillary one and he walks bill after doing is notorious
signing up to be an intern job you know that you to joke about any hillary clinton's personally that's on top of that would be like his triumph that would be the the movie the king of comedy
singer
you could do the weekend
all his songs are about having unsatisfying sex it makes you sad and what is people immediately favorite thing to do i'll put it out alpha right now great white
oh joy
the fact that they're doing this like oh maybe we can do doing it even other things outlived their usefulness and it's totally contrary to the entire idea of an adversarial media and hugging white house press corps that hope the idea of the press quarter isn't stupid and and doesn't make sense like you shouldn't even have repaying let alone have the circle
jerk every year
can't stop doing it they can't from having fun little thing that they do every year and having all of a big important people there to hang out with them even if the president doesn't show up any more trouble i haven't been there he's the like he doesn't show up what's the point of it if the president isn't fair
but they're not going to stop the brim dueling comedians no brain from awful good from the daily show and dan mean and to do doing joke before they get rid of a fucking thing i i love i love that they're looking at it as a problem that needs to be solved because the the first premise the breakable first premises like all we are
obviously need to have this big fancy party about the news we must tell good news could tell you
come on the new companion
he does number i'm so like union broke like ten years ago called bear did that correspondents dinner it's like jeb bush in front of him and i remember when that happened i thought it was amazing i thought it was like oh was over them i thought called bear killed it i loved how offended everyone in the room was i probably get a great job he really did cut pretty deep to be
bush like right in front of them and circa two thousand and six i thought that was like a huge try out for like what comedy stands for and like the ability of you know the clever and witty individual to speak truth to power but it on i still think that speak about that performance holds
but it's just like we've come so far since then i'm just like i don't know how anyone can really get excited about the idea of comedy speaking truth to power any how were you living remember when they roast and the shit out of trump when he was of the correspondents dinner
they just shut him down when people value was being too uppity and he was going to oh you the guy thinks he can run for president on a platform of racism and made him them weren't going to shut him down and obama did all those often and they cut the him looking like a tree stump in the audience
work he was driven from the national stage after that i don't know if you guys have been paying attention to him but he added you hosting a show on q v fi
well this is the this is the argument of course that conservatives make about the white house correspondents' dinner and rochelle walls and in in their packaging all of this and he made the old same wine old bottles of this idea of like you know this is just the elites who have contempt for us and
we just feel so disrespected this is why trump this president and i really feel like the liberal media day fall for this shit every single time when because they now like have some agonize like self reflection over like oh maybe big we did go to for maybe we are just as bad as the like you said matt the people who filled the state
at the exact same time to who and i think about immigrants and anything their he tells them but the thing is isn't there are right they are an elite they are separated from any kind of concept of an american people are or anything like that in that build them of anxiety the problem with because of our idiots fucking
polarized political system all of that all of that resentment just run down the benefit of a bunch of people who are able to queue pretend could be in regular but are in every sense of much in a rapacious the league as all these fucking me at all
this is unrelated but i just found this out guys i thought i'd share it with zero zero zero down or wrote a poem about joy read
what
rosie wrote a poem about julie read called me enjoy read in all i can think about is riding the bus my sister joy read
look here it
it's really long okay
pro or anti what's the what's what's the evidence them it's bro
i don't know it talks about how much she likes her and rachel matter how and
by the end it just says awful ever i will forever wonder what i could have done to hurt her so i am truly sorry
she sort of being like i dunno i like you so much why why do you hate me
alright because one of the thing from people are funny and joy read all blog with her just being really mean to have your novel and whole or are
what back when that was the big thing of trump
public viewed with rodeo donald he was like a hog shut up already
trump is winning here
hilarious
from pay for paper baffling of yeah
so
i think that is you know we haven't talked about it since the last show the joy read thing is also funny because it's like her defense that are bog was hacked is completely falling apart and all it took was going on her show on sunday apologizing but essentially saying i don't remember writing these posts i don't think they're me but i and
if you think that they are and that's ok
and then people were just like okay cool
it's currently stupid that good who gives a shit it's more leg i mean i think the jury read news cycle was a case of everyone on every side of it
feeling as though they accomplish something because they expanded a lot of energy on this her
the people who were like really pro joy i asked her return to t the after she crossed back into the rubicon it took room
it was just like man we've all been through a lot together it's like
yeah i haven't ever it was just on the computer they hate the they did before and they before that the judge is just a stupid exercise that we going to for by fucking thursday
there was no meditation you're still get like to pull pull this shit on people you don't like people who like who they like are still get to go yeah it gives a shit about stuff they poured people that are like it's stupid it's stupid
it's completely pointless but because you were just sitting in your car in neutral and slamming the accelerator you feel like you went somewhere excuse me you say that he say
all the people getting exercise on lie about politics
patiently like being on a stationary bike and you think that you're right now probably the company and wait on a stationary bike
but but like you're on a stationary bike but you think that you're getting somewhere you're actually traveling different excuse me but you can keep that shit i'm fighting for the future of the republic by trying to in the county where deal with fleck pack
from the communist manifesto that the future politics my friend yeah i guess that's the other the other major news or the weekend or entire week now this is designed to basically liquefied what's left in my brain it's just like i can't engage with any of this i mean okay
i'm glad if there's anything productive come i guess i'm glad maybe we can now just feel like you don't have to you can still enjoy the art of someone whose politics don't align with your is a thousand percent perfectly birth been having this conversation about gallagher
but that's not bad
what's going to come out of
i mean i i actually didn't even know the somebody pointed point of alchemy when this started happening when when when can he started talking about how hurricane every they were hanging out somebody found in my old tweak it from two thousand and fourteen when i said if i had one wish it would be for continuity to become a neon reactionary and you can feel old
well i was using the crate neil reactionaries has right all right we'll even a thing of the term relief i felt that i mean i didn't remember arriving in put thinking back what i meant was how hollywood be the theme people who have pin their identity on the notion that their consumption choices are politically meaningful will square with one of their idols becoming
reactionary about would be funny to watch and it was funny for a while but what's been really stunning and heartening is been watching people confronted with miss new political car was literally now hanging out with charles fucking kirk
and treating abraham lincoln was a republican instead of having that reasonable step back from investing in consumption with political meaning have decided that the future of the republic is at stake
with who gets to who gets to influence county so it's not it doesn't matter what county fairs are still enjoy the music or whatever it oh shit we've got to save county the that's the only way we're going to get any political change like this is this is perfect this is perfect for the hasn't phillips thesis on how are culture because
futile geometrically every few years because his when he wrote that an american theocracy was that we talk about celebrities and futile terms and we see them and fuel terms that are exemplars and everything we believe in these unelected
designed monarchs who has been selected by guide and are preordained
and all of that but now worth the best part is monarchy which is when you get a mentally ill for more child ruler and it's a race
who would the court
it may be a curse
yeah
friends with segments of the court dangling big turkey legs in front of his face i mean the text message exchanges that he's been focusing are hysterical because like i love it i mean it is so perfect that he'd be a right wing now because they are the group in our society
really really love is the idea of being a free thinker if by being a free thinker means you're unaware of basic american history as an adult i'm a free thinker and by that i mean i'm terrified of everything
or i don't have a i don't know what anything mean i i don't believe that structure of
yeah i don't believe the economy as a real thing
i think that we are just a collection of people with varying degrees of whole and creativity and that determines the social order by being a free thinker and of course a guy like that is totally disconnected and and family rich with would be a track that point of view but i think i mean some people arguing about how from here all the fifth and i have no idea
i think at least part of it is driven by his awareness that politics in terms of entertainment right now politics was the only game in town
everything is filtered through politics if you wanna move the needle in terms of getting a conversation about your piece of art it half the half a political violence or no one's going to care about is all anyone fucking talks about now
a new album's coming out and i think that there's like i think i think he's doing like an andy kaufman say i mean like actually just like getting your photo taken with charlie kirk
being like this is interesting is what are the most outrageous stones you can do i mean like pretending to be friends with
pretended to like him and like target do this does seem like a man on the moon type of shit like i think maybe it started sincerely candice oh sweet and then he saw how insane we that took off when i think he's leaning into it and i think he's going to be like do this sort of a right wing thing for a while is kind of spectacle and performance or see where it goes
odd me in me introduce the crusade talked about this and it will be a tuesday
the it's called an intro pod yeah we talked about this and we we talked about its conspicuous the county has extended anything that he likes about lucky
he has said like the muslim man or like the tax but it just like ideas energy power
i don't want to preempt too many too much existing program me but there is an those in in to us as you follow him that he could mean something happening similar to what people think they could do where they post frogs in a rapidly changing country
and eventually something happens and they go the frogs did it but you can actually shift culture
incredibly dominant cultural force and i think maybe for a guy like that it's very appealing
to think what it is i'm the guy who breaks liberal cultural hegemony
yeah you can always thinking about it in those terms though
easy i mean you don't you think he doesn't notice culture doesn't notice that like entertainment is very good
very similar liberal democratic line throughout his leg
such insists yeah i know i could see you and go down in history you'd be him well that is what all those like the culture warriors and like people like ben shapiro are so invested in now like all the manga people they have signs that trunk now he's to be like con yeah i love you or whatever because they're very invested in the idea that someone
oh calm pop culture cache which probably couldn't be any higher has now decided to say a it's cool to be any are right way it's cool to listen to charlie kirk and ben shapiro or whatever or that i will calm he hasn't said that but they are interpreting it is such a there
they've invested a lot and this and i think it shows how
kind of their their disdain and hatred for pop culture but trace their own minas and like the fact that they really are desperate for any kind of mainstream validation
they conservative have all the political power of a want a cultural power and liberal have all the cultural power but they want the comfort the political power
so this weird thing or not so sure about that second point why don't i don't think they would like it in the abstract on their own tom yeah but i do think that which one is driven more crazy by what they don't have definitely the conservative not having the cultural power to know he talked about like that before
are they really are infuriating by the fact that trumps victory has not down to them getting more personal respect on their own lives and they're still getting shit on by tv and movies an artist
i mean you're going to on even harder than before because like now
liberal artists and musicians or wherever many and then think it's their duty and responsibility or just they're feeling to speak about what they hate about you know our government and our country right now which is largely ban nice people like trumped and voted for him and they think they get scolded
well fed us about the fucking correspond with thing they say your efforts to try to use your position in a cultural authority to change to shame conservatives or whatever will that's why trump one in your driving people into the arms of reaction and it's not true but it is useless it is
sad and fruitless it is it is watching people who you know they talk about the people who only i'm a hammer you have a hammer everything looks like a nail that's that's liberals right now they have culture and so everything we only solution they have is by just so i am in that buck and a hammer and everyone faith and it doesn't change anything because the
people who are resent that they're not
nobody who was offended by something michelle wolf said about fucking sanders persuadable voter but it also doesn't get anything on your side it doesn't change the dynamic in anyway so it's just sad display of of liberalism just basically wanting the one thing that have the folks who left any more
i guess just from a pure shot and for perspective it's sort of amusing watching conservatives national keith over their lack of flat and that's what makes the that's that's why the liberal panic about communism is because now they're taking the damn of actually might break and oh my god what if this does change i think felix's right if if that did happen wouldn't
con and love to go down in history of like the rosa parks of conservative cultural narrative
the guy who would not be in the back of the liberal any more possibly i mean like that when you're talking about this sort of school being about you know this is why we got trump or like this idea that
is the demonic the liberal cultures responsibility to speak to or give a pat on the head or recognize or seen whatever terms you want to give the people that they hate so much and will eight each other so much like i either voter this reminds me of an iq stage i had this
weekend with it laid sick magazines resident practitioner of this very style oh my connor
the door
walk in or and this was over and the john and make not and paintings john make gotten of course is like the official or a painter of mega america and he came out with another idiotic hating this week his last one was the one of my personal favorite is would have trouble
with its here like get like
cleaning off or ragged american flag that he picked off the football field
this new one is on a park dead what looks like a cruising see teaching young college guy a very handsome young college man about how to fish or some shit like that and people were making fun of it and connors point was like i don't know with like you know i think liberals need to ask themselves a question of whether you know renounced and their benefit
i'd like to be like this in group mocking of like you know the art of the other side or whatever and responded to him
you hate this kid she bullshit to shut the fuck up
because there's no way he actually likes john wick mountains art or other people who fucking cool over it
but it's a virtually signaling from so weird right wing central point of view and i think my only response to that is it is not politically productive to kiss the asses of the dullness worse people this country's capable of producing and like i think
just stop fooling themselves about that whether it's the correspondents dinner or culture or whatever is guess what
these people even other not necessarily in terms of culture
are united in their spite and in group loathing of liberals and you know what
it works pretty well for them getting getting what they want done so i think we should stop pretending to honor know like follow these little bread crumbs all the time or pretend that there's always some honorable interesting respectable point to be made the entire conservative movement is donald trump it's always been like this it always will
oh it's morally hideous and corrupt and these people deserve nothing what slate and you really cannot be mean enough to them the public or private be kind of them
okay me to defeat them politically and make it so that they cannot enact their will it even a local or like dog catcher got to be the goal of everyone that's the problem we're all facing now
else is window dressing you will get know you'll get no credit for humor in there surely arc or like many haberman did a whole thing making making me a call and reading about how mean everyone loved the thoroughfare do you think that's going to stop drop and value wants to call me a i'm in a dumb whore which she's done like
the fucking time since becoming president now i can honestly two days until he does it again nothing you can the fate of them will change because they're driven by bottom with bynum these people for the most part what do they hate in the world they hate liberals they've never met they hate mexicans or healing job they would never
do they don't have any that were black people who live in neighborhoods with their family have lived in several generations the current bid all a constructive resentment
bank be in their head nothing you can do is going to interfere with that nothing is going to make them rethink what if the primal driving force of their entire politics
and it just like it's so weird to read shit from
journalist or whatever who were like you know what
see what you will but comedy but like you know bullying is not ok
see you about trump billy bullying is not okay and i just like i really have to question the mentality is someone who really thinks that they can or should be objective it read any of this shit like you you mustn't know what the trump administration is doing and what they stand for and you can bully her yeah do you in bali
white house press secretary the front of them four days a week and he knew eat them an insult the intelligence
but bali someone in that position that he does the don't drop is always wearing long sleeves because he's cutting
show me before i came here handle women
an estimated dead
robert smith he's got a lot of i think you should look for one
and world if the vampire books well i do like that the entire week
i think the the dominated was the daily show woman to me or was that the resistance
the parties where the back backpack
you know can we hope con a leg
can we make this man has been having a mental breakdown for years three have irrational political thought we need to make it happen
you know that yahoo just went up
game presentation
and ran liar
yeah like eyes
about the iran nuclear deal
urging sort of a repeat of his presentation last maria i'm sorry to bother guy
round bomb with the camera that
yeah
this is all dog and pony bullshit that goes on
and there is a real horrifying thing in the background but what i think is interesting about that is that's his monkey with a broadway show
i don't actually think that israel really wants to go to war with iran
really trying to getting our concept of war now it's a trade show right our concept of is a trade show where every country gets the show off the military hardware they specialize it
you know every time that israel hits syria like they did this past week the russians get to go oh
sounds like we can finally a three hundred and four hundred aircraft batteries with sold the then everyone who fucking hate each other we've filled with armenia and azerbaijan at the same time with the saudi arabia were trying to sell them to get our
i don't think that yeah who legitimately wants to have a ground war with iran because it would be fucking disastrous
what he wants more he wants more terrorists that's very want more money for whatever proxy conflict like they've done in syria and we all now played the same game the same trade yeah that's what our culture our culture wars is they thing no one actually wants to win the culture war than is fucking
people do they want to climb this ladder of escalation that we do in ukraine and syria to sell higher tiers of weapons
the greater stakes you see the culture wars the closer you are to cultural world war three
you get to sell your as three hundred or as for hundreds or your version of american t o w is or
anti air missiles are fucking whatever which is more cable bill appearances or more more book deals or whatever
the same same thing we're we're on the verge we want to go to the exact verge of a catastrophic for conflict
but just before that just so we could sell the right are moments for through each other why everything is exactly the same fucking way
never going to get better but we're going to have a twitch channel
i think i don't i don't i think i don't think that i don't think many ah don't want to hang with i don't think he would mind if we did i think they'll be fine with him if we spent shallow of metals
i was gone and i don't think he i don't think it necessarily want to have a ground war with iraq i mean necessarily fairly but i think the damning some fucking and their shit up some degrading capacity with i i think you'd like to do that but i think you're right that always conflict and this goes back to the thing about how all of this marketplace of ideas it's just a sterile cycle that know
our bills to resolution the way that dialogue is supposed to is because all of these conflicts about culture and and politics and foreign affairs balance of power
they can never be resolved because to resolve them would be to break out of the fan of school the benefits the people who were perpetrating them and that to terrifying to contemplate because they don't know they'd end up on top of that any and then
any is that are one war is rolling the dice is bismarck said anybody anybody you want to really challenge any of these prevailing enemies
is gonna have to deal with the fact that you can't deal with these issues
the terms that have been laid out because they are not designed to resolve the problem they're not enough to fix anything they're they're designed continual status quo to drag the corpse of of the guy from weekend at bernie's across the fuckin beach and killing dissolves and until there's been enough of them
hyper extraction of resources of the people at the top of that can survive coming collapse
in their fucking bunkers and see stands and and you have to point path
that grow and path just dead sterile fucking debate on all these issues and say
fuck i don't even know because
even imagine it is to move beyond everything that we have generally understood to be with politics means right and the culture war works around those same points
what does work like be this i can't conceive i know that we're all fucking sick
and it feels like it's tearing at the seams because it is dumber than it is ever been i feel like in my lights navy oh yeah
but what comes after what comes after i don't know what comes after the proxy war as weapons sales trade shows that is the met a game
international politics i don't know what comes after any of these because
as i said the matter for all these games is to go right to the verge of for conflict never get there because you only selling the escalation and hinges hinges gene that you won't get total disaster hedging it on these apparatuses of millions of people making no human error
well fuck again twitch stream
entertainment is still available people and none of those jokes sure gotta i mean i guess the the only difference is that people would like to win the empire wars but again i don't think anyone wants to win the culture war yeah
yeah
a different culture war that is an alley terms isn't one that that generated by capitalism the way that exists now i mean just i was just thinking about how the other stupid argument i thought being recapitulate it on the internet the this weekend was because of the new yorker road
review of the new adventure movie and of course it was very dismissive of the film and said that it was kinda bullshit that was stupid and incoherent and led to a million nerd shitting themselves and how a lead if they are but
book and you will why the hell with the new yorker writer of you fucking kidding movie
it's a huge cultural moment and all culture now the big ones i mean everything from filed off in the nation's the big ones left are the things that are at the lowest common denominator and can guarantee the biggest return because of how much money is put into them
and new yorker knows when they write a review especially if dismissal it's going to get linked to a million times by outrage nerds
and that just means that this
as long of capital is dictating what our cultural expectations are and you know entertainment is like any other industry is a big investment required a big return so not only the movies that are costco i'd have to have a preexisting intellectual property that people know about so you can ensure a base
level of interest but marvel have taken the next step and with the expanded universe created movies that only reference themselves and sell each other and that number and no movie can and has to sell the next one because the next one's going to cost even more than one did and have to their whore guarantee and even higher return and show
oh but because this is built on the framework of nice interest things that used to be for nerds like comic book people have this personal commitment to it because they think geek culture still exists
when the finger are making two hundred and fifty billion dollars a day and so every fucking time the springs been going on for at least ten years so the dog so basically the person
comment but when we came out the nerve and the snout fight about how you're being elitist and they for how can i be elitist when this movie is the most of the you know this is the sum total of culture and they can't resolve but because
look how kind of dictated by the nature of the economics of entertainment so they just are you for awhile and boil goes the way and then another piece of shit slides down the fucking pipe and they have another argument and it could never resolved and they're all like that because of the underlying premise of
the market dictating the dynamics and so we can only eternally record basically until the resources that fuel run out and then nobody will be arguing about anything anymore except that the last can of beans and the gut and kroger extra for the fucking washington dc media will be in the borough
and out shell of the museum factor in virgins to the god of decorum
the museum
i mean to close out the shell because you know
let's see the accused of being too pessimistic
felix alluded to it i'd like to maybe chart a new course for like a different better culture
a way out
the track that we're all viciously ensnared and of course our twitch stream this is sort of brainchild of felix in virgil of course year
the yellow approved game masters
you know i'm into it what are some of the things that people can expect for the chop chopper twitch projects as yet to be named tentatively tentatively my basic ideas are basic ideas i am going to have a series where i play through a single player games obviously we're going to start with the metal gear series but i'm also going to play through
my theory single player games of the
early to mid two thousand like max payne one and two etc
talk about their significance culturally but also for the people who like what is now the biggest genre which i am to beat the james cameron of this jon era where my art transcends the tawdry medium my for tonight show with my fortnight friends we
we'll be doing it
i hope to out to be playing fortnight for the first time ever on on your guys stream
you you will be a guest player and fuck you mean
also virgil had a terrific idea of him playing crusader kings with matt and i had an idea having map play assassin's creed to get mad at both the abominable game play and history
that does would like a terrible game be interesting
i do i do want to play one of those super complicated strategy games with version because they can't have been kind of interesting but then i just look at the screen and there's so much stuff on it that i get a headache and i could never do that allowing him to do all of the actual button pushing while i guess kind of watch would be kind of fun i was also the
interested in putting my little spin on the twitch medium and doing a finally giving a cooking show for you guys are know if he was a listener aware but something of an amateur chef myself i'd been known to cook a few things and have been thinking of doing he sure of combination
instructional curfew show at a dinner party lives with stream so you can operate me for cooking and then berate me as as i'm eating food will really fail item that megan mcardle have ever advertised from the from that can i do not have even close to one
thousands of the things that meghan but now you're you're just impressed that i have like a whisk or an immersion i haven't of those are okay all right i don't have anything to fancy i just you know i have a rice cooker
you want for me that's not like
ludicrously extravagant kitchen item i'm mostly fascinated by the fact that you have a literal meat cleaver that is sure i do have a cleaver but you know that's good for a cut chickens have you ever use that you have course
it seems cool i want one
it's low tech now
