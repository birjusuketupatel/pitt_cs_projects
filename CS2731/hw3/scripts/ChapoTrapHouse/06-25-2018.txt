over the course of
what she's just a lot of issues
show i think we're already touch on the most important all
respect is going to be show bow respects
about us giving you the listener respect and you giving it to us and returned giving respects getting respect and family easily things that make life important
talk about film shows just how you can become a matter of respect a man of honor to run your own family
cas or the gambino crime family will get control over this park his family you need all five girls that listen to the show
if we are talking about our facility
i think i over the road like the movies we talked about ownership i think maybe the most extraordinary movie now that we've done now
incomparable this isn't this is a movie that like were like his insurance a budget and like casting is like like more professionally done then the room but at the end of the day every bit as baffling and perplexing is that movie despite its extensively professional cass
people production habit is to do that stuff but astounding we are talking about the film gotti the bars
starring john travolta as john guard the capo di tutti copy the boss of all bosses before we do that
some help friends of ours
some friends of ours you know a some friends of ours to talk about this thing called respects
it's micro saying thank you and adam friedland
our time out and showed an arrow now is not response
adam i was showing respect for i know how to cast this is how you treat her out
and take off his hat when he can add and slower
during his pocket had
iris back guys get showers and respect all
favre have a way that movie was the biggest piece
you say that we all saw it on friday and honestly i have more fun in the are watching this movie that almost anything i've seen no one reason or were about it out it was a blast deftly ruin that old man's
they're not we enjoy it there's an old man wearing feelers and black dress socks and shorts and attacked and he got mad at us for laughing to work
we were now
i thought in keeps bay which is like a weird enclave for people from queen's speech held in and out of manhattan
and you know how they say like this was the most dollars per movie theater for award
avatar one hurricanes
i don't know gaddy accomplish that i don't think they got that much money per individual theater
per room per screen
but it's probably the most op ed ever written per theater
because everyone in my theater look like the right hand
letters to the editor yeah everyday to the new york daily news about overhearing rap music in astoria although i haven't got our budget trolls behind a keyboard
who are you going to trust people that saw the movie
that is ultimately weren't convinced me i really think we're going to do an episode on this i just wanted to see a movie on friday and this is what convinced me that this movie will be worth seeing was a publicity campaign
leaned into the universally awful review zero percent on rotten tomatoes the fact that this was uniformly panned general i think you know you like the best serve well he's sort of the hero of the movie in a way it's like they should call the got a gene
as my take
with the publicity campaign for that movie taking aim at the the reviewers of the movie and he's raising is a group who's the best and striking a populace town that's very of the time show her say to attack the fake eggheads and the fake news there are telling you not to see this movie
telling you the public that people with respect that you've got to see the movie in order to get respect i will say i think it worked in the sense that i think everyone who voted for donald trump in new york metropolitan area
probably also pro john gotti yes and so you can get all of them to see this movie
you're in
it's going to be going to love it for years to come i honestly think that this is going to be the rocky horror picture show for guys who are medically prohibited from more home
this was an interesting side note about this movie was directed by kevin connelly of entourage from entourage what you eat from ontario is potentially on ecstasy the entire time he was making the movie
like he was something like this is a movie in which is so single or we incompetent in every aspect of its execute said it becomes art area becomes a kind of genius because it's like
i was worried going to this movie that it would just suck and be boring it would just be bad but no this movie was bad in such a shining shimmering way it it was just specific it's like you watch this movie and it's bad in a way we're all the bad things come together to form this mosaic of an end
tire mindset and culture it's just it's perfectly it's literally an educational experience
you know so brilliant about it is that
it perfectly mimics the way that stupid guy who lies all the time tells you a story
yeah like it's pointed characters are introduced but then we don't know anything about them and they don't do anything and then we reference something that they've done so like every time a character comes up john gotti will go oh who's therefore can jerk off and stacy keach we go
that's joey maples and enjoying people's or flash and texts across the screen and then the guy in naples is targeted is going join me balls my every member of the mafia
he won't see him for twenty minutes and it will show up it will remember that thing he did you know it's like a guide is lying to you but he doesn't even remember what he did or didn't lie to you about
i think interesting that is directed by he from entourage because this movie literally is if any of those shitty movies that a pace escobar many chase to do and entourage and it was actually became a movie new would be this or even more on point if you remember from the first season of the sopranos when the first screen
her son restaurant to get on and it shows a screenshot of the laptop there's just this line of dialogue i must be loyal to my cap oh if that screenplay god made it would be this movie exactly and the also if the real christian remote the on a directed and produced her like this is exactly like the world view of the movie
dialogue of it and the execution is exactly what christopher like if christopher a lotta salty were real person they wanted to make his vision of his own life
what it would be i view this
trash this movie i'm gonna of over trump again
yeah my whole family
oh look let's dive it was surfing the beginning of this film
so we get in there we sit down and i swear to god from the very first scene in this movie i news going to be special imagine if you will lights go down
screen comes up what do you see the beautiful night manhattan skyline new york city at night
cut to the east river it's an elderly gentleman wearing a sort of luxurious winter coat
is leaning over the railing looking out a queens and the night sky
he turns around and is john travolta wearing a ridiculous wig and fake eyebrows who breaks the fourth wall turns to the camera in the audience and says new york to greatest city in the night at that point
adam
now we all stood up and class
i salute point they will like
i mistreating i kneel
you nailed as well
as far flung instantly shot fifty seven
seventy five year old moviegoers ozone park
thirty eight there doesn't matter
black dress socks
they should have played the national anthem
however i complained that they didn't
instead of a national
they're amazing opening and then it just jump straight into the opening credits which is a montage of real news footage of the real john gotti it all these various trials lot of archival fun
it's a man's eyes like are upbeat news reel montage of the real john gotti set to music by the rapper pit bull
like probably the corneas most bullshit always neurology oh sod it was the original song for the film any serious with a leona lewis
i've also from avatar
not only did one of the songs behind
maybe i'm wrong
have to play a snippet of the song
cinnamon toast
yes minister
second fastest man
if not the only all song in the movie know well i swear to god with i like the if he had a bull song in the closing credits to that i must have been if it was a result for the movie and that is even more genius because it's one of the classic movie closing song credit sequence with the song tells you what the movies about so pimples wrapping and he's like losing your it's the
bob there's a code got to live by the cold or will kill you
i think my son around
i fear is excellent
more incredible is there is a non dietetic pit bull saw in the eighties while loyal he's just saying that like they play it over all right oh yeah
like know they're listening to it in the eighties
oh yeah we got some people songs twenty years early
fell off the camera
so we get
that credit sequence and again i think the real john gotti would probably be very insulted have any kind of pit bull music associated with sinatra wise to use hip hop because as we all know the blacks are jealous of us they want
copy our culture
so good to be like a cultural appropriation guy will retaliate
i know those are my favorite games on facebook are the ones where it's like students images like any black person and all who's like not in a gang and and it's like gangsters real gentleman who wore like
el al capone murdered like seventy eight hundred people had syphilis
fish swimming clean
that's a man
the school had sex
the rapper type seven
congrats on
so the movie begins and it's of course the narration stays with it because i hated that you know if there was no narration this movie would literally be just a disjointed collection of things happening there would be even more incomprehensible a goes you either end up dead or in jail me i got both
my father
i love that my that was right after he said new york is the greatest city the road i love about that is like i did both
he's funny and cool and say hey hi died in jail
i'm like al capone is still alive
hello hello
gambino dies of old age peacefully because he wasn't a fucking idiot with god it was like yeah but the life came for him finally age nine
find out who did this
it is cancer prick
that self taught cancer sure
alright i'm sorry as a little just started a new thing of ours is called the chai
i'm a big guy by wearing a shirt for cancer charity five k to buy more shirts and say fuck cancer
so a guy he begins begins when the story of of his rise to power our our john gotti became the bar suppose the boss and this story begins when he was a gambino family associate who was tasked by his superior played by stacy keach everyone is
movies like ninety years
yeah a single like young actor
over the guy by john got a huge probably secretly fifty so is is sort of boss figure played by stacy keach tells him
there there's some crime where someone's kid was kidnapped they paid the ransom they still murdered the kid and you know the mafia is like kidnappings one thing but if you pay and they still kill the kid we're not going to abide by that so be saying i want you to have given this you personally this is a personal matter for the gambino family get me the guy who's always going to prison
so he makes his bones and does it will be my honor
laugh
so he makes his bones
killing someone
either way a botched killing they were trying to grab the guy out of a bar and take them off and kill him some more nice and quiet but instead he fought them and he just panic and pulled a gun and shot him in the bar in front of people in the bar who later identify on yeah so like the big crime that's like is coming out to show to fucking awesome criminally was when the he was he
fucked up and immediately was caught for a while when it's three on one with the squad and you knock somebody you kept the third them because one of your squad seals
what of god he's guys were trapped in the storm before they got a bar
john gotti home
i'm moving on
so yeah that of course he goes to jail for that crime again
and then in one sequence he explains that through bribery he was able to get furloughs for dental work yeah that was any leaves the prison
ghosts the dentist's office changes in the dentist's office because without it
into a cool suit and then he's like i had there's a few loose sense from that that hit idea i needed to clean up and we were all like what what i only forty eight
and then it shows him just walking into a motel room with a woman inside it going to the shower and shooting the guy in the shower six times and then leaving not killing the woman again movie does not even to my single it implies that has really helped
yeah she's good work but maybe i actually think of a fan theory about this that have been arguing with on the gotta a wikipedia
that perhaps he didn't hire her and gotta just heard her having sex and was like oh good what you did good and having sex
congrats on this year
then again i just need to underscore like the overall staggering incompetence of every aspect of the like just pacing rain knows that it relates to the following see it it is a collection of sketchy many times have one line or even half of a sentence and then it immediately
cuts to a completely different thought he had an idea is if it wasn't telling the life of one person it would be so baffling and confusing
it's like you just take any ten minutes to the movie the thing you'll see is like john gotti talking to one of these kids and be like if you want to be a man the first the go to learn is how to be strong and the first are your learn about being strong respect but the first thing you gotta learn about respect is being strong
and then cut to like a bunch of fat old guys in a garage and then they have a tense conversation and shoot like a third fat old guy and the head
cut you some fucking social function to john gotti house where was like whoa whoa now they've got these things push pops decide how much ice cream you want
yeah i miss my grandpa
will cut an entire edited video local news report from the nine hundred and eighty i get really
this report
to explain one of them are one of the awesome crimes he does instead of privatizing a way they just show an entire remote report for a local news station
it's called out forever forever and the guys talking like local witness frank polanski says that he saw as i know information that has any me where meaningful to anyone else delivered by an old guy in the eighty i mean i don't know man
course you get that i mean it is so hard to get a license for a local news report from nineteen eighty five on long island you just gotta use it if you got rolling stone songs
i want to get to that crime
there is again completely obscured by an archival news footage but before we get there i want to go to where one of my favorite scenes early in the movie that where it begins to try to sort of sketched out in case you weren't familiar with the mafia john gotti like exactly who he is in what they do because another staggering thing about this movie is the absolute lack of actual
crimes being committed other than bird brain murders which the perpetrators are immediately sent to jail for like a million life sentence that they only kill bad guys right yeah
so it's like a complete fluff piece on john gotti his life he only kill back eyes he never did crimes he talked about running books in ozone
it was early and the shot of the final arc
you are john gotti was john gotti was italian sons of anarchy that's literally every crime he does immediately and dates thirty five people i can only name like two or three profitable operations they had put the community loves him because once a year he throws a party where
well you want to get some hotdogs mariner on it
some disgusting were chicken when mine by friend in the mafia who looks like james call me for some
but they don't in this when they don't show them doing any profitable crime
if you didn't know the mafia was and you watch this movie you'd think the club for all guys to like yell at each other and sometimes get killed
it's like you would have to think that john gotti made money in the way where it's like you kill somebody respect and
everyone he shoots turns to gold
because they don't show them doing anything to and hijackings did they say explicitly we don't do drugs because that this was the greatest martha their propaganda absolute bullshit
but they don't show if they don't the only they talk about gambling but only this guy saying stop telling people to use my about for use start the guy from using my name when he does gambling so that means we know that guy is if it they don't do grinning crimes argument that scene like this is your first impression of what the mafia that about it shows travolta and
or like some will be ludicrous looking people like doing italian face walk out of one of their social olive oil face that's cool yeah i walk out of out of their one of their social clubs in queens
howard be at one hundred fish club and howard dean jfk hogs like you know points in with his pinky out and it's matt was saying he's like this guy i don't like him he's making book he's using my name on the fucking cut it out and like that's basically the only instance you can have like any crime that's not just associated with directly murdering people who they've felt
disrespect
but this was like a murderous cut want to score but right after right after he mentions the guy making book and another little bit of local flavor there's an old one and pushing a grocery modern home and travolta stops his goons and just goes oh oh hope this lady out and it's like well she's pushing a cart doesn't need help carrying it
that they're helping this old lady and they love the community have you learned the guys but his big meaty hands just on her back and just sort of guy so he doesn't actually perfect
but then in the box that yeah that the box with like severe he walks up to this guy looks in no way athletic
he looks like he wakes up and goes to a dunkin donuts reality in our yeah a guy that like literally just sits there
steals napkins
racket
yeah but kid that guy's a good earner
because
bag of port
dogs though that it
they don't make you pay
yeah anyway so this guy comes up to him and he's like he was a matter of finding a mortuary school and like
had to close the gym
i like the equivalent of like had to close the teen rec center
don't worry i'll work it out your door and no no no mention of boxing gym
always good insight into the people who are pro got slash pro trump because it's like anything bad they do is contained in their own world but also you never followed the question of why they have so much money so it's just like in the badger brains of the people who are like pro guardian sledge pro trump in new york their life
oh yes so this guy he just sat down all day and you to have some fucking spaghetti argument with small piece of shit and kill him and it would
sprout a million dollars or him that a million dollars for non specific community acted like john gotti is what every conservative things about obama he's like a fake he is like a community or
oh yeah i'll up the rec center again
shit we spent our entire community budget this year on a barbecue with one grill
the cool thing about this movie
i've been out of were distracting from the planet let's one and john travolta is one of my favorite actors especially john travolta at this stage because he's so desperate to convince the public that he does not spent his entire life trying to jerk off me
that's he is
oh and you like you will deny it he's like in the church of scientology is kid died under mysterious to assets is but he you know enemy and all character have you seen as a paris with what is it called to paris with love or so i saw it with john travolta away it's one of the only movies where he goes full bald he's been
boxes like know any any one he's a rug yeah
he's a rug
that movies and say to but he he is desperate to give the public that he is not just trying to jack off every single guy that
in in his like in his with her via radio the same rank terra nova told me that travolta is not gay and the thing with a gay rumors that you can't deny it
it's know you have to embrace it yeah i guess it also his realize wife is in the movie to kelly plays a victoria does play his wife is also doing olive oil face and maybe one of one of the like you could do a fucking raz is just of the performances in this movie and they'd all be nominated and then you'd have to pick one and my advice or the
funniest thing to happen in like in the last ten years was when he was at the oscars and he was like on clay loser i don't know what it is and introducing the singer a dinner man now and he said everyone knows i love music
everyone please welcome city and let it go from frozen
he take the name edina menzel and he turned into a doubt
he's like full year later it he's trying to jack off everyone around here
allegedly he's like a member of an alien cold and he just wants the ball with he is danny's coast
we have a real met a thing in like fifty years from now when the guy from the entourage
entourage reboot makes the travolta movie and it's not going to show him doing acting and all he's just famous for no reason and it's like look he stayed in his own community of scientology he got money by jacking off it is just a cool guy
we're talking about what's so funny
to contrast sure this performance as god he with his performance as robert shapiro and american crime story was it oh i thought it was brilliant
oh my god yeah oh funny and on point but what he was so funny as they look identical they're wearing the same don't wake up big bushy eyebrows and italian suits but it is so funny the difference between him playing a character like the with the writers are in on the job shapiro
oh is a laughable figure i and the ones and gotti with a writers obviously are not all know
tell your so called realize that he and bringing in trying to describe the plot this movie is probably falls across because it's impossible there really is no plot things just happen at this weird clip nothing is no one scene is related to a scene that comes prior to it and things happen with with no regard or no effect on the plot later the
only or actual plot elements are exposition scenes were stacy keach just lists fifteen italian guys in a row that you don't know and have no grounds that course i will to do this she going to need tony we are no stevie vesuvius
sancho panza sacco wednesday that's just that is how the plot is a step in it really was no distinction between the periphery characters like it or well there was probably other didn't interval to as god himself there will be two or three other character is that like you could identify as a viewer like as a distant character
one and the stacy keach character everyone other than that just exists in this like weird vague like they all think there's no distinguishing any of them
it's just a bunch of potato keep track so there's that i want to say though
we'll get into each of our favorite scenes in moments in dialogue in the movie but like what early other movie tries to establish is that like you know if when you're in the life and the life really matters in these guys the life is about the code
it's about it's about the code and these like these life and death rules that they follow and that's it makes a man of honor and respect and what keeps their criminal fraternity together
the writers of the movie and filmmakers who we take this shit seriously as the actual movie itself and god is true to life story would be proof positive that no one actually cares about these rules and they break them at will all the time and that was the great thing about sopranos to it's like you see these guys who believe in this stuff their whole life and and they realized
it's like wrong
are aliens basically like they're they're dinosaurs living in the modern world as widespread as was so sopranos
like they did all these little things that indicated you that these guys want like the mellow prisms on this rounds were brilliant because it was like it was a very subtle way of showing that they're completely alien from society
and think there are a lot smarter than actually are but in this movie is john gotti is the coolest fucking guy in every room like when they said it seemed to life and then like order his court fees he's like who lives or it's i could take the thirty dollars
it's like oh this guy's so awesome you have those he has like three or four char moments where it's supposed to be witty and clever and they're all just pig shit stupid and that's the thing about this movie is you think well yeah he probably was not very clever criminals and movies are i was way more clever than real criminals are and that's why this is like the most in its own
a realistic mob movie of all time because it's from the point of view like the actual point of view of people in this mill you as opposed to every other mob movie that is good quote unquote which is why somebody outside of it is critical of it and as like has remove and distance and the judgment other people who would they do not taste the they don't know the and water their there are
and there is makers like this is the thing about these guys they got a coat and i got respect as they take your the community in the family speaking of that correct answer those are literally gibberish that was what is going one of the things that again the the outer boroughs a slash trump supporter if you ask them why they idolize someone like john gotti
all of the things i'll tell you is like hey you know they may do these murders but it's only people who are in the life you know others you know they don't got a cold they don't do maria they don't you violence to people who are just sit civilians or whatever one of the first major plot points in the movie shows are you doing exactly that
again a true thing that happened but one of his kids you say allegedly i don't want to get
what john kerry's kids is allegedly mowed down by a car was just riding his bike
the street and howard beach and some guy hit him with a car kill them
his young son and we know he was later on because again the young son is introduced about a minute before he knows he literally her kidney only the a
even have hair and is
as bad as corny as dick and now he's
murray get over here
many folk and aerobics you almost game quit
that's why he is dead
he goes to the corpse of the kid on the street after getting hit by the car and he he just picks inside of his shorts is a god
you
my boy he didn't even a this item
i don't think he is mind the pupils have to strain
alone case you will think adam is joking that is actually a line
god he got his grief at the death of his child is he didn't even have hair on his
so what is he do to the driver of the scar again wasn't in a life he's abducted and killed but again the movie does not show you this on screen it only refers you to actual news of the event so talk about a whitewash of this guy's like they could have actually dramatize shown the moment of kidnapping and then torturing
some terrified schmuck who was in the wrong place at the wrong time will even with that scene they still kind of glorified it because they were like he didn't even have fix the dent on his car oh yeah
no parking it where you can see is not way to respect the family mostly it's really not even the kill indicate it's respect
like every fucking auto repair shop in the triborough tri state area wasn't owned by someone who knew jack it was it called like did not video al partido pol repair and all like all their buffer pairs were just people who ran people over on purpose
yeah now i didn't like after his kid dies you know he goes to the social club and is it when she's sweaty men out front and i remember saying out loud in the theater respect to a
the whole movie is like it's like italian dragon ball z with assessing respect levels
oh my god
cheaters respect levels are higher than i thought and awesome
it does have the judas airline ha
i'm a nice like a prince and i have a working theory i think kevin connelly got really nervous the night before director this
and then he has he directed all and one like let's be clear and i think he just got some guy from china to do it for him and he just showed him goodfellas one
make a lot more sense if the person that directed this movie did not speak english yes it will to make a lot more
they took like fifteen mob movie scripts and ran through babel fish to in japanese and then put them back in the english yeah and they just assemble them at random the as the first gangster movie ever made by the first build of skynet
it's like they took all the marginal qualities that people like another mob movies like the sort of joke he banter and camaraderie and and goodfellas
the narration and generation
city but none of the thing we're the plot can be followed by anyone at all or you know who any of the characters are
he's fine with were joking around here at time you know but but you guys like have the balls to criticize islam

you know there are a lot of characters are introduced way too late in the koran
i really wish they would have gone into the mafia offering the federal government help after nine
they're appointed how how they were actually good guys i love that one because what was help it's like i saw arab yesterday
what i'm worried because i mean that hearkens back to world war two with the bigger midday to enlist the help of lucky luciano a highly own
the sensible what they said they were doing was there hey we know the mob controls the ports in new york dogs dogs or whatever we're going to make sure that no nazis sneak in and you know we need lucky to do that but really what they were doing was making sure that unions would organize on those same dogs that's true by the unions were started by nazis my name is steve nash
yet national socialists
organized labor organizer death camps
i'm thinking back to the line about it didn't even of hair on his prick i would like if the next scene when they're all gathered officials so club and like everyone's paying their respects and like some guys in the and neighborhood kids come up and like mr gotti who your kid didn't have no hair and is prick like to give you some ah
give a big bag
petition from an old
called tribute awesome

you're getting abuse to mr
here's another amazing amazing thing from this movie
we should be about like i said earlier the movie like that guy over there that's angela ruggiero like the screen will pause to show you enjoy riviera who was a rabbi yeah yeah
like the absurd over use of name and location queues at random moments they'll just be like it will cut to a shot of the plaza hotel will tell you new york city
then it will cut to get it will be like new york city
movie doesn't take place in any location other of in new york city so i don't know why they would keep reminding you only have i guess what a prison yeah yeah but again
that that would be obvious when he's in prison and then back of the city where you know the difference between those two locations edges everything is like copy and paste wikipedia oh here's an all the establishing lines with might as well
is another really funny thing about john gotti to character and like as he's portrayed in the screenplay
one of the things he says repeatedly throughout the movie like when he first sees the same me the ball character he goes i don't like tech i i will trust him he's never been to jail and he says it multiple times the movie i don't trust anyone has never been to prison and he has affirmed when sammy the flip side of the i knew it wouldn't want to go he didn't go to jail but he does cross
sammy the ball he put sammy the ball and the most important
sensitive position he could give it i mean i guess he like me where he makes a prediction an axe otherwise you just can't be wrong except i don't go to i don't go to prison when i call elections and like he hopes he votes wrong yeah you're more of a autonomy patera i think tommy karate somehow banana family yeah you're like a wildcard
yeah that's what people say when they see me game it's like sometimes i die seven times in a row sometimes i just drop twenty bomb
and like okay so this movie does cover a bit of real history and if you didn't know about any of this it would be early incomprehensible but even if you know the slightest it's more incomprehensible because there are these big things that happened like they show the assassination of paul castellano in front of the sparks steakhouse in midtown manhattan which is
a big thing
the moment or god takes over the gambino family the five boroughs
yeah
because back to his mentor explaining to him you know what he needs to take in one of the best lines of dialogue with the movie he goes john i don't gotta tell you but new york your new york new york is all the gambino family that's who we are if you're going to do this you can you support of all five boroughs new york
brooklyn bronx queens staten island
just listing the five brother pauses to give me that are all only before all the were fifty seven boroughs they are born out in queens brooklyn
but cast is in a character in this movie at all know he's barely shows and also when he gets killed you don't feel anything because there's never been even one moment of tension between him ah the only one having that path for a plot was him getting an impressively annoyed with cast llano and and getting the guys together with kill him and they'd never meet they never ever
conversation they never shown any kind of disagreement it's just sort of like that guy is now like go real guy he's now he isn't run not a real gangster i don't i don't trust them
because i feel like chap a trap as is kind of like john gotti and paul castellano his part save american
you hear that positive america we love going to prison
yeah it's like i've seen a bunch of god a need for tv movies because i had a lot of time alone when i was another one of our minds
it add premium cable but in all of them is the same thing words like because it's like a jewish screenwriter who wishes he was in the mob because it would mean you'd have more friends and night romanticize it is like it's the same thing is like the suburban rap fan with the drake is a policy
it's like oh yeah he was a businessman cast are you fucking put you fucking pitch and so it's always sort of sympathetic to god he just blow his brains out i was expecting something like that but it's like it was like what was that one mystery science theater with mitchell yeah where they're like
garza busy brazilian gaza they're just name these two italian guys you never see and they just don't really figured that the plaudits that they are the crucial plot point like a in the arm and a day got a movie there's a scene where the disgusting naked castellano emerges from the pony is fat body jiggle about
i guess the implication viewers a john gotti would never do that he would wear like a victorian baiting costume
he had girl is fat resigned ever way short but with this it's just like look at his house piece of shit thinks he's cool because he has columns on and says well guess what he's going to die
the benefit may
another another great piece of new york city mob lore is vincent the change you can say and his
that's going on
his feigned mental illness to avoid prosecution is walk around in a dirty bath robe
you got it today
just put a career cashed out i mean his bio
i couldn't be the boss he's doing another tweed storm
again something that could have been done in a way that made him a interesting character or adversary nothing there's a few recycled shots of him to in the bathroom overcame showing about the streets and then you get one other seen with him when it's implied that like he blew up the car bomb some guys allegation that didn't get guy
that we saw two seasons of and for ten minutes after that i can't believe they killed frankie air seven characters
britain ranges like frank including john gotti son i thought it was funny because one of the scenes he's wearing a suit so i was just imagining he'd get home from walk around manhattan in pajamas and then he'd change into her valentino's it just hang out in his apartment in a suit
murray talk about the marketing campaign of this movie
oh yeah so the twin it
check out the twitter
page for god no
so the twitter
page
it has embodied this like a mafia like a tough guy italian guys running their twitter page and when they get criticized by like film geek says after be like hey
we just we just put ten times and film critic off
you don't like i'm always angry
there's there's just one critic who very happily so this this movie is the first film has been distributed by movie pass right
the past i have it but it's going to go out of business unless it's
his business idea simultaneously
but so they decided okay we're going to distribute films every we're going to have a second revenue stream that way
as opposed to us just losing money in that by people by paying for i mean i think i sound like fifteen movies
for ten dollars which is less than even one movie arrogant
anyway so everyone who has movie past gotta push notifications like sometime around last week which is as which just said gotti the critics hated the audience is love it like how about you see for yourself right
then if you go on rotten tomatoes which it is currently at zero percent it is like a ninety nine percent audience score and the reason is because there are a ton like thousands of people who saw this movie and then decided they were so passionate about this movie is either
they were going to create a profile on rotten tomatoes and then give it a five star reviews that lead people to believe that okay they're like they are fixing the audience score on rotten tomatoes
and to the extent that i think the incredible came out the same week as it and it got slightly i think it maybe like got billion dollar like a brazilian dollars got only slightly fewer audience scores on rotten tomatoes so basically this whole marketing campaign was that they made a bunch
fake profiles on rotten tomatoes and everyone gave a five star reviews and they marketed in the vein of the whole trump you care trust the media you can trust it's all fake news and that's like sort of the way they've got about it it has been a failure i think they made a million dollars like opening weekend three years
saying there's an italian american troll farm
i don't know
i have become like the eric garlic against italians are on hand our democracy with your greasy hand guys in a bunker on the internet twenty four hours a day drinking straight from provo bottle
well i'll be like this gets into like what is also interesting about this movie as a stand in for the times is that like this is like like the donald trump guess not
every reason to stand in for donald trump of like the way he's portrayed in the like more confusion and degeneracy of the film itself in reddit portrays this obviously evil man is some sort of hero or person where the of admiration or because the only way they can evaluate actions is
a series of like three or four fucking bumper stickers that they've have memorized about like he knows about family and a date to the community the same way they are for trump and it's like he's a businessman or whatever like the hell we have like these very small concepts that that they have applied this movie is for people that have a tattoo on their body that
his family but only talk to their uncle because they think will inherit zippo that they believed to be solid gold
this gets we've mentioned before this movie's over use of stock footage of of real news casts and maybe my favor
testimonials is the real testimonials that are we all local news footage and believe you do this i want everyone to go around this room and name and italian american you respect

oh no
it sounded
have no but this is a real news footage for when god he died in two thousand and two and this is real news footage from howard beach and they're talking to these are real teenagers and people from the neighborhood all lining up to say i don't care what anyone says god he's a good guy
he kept the street safe he had class he's now he's bad criminals nowadays and i actually saw speaking of the twitter campaign i saw someone on twitter reply to the guardian was handle was deplorable mega us a number one say god he was a good guy when he was around queens
clean and safe not like it is now which is ludicrous because the crime rate in queens in the eighties is probably ten thousand scientists higher than it is maybe one of the save the world right now yeah that's insane
so significant i saw another deplorable account wide someone saying if god he was around there more followers than any of these hollywood
up
praise god he would beat ninja on twitch i think they think of him the same way they think of job because the thing is they also they all these guys go and he was a pause it was a great pause he was an objectively shitty criminal he sucked at crime even if your have in an hour to jail or the time and then fuck him did he
even within the code of the mafia by killing his boss he committed a violation of the code but he has a pussy and then almost immediately he goes starts going i mean yeah i took him awhile to convict him but he was basically on trial for like the entire time he was boss and then he went to prison for life a died there is a shitty fuck am i mean i have added an isis
he was on tv how the time it's the same way they think drop is a great businessman even though his entire career is just a bunch of money laundering schemes and and sees he was on tv all the time so of course he was a good businessman speaking to his leadership also like have all the guys in his career turned out to be rats
he has all of them were informed guys like i you know i keep people course like everyone you just you have the door literally lapping open met
like john gotti throughout the movie he makes a bunch of a weird moral points about how it's going to be the government including refusing comfort medication when he died
which is like yeah just imagine a federal prosecutor going like you can take out of event so own
the i mean he actually did get over and ago and because every single person he talked to everybody was wired and can you imagine the asinine bullshit always they probably got some version of he seem to finish the conversations
say you know i think you know that pussy about nineteen thirty five before
look now but it would be and are you on that races will have been way better though because they didn't even have any kind of like attempts by one or two attempts at giving the language any kind of color there were just talking about mob stuff in just these things like you gotta have a sit down with the capital just kind of stuff or saying got me
f u wisdom what does one where stacy keach goes the boss is the post is to pause oh yeah they am right and then they think that's so fucking insightful that later on in the voiceover gallegos you know my my personal use to say the poor says
the in case you didn't catch that absolutely meaningless fucking slogan that that is just literally a pathology
were more time because this is what passes for like wisdom and insight here into this this moving was reality this movie was written on the toilet and frazier
see there's a scene where
gary how the other there's one alpha called fat guy that that age and one beta one in us who by the way i want to point out was played by retailer vince who big hillbilly louisiana and he tries at the beginning to do like a way you don't and
okay but then as soon as the movie whereas on and he has to do scenes where he's yelling he just completely drops it and so is just gone i cannot me and there's no way man
f b i got her what we're talking about oh john they bought arcana carry pages
he because they explain this in the most confusing way possible but he
fox up in some way
because he tries to kill as many yeah and cassock has by who's it fascinating character that we seek to fucking scenes of but they got a wants to kill the beta fat guy and guy like now i'm just put him on a shelf
bob's being in the mob so much lie hard regularly say it was heartbreaking
similar to like it's like old yellow yeah our it's like erin andrews it's
we don't watch her they're like you can't come to our shitty building where we sit down all day anymore
yeah i saw the kill himself like you you can not come to the store that doesn't sell anything
you are fired from mars or easy looks like he looks like all of his children
him because he can't sit on a folding chair and go about the bills
murphy says that like he dies like few months later a cancer the video sharing just said it was cancer but he really tired of appropriate
said however that he literally said air and then the following see it is my fantasy of the movie where it's one line is john travolta looking at his friends tombstone is like a you fucked up sorry about that
okay
yeah if jared like dies in prison trump is going to be emotional day and then he just goes to jared muslim and is like well
who'd have guessed you would be i live by me funny how things work out so true but i think we should sort of circle the drain here circle to the ending and talk about with this movie
because the say half of them of the first half the movie or first three quarters of the movie is about what a cool guy john gotti is the last quarter of it is about how cool his son is and we know that the service was cool because in the movie he's like he's like the hunk from a nineties keen show the hair spiky hair is
low body fat whereas in real life john gotti john gotti idiots on looked like a boombox mario just hideous bowling pin shape man but in this movie he's just like in excellent shape of the way they kept to a guy for a fucking acting ability as a he might have been the worst performing i was given isn't that bad actor was like a nap of i thought there's no
oh this guy's an actor he was so bad
is a contest when he's that's what a fella yeah yeah it's like they'd have scoured him from like the fuck team five friends
he has to porn actor
only would have done a better job absolutely one hundred percent weaker bucks you are to gas pipe for a second oh yeah no yeah then we get our other johnny got his yeah mike because you tell us that away but the real gas pipe and that sixty add brevity interview with him so if i don't think that's awesome
yes might actually was at a gas pipe casa was the underpass of the lucchese family and he was like he tried to kill gary with their palm and then we ever jerry try to kill him but there's an interview on youtube bradley talking a gas pipe and he's asking about these to long island
guys who own like garbage carting business and
the gas pipe killed and he was like these are family men men who are trying to make a living is what do you say to that and get her it's like whoa
i don't know if amazon or not
there's a lot of great moments in an interview
like he made a deal with the government and then the government reneged on it because he was like smuggling cheese jail
they betrayed me and i just think about tories i cry on the but your underscore again this is a guy was dozens of murders or yes on him
murder torture executions
type of sociopath it like for the mob like he was notorious like in their use a terrifying guy and amazing character but again if you only reference and from the movie it's like that sort of like the ratty looking dude who tortured somebody we never see again but once he was pretty cool though it torture and the guy
they can meet with wagner
i mean it's like the guy they got to play him play gas pipe in a movie that was produced by a i for sure
google deep dream
this is this movie was made by the microsoft a i had to be suspended for twitter because it kept post racial dramatically
so you think the movie's ending because the movie has been structured around with these really into a flash backs but the the spine of it are these scenes of of gary when he's with terminal cancer in prison trying to convince his son not to take a plea deal on charges that he had go to trial because you
you know is real footage that nasa is like super interesting because it's guy telling sign like i would never lay down i would never like like putting the life above his own family and as being a complete piece of shit was who he was then they are you arguing in this sounds like cool dead he's like no
good move
and then at the end is i don't he leaves and then they show the kid signing papers and you're like okay i guess he took the deal even though he literally just spent the entire movie be told not to
that's basically it is to best for guys who are too much education and brains could ask you closure but he leaves and then they show him on the gurney and hilarious scene like they're trying to get an eloquent as his and he won't take payments and were like why don't we just put you in a coma
hurts so much and like is rather mower
over in years or fuck you
and then he dies
and you're like okay the movies over and then decides it's going to follow the legal travails of john junior and it's like you like we when he signed a deal i'm assuming that they're now he's out and he's on trial
yeah and then the get sick then he's out again and then he has a scene where he just goes into a garage and yells at some people who you'd have literally no idea who they are and their argument is in cop cheaper it just like he goes in areas like i mean here is my dad told me to be here and they're like yeah well who saying that i'm saying
okay where i guess you make the rules yeah i also make the respect okay
he goes back a trial and want dialogue tree do i tend to get all it is is is the movies to explicitly saying that this kid this poor guy is being railroaded by the feds that they're harassing him and that they won't let him go
the real real she says that says that you're the real gangsters
and then it closes on a fucking
title card that says you know john gotti jr was charged over fifty times with crimes even though it was repeatedly acquitted the government made deals with bad guys little more on the street in exchange for testimony he just wants to be left alone
we originally comes an explicit play to for the government to leave him alone or get off work at a pardon from trap which might happen honestly
what the fuck happened where this movie come from and it's like you're trying to tell me that this is an unjust prosecution but one of the scenes in this film
his of john junior swearing and to become a maid member of the game been what i am left which is never hey
never showed are expressed until his lawyer is making his final play which is like come on lot of golf
the jury's yeah
i like the government like they were in that garage that and we got you did one day of the mafia
her hair prosecute that but yeah
it's like
john gotti later in the movie he's in this sprawling mic mansion like idiotic state and it's serious kids now he's married to the girl that he met the discuss beautiful judiciary of or neglect or impossible
searches huge house and it's implied that it's like unfair that the cops arresting him but it's like okay how did he get that house
he like passes series seven yeah theater yeah it just never explain like our wire when he left the mafia just like or what i am i waited as of the start of this trial let him go it's like it's everywhere you could quit because it's just people who having brunch it's just that planned
that is the point is like the coolest part sopranos is a like do all these crimes and they're like a protection rackets and murderers and like all these things but essentially like what they do it to support is not like having big houses are like fancy cars they do it so they can hang out in a boys club like in a club house with their fellows
they do so they could be in a friend but left for their entire life and that that that is like there's a kind of like they think that they like you know where spit on when they came over and ellis island they had to work and they always talk about how hard they work but essentially they really just hang out with other men
that was like the most clever thing this brand it was what a fucking great clever show but like when tony always bitches about hard he works and it's like the previous seem awfully him eating like him
i could go for another launch this is about you're right that this movie is it shows you what the lure of the mafia is hanging out with the bodies but the problem is the real downfall even among downfall is that it doesn't even look like any fun
like nobody says anything funny they don't do anything they won't even my drink or play cards mostly we don't even see john you is why i never had
nods there is no cigarettes in the whole they don't go to the copa yeah like there's one scene where they'll just like joy leslie sitting in a disco and that's they weren't john he went to the club with meet with neil so he could point out people he didn't like statement later higher at random
i can i get these holes out of the way i want to point out these guys are gonna like oh look another disgusting guy that are going to trust her son
hand on her sight
i love it uses gas his trial that it's also to astra go in the oval office with like don began in is like lose fat guy and like that's literally your secretary treasurer i don't like him i don't trust
i several following
it just doesn't look like fun zero here's a thought though has the power and membership of the mob gone down because of aggressive federal prosecution or because of the availability of gaming and pod casting and the accessibility of male friendships later in life that's true sacrifice
i want to know what i would do i might have to join the mafia
yeah i think about
you guys i think about the other the other fair park as a family in brooklyn
i guess the family come
growing and leisure yeah and comfortable the law
i'm sort of fucking stupid but i'm very confident when i say
i don't really work that are but i'm always complaining at that is through this movies for more than anybody more than any general subset of italians or or trump voters or anything it's a very specific group of young men like kyle smith who liked the idea of the mafia because it's where they could be with her friends all the time
as the people who are like that and that's why there's no crime
that's why there's no actual mob stuff because of what they actually care about they care about being in a room with you from being in a pig dimly poorly lit room by the way because they literally on where we are right now i like yes but as somebody who's watching a movie i would appreciate even lighting keys so that you can see people's faith
says in the middle of the friend every interior seen in this movie has a big black spot in the middle where all the peoples features or clothing become totally indistinct because they just didn't like the space it's negative space i think it's actually has no i to have it currently is a family for america even odds are no
it's amazing he had to post this movie
accidentally doesn't know much to michael mann and robert altman there's a scene where there's a bar fight that has the overlap indistinct dialogue and jittery camera
the movie but obviously totally accidentally and then there's another scene where john engineer walking down a flight of spiral stairs and the camera instead of like following them down with their faces forward while they're talking like is behind their back and following them from behind and you to see the back of their head and it's like a tracking
batman movie once again totally accidental it's amazing it really is like you gave a fucking monkey a goddamn i really think that china
that's a horrible thing to say that an irish director
oh can i tell you it harder irish i'm so entourage gossip yes i saw the any from entourage a coffee shop i my old apartment and he asked them to turn the music
back
hello
on what music playing that's utter respect or lack of respect page three shit right there to see that there is a tweet reason and they went viral it was like a group of white man is called the pod cast and everyone was like yeah but if we didn't have those park is would be shooting each other
i would be exactly like meyer lansky and would be bugsy siegel of course go
your car
oh i not even think about that
always replies you with on twitter when you're just trying to have a good post i don't know your talk
the bug
i think i aspire short legs even figure
and irish bootlegging that shorts yeah i'll be him loud excitable killed in the bathroom most likely that's where i will like we die
actually i will like die in a bathroom
but aren't we would be the worst mob i mean what crime
will could even think what hustles could we possibly put together to me all right
you want barack as it's free
i hope
a forget about the money that is rat terriers how you make it illegal you slander somebody every episode i ass
you know it and age aging a poet nice bike as you pay you pay us for the privilege of putting it out every time someone is polite to us like subscribes to address from their park has worked as respect her just being polite because they made us once i got i think if we did try to become an actual mob mob
crude trying trying to earn like i'm honestly think it would be things like lying to grab her to get the free like or the or the refund
for so
do you think about you take the expensive food out of the boom
yeah august costs to of living
example of a tell you
just got to get a mother only go yeah yeah i'd never showed up at are you talking about i never got it you know this remind me of the episodes prayers were there are hanging out i think it's when a poly gets out from gets out of jail and they're having a party and they're making sylvia silvio to please do it to do it and it's like sylvia just in his normal voice he does it change
boys they're all he goes just when i thought i was out they pulled me back it was like that sounds exactly like godfather oh my god
there are freaking that's like that scene for an hour and forty five minutes is this move yes i beg your absolutely every it's just people doing impressions of other mob movie just like a hundred italian men doing deniro scours yeah and it's just like but it's
with anything like like what is good without any these i mean i guess just like information gaudy is now the movie for everyone who used to look up to deniro because it good for us reason reason the trial allianz disowned him a long time
he had some preferences
sad to have been by the church
he's doing is that italians are england didn't like they were like in the modern context the first to be like you know that
get rid of white people
so i would you say in summation
with god he was actually one of the most extraordinary movies i've ever imagine i would say run don't walk to see gotti you're gonna love it
and if you see a critic
do not hesitate to do the most profitable mob activity like killing them winning witness
they don't worry you get to go to the death it's just as if you want you know sit in a dimly lit room with other badly dressed man arguing over what food to eat incessantly do a movie quotes back and forth to one another and generally being a drain on society you can either join the mafia or starter pack
i also want to say that as someone who is like a fan of the show
like i did come from that kind of like italian fashion upbringing in can't this respect people but one thing i respect about you guys is your lack of respect and how you're not afraid to like go after people you know i don't i'm afraid to do that stuff i will thank you for disrespect respecting are different
i thank you for that unless of course literally any member of the gambino crime
really find this episode listens to it i retroactively take the and route only thing i said work i just a little more than argue about cold cuts adams addresses
when he told us to do this we're scared of them i just say publicly that one person that i had this respect
is mr dodd jessica up
and i think that we straight a little bit from politics on this august
it's important that we remember that we have to disrespect him by calling him orange in being rude to him and cheese diddley dude lead
like a sort of ned flanders kind of insult surges just keep resisting
you know the maybe the guardian people fucked up by making this the trump movie maybe it was like resistance will be gaudy doing a deal with tromp and god it's like whoa i'm bad but can you imagine if this guy was president
i thought i was a group that's a good
make the resistance mafia cut she i have a million billion dollar
yeah just last word for me i give this film ten other thing gobble ghouls
eleven and a half per shoots golf
my file or of you honestly like lars von der of those other stupid europeans made a move it is confusing people would say it's genius so give it ten
so yeah again in closing i would like to thank our true friends are few friends of ours from the adam friedland you are you fucking come town baby might racine of the sit down a great park as you want to learn more about crimes and the people who do them felix you are just a guess that you actually talks
about john got the entire got a episode is very good i think you should do it because we didn't die there's much in the actual life of guardian this but with you on that but everyone check out the yeah i want to sit down and dive more into the history of a crime in this country and elsewhere check out the sit down with mike receive
because
wow

give
said
sentiment
the mob thought it made nothing
the case
the
