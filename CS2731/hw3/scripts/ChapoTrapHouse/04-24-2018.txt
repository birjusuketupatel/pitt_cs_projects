
everyone this is virgil taxes with a special bonus episode today which will be talking about issue that's very familiar to me canning specifically then cannon candidate for the united states congress in indiana his ninth district than as a civil rights lawyer running to win a competitive primary on may eighth for the democratic nomination to take
on freshman congressman and wealthy fails entre hollingsworth tray is an entrepreneur from tennessee by which i mean he founded companies with this multimillionaire father's fortune that father joe hollingsworth also purchase the congressional seat for tray spending upwards of one point five million dollars on a super pac in the last election than thank you for coming on today
now performing it's your biography i want to talk a little about his district in the ninth is in the southeast part of the state a kentucky containing suburbs of louisville in indianapolis largest city i believe as bloomington
it is a racially homogenous district some ninety one percent white largely a republican district based on past election results in the last election then i voted for drop a sixty one percent of the vote to hillary's thirty four
from for out running tray hollingsworth only pulled fifty four percent of the vote now last time i interviewed a congressional candidate kang yelling he was running to represent a district and white i've never been to that district very blue district but i am very very familiar with it from those episodes a full house where they go to hawaii it's girls spam and the beach boys
thing fire dancing right
i have a perfect understanding what wide voters' concerns are which is volcano abolition that's sort of thing i do not have any similar understanding of southern indiana i don't know what the economy's like what the density is what sort of jobs people have what opportunities are are or are not for people my generation what struggles are unique to that area so dan my first question for you is what does indiana's
ninth district mean to you
the same of what what's going on in hawaii it's mostly volcano evolution
we're trying to get spam macadamia nuts
there and available and abundant supply
despite the homogeneity of of the district
racially a man i think it is so diverse district in terms of
the way in which we have to
in which we choose our messaging how we talk to people what we present in different parts of the so it's thirteen counties
from louisville to indianapolis basically and including are you bloomington should and are you
june ish very progressive the university
i wish you could proceed trending democratic socialist at the moment
you know and then you've got the sort of blue dog democrats in the south in the upper middle class types in the north and then there's a whole lot of rural area and the middle
so it's a challenge to me minutes or messaging challenge
you know everybody's concerned about health care of course everybody's concerned about the opie would crisis because it affects everybody and scott counties in my district and that's the county that was notoriously got national headlines for
having a now higher rate of hiv with the rate of each of us actually gone up in recent years
just ravage hope you yeah yeah
i mean that's that's something that is going on and people are talking about all the other than that you have pretty diverse things what are you know in the middle jobs are a big deal
in the north there's a lot of talk about infrastructure so
it's a challenge it's surge two hours in any direction it's a lot of driving and a lot of different kind of people whom the but a lot of good people and i think that's
we can talk to those good people and convinced them that we are looking out for them i think we went with the fable trump country that i've heard so many tail
new yorker
we get questions all time low i had you appeal to rural voters and hey you're going to get to all these republican voters and you know i personally think that we're going to have a lot of previously known voters and marginal voters and we're going to come out for the ocean and in were you know of course we're we're still talking about how do we
reach to the center but i don't think that's particularly productive conversation to be happening and yet they ought to be trying to get people out that we couldn't get before well for my analysis and the parents are building in the democratic direction very very sharply suburban voters
oh and as and republican loyalists are moving didn't the democratic column
lot of the white working class voters in the rust belt post industrial midwest areas that flipped from hillary to trump are returning home which all which points to a wave the incumbent hollingsworth one by what thirteen percent now
i would project that to be the swing yeah yeah
the i think this will be right on the costs well we had a congressional candidate and twenty six sixteen
fourteen points better than hillary to so i think that those odds looked pretty good
when you when you're considering that this guy was essentially riding the coattails in two thousand and sixteen
it is he he not very popular generally not particularly i mean he came in and bought out a republican primary from established in and republicans so even the folks on his own team don't yeah particularly yeah those fracture is still exists now yeah
you mentioned blue dog democrats and the destroying our they are successful down valid
yeah and you know what one of the biggest challenges that we're running into this like on in trying to meet his to get people to fill those down ballot
also so you're you're dealing with the situation in my district where
we haven't run democrats were a lot of the seeds in years and sometimes and decades just because they been republican stronghold seat
you know that there's been a big part of what we've tried to do in this campaign is is i think we've got about ten volunteers at have morphed from being volunteers for the campaign into being candidates in different places a lot of district and so yeah
that sort of reverse cocktail thing will work in our favor know absolutely i mean you have the tail wins on i i think any democratic and eight has can rely on these tail wins that after that it's all hustle talent that kind of thing messaging
but what will talk about campaign itself often a little bit late let's get to you
dan about you
civil rights lawyer
oh what is what are some highlights from your career
oh nothing too big
yeah
i came
to be civil rights learned sort of unconventional way i guess and went into it like most lawyers do to sort of not sure what to do with myself i'm wanting to do something helpful and so had to hit the big career default but after college we went to law school
i'm in thinking that i was going to go to work for a nonprofit
some to go something like that
and ended up being a trial lawyer working in a small plane us from doing mostly employment discrimination whistle blower type case
discrimination sex discrimination that going to at first
in short of his transition into inmates rights cases and police brutality stuff over the years
so lots of what we call constitutional litigation and as a result of doing that kind of work and sort of branding myself as a civil rights leader over the years and we got involved with doing the marriage cases in marriage equality cases than happened out of kentucky and indiana and the one out of kentucky actually went on to the united states
supreme court
the case now it's will bear to fail vs hodges that's how people know it but result in a marriage equality and off at the state
so that which was kind of a big deal
we didn't get a chance to celebrate that much because a couple of weeks later we
if you were listeners know about kim davis and eastern kentucky
we filed bad case and i teach at law school and i tell my first year law students when i was sitting where you guys are i legitimately never expected to have the rock band survivor issue a public statement on a case that i was working on over my legal career but that's what happened and the kim davis case
that was the same
we do not condone kim davis's use of the song i have the tiger
i don't remember that oh go to court with a boom box
she came out of jail with a boom box
there was a public rally when she came out of jail and shoot sugar for a couple of days and then she comes out and it's like mike huckabee and ted cruz looking dejected on the stage and it's like this big booming round of the tiger and yes survivor issued to public statements and
we're not cool with that and and like the next day waking up like really all just happen yesterday that the rock band survivor religious even so there's that in that cases the case it won't die it's still going on
pills
during the twenty sixteen election and there was a guy you may remember a candid
who was holding lots of rallies nationwide
lots of races attended i guess it didn't really narrow it down all that much but anyway
continually particularly raucous candid that came to love all and invited a soothing mob of white supremacists to beat up my black client who is there to peacefully protest him
and so they took him up on that imitation and so we shoot home
before he became the leader of the free world and the white supremacist the beat her up and his campaign and so that that got a lot of attention on twenty four hour news was that lawsuit going right now
although for the court of appeals so we won the first round was which was basically them trying to say that
trump has got a first amendment right to ask members of his audience to attack people in the protest and the judge pretty conservative judge in kentucky so no actually it doesn't have that right that's not how the first memory works in week quite agree with that but that that issue is being considered up of the sixth circuit right now as a federal case
yup
what if you were elected to congress will you continue seeing the president the i mean i think i'd have to withdraw from that guy
have to withdraw from everything as i understand people in congress or technically very busy
you are also involved and told in the medical marijuana law suit against the state of the correct discuss that yeah we filed suit under a provision of the kentucky constitution
to invalidate the prohibitions against medical marijuana and so we've got some really cool clients for that you know people that have lived in a couple other states and been patients and then they move back to their home stay in their considered criminals something happens in kentucky and indiana
and we've got a vietnam veteran that it takes medical marijuana for p s d and it's the only thing that helps him not have nightmares the we've got another guy who used to be a high school football coach that found himself as so many people do just all of a sudden one day addicted to opiates it's because the only thing he can get prescribe
try to manage chronic pain
so you know
and i really even know that much about medical marijuana for a couple of years ago when i start work on this case loose there's there's a big need for that there so we're all trying to get there by hook or by crook i gotta i gotta say cool mean something very different to trial lawyers it does to most people when he sighs and cool clients i thought oh weird old jerry garcia
well i mean
not so much it's not there's been very little of the
the sort of cheech and chong type of stereotypes new associate what what is that provision in the constitution
section two that is provision against arbitrary government it
now how has your legal were contribute to the development of your political ideas
yeah that's a hell of a question
i mean i think you know what i've had to do throughout my legal career is is take care of people so i'm interested in policies that take care of people you know
in in terms of how that
gets to where i am now i mean i think that we're we're dealing with a landscape
where you know you've got an executive that is pointing maniac judges to the federal court which is where i practice and they're going to be there for the rest of their lives yeah and it's like we can get and we can litigate these cases on behalf of individuals and we can try to vindicate civil rights you know all we want to but if we have judges that just don't care about the law and just don't care
about people
help us whole lot so i mean there's gotta be standard of accountability establish through the other branches of government i'll absolutely i mean i am a proponent of oil is oh man i recognize that's where a lot of the formal actual power in society as and when you have a president who is nominating just twenty seven year olds with no
legal experience often have been banned from dave and busters to the federal bench that are they getting rubber stamped in we're going to have to live without for probably our entire lives yeah i mean these are guys that are not qualified to preside over you know a meeting of a rock garden
so i mean the idea that we would have to practice in front of them and like something something like marriage to me some like the marriage case or a marijuana is or something like that where
that could have gone very very differently in a marriage case itself could have gone very differently in front of one of these trump point the judges than it did in front of the bush appointee that we have yeah let's go on to some issues regarding that and medical marijuana law suit you support the legalization of marijuana but you also supported in order to treat the oil crisis
can you describe how the old
i'll be on addiction has acted this district in indiana oh yeah absolutely and well it's been devastating and part of the connection there i mean if you look at the twenty nine states and dc that have some provision for medical marijuana meaningful provisions for american medical marijuana
i mean you see overdose rates drop by as much as twenty to twenty five percent really no states in a lot of it
a lot of is just common sense if you look at the way in which people get hooked on opie ways to begin with by a large it's a lot from least they're getting prescribed fist force of pills
from doctors that don't have any other choice to but the to prescribed opie way pills for managing chronic pain so it doesn't take very long to get addicted to that stuff and it's not terribly difficult to overdose on
and these pain will formulations are more powerful today than they were in the past yeah
the law of diminishing returns here too you know where where i mean it's just like my client i told you about in kentucky where you know he's taking pills and he doing what the doctor tells him to do and then six months later you wake up and realize oh i'm addicted to opium
i have a problem with this stuff and you know the whole manufacturers know that we need to pursue greater liability and expanded liability for those manufacturers
but the medical marijuana pieces it's not a cure all but it's it's it's it's a big part of something to wear somebody has a an option for treating chronic pain that isn't just an opiate so i cringe every time i hear these guys call marijuana a gateway drug because it's only a gateway drug because there's a black market in otherwise it's and
exit drug you see people successfully get off of of opiates of they have some other tool to manage chronic pain you know i just came from the west coast and were all three states that we visited at legal marijuana stores clean nice boozy store you can walk into and get tree
sheets and rapes and and just we'd right there he did on the street you know and my colleague mad said it's just it's just so civilized you made it was in chaos and anarchy and
it was born jobs getting married to each of it was dole it was like going to have small pharmacy honestly is the novelty wore off in like five seconds if i mean that sounds pretty boring maybe i should abandon them
when most people have come around to that even a lot of people in the republican party yet know i think so
that's a great example though of something that has huge bipartisan support among people on the ground and elected officials have both parties
still see it as being the sort of taboo thing when i first started running we were out and proud about marijuana support from the very beginning and it caused me to lose some support among some old guard democrats and because all around
want to give me a serious candidate
yeah it was support for legalization is what's something the sixty percent nationwide but we don't have a legislature that votes sixty percent for the legalization of marijuana medical as a no brainer
about eighty or ninety percent of yeah absolutely so bernie sanders is going to final bill that imposes stiff criminal penalties for these drug executives and are quote from an article here and this was a fact that was just genuinely amazing to me mckesson this is from stat news mckesson a drug this
said to have ship five million old boy pills or west virginia town with four hundred residents over two year span now i have not followed the old boy who issue as closely as many people have so that a staggering to me though yeah
and it's staggering
becoming more and more aware of the malfeasance on the part of these pharmaceutical companies and as well
it strikes me as more profoundly evil than anything big tobacco is die if not worse
well that's that's a pretty high bar and i'm pretty mad at big tobacco but yeah no army the point is well taken
and i mean that's part of the problem know
there is no national system for monitoring this stuff either really well
in indiana somebody can easily just drive down to florida and you know get a couple of prescriptions and come right back up and nobody knows that even that they're getting this stuff legitimately here's a little about the bill legislation will impose a ten year minimum prison sentences and finds equal to an executive compensation package if the individuals company has found to have a legally country
repeated the obesity crisis it would also oppose an additional fine on those companies have seven point eight billion one tenth the annual costs of the crisis birth thousand and sixteen estimates that a bill you would support i absolutely so the scuttlebutt is that while the last big legislative push before this congress has turned over to the democrats this year is going to be about all the lights and the
public and plan is near as i can tell is just an increase on the war on drugs now when you talk to people in your district about the old be like crisis a district that probably falls conventionally to the right of center somewhere do do people clamor for more criminalization or what what what do people what i mean for the most part no i think people realize by en la
large you know it's get it's another example of the disconnect between elected officials and what's actually going on in peoria right
so i think people by and large realized the war on drugs has been a massive failure and you know there's not anybody out there has been affected in some way shape or form a friend or family member you know everybody knows somebody that's that's that's fallen victim to this one thing that we've been talking
campaign trail is how do we sort of rise to the cultural challenge of picking this thing up out of the criminal justice box all together and moving over to the public health pots where it belongs when you say that in no uncertain terms to people they get it i think from the most part they get in we are slowly
coming around to the idea that this is not simply a moral failing thing this is not simply something that we can treat through the criminal justice system that we actually need to have real public health solutions for it
it's easier for people to process that unfortunately because they've seen so much of it in their own lives and their own families
and if you have to you know if you have to tend to a relative that it's had an overdose or if you have
your brother or sister or son or daughter that's gone to jail for the fiftieth time for you know and that's the only kind of treatment that they can get
you see that not work over and over and over and over again you know people sort of get the idea that we need new solutions you begin to understand what's really wrong with the criminal justice system and using that to solve every social ill yeah exactly well how do you talk to people about of a broader vision of social services of health care i mean
how do you feel about that
oh about healthcare specifically all about health care are generally i mean you're talking about turning the boy
opiate addiction from a issue of the justice system of criminality to an issue of public health and that necessarily means a discussion of the health infrastructure in the country and specifically in your district
sure i mean i think the the way we've approached it would just about everybody
is to say we americans deserve a healthcare system in which nobody has to go bankrupt or die because they can't pay a medical bill
and then from there we can start to talk about what that might look like
oh think it's also useful for us to ask the question of who doesn't deserve healthcare is it is the poor is it you know is it seniors
you know people who who can't work i mean who doesn't deserve healthcare
is that it's something that's just a luxury good that should be provided to a privilege fuel or is it really something that everybody on some level is entitled to and then we can work from there the i think almost nobody would say that that you know just because you can't afford to pay a medical bill you should go bank robberies you lose your entire life savings you should lose lose everything into you ever worked for
for or you should die because you know you're too scared to go to the doctor
most people not everybody but most people would say that we need a system that's better than that
i think that once we come to that agreement we can build on that obviously we've we've talked a lot about were still in the primary honeymoon phase right so we're talking a lot about single payer healthcare
that is free of the point of service that comprehensive and all that good stuff
i think that that's what we that's the idea that we need to normalize start shooting for i think that's a persuasive way to frame the issue isn't now on may eighth that's your primary primaries had a close primary it's an open primary in indiana okay any party
okay know you can you can pull you can pull a ballot for the democratic pull him out for the republicans
gotta pick one
right let's shift gears from and talk about ice and the immigration issue right now you i'm told have been involved in litigation involving immigrants and refugees and right
could you talk about that were yeah absolutely i have represented immigrants and refugees in some capacity for my entire legal career
a lot in employment cases because it's very easy for employers to take advantage of immigrants and refugees if they want to
but more recently in sort of emigration type
situations and what we've seen is what i've seen anywhere on the ground in indiana and kentucky is is increased enforcement
against your peaceful people who are not otherwise community a crime and who are not engaged in any sort of a nefarious what we think of his nefarious conduct
you know what we're seeing ice come in and scoop them up of the parking lots of their apartment buildings or where they work or whatever because they don't have the right pieces of paper to be and the country and there is no way for a lot of these folks to to get your quote unquote the right way
i can tell her story after horror story
there was a guy under represented there was from a central american country and his his village had been essentially over run by a drug cartel they chased him out of his house chased him and his family's house
and so they all came to the united states and
his he will arrive separately from his wife his wife had successfully applied for asylum
and in he had not figured out how to go through that process
the and been here for a couple of years and i think it was in january it was right off the elections he scooped up ice taken away from his family he was the sole source of support for their family
taken away from his family in in don't ninety miles away in a jail and boon county kentucky
and you know we treat people that are here without the right pieces of paper that are just trying to feed their families we treat them worse than the worst criminals that that we have that are us citizens
so you don't know under no set of circumstances would you ever take somebody and take them hundred miles away from their family give them fifteen minutes of visitation a week or whatever it was and then just randomly move them to different places in the united states where they're even farther away from their families but that's exactly what happens to
undocumented immigrants and this country when they get apprehended by so this guy gets moved from boon county kentucky where he's locked up in general population with everybody else is accused of everything else moved up to a commercial wisconsin to a jail up there with alto and his lawyer without telling anybody that has happened was just steal him away in the middle of the night
and then i think he ended up in a state facility in louisiana i mean this is this is somebody who signed a voluntary deportation order says
yeah okay go ahead you got me send me back and you still spending months in several different jails
getting medical attention and not having anybody that can speak his language not having access to a lawyer
if he didn't have a volunteer lawyer that was doing it and most of them don't
and eventually gets sent back to his village which is still over a drug cartel
it's fantastically despicable system that we have and i think most people don't have much experience with because especially in the middle of the country our communities tend to be very segregated big what's the next population there in southern indiana but there's not much of an overlap and the van diagram between the next people in the white folks
so we don't know about ice we don't know what they're going we don't know about these sort of gestapo style tactics that are going on and you know we've got i've got a unique position in this campaign and i can talk about that
we can tell people about it we can educate people that i think by and large if if decent people knew what was going on their own backyards they be outraged about rightly so
being follow the dream act debates and the shutdown brinksmanship it seems like for congressional democrats they're beginning negotiating position is we want permanent residency and not citizenship even permanent residency for the good immigrants
for the ones who came here as children through no fault of their own what get implying that is an egregious thing i thought on the first place live and who go to college and who are just nice clean people who will never get arrested even for an arbitrary reason and the law and they lost they lost that it's i believe is only
through court orders that
dreamers are somewhat safe right now
what's your position about undocumented people in this country though i think that we need a clear path to citizenship in
that's another example you can come up with countless examples i think and that's something i have learned throughout the course of this campaign where there's just a huge disconnect between people that are that are in positions of power and you know real people on the ground right
bipartisan support for a clean dream act is huge
and in there's there's an ample bipartisan support for a path to citizenship most people in fact already think that it exists
some way for somebody wants to during the country to gold are pursuing citizenship the quote on quote right way
when in fact there just isn't a way to do that and we most people i talked to in indiana think that they're it
so i think that we've got an obligation to start talking about that sort of talking about the sort of inherent weaknesses in our immigration system and him but more importantly to take the moral high ground on what we are doing to people who are here in they are peaceful and they are simply seeking a better life for their families you know it strikes me that the
people who would disagree with that position
the people i see them online who cheer you know people being dragged away from the families and brought out the country are people would never vote democrat
exactly so why bother compromise with that brutal an idealistic point of you know i mean in to the contrary we should be going on the offense on it we know that they're going to hit us with are already him jail donnelly in indiana with these ridiculous much thirteen it and there's all this immigration fear mongering and we gotta take control that message we've got to take control and message and
look there's there's right and wrong and we need to play the good samaritan here for for people that are here
they've simply got the wrong pieces of paper to be here let's help them get the right pieces of paper if they just want a better life for their families and and that's what we ought to be able to offer here in america
you know and that fear mongering you know obviously didn't work last year and the virginia gubernatorial election yeah that's right i mean i think that by sharing these things by taking a solid moral position
on something that is in my view as much of a no brainer as is cutting the legs off of ice and not having a secret police force that's just a brute squad to carry on a mission of ethnic cleansing
taking the taking the moral high ground on that is going to bring out new voters
know we've already registered seventeen thousand people to loud just threw my campaign alone her
long since last august
and that's i mean if those people show up at the polls it's going to be because they were excited about something it's not just because they want to vote against the incumbent or they're scared by the until they're scared about what the republicans are doing so there's snow that's going to drive a lot of people who oppose to but we have to provide a positive agenda that is based on the idea that we stand for something that we stand for humor
right so we stand for human values that we actually are going to do the right thing when we're not we're in office nobody thousand is quite impressive figure if i recall correctly the
difference between the republican democrat and when the fourteen the last mid term your was what fifty thousand something like that
in a be republican wave know what we in indiana we had a miserable two thousand and fourteen we were number fifty out of fifty in voter turn out and i think that i mean obviously that's bad but it suggests to me that we can do a lot better there are a lot of people out there that are just not motivated to vote and we have to figure out why and
get a moment so
me and i assume it strikes me to that isis totally unaccountable at this point and what do you propose we do with ice
i mean why do we need to why why do we need to spend billions of dollars
on
a again you're the sort of brute squad that is there to remove people
we have law enforcement that takes care of the violent criminals we have law enforcement already that takes care of gangs we have a border patrol
do we really need to spend eight billion dollars plus of public money on you know a a a secret police force that is accountable to no one that supports american citizens you know something like four thousand american citizens and green collar cardholders by accident
a year because they don't have access to counsel
kicks in doors that terrorizes people that breaks up the families do we really need to spend all this public money on that can't we do something better with it
what replaces ice in your mind to handle matters visas immigration things that nature well and we we've already got a system in place to handle issues of pieces and immigration all that stuff we had an ice has only been around since two thousand and three and the border patrol was very effective at keeping people out of the united states before that period of time
the f b i was very good at breaking up gangs
there are the mean these functions are already in place they've been in place for decades so the idea that ice some kind of sacred cow
they're really they're only function is to bust of families and take peaceful non violent people out here we've got for the for the violent offenders there is ample we've got an ample law enforcement answer to that yeah i'm sure most people could not tell you what isis or does one way or the other know i think that's part of the problem
that's part of the bomb us what we need we need to we need to educate them about that's interesting that you talk about enforcement being effective in two thousand and three because that's before the republican party and republican voters really started clamoring against all evidence for stricter border enforcement they started asking for a wall in the two thousands when
bush and mccain tried to pass a comprehensive immigration bill
they started demanding more money for border patrol more agents stay started using these udall races propaganda nonsense about m s thirteen gangs and that kind of shit to scare people and the time and time again throughout this the democrats have been willing to kill
seed so much ground to that position as already faulty and motivated by bad actors and say okay yes or no we want to secure the border to we want which in practice this means throwing more money to border patrol
enforcing stricter more arbitrary and more
undignified measures at our ports of entry more humiliating measures because that's that's easy for them to give that away users
not a strong and sea border you know position reaction in this country and it's all lead to this point where the republican party is now one hundred percent
for the crazies for the races for the you know
we want we demand a wall now that's that's the big thing so what should the left counterbalance position be what would an artist democrat position you know what did the democrats stake
yeah i think that the denny's me ongoing conversation with a kind of goes back to what i was talking about on on we've got to find places where we can play often some not just constantly be on the defensive
you know raised this thing of there's an army of brown people coming over the border and they're going to kill us all and prove us wrong about that
i think you know the counter messaging and a very crude sort of way should be like these are people who are escaping desperation and poverty and war and all kinds of horrible things that we can't even imagine
why why should we not help them give us a good reason why we shouldn't help why you're in the wealthiest country in the history of the world why shouldn't we help them
may i think that you know at it's core message should be something like that
and i think we've got an opportunity to to put them on the defensive with moral messaging about immigration
how we do that is i think has got to be ongoing conversation
abolishing ice is the sort of easy low hanging fruit in my view
if you don't need to gestapo to go out and roundup people to carry out this mission of ethnic cleansing and if if you're saying that's not what it is and that's not what they're doing them prove us wrong
now congress recently passed a faster with widespread bipartisan support a bill that purports to fight sex trafficking what it actually does is a road the section to thirty protection for internet content providers such as facebook or twitter google which immunize is them from legal liability for users do on their platforms now although the law does not go into effect until next year the fall out
has been immediate craigslist has eliminated their personal section reddit a website with suburbs literally devoted to selling old lloyds has eliminated sub raddatz catering a sex workers ward sex workers and others have also rubber their personal clinton been deleted from google drive opposition to says to have asked those mostly come from digital libertarians groups like that yeah fair
you send as rand paul and ron wyden the only through to vote against it widen of course coauthor the section two three language in the nineties but opposition has also been led by sex workers themselves as work will inevitably be made more dangerous for instance will be unable to that clients want each other about violent clients if they are essentially exiled from the internet services that we all use so where do you stand on says
the faster and as a follow up where do you stand on the legalization of sex work yeah wow okay so that
his i'm glad i'm glad that you asked that question i've never been asked that question before i don't think it's something that hasn't come up on the campaign trail
but it's something that i'm aware of and i've been watching him you know what i mean yeah i think that the way in which you phrased your question sort of presupposes the answer you know
we have to listen to a sex workers on and we have to listen to people who are going to be put directly in danger as a result of this act in mean as far as i can tell from people who are actually involved in that industry in the industry is not going on since the important thing about this too is right you know the industry's not going to go away
obviously just because you try to legislated away no matter how you try to do it i mean that as an industry that it's going to be there
so shoving it further and further and further underground is not the answer i think you see that from the
by and large as a response from the people at work
in that industry in we should take their lead on it so yeah i was one of those rare occasions in which i would side with rand paul not unheard of what where
i would have voted against it yeah i want to shift gears and talk more about your campaign your general political thought and what a congressman dank and and might look like are you a member of the usa no
not a card carrying member where their button on my jacket though we are cool but in the local say image that's confusing
it's stealing valor you know yeah listen
i think that they would be proud to know that i order a button hand
but no i mean were endorsed by two separate produce a organizations and i'm proud of that mean i think know it's something that we can't run away from right so i'm not i'm not ashamed that a label and i think that the he's doing great work
and i think that we should be expanding the tent to the democratic party into as a members and the us a philosophy do you will always capitalism or otherwise critical of it
i am i am critical of it in the sense that you know where we've gotten to in the united states this sort of cutthroat capitalism was hyper capitalism were capital is valued over all other things capital is valued over labour capital is valued over our children capital is value over our health and safety and wellbeing and everything else
so in that sense
if that is the way we define capitalism and i would argue that by a large it is in the united states i i say that i'm an anti capitalist in that sense or what do you believe to be why i guess as to questions or what do you believe to be the answer to that in terms of oh i don't know
anything that would not make us all give up your you know look i'm not i'm not a theorist and i'm one of the unknown one of the few i'm glad i didn't want any theorist to run for office i've met era
a few lawyers to that didn't graduate with a political science degree so
and to me i think that we've got the opportunity in this country to to have a government that gives people the tools and opportunities that they need to be able to live their best lives
simple as that and that's what we ought to be striving for and so i don't really care whether you call it
social democracy or socialism or some other kind of this i think if if it works if it's a good policy that demonstrates you know common care for people
basic core human values i am for it if capital has all the power and they have they can spend billions of dollars on the republican party and yes many people in the democratic party
what chance do people have does a largely discouraged non capitalist class have to combat that in the absence of you know mass movements real politics even a political party that is a party for the working class
in the absence of those things you know not much that's why we going to strive to create those things so i mean i guess the answer is we'll see
but we know that are not going to outspend we cannot fight on that battlefield like we know
you can't outspend hauling we're not going to be able to do that it is again that's a multimillionaire that comes from multi generational wealth so we have to pursue other strategies and i mean i think those strategies have got to be at their foundation they've got to the humanizing
they've got to be oriented to basic human rights and human values
we've got to him by that i mean we need to be knocking a lot of doors which we are in this campaign we need to be having a lot of face to face contact we can't afford to fight these battles and the air exclusively and we won't when we know we don't win if we do that
so it's got to be whatever movement building were doing through our campaigns has got to occur primarily on the ground where we're having face to face real human contact and showing people that were not the scary monsters under their belt because that's the propaganda that they are receiving how big is your campaign
how big is it in terms though i have like seven staffers and one thousand plus volunteer out the biggest internship in the history of indiana university bloomington which we sort of stumbled into it's it's it's around i believe three hundred in terms of this point three hundred years it's getting close to that
so i mean it's big and people respond to big ideas
go figure
it goes back to oversee at the beginning i think that people want a positive agenda for the future of america people want to talk about big ideas
people want to talk about revolutionary ideas
inspired inspiring people want to be inspired by something they don't want to just
show up to vote against the other guy
because they they don't the because they like him less than the candidate that they've all right so i mean i think that's that's where we've ultimately going to go and especially young people or inheriting a very raw deal right
so how does your campaign contribute to that general struggle beyond just we're going to like one person to goggles yeah i mean you know in this is something that we've shown from the very beginning is so we we don't run on the idea of of a person getting into office we going on
and ideas themselves right
say that the sewage usually ideas that we have for the future of america these ideas belong to everybody
we are backing them not because they're politically expedient but because they are good ideas
it has to be it goes back to washington has to be more about the ideas than it does about the personality of of anybody involved you still have to be able to get out in the personable and talk to people and have the sort of
the willingness to forge human relationships with some voters and perspective boaters and especially non voters who wouldn't otherwise be inclined to come out and vote for anybody
but but i think you'd have to run in two thousand and eighteen we need to be running idea driven campaign
let's say your elected to congress
for starters what would your constituents services like yeah that is something that we have emphasized since day one and i think it should be job one
a robust constituent services program is really important if we want to turn the swing districts into non swing districts
everytime i get a reporter that as you either win the super republican district isn't this district very read while a democrat in hell this district mainly hamilton held this district for thirty four years and then it's gone back and forth since then
but hilton at a very good constituent services program when you talk to successful congress people that have turned their districts in have been and now are virtually and the fetal in their districts on both sides of the aisle it's it's often because they've got goods constituent services
it's really important for where we are i think right now politically when people do sense that there is such a huge disconnect between the people that make the rules and the people who have to follow them
in and we're in a situation in a democracy where people feel so cut off from the from the institutions that govern their daily lives so cut off from the rulemaking process so cut off from any sort of semblance of control
that it creates a problem and it creates voter apathy and it creates anger and creates all this other stuff that you you see as a result and you can see very clearly in america now and so responsive constituent services program is his job one for me and it's something that is that we've done in this campaign where we've been doing
the locks own arcana trainings and blood drives and homeless clothing drives for the homeless and all this other stuff out of her campaign offices you don't see congress people typically using their campaign offices like that and my question to those congress people is why not you've got a golden opportunity to connect people with resources and
community to provide people with resources that they wouldn't otherwise have and
into just be there as a sounding board and you know so like if if if you need to get grandma so security hearing moved out by a couple of months then call your congressperson if you need help of their passport or obese or call your congressperson if you need to get your cat out of the tree call your congressperson will come and get your can have the right i mean that's the kind of constituent
services program that that everybody should be trying to build on the ground so we have a real future on the left in the midwest and in particular do you think that constituent service is an opportunity to help people organize for instance to show solidarity with the union drive locally grad students at that university yeah
i mean i think we're really just just now getting to the tip of the iceberg of exploring what those possibilities might look like you know i'm excited for my first couple of years and office to really get more into that and see what a good constituent services program can do because i don't think that by and large they have been used to their full potential and i think that are stairs
a whole lot that we can do of course our votes matter in the stuff that we do in dc matters but i think for the long term future of the left in the united states what we do on the ground in our own communities matters whole lot more your money closing remarks nope but thanks i male and a thanks for coming on and can in candidate for united states congress indiana
