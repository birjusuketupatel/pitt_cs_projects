the documentary must really doubt amazing always complete like one of the best documentaries because there are lots of batteries that there is no narration or any current interviews it was all just assembled from like stock like real news footage and yeah of that stuff was there and they had dad talked to and like people malls here's the
dang
obviously the philadelphia police department literally drop a bomb for the helicopter the yeah destroyed and entire middle class
i should have however if he is that documentary makes clear living in that neighborhood with those people like i always wanted to bomb that have asked whether he had like distended bellies and the guy was like oh it's because they'd so much in it's like it's because they want
only fifty eight hundred and fruit and raw vegetables the average averages must had diarrhea constantly and like that the same are not and seek shelter we're doing my alley balk i like the fact that the wendy's god tweets of the week came with the same it's time that there was a news article about how hyper explain when is of the
yeah yeah yeah yeah i mean when i was when he is more hyper exploitative and other fast food okay so you know when the girl
now i mean it's like anywhere else it's like wage i think they're all pretty much equal to me i they literally ran off the same model yeah but it's like you know that a wendy's has a space eat spicy chicken with fast fast samurai
the fouls only frosty is terrific but yeah it's like anywhere else like we wage in unpaid hours and just capriciously like taking jabs and giving them away
everything that a shitty him or any company has wendy's is my favorite national fast food chain yeah acre it's my go to

we're going to do that because you told no they're not they're not dating anyone in haiti have been awesome over them

okay

a joke
magic pill
just
guys
well actually this is a good place to they actually start the show because this is this is a banner week you know for people who are really funny on twitter because we're all now everyone is a real stable genius
if you can just do a riff on that joke baby and your display name it's like tons a rack up those flaws
beginning with david frum of course you said the trump is like credo
because he said i'm smart like he insists that he's smart like credo call from the radio betrays that you haven't really seen any of the godfather movies because frito is like the also rans brother who like nobody really respects and doesn't have any power that whereas trump is like actually the president
you're just saying oh he's like this character because he is bad i just think frito is the free floating lowest hanging pop culture reference from middle age shit has with
really no frame of reference for the modern era is jay leno one movie yeah trump is like saddam hussein they're all future godfather trilogy trump trump is closer meryl streep in the devil wears prada than he is afraid that is absolutely
the news bitch
a history when people i bet when someone like in late spring of two those and fifteen when someone who was like what do you envision for america and you went through his mind it was just him and like as silk bathrobe and nascar going
anderson cooper who ever told you to part your honor that way
not the smartest move your on the wrong side of forty and just dispensing bows and anna wintour
in his eternal struggle against her and and garter
and then when it came out of his mouth he's like jobs are coming back and no mexicans
then they were like oh that sounds great
we're a bunch of racists long island shithead to hang out in a trump tower in the cop playpen it so
here's the sort of hierarchy it's like okay you start with the middle age try hards like david come like trophies alfredo then you have the no resist
there have like twenty something girls you don't really not a curse who are just like trump is a trash shit bacon dumpster garbage man and hey trump euro shit ass mother clock or and then there's me undisputed irony comedic genius
our president has a big old percy
i have a lot of fun just imagining what
orgasms are like i kind of imagine the jerking off trump would be like getting frosting out of a piping bag
i think he's like is your regular railways like a star so it comes out and there's no like plato and the way i like pigs are where they don't actually each accolade it they just dribble for a long period of time oh yeah he's like it's like a lava cake yeah exactly
just lethargic the polling or huddling in like a sort of in gillies behind like a trail few way it's a while and he gets really excited it's like the last blast have already web cam
just the slip the very end
what if what if it's like an omni directional com like it seeps out through its poors she i was thinking about that i was thinking about just like his attire every summer for labour adam has nurse where it's like where it's like it they can sweats now yes
now with saying what if he didn't have a urethra
yeah he just had like a dick dick was completely solid actually similar to the platypus he doesn't have a day he has a poisoned barb
see yeah i guess we're we're talking about this because the talk of the week of course is the michael wolff tell all book
the trophy administration
no not really sure how to feel about this you know it's like everyone's talking about it people love it because it essentially confirms what a stupid shit show everything is and how dumb everyone in the white house's you know that's on the one hand it's fun to read and it's cause this big falling out between trunk and ben and they're bitching at each other and ben and just apologize which is really fun
ran up the white flag which obviously arena
you got to choose sides the literal president of the united states no matter how stupid are disconnected and comedy yes he's still fucking president he has all the connections related to that everybody wants a piece of
he's got all the suction with all the dollars or just this fat booze sweating
i i'd who who just as a website
i got a bandana in the ran and got so high on his own supply from like reading those articles that were like he's like darth vader he's like he's like if captain hook met the judge from two now
and he was like then he read like his articles that he he like commission articles on bright part that was like the new geniuses cool stuff in japan
like he was on tour and that was all right but was for like a month and then he just read comments from like boomers were like steve buried says where i'm thinking and he's like oh i could run for president kim is masterful is donald trump and then like yeah people didn't vote for steven and they voted for arnold
because they like news gossip
they like dark machiavelli and then it didn't work it's ban in you know
what happens when any to alpha males fight he was like i'm sorry and i would love to paint
jr is not a trainer is a very smart young man
your muscles are so tight and homey big j jared what's up were looking for in swore have you been doing pushups on the plane that's abandoned said because yeah whenever too strong men fight that sort of like but like in needle respect between warriors
in michael wolff though you found like the perfect marriage of writer and subject because michael wolff is like a fish face fraud of the highest or totally full of shit and by the way michael of is not allowed to travel to germany because his face violates hate speech laws
and i really did love people who have been in just a perpetual state of apoplectic
perpetual state of apoplectic the outrage the idea that there is fake news that the media's making things up against trump and then this book comes along by this guy who admits that he basically makes things up as it goes along like yeah but it's fun
it's okay it's getting to it's truth ask even if it's not technically true it's pointing us the writers are okay if is validated everything every one of these holding more and has ever said about how the media doesn't actually give a shit about the truth congratulations millionaire
they don't know yet hands around to some they are right that's the thing that's where that's that's how trump is able to reach people even though he mostly just talks about media gossip is because he's tapping into a genuine alienation from the media yeah i mean i think it's perfect like that after this whole thing of this book by this
he's like if you created in the mind dallas of an all right guy like immediate michael off would be the perfect guy this guy is known as a fabulous and just completely full shit that the day like today jake tapper had i'm steven miller
and did my favorite jake tapper thing where he just gets a guy who's just straight up lying and doesn't know what he's talking about and he's like sir that's not the truth and everyone's like i can't believe he just did a newsman smack down and it's like that doesn't mean anything it doesn't mean anything
it doesn't matter whether it's michael wall firms like probably have full shed probably half the shit and the book is is made up or if it's jake tapper who technically is like beating some dumb as an argument because
in an adamant as culture where no one follows an internal logic no one ever hours but especially not now and it's completely tribal it's just a completely master pretoria exercise their mean
the book is meaningless the argument between ban and and trump is meaningless
the slap fight between miller and jake tapper as meaningless meanwhile every fucking inch of american coastline discuss authorized for fucking oil drill yeah way of why everyone is jerking off about jake tapper owning the miller for being the wrong type of that no nationalist jake tapper who wants
during my hair came back from the dead
trump is creating the big show disaster for metal gear solid to support it
caught out one i hit bonus
well now i feel compelled to i wanted to bring this up just sort of atone for bringing up their michael off the filth and the theory or whatever it's called
q yeah this is from the the washington post today are trump this from a fourth sorry
drug administration plane would why they expand drilling in us continental waters it says the truman administration and the controversial proposal thursday to permit drilling in most us continental shelf waters including protecting protected areas of the arctic and atlantic where oil and gas exploration is opposed by governors from new jersey to florida under the proposal only one of two thousand and
explaining areas in the arctic ocean pacific ocean gulf of mexico and the atlantic ocean will be off limits the oil and gas exploration according to interior secretary ryan zinc he said the bureau of ocean and energy may make management is to forty seven potential areas where in industry companies can buy leases between twenty nineteen and twenty twenty four when the proposed
would begin and end so yeah like look forward to more deepwater horizon in the future
it's sort of like i guess an underrated thing about the trump administration and underrated a horror is like the and all the environmental things that they're just absolutely gutted it's really terrifying also there's the clean air act as well
they're expand their allowing companies to dump fucking tailings and to tributary now in a way that was banned before just selling off meant much of the national park system again for extraction industry and amazingly enough drilling and and or something that was a multiyear brutal battled around the bush a minister
they ultimately couldn't get even with a republican congress just sailed through as part of the tax bill basically nobody mentioning it you people would allow people to alaska wants or they don't because they want the check yeah they want they want they want more of that that sweet sweet luker yeah alaska is their political representation
so weird because it's like it's just understood that the us rap and the two senators from alaska their entire job is just to drift
it
and rewarding a little bit to the taxable and murkowski vote for it i wasn't as matter as i was for as i was it like susan collins because it's like well that's the that's the job for alaska
it's got to get the drifted just got a just got to get it so people like i don't get another another community center that's paid for by like no work labour it's sort of like the sopranos but everyone is christopher
i love your member deepwater horizon of course of talking about the movie with mark wahlberg
not be an actual oil spill now
you also like still the effects of that are still not even widely we weren't even able to do to assess the true scale of that disaster but there's probably some urban area in the gulf of mexico probably the size of connecticut that's just like a dead zone around but nothing is and again like effects of is so be long long reaching and
i read here from drilling also has its supporters including house majority whip steve school of santa he says with this program my constituents whose jobs depend on the energy industry can rest easy knowing that oil and gas development as a priority for this administration with increase exploration and production in the gulf of mexico and
yeah and we will be able to create more jobs and continue to receive revenue sharing it's vital to rebuilding our coasts to which i say boy
yeah and even if none of these things blow up even if nothing leaks and any of these oceans
life on earth cannot sustain itself if we take all the shit out of the ground period like the stuff that's in the ground largely has to stay there or else we will fucking microwave everything to death
but people have jobs right up until the moment that their skin melts off their body and that's what counts and those jobs are great and they're fantastic jobs and their long term they were down to the community
they're healthy yeah like look at those those freaking camps in north dakota you can't car a great time
that is a thriving social order right there it's just a birthday party every day all these guys in these fucking wants that huts all stabbing one another
sex trafficking people it's awesome yet
i think like half the people overthrow the bar in same paul or people who were oil workers in north dakota
and it made me very sad because i really like their big night out
like they're big vacation night out ways to go to saint paul minnesota
a party in north dakota began know they were lunatics because they were work to the bone i mean it's like any other industry in modern america where the jobs of five people are give the one person but they're also just bloated up with opiates for their injuries and then math to balance it out
you know actual math or like by hands or something
and they will make a shit load of money of oil is above a certain price but if it isn't they're just their estimates go completely off and they get laid off and they went into debt by an s u v but facts you a philadelphia and let the fire burn though did you guys see the local news footage from philly of
with the da's krasner just fired walking
i actually i should link this in the episode description it's from local philly news so there are like common or near the water
ours are new da's been fired all these cops and prosecute okay krasner that's so fucking bright spot for two thousand and eighteen the footage of in probably zero degree temperatures scores of these fucking prosecutors carrying cardboard boxes full of like world's greatest lawyer
pencils out of their shitty offices just trudging through the snow it's just just news rubble looks on their face honestly fed my soul and yeah is that and i get about that's how you fucking reform is just clear out the fire these fuckers there's no reforming them with these people having their job that's that's such a
good sign that he got in there was just like day one you fired
what's funny is that the local local i read an article for the choir
they said first of all they gave plenty of space for all these cops and prosecutors say rule are destroying our ability to do a job
but also they said why did they fire these thirty it might be because they pissed off his wife who's a judge like the process anything outside of just petty fucking personal vendettas there's no real like the idea that a guy who campaigned and wholesale radical change the way that they prosecute crime in the city would have to fucking fire people to make that
happened just doesn't even compute play you have to fire people who is like entire lives and careers are based around the exact opposite of what he's attempting to do in criminal justice system
yeah i they saw coming i bet they did but still you know i bet a lot of the looks on their faces at like they're like we're talking a thirty year veteran of the da's office you know i don't know what's a good filly shit had no nikki casts of widowed
and he had a look on his face like maybe up and so on and he had put your stuff to one of those cardboard boxes he thought that he could like you know
yeah out as this guy to worry about it
oil furnace and it's fine
i do you want to talk about
a little bit more serious and i want to about the the profile the very long
profile james rise in that was in the intercept this week matt you read it it's fairly explosive can we talk a little bit about that peace and important well he talks about his his personal genes rise in as he was your times is then i have sat here and order reporter for them during the bush years and
he got the he had access to the fucking essay spying story that was later confirmed by edward snowden in two thousand and four
before the election and
he was not allowed to publish it essentially by the new york times because they were told by government officials like michael connelly the rice that it was too sensitive we were at war we were saving american lives and so as a result they couldn't talk about it and for over a year they stopped him from public
pushing this this information until he basically force them to by writing it in a book
that he had contracted outside of the new york times publishing empire basically the situation was it was either going to be in a book a room know why the hell has in in the newspaper or it was going to be in both and they eventually blink them they publish to make he got a pulse for it
but only after being stopped for over here from he publishing it basically because the government as the bill keller and those people nicely
and the asian me is like i don't know whether it would have made a difference in their twenty two thousand and four election however would have had some effect and the conscious choice that the bush administration
demanded that they not publish what the new york times were complicit in i think putting a film on the scale for that election but the funny thing is is that they actually thought of it the other way they felt like publishing it would have been influencing the election and therefore it was more fair to not publish it because someone who is because
first thought was that one of the people who was a source might have had an agenda might have had a political agenda and so it would be not right to sort of help them by publishing something that might change the election but essentially what what he details in this article is that the government does
have veto power over what the new yorker absolutely and it wasn't just say story before that during the run up to the iraq war he he had stories that that called into question the accusations about weapons of mass destruction in iraq and ties to al qaeda and the that were largely butchered and spiked
and none of this was anything like the situation where there was a threat of legal legal action there was never any suggestion by the government that it would be illegal for them to publish the stuff they just said it would be bad will be bad for america be bad for national security and they bought it and sometimes they lied to them for example they gave them the idea that that
they were just collecting data nobody was leading emails are listening the phone calls which was a lot
but the one thing from it that really stuck with me is after the whole thing was over bill keller reflecting on it well you know i didn't want to publish in two thousand and four because the
america's
this the moment everyone felt very scared we were very worried about terrorism and we be trusted the government to stop it what's this we and then a year later but or two years later
by that point bush was in the toilet nobody trusted him the edge kind of come off of that that post nine eleven hysteria and so he said and so the atmosphere is different and they could publish it and he said i was happy i'm i'm pleased with my decision to not publish it and then i'm pleased with my decision to publish it because the national me
mood had changed which is basically saying that they're too much too cowardly and too worried about getting yelled at essentially to go against a presiding of mood which like what what the fuck are you if you can only trail after changes in national perception you are literally doing nothing
the second bush administration is very interesting as opposed to the first because when they talk about this national mood changing what they mean is like basically around circa two thousand and six was when
sort of elite consensus left the bush administration
they gave up on right and the funny thing is is is is basic premise you'd say well yeah ok maybe maybe bush is a champ maybe we don't trust them anymore but aren't we still at war we still facing all these threats isn't possible nine eleven around every corner and we need every mechanism of the national security state including this illegal wire
tapping stuff to to combat it well no because if the president is a champ and an incompetent to let's an american city drowned or whatever
then the thought of him being in charge of protecting us is too disturbing so we're going to revise down the threat that we think we're in it's all in our head when we when we when we trust the president and it's a significant threat because we trust him to protect us from it
but if he's a fucking idiot and a clown and and incompetent than the threat can't be that big know
about the fact that he was then after the bush administration subpoenaed for his sources by the obama administration well it went through started under bush and then it went through to obama and it was all part of this one whistle blowers that really took up the second part of the bush administration or than really intensified under obama
and one of his sources was sent to prison over it
and i think that was the most interesting thing that popped up to me and as someone who as will will remember because he was to was sort of a young resistance lived during the bush years
according to rise in the thing that changed the government attitude towards leaking which used to be there be a leak and the government kind of shake their fists but they wouldn't really pursue finding out how it happened because it would involve this really dicey showdown with the press the could end up looking bad pr perspective so we didn't really pursue
trying to force government officials perforce force reporters into revealing sources
then patches fitzgerald's investigation of plane gate
changed everything according to rise and he says that fitzgerald went to hog wild trying to find the person who leaked mallory his name to the to yeah and so he subpoenaed a ton of reporters judy miller actually went briefly to jail if people remember that
and that sort of set the tenor and then everything was it was different after that and to me that was really resident because i remember routing like hell for the plane good investigation yeah no i mean i want to fight with the plane good thing because i think it's interesting because me personally like matt was obsessed
during the bush administration and i thought like this is what's going to bring him down yeah think this is why i have an immunity to like the russia stuff now because i feel like i've had that illness before and now like my immune system is built up and the idea was that i was so
intent i added that the prospect of karl rove going to jail for a leaking state you know cia agents name or something like so tantalizing ask me that i was willing to essentially look to be delivered from this nightmare the bush administration from a fucking federal prosecutor like patrick that
again
i undertook a rather nasty assault on the freedom of the press yes and the idea that judy miller went to yale is of course likely satisfying because she should be in jail
oh yeah for her awful prewar report aren't of that's also an attack on the press judy miller is a rotten person and should be punished in some way however it's know it's like this patrick fitzgerald they was the prado people who have sex fantasies about robert more yes absolutely and james call me that the indictments came down i remember this
whether the indictments came out in december
and people were calling it fits smith and they were saying merry christmas online
because he was fitzgerald and it was christmas
christmas and people were so fucking site they a little pellets and so it's the same thing as the rush of thing where you're rooting for the fucking this this government apparatus this law enforcement machinery and the fucking c i a like carrying that of a officer got fucking got unveiled
that that's to you a horrible fucking miscarriage just i mean people remember if i can fill up the seventies i mean if that had happened under bush and you'd be rooting for the government to kill him or something
generally like those years like made liberals like more mentally deficient because right after nine eleven i would say like pretty much everyone except barbara lee went along with the mission in afghanistan and for most people who their default is not giving a shit about
foreign policy when there's an opportunity for you to get mad and have a vendetta and be very serious and get very emotional thinking about the brave soldiers and thinking that there's actually some good and evil struggle where you can side with the most powerful military in the world and it's good
it was very calming for people to do and then iraq and i would say enough democrats went along for along with it that this generation of liberals they couldn't
criticized the concept of or the concept to them either
the myth of like the liberal dove has always been a myth and america
they've always going along with every major intervention but this was just the one that did it for this for this generation and so when the time came when like the post nine eleven love of bush wore off they they couldn't hit at him at a moral standpoint it had to be like oh you were mean
oh you didn't disclose these documents properly or oh your daughter's like to get drunk
just the most fucking sub mental mind numbing lines of attack and the plane good thing like yeah i don't think they should have disclosed the undercover agent i mean i think you should just blow the cover every
once and fucking give a shit
but it's like that's the thing that's the thing about bush that you'd taken down that that he blew the cover valerie plane not that he killed these two million people and now you see the rebate now it's like people are like oh you think nothing happened with russia it's like now i think like russia the greasy is
entry in the world besides maybe ukraine which is why i support them in their struggle against them
the radio shack of countries
i think like they probably did something weird with the rush of people donald trump
but in the face of everything else i don't fucking give a shit give a while the real damage is when you end up
looking for some sort of procedural way out of out of a disagreeable administration by rooting for this apparatus of state that is persists long after
any given presidents gone and does way more damage in the long run that is the real the real danger in fact one of the people who went to the new york times to convince the matter to report on the center say stuff was fucking james komi
got a ladder
shiloh eyed man all right he got shined up because he was when when obama appointed him f b i director one of the stories a got put out was the he was one who stood up against the and essays by it said it was fucked up but then a few months later after they did it anyway he was at the new york times selling them not to fucking report on it james caan a can i just say how much i can not
can that mother fucker
big lurch dumb ass the trucking brill cream statue shit
like every to every fucking ever since he got fired this guy spent like four decades framing muslims for like yeah trying to assassinate wall
like all his agency does is like send some fucking long island shit are some mormons sociopath to go on i c q and find any thirteen year old most on to go head you want to do not eleven we do it every year and you can take part in it like
when they say yes going oh we stopped him we stop nine eleven who just one of the most egregious evil agencies the guy that runs a child opponents are not some ministry and this fucking is fucking scumbag he's spent his entire life throwing people in solitary confinement forever for the rest of their lives he gets treated slightly unfairly
once he gets fired by the dumb ass president and he's obviously like even if there wasn't this whole back story by that you would go into whatever seven figure gig at like a law of or something or just make speeches called like the justice of honor at the fucking foundation for remove in riyadh and
he gets treated slightly unfairly maybe one one millionth of our he was treated anyone else in the world either at the f b i or his career as a federal prosecutor
and all he does now is just make people take silhouette pictures of him against the sunset and going
when the times are hard
good then must be great
and it gets fifty million recruits the underlying thing to play a game was that value claims husband joe wilson was in fact right about the spurious nature of the getting uranium from africa what african country was a nightmare nigeria
and then in my head have been so obsessed with it like i thought like the war on terror administration like the troop kiss is like this is too much people are finally going to really realize the hypocrisy there they're exposing to danger one of our agents he's supposed to be fighting the war on terrorism and a god
that's embarrassing out because you know like felix said if i had that knock less like mission impossible i'd gladly egg all of you
okay i see it like you see them every little thing like you know now
the us navy is like the amelia delia of military branches like they're just getting lost all the time and it's pretty funny
but every time they get like
things where they've been lost in the persian gulf gotten lost in north korea despite one hundred trillion dollars being spent on special computers for them to never get lost and people are like donald trump weren't you taking leadership on our members of our military being in danger
it's the same everything words we never interrogate this idea that we have so many boats going around the world that are supposed to scare people that they just crash into each other no it's the donald trump didn't send their families a card when he's like sorry
the gps fucked up
you know i've got a lot of for on boats
larry silverstein let's just say we put the eiffel tower the hudson
they want to do that call he thinks we have let her or visible plane yeah how the fuck is he going to fix all my three much after he would love that
never never know what's going on inside is an invisible yeah like wonder woman of jeffrey actually don't know okay jeffrey we're not doing that never with the sailors like when it were up in
iran is water is and they have commandeered and they gave them juice box of shit and people were like dave humiliated or chef
they may they may sit down and drink juice boxes while they waiting for their parents the competitive mother
yeah those sell it looked like they were at his sleep over at like someone's they like fills asleep with gum and their hair and got over their clothes and the iranian kids like here is where our close
that level of humiliate that was the mole with the us navy lost its confidence and just started getting lost all the time
it's it's you to close out this week's show i want to get to this piece that was one of my favorite things that i've read recently this was right before the new year is a profile done in the new york times about the latest trend that is sweeping the valley and all of the smartest people in the world of course of talking
about the raul water
movement
what is for all water you may ask is basically untreated water that is now being sold for like sixty dollars a gallon some of the most gullible shit heads the
in the new york times this is an article by nellie bowls from december twenty ninth of last year headline unfiltered fervor the rushing to get off the water great now keep in mind when you read this article though water grad we we can be very critical of the society we live in society is
bullshit as fiona apple and thirty i'm world and bullshit world is blackjack
our civilization is evil however i feel pretty confident saying i think what are the things that we can be proud of as a civilization is the fact that basically well in most parts of the country
can turn on a faucet
and get water that you can drink and not die the fact that there are so many parts of this country that have bad water that have will added water like flint and countless other means that's bad that's something that we should fix because it is genuinely a miracle of modern civilization that we have created this network that allows access to this life
so that we don't shoot ourselves to that again is welcome to life hacker those weird faucets and dreams you have in your apartment they're not just decorated you can use it to clean the dirt off your disgusting nude body could even wear a bathing suit if you want or you can put it into what's called a cop and drink it
you don't die
has been life back so because like this is the thing that all it needs is more money and more investment it doesn't need to be reinvented it actually works if we would just fucking funded free mother fucking watershed to jail you buy new favorite person on the internet so keep that in mind
maybe even taken for granted the fact that you can turn on the faucet in your house and have water that you kid wash yourself with you can drink you can cook with it it's right there and you can pull it out on the ground it's just leave him one hundred and eleven knock you out
freeze it and put it in any other beverages here's a little easter egg if you got what's called for skin
dip your penis into a container of water and clean the land that baby mac pillow back just you take all the out you know the gun in there you can take it out daughter
buff that hard
sanford okay in san francisco and the valley there's dammit different idea so ridiculous
reading from this article it rainbow grocery a cooperative in the city missing district one brand of water is so popular that it's often out of stock but wouldn't recent evening there is a glittering rack of it glass or containing two point five gallons of what is billed as raw water unfiltered own treat
id and sterilize spring water thirty six ninety nine each and fourteen ninety nine per refill that's my lady arbuckle took a bath

nothing that overwhelms the flavor profile
thirty nine a shift manager at the store bottled water is controversial we've curtailed our water selection but this is totally outside that whole lotta it's a glistening orb yeah here on the west coast and and other pockets of stupidity
many people are looking to get off the water grid like we said that amazing thing that allows us to like live in have like a clean yeah easing society anybody gets to do it the thing is these people are violently opposed to any kind of social good they hate anything that everybody gets because
they're not special remember fucking il en masse talking about how awful public transportation yes you're surrounded by just anybody
give me the other they hate that they're special perfect beings of genius and they should not have to drink the same water as every other fucking sub normal club that they have nothing but contempt for the hogs the fucking future cattle that they just want to basically turn into batteries and oregon farm say down enjoy any sense of kind of big key
immunity air collectivism and i and i hate the idea of community in the way that it's normal years but the fact that you can get on a buys and basically look around and see sesame street he said one or two people sounds like piss is like an actual wonderful human part of living in an urban center and these people don't like that part know they want to be carried around
a jet propelled little crystal ball everybody can look at the end of the shuttle around the town in there floating author or other little water or floating through thousand so everyone could look at the would be like that's a special that guy knows how to cope yeah yeah
musk felix i didn't see that you've uncovered the fact that not made out you on musk is a rockabilly ilan he said
whereas paper he said
i've never heard him speak so i'm just going to do an approximation of work but he sounds like a sort of a south african dracula
like
the next to a supercharged frustration for tesla
we're going to have waitresses on skates and they drive in movie theater and minds poodle skirt
and like you know switch flick knives
he on modesty is going to colonize mars
the colonies just going to look like a big jukebox
and instead of having a solar cycle because it's dark all the time a big robot will go up to and hit it will play like one of the classic fifty look like the rock and roll nick down it'll be he's going to live in rock'n'roll mcdonalds and when the big robot the big mac hits the juke box and plays a song called like oh sweetie baby will never run across the train

he shares a malt with sex robot pretty those on the i robot wearing like a cherry dress and has really big yeah which is betty page bangs but they're not built with policies like the only way you can reproduce is if you rub girls elbow
the you transfer your your comment to their robot uterus through there and create android children who grow up who are just born with hard parts they come out wearing davy crockett traps
a rock and daddy thinks her great and me
they start creating your misbegotten android child who doesn't know whether his duty is the moment machine or man
amaro on android baby and your my human queen all never ever become one with the great machine

another thing that's enough to it
mosques martian colony is a store called another the store franchise of liquid eat in a water store that opened in san diego three years ago
waters store on are still would eat in the lake in the garden of eden god was located so heard of this whole water filtration process and i put florida in it and adams like not going to trick me i'm going to drink from the dirty tributary
it says a liquid even eat in offers a variety of options including fluoride free chlorine free and mineral electoral eight alkaline drinking water that goes for two fifty a gallon
well what if here it's share is a weariness of tap water particularly the fluoride added to it and the lead pipes that so if it passes through they contend that the wrong kind of filtration will lose more beneficial minerals even traditional bottled spring water is treated with ultraviolet light or ozone gas and
pass through filters to remove algae
hi alex
right away
why the toothless hillbilly stereotype exists
fluoride in that water and they lose their fucking teeth before their forty both of my grandparents had dentures in their early forty's you have a lot right as good as our what was are the scream amber
or their ph level of a were better than whatever you say that but once we remove all that helpful algae
they say these filters
they kill helpful bacteria pro by addicts in raw water
sauerkraut you down
it's water
you have three older there's a talking about your can achieve that i love going to a restaurant and having tap water munich
sir
there is none of the algae or raccoon
i usually enjoy on i know the owner that everything my attic now and know everything should be probably i live a robotic lifestyle isn't averse eat fish shit every to keep healthy but off but the off grid water movement has become more than the fringe phenomenon it once was referring
the john birch your the nineteen fifties and general jack
what i love about this is that these are the most sexless
super optimized linked in human beings but in practice through the same as virtues who were the coolest
yeah either the same as the people who were like
you'd use are putting jack paar on television and a third of day with his wink
here are more than the fringe phenomenon it once was with a sophisticated marketing cultural cachet millions of dollars in funding and influential supporters are silicon valley
one recent morning in the hills of berkeley california cody freezing the founder and chief executive of zero mass water was inspecting water collection panels he had installed for his investor skip battle a long time tech leader who now sits on the boards have linked in net flicks and open table
this is a sort of thing that collects water from the atmosphere
solar panels which i guess is kind of cool if you're trying to live off the grid and general but like you know as a consumer product and you shouldn't live off the grid
live with people
oh a this asked how it will never be as good as that one oh my god so good ok
people want to be big ted so bad
that nobody can touch and here's our absolute king
yours are things really get mr battle poured himself a glass the water from the just doesn't taste quite as refreshing he said now is that because i saw i come off the roof and anything from the roof feel special
it's rough water
you know that classic thing where you're like it just tastes better if i founded on the roof everything's better off a roof what's what's this great rotisserie you're making oh it's this page in that film
her chicken
that's why i replace all the plates of my also spanish style from my roof
this guy saw the movie title
cat on a hot tin roof and was like that sounds delicious
or it gets really really good this is a call back the most prominent proponent of raul water is doug evidence a silicon valley entrepreneur surprising after his juicy and company to cerro collapsed in said
king those i remembered you sarah the yeah
five hundred dollar juice machine that literally does squeezed
his his company collapsed because it was fucking stupid
you had no reason to exist then he was exposed for that like so many of these other shit who will like you know the blood baron herself elizabeth battery two point oh
we'll never suffering a negative one realizes they're coming back without you sarah personal responsibility to lead on the next morning and i finally figured out you sarah like that the why they thought that it would be a machine because they only drink juice they'll have pellagra and they don't have the physical strength to crush it themselves
you wrote him because he went on a

pero yeah of course grass
the thing i'm going to run out now it's and getting back of my axe elizabeth
that so after you sarah collapsed in september he went on a ten day clan hunting nothing but live water i haven't tasted tap water and a long time he said before he could order raul water on demand mr evans when spring hunting with friends this has become more challenging lately the closest spring around san francisco
those recently been cut off by latin slides
it means crossing private property which he does under cover of night
just get given merc buy a property owners so you have to be encouraged us to off of a leaf
you have to be agile and tactile and be available to experiment he said literally you have to carry bottles of water through the dark i want to see like a david attenborough documentary with a view that cool night vision they're like this is now have a silicon valley
he's approaching a cactus to get its do he moisture
clean water source i wanted to see this be the new metal gear solid just replace the beloved big boss and solids their characters with a guy that invent stylists is
i won't mention them as it is is i do you think we have like a human desire for struggle and these people don't have your frankel baby and said it's plugging
ruling the world or anything like that they create
weird survival fantasy in their hand with like oh i have to get to the good water
i will never die if i drink it you know if i have the roof tar and bird shit
will never die so you've already gotten juice zero and a lot of of silicon valley v c bullshit let's let's bring in another utterly repellent an awful cultural phenomenon into this mix you ready for this at burning man
that attracts the did your roddy and others
evans and his r v make broad fifty gallons of spring water they had collected i'm extreme about health i know but i'm not alone with this mr evans said there are a lot of people doing this and me you'll never know what you run into at the spring what i find interesting about this is like these are like california ideology silicon valley utopia and they're burning
man this big hippie love fest in the desert
the core of all their beliefs and like their obsession with purity and taking hello series is extremely reactionary there's something very right wing about all this is hitler youth or something absolutely back to nature it's it's you can try and or as other this
like roof so in understanding of what period he is and it's like no science brings you here
well yeah it's like the teutonic myth
yeah so i am drinking from a mountain spring and the poisoned by the june
we lessons or wagner the entire trip to burning man
i love and year ago wagner pod cast the found our underlying water
the founder live water new can sing started selling spring water from opel springs and culver oregon three years ago but it was a small local operation until this year marking material is show mr singh original name christopher sanborn sitting sitting naked cross legged on a hot
spring ways in south asian now exactly is he will do the reverse bobby june
sitting naked cross legged on a hot spring is long brown hair overflow okay you guys going to see the yukon know it's right here i'm here is mccaw here
here's christopher sanborn a new concept
so it says here pure water can be obtained by using a reverse osmosis filter mr singh mr sanborn says real water should expire after a few months
think about that
this is a problem i've never had with water
is it supposed to be a durable
be i know it's literally one of the most chemically unconfirmed substance
that is available in law that's that's what happens after the man's strips down
real water that is a dead rat
sleeping like he went enough
don't have to shoot your water
oh wow
he goes
pope water
it's i'll water
the curse that have all the nutrition
my mom used to leave all the pebbles
to be so it all goes real water should expire his does it's these most fresh within one lunar cycle of delivery he said oh my god
on the moon
ty rocks that sits around too long it'll turn green people don't even realize that because all their waters dead may never see it turn yeah i want that water like why don't i don't want to get typhoid
i want i want to get of fucking boost his bath water sold to be sold to be by a guy with ask league pair though ti who had the my seventy dollar water to me you know they still have a have have a powerful magnificent cycle
either way that's speaking of the word cycle i am dying to know this man's insights into menstruation ember another good ember you ask about oh my god this is beth
you mr singh believes that public water has been poisoned tap water you're drinking toilet water with birth control
there's nothing more than a lotta i need that
i love that like knowing where disgusting for the birth control draw it's like i said these guys are all low key reactionary yeah yeah like they're just missing there's one degree of difference between these people and the triad cats people want to live in the hobby
no anti society modernist it's just yeah well i'm in silicon valley has often been accused of trying to bring bad feudalism and a real piece of evidence for that as their insistence on trying to bring back medieval diseases yeah well one of the interesting things like you look at how now realized he couldn't actually developed the countryside as quickly as they want to you
it was like
well can we can build a hospital here but you can use traditional chinese medicine and like what's that i don't think there's learn to your grandmother used to do this yeah okay your leg it's writing off but there's a type of lizard and you'll be completely fine and this is what people try to sell to poor people when they either
two or find themselves unable to provide them with the support of modernity and now instead we have board rich people deciding to cause play as medieval present ship
i hope they'll fuck and like big dark because like edmund burke used to say that like there was a value to rich people accumulating wealth because then they were able to display at the people in a way that was aesthetically pleasing and inspiring splendor that everyone could enjoy even though it was controlled by just a few rich people these mother fuck
don't want to do that they just want to recreate the lifestyles of of a fucking like a shack dweller in mumbai or something like that they want they want to fucking its soil and shit their guts out from fucking chunky green water it's a deranged fantasy that has always been fallen the upper classes during times of
of extreme wealth inequality to where they both kind of fantasize about this bucolic pre modern era and also try and make an elite so it's unavailable to actual poor people
they knew the victorians when they were gonna shove corn flakes up our ass so that we can stop a retard cousins
rough terrain and ideas about health because they had this generalized
kind of anxiety and alienation because they like another child got eaten up by an industrial live in my factory today but it serves more corn flakes
they're not least because john harvey kellogg reborn yeah they're only social engagement is going to special parties were like them and they're rich friends eat oysters off of each other as pot bellies and oh i feel weird all that
a problem is that i have like a bad humor
could somebody just makes my room temperature
they pour down my urethra
but if that's the way if all you want to do is drink pond water
he fucking soil and paste you don't need a bill him finish it just take all of their money they told me that
here's mr singh says it addition to the fact that tap water is has birth control drugs and room he says core mean and on top of that they're putting in fluoride call me a conspiracy theorist but it's a mind control drug that has no fun
mind control drove it has no benefit to our dental house and then in parentheses it says they're in the article it says there is no scientific that all right
i'm control drug but plenty to show that it is dental health so then it goes on where they talked to actual public health experts who are very disturbed by this new trend with good reason
i'm not because normal people won't do it if i got a great i got a grand bargain for these mother fucker it's not even like the vaccination staff it depresses it's true it's it doesn't hurt anyone else which is good
so let's make a deal give them all of the bog will her and run off that they can drink and then we take all of their money and we use it to modernize the water infrastructure for everybody else and get all the lead out of the pipes and give everybody else access to clean drinking water dead water
rygel of the out of all of the out of the all over the acorns that they want to it's a hell of a bargain yeah so starts to one more person
vanessa
commercial of emeryville calif who says fluoride it's a deathly toxic
escape designed for large tech companies he was said she was in early a doctor of raul water and no many of her clients following suit their health conscious people and understand the bigger picture of what's going on she said everyone's looking for an edge new tropics bullet proof coffee better a water
as the health benefits she reported include better skin and the lead to drink less water my skins plump her she said and i feel like i'm getting better nutrition from the food aid see that a lag gives you a nice nice blokes level for you shit out every
you know it also makes your skin plump for when you drown in your body stay still lake fertile with it
my friends who drink spring water when they come over now they're like oh yeah give me the good stuff said amanda thompson or writer in san francisco the consciousness around water is changing
this is all real estate
however we live in is truly historically significant and i hope to jackson leaders lives long enough to write about it
in the same way that he wrote about the hysteria of the upper class victorian what's this all boils down to his buddy poisoning
these people have been poisoned by having too much fucking money yeah where the only solution is to take it from nuisance for their own got yet all water is such a nascent business that there's debate over what exactly to call of liquid daniel vitality hosts the pod cast really wild yourself that promotes hunting for food and gathering water it's
guess that the hunter gatherer lifestyle
why after africa troll billions of dollars of assets to do this shit
what's it called again reviled yourself real wild years and says he prefers the term unprocessed water which echoes the idea processed verse own processed food i don't like raw water because it sort of makes you think of raw sewage said the service
grier has a ton of now
there's no way that's nice fucking when you say live water that's going to trigger a lot of people who are into physics and biology
alive
the article that has taught us how people on earth are going to be excited by your branding opportunity
so take their money it's the only way to stop them from shooting their guts out of the covert it's acting on it
fix itself
yeah but not if they keep hearing about it
pass it on and i hope they all get georgia but like the problem is that these people are extremely wealthy and have the ear of politicians and are quite powerful people in our society that i think are going to try eventually to disrupt our water in transportation infrastructure i mean because at all hundred another and
won't be a luxury item i mean yeah i mean that's true but at the other it has it's own budget benefits because it would probably cost a trillion dollars to fix america's
pipes nationwide at all
all the can just tell people to drink out of the sewer this drink out of drink out of the gutter as a good laugh at your house get along strong yeah no i think your your reference to now is the correct one where it just like we realized that like when we know we can sit by can't mean we're not going to spend the money to upgrade our infrastructure provide clean
drinking water for every one of the country so you just discover some ancient secret about live water and just tell everyone to drink out of fucking rain puddles massively anyway
