
hello friends it's your job for the week
just me and virgil a very and everyone else is off off or memorial day paying their respects to our great monuments in this country now rushmore the hollywood sign
branson missouri
it's it's version of an eye for the show and and just a little bit will be speaking to you are david ferris about his book it's time to fight dirty which is his political strategy for rat fucking the republicans out of power through procedural life hacks
are able to hack the constitution and our form of government to hopefully this power the task or eight when goals that we're currently ruled over by
for then of virtual and i were going to give you guys a little update online the see well behind the scenes or a media that we did earlier this week that i think you guys may have seen by now
oui appeared on a jesse's world
oh no that's the jesse water show it's it's called ventura boulevard just say no we went on former minnesota governor and awesome muscle man great movie star chris kyle widow owner jesse ventura is our key
on russia today yeah we did compromise that we did active measures and we got to appear on jesse ventura show our personally i am a huge fan of jesse ventura because of his film work predator and the running man or easily two of my favorite films of all time
but oh jose chung's from outer space or my favorite episodes of tv of all time so just he is has touch my life and a lot of ways so i jumped at the opportunity to come on a show even though it was a rather surreal experience
so apparently jesse host the show in minnesota had his basement or something we didn't at an undisclosed location so when we told people were going on jesse ventura rochelle there were like oh that's awesome you got to meet the body are just see the governor you know and were like no we didn't even get to see jesse ventura it was just literally
a voice in our ear as we sat in a room with a camera track we can even see ourselves yeah there was no monitor we were just talking into a black box one room during this camera reposition itself as if for an alien
singer and this guy puts these era pieces on as a thick russian
that was the funniest thing because i mean a another reason i agree to go in jersey show is because i wanted to go on our teenagers because i think it would be funny because it would make a lot of people mad and i think that's going to get recording this thursday so we haven't seen any of the backlash of yeah
real phone will be fine but a chapel trap house took seven million rubles on the chest ensure a program so versatile and i we meet in our keys i'm putting in quotes your green room it was not a green room not just a break room for their employees there was coffee and water but no treats
for home so we're waiting there in this room and they're wouldn't get your and in the chair is it about five to the top of the hour whatever this is probably one of their satellites yeah yeah i get to the analysts should have a teamster looking guy herds us into the into the kill room where the
the all seeing eye with were scanned or scan us and capture russell's so this guy gets it
rough teamster guy gets us in there and then begins men hand when nurse and threading microphones through our shirts and feeling are feeling or i saw of mine on it
last week so we get the earpiece
in your ear and i've never done like a cable news hit like this before and when it is this sort of like it's it's pre tape so that wasn't that nerve wracking that would be going out why but there's this huge sensory disadvantage when you're in studio and like the host is elsewhere because you can't see them you can even see yourself a seemingly
they are watching everything about you they're seeing you pick your nose or sweat but it's just like all you're getting is just a voice in your ear even though you know that you're supposed to be talking to a camera and it's it's very odd but the funniest thing was after he got the your piece in the sort of the voice who wasn't jesse's who has been like okay we're on in three
whatever han ethnic russian accent and it was just like google could be a good sure
boots appreciate your work undermining democratic party
pleased to do propaganda for a comrade boots thank you for helping take it down
russia the greater and me near it and
take down strategic capitalists mastermind chuck schumer so yeah but that being said the the actual interview was very fun just use a joy to talk to i did get a chance to talk about running man he agreed with my assessment that we are living in the running man
he also said before he was just very china you with us and he told us this story about how when when
he did wrestling he had to have a fake name because bag of those these heels were real heels yeah attract
which i think find you and can kill you
but so fun jesse just he was great to talk to i'm really hoping now i mean again the other reason i did as i'm really hoping to get jesse on our show would love
are the interview was like five minutes it was just like a rapid barrage of questions like reuse just like so virgil till be about how who work at a lock the documents
it's just like
really quick here again a very very surreal
so will
our kids eat the democratic and republican party
a week or why do people like you is it because you talk about real issues
so again it was great to talk to just see it was like a blurb and i love to get a chance to have like a real a longer sit down an actual conversation with the former governor to talk about his career and wrestling he was one of the few first people to try to unionize w w f under vince mcmahon it didn't work but i mean i would love to hear about some of
the early days of the world wrestling federation i would love to hear about the set of predator is the fact that he got his you measure it or he had his biceps measured on and they were bigger than arnold's would love to hear about owning chris oh
so would love to get jesse ventura on a show and really going to try to me i'd also to hang out with it seems like just a funny i don't want to go to the compound in minnesota
he lives elizabeth thief paisley part
so are are so yeah just jesse ventura is grey jazzy please come on the show
i guess now just to move on and introduce this interview were about to do again this guy is david ferris he's a professor of political science and i suspect this in you will be interesting for some
one you out of time we are going to engage in the sin of electoral islam and reform islam by essentially engaging with the idea of electing democrats or investing in the american political process through an active voting perhaps some of you will
be offended by that
i think it's an interesting topic of conversation and it's worth considering even though friends of the show host of the show would regard this as seeking procedural problems to political solutions that being said i think the book is interesting and at the very least lays out a few planks that i think
i would really like to see democratic politicians at all levels of government being put on the record is now
as supporting things like a new voting rights act the up things like packing a supreme court statehood for the state of freaky see in porto rico
slam dunks yeah the these are good thing is that i think like you know broadly from a liberal to left wing wave you can and should support you know there's a moral imperative buying those things are going to get like and what david's book is really about is not not just electing democrats but like how to change
the inherent in equities
the structural of stretch your biases that are part of the american political system
to make it possible not just you pass progressive ledge or left wing legislation but to make it possible to even do that in the first place and i think his argument is one worth considering that the even get to the point where we can elect nice socialist leader is that we all love and support and believe the thing same things we do we do
you have to confront these terrible problems that put any decent person or anyone with a conscious in this country and an extreme disadvantage it magnifies the power of as reactionary forty percent of the country that's totally fucking backwards and magnifies the power of the capitalist ruling class yeah absolutely and so
we're going to talk to david and you know why you know listener you might not agree with moralism you might think this is reformist but i think what we can all agree on is you should absolutely not email us about this
i did not contact us to say that actually and our corporate way to go and eleven years though i were not listen and
agree absolutely i mean i think again that is something that abroad
liberal to progressive left wing coalition can agree on own email us to complain about the show
so onto our interview with david and then another reading from our own book you may so
oh david harris with his shirt
com's roaches persecuted by your government
some of the talks are intentionally you manipulate the truth seekers who become discredit if they disclosed
in


okay so joining us how is david ferris is a professor of political science
roosevelt's university and the author of it's time to fight dirty how democrats can build lasting majority in american politics
we can as this conversation goes on maybe push you a little bit on whether anyone should desire the democrats having a lasting majority of american politics however the one thing i think we should begin with and agree on is that the republican party does represent a clear and present danger to all
human civilization continuing on the planet earth
you know you have another term years the girls like grand grandkids are going to spit roasted
oh fire and it's not going to he wasn't
so we're gonna we're going to get rid of him was just like begin with
the baseline of like what the current political reality of america
despite being massively unpopular you have a minority of people a political minority in this country that represents let's say between twenty five to thirty five percent of the population that now controls all three branches of government most state governments just basically has a death
grip on all the levers of power and our government despite being massively outnumbered by people who would not wish to see them in power
it's hard to disagree with that assessment
you have a minority government
they've come to power through sort of conscious manipulations of electoral procedure this combination of or two hundred and thirty year old design flaws
you know there's not a time we can do about it
the aggregate
it's very difficult the left again
power in this country because they're start off every election at a massive disadvantage
some of these problems
better that to be pretty ruthlessly exploited and pushed further other contemporary we can earn it and you trace this meddling back to gingrich in the republican revolution
yeah i think that gingrich was one of the first people to reload
if you what very vocally and openly
your opponents than call and like slimy and discussed area
a horrible human beings that that that hasn't impacted
but i don't know it wasn't gingrich
executed this year
doesn't and it wasn't getting rich white design always voter id laws that are that are suppressing it wasn't direction
the phony disenfranchisement stuff so there's all kinds of their terrible things that are happening in american politics though
they started with gingrich but some of them started record thomas jefferson to yeah well
the us said it is
undemocratic institution but under the ground tomorrow morning but we're stuck with it
so we have to figure out a way to work around somebody is flaws
the next time
democrats are and or and you know like the most obvious manifestation of this is the most recent example of the twenty sixteen election in which the person who received the majority of votes in fact lost the election but not only that democrats receive far more votes
in terms of actual voters for the congress and the senate yet still are the minority party
i mean that you know that's the impact of our to our rules
which which to do matter and really so the fact that california has thirty eight million people have the same to senator is this the seven hundred thousand people my armor is absurd
democratic theoretical standpoint and that's how you end up with republicans in control the senate
many many books and you know when you add them all up we will get to your plan for california which is probably the most ambitious thing that you lay out in this book but it's not just that you describe
these like you said these flaws in the constitution that are exploited by the republican party
flaws and our electoral system and the rules for congress etc to exert their will and an undemocratic way but it's it's it's more than that in that the republican party as it's currently constituted really doesn't see the anyone who beats them in an election as a legitimate
yeah form of government a don't regard democratic presidents as legitimately elected or should be treated as such
and they also they don't recognize liberal jerk
some records as a liquor as equal to conservative original it's jurisprudence
which is which is a real problem because if you look at some of the rationalizations or why their guts to steal america and see it on or you're right
read dimensional you're going to it and rip an asshole
oh i read the national review quite regularly sir
just are at worst but they were like oh look we can avoid this person of a supreme court because barack obama judicial philosophy with it
that's not obvious decisions or deserves
and so they've been acting for the better quarter twenty years since two thousand election
as if
he didn't democrats out of power justifies just about any escalation
normative way or even formally it's been abused
should be obvious early really long time that the republican party is the single most extreme political party an entire democratic world
single most far right political party and intent democratic world they are not a centre right party by the standards of any comparable democracy know to do it off the map in a european parliamentary to marks one where it matters
even some of these european far right parties
your to loose in the netherlands
these guys actually believed in a social welfare state
whether a terrible reticence but they're also way
after contemporary terms of economics there is no other party in the entire world
super races and
reduce the modern state to its industrial show you know let's compare to what level of public spending
that is really unique and a world i'm pretty sure good viel viel dies or whenever believes in the social welfare state for exclusively for people with jet white hair and who never wear socks with leather shoes incidents
i mean i don't feel like it's the current events little lot of people or the same sort of cartoonist look
social network effects now like so you know
eric these legislative and progressive policy goals that i would say are broadly shared from liberals to the laugh that we all should have had this idea that we'd like to make him more just equitable less screwed up society like things like single pair and what you're saying is first and foremost in order to do
those things basically the republican dragon the dragon energy people will have to be slade and the way they have to be swayed in a effective manner is by instituting these waging what you call the same kind of procedural warfare that the right has been so good at in terms of force
their agenda on a country that like i said is the majority of which opposes what they believe in so to get to the the media your book which is this strategy your plan for like six things the democrats can do to keep power and in doing so awfully make
the kind of country that we'd all like to live in a big ask is of course that the democrats regaining power in the first place which is an open question at this point but that's again for the sake of the book and the show let's assume they do
assume that there is a democratic president with full support of congress ready to go in two thousand and twenty the first thing you say you should do like the first piece of legislation that you should push out his statehood for dc in porto rico and then splitting
california into six states which i said it's probably the most ambitious thing that you describe in this book and the only thing that actually wouldn't need simple congressional approval to do before you get to the california solution just you just described briefly what is the moral and procedural case for dc in puerto rico
coming full fledged states i'm in i'm in both it
everyone is born in dc and there was an american citizen
and no urgency and work or legal representation in congress
which is just unjustifiable reasonable just called democracy should work
you know for the case of you see that to go out on all kinds of different ways risk
it's straight items out of a and budget
you know people are arrested in dc end up going to federal prison system right away it's nice to record or we go over the last year has made it really obvious to me
why he made a state because no one in dc has to answer to the people of puerto rico
and even you know
our politics are not perfect but like if if if we go have representatives in congress
you know somebody could lose their job when the federal it doesn't respond to a category five hurricane prompt chest
thousand people die so you know order he goes in a kind of a legal limbo it may have been sort of like one hundred years which is there a territory state a long list of debate in porto rico about what to do about the
and i think that there is real momentum for statehood
since this like comically i don't have a comic is it's tragic but this horrendously enough to response to hurricane
i think it's it's it's just it's easy the case to make you have people don't want to be
one to be part of the union
don't have real representation
and there's just you know to me is no excuse for not really go into the and it just does appear at like moral ethical imperative that these people need released from their condition many a drawing rights
really should have been on day one any procedural being that this would be for new senators in the senate basically yeah i mean like you'd to slammed on senators dc it for sure yeah
it may take some time for it politics to just shake it up quarter rico
a political parties that are not democratic and republican you don't change pretty quickly at the front of the union yeah and it's hard for me to see anything but like a monumental way an election that we don't get to send it was out of order to go to so i'd like to set of the books dc important
i've been made ten years ago democrats will hold the senate right now on the other gems would have been flipped and the trump administration books functionally be over i guess except for got dodd frank was democrats
confirming hospital as well tell me this so you talk about statehood for dc in porto rico but why do you have against glum
nothing there's actually nothing stopping us from making guam and that us virgin islands and american samoa
i'm going to entertain but all of these overseas turret british that united states i actually think there is something in the virgin islands for stated i mean the constitution doesn't have a minimum to wrestle
so anybody to be a the matter of whether the people what they are want to stay and i think that we could do out here
oh i thought he can be a state he started to see where we go because they have active statehood were mentioned these other places don't they didn't
when i wrote a so i went to senators from the bikini a tall
yeah so so that that's dc in puerto rico like you said they're active statehood movements people like you know eleanor
horn homes norton has been pushing pc stated forever
the california one that's the line that's like turn of the most eye popping
a recommendation you make which is make california into six states
then we get be fifty eight states in america now we'd have to make room on the flag and i am worried that would be the main objection to this republicans be like you really want to change our flag
but he just got this from home depot
but what about california is so unique in that lake in really cries out for this because i can really is did california is so it's the fifth largest economy in the world it easily swing california sits around the elect acknowledge it sits around the electoral college
one of the most blue leaning states but yet it gets has two senators what describe your plan to make seven six or seven states edit a california yeah so be seventy seven states yeah i mean it it's a unique situation
was is the largest city mean you know it's also one of the most this point the most sort of left wing stakes in the country so hillary clinton one that the by thirty points
she one orange county
which which no democrat had one since of the are so it's like this then this long term transformation of california
from a contested stadium to dig deep democratic stronghold
and because of so much of the progress of energy in this country is in california
a lot of it ends up getting all build up at least the two senators from california
telephone it clearly does not have the same kind of structural our and american national politics
why almond us
it's just a problem with it
and if you look at the senate even you can do
in porto rico only do us part of the way there to parity and set it this probably thirty one republican going extinct
one of the democratic leaning sticks it in a neutral environment or lose the senate more often than we win it
that's a problem
public policy is going to get older inexorably to the right cycle of just just cycle
two out of every three elections or it's a problem and so
equal representation in the senate as luck
it's written in because student with a special provision that you can't even if we wanted to amend the constitution to make the senate equal we can't do it because we have to have the consent of the states are being deprived of equal or up in addition
non starter like the constitution is like the news on this question and so we'd have to get created about work rounds and i did
there is both like will just go case for britain california an artist and for it
a drew maps and the book that would have created seven states that voted early also don't know states will still have access to the pacific ocean i can all be economically viable and i think there's a case to be people awkward and also
i think that the federalism was entered was designed
to give people access to your up to a government that closer to them
than the national government and particular indicates california which to start a million miles away from d c
oh here it's because there is a lot of restaurant and in california
about state politics lot of remoteness of sacramento
and so again it's a kind of thing where i might actually think this will be a good idea
i've sworn it but it's also it's also artisan marble i think you can't count on all sorts of us me and democrats all the time between ten and fourteen
yeah ten would be to acquire where he mentioned as isn't he do say that in the past if you would proceed the same plan it would not would be almost guarantee the it create a bunch of republican leaning states because there is a lot of california it is extremely conservative you basically the way you draw the lines is that your bases
making states and of like the seven major cities in california in the areas surrounding him and it's sort of you'd have to be very careful about how you draw these lines right i mean like we this require sort of a kind of gerrymandering yeah i mean it is dream and are going over there
again it's larger if you think about the predicament of the planet
determinant of democrats national air are the left and nationally and more broadly i really think of justify to request because again it's not unconstitutional was a procedure in the constitution
states out of existing states
you need an active of state legislature and an act of congress i could also and this there's you're obviously near the consent
sworn it recommends is like jonas over their heads if they don't want to lead a lot of is doris burke
but you also say because if california has this weird quirk with their referendum
system where you know any referendum can be put up for a vote like that would be the sort of the into this is get that on the ballot hey do we want to create seven states of california
they would actually they had the california would have to vote on that but i mean they voted for arnold schwarzenegger governor so if i recall correctly i'd have to look this up after the show but there is an initiative on the ballot bankrolled by an eccentric billionaire split california into three states but it's polling very poorly like four to one against yeah
i like to divide the ideas and look into two camps you know there's like low hanging fruit but i think that be accomplished and month on
and then there's stuff that's like it's like an ideological project have to pursue ever over the course of the number of years southern california it's falls in the second camp look like i obviously doctor gets is can happen and a first year it's more like an open up a conversation
the idea of california in some way shape or form benefit to benefit the to hurt and recorded them but i think just the go next month one california we should not count on a happened
even they didn't have his first term there could be the you know i'm thinking it through there could be an incentive for state legislature legislators to support this thinking oh all of these new federal seats are open now
gov an english and in the california state has suddenly you look in the mirror and you see what you know
gov
sacramento governor of san diego
suddenly you're a presidential contender but as your governor and sort of a state legislator know and you can instead of to have been to run against six other people they could all these senators
so everybody
everybody gets
so yeah even know myself and just start i could see people in the california state government like really really dumb and dumber
the real problem is people in california when i tell them this idea
look like
you're out of your minds
and when you try to tell me what to do it my state like you have the other thing would be like every one of these new states created south california with each have more people in it than almost every other state in america
it made also quite large yeah i know the be huge states now you mention like a possible retaliation should the california plan ever become a reality would be to republicans to do the same and break texas up into a bunch of different states hoping to get the same share of their newly formed senate seats but you say that like that would be a little
bit more of an iffy proposition for republicans would be a little bit more dangerous or or harder to predict for them to guarantee that they would get like a dozen new republican senators him as a couple of
the texas texas is trying to give me the opposite direction
or a success is trending purple
and so breaking up texas really goes the potential of backfire republicans
because of the temple it's sort of demographic changes that underwear and a state of texas i don't think it's a swim stir in the next decade
moving much director and if you wanted a great texas up into pieces you know unless you want to stick like austin san antonio dallas and houston into the same state and had a bunch of bankrupt
you just can't you can't do it without a couple of democratic states and most adorable loans and get a couple of extra republican senators also older and it muscles would be worthless
the state has to do
there's also a really strong sense of identity success
i think this would not that i don't necessarily in california don't mess with texas
okay so the draw boundaries now moving moving on from from this like the next the next pegging in your platform
one that is my i think personal favorite
his court packing good old fashioned car packing adding more justice to the supreme court and creating a whole bunch of new federal judge ships as well
obviously you know i prefer a pelican brief option for the current supreme court but barring that again you mention the constitution does not mention how many judges need to be on the supreme court
f d r try this could you talk a little bit about
his core packing plan how it ended up and how your plan would be different than that
yeah sure i mean first of all i don't want to go we're going to call it and against court appointments
yeah i mean we'll all remember the of the arthur
i was losing administration was losing his work he until the new deal or being struck down by the conservative supreme or
trying finally won reelection and thirty six with his tower already has like that will spend the rest of our i was dreaming about muslims and congress
couldn't get it done and so you know what's what's the secret were
it would it would add a justice to the court or was everybody that was over seventy
time either
six seats sprint or i was six camera somewhere
it was age based you don't get editor you all people were going to justices the record
ultimately is democratic allies in congress bought like we're not going to do this is too disruptive
i think one thing that's been lost a little is that his allies in congress were willing on what when
what it out and fewer than five justices to the court they said no because it would have been it us to destructive but democrats and cars were really were willing to record just not
is exactly
and so here again we had a case where we have a conservative government it
that's completely roads and it's not just the seat it's it's six of the last presidential elections are democrats one october and those election
the for the senate since ninety two democrats won't thirty million more got us us it so it's like the american people have spoken they want democrats studying the federal judiciary and one thing one of the bank republicans for when they when they did the girl and thing
i don't think they really torpedoed any remaining norms or informal expectations about the supreme court should do people speak or nature
and so here's a case where it's like it's it's not it's not unconstitutional to expand the supreme court
democrats get to see if they get to see it's ticket to see it's
you know
he didn't even know we want to which so two four six whatever whatever it means to do to get a liberal majority i'm a supreme court because so many of the other problems with our political system including ocean untraceable classic gets dumped into every state legislative race in this country a are
all springs from were terrible decisions authored by this circuit court like i have not bereaved day and minds i realized what a liberal court majority country has been a death grip of a concert
or since the nineteen seventies like since i was born and so again
something were to do its constitutional it would be perceived as horrible it would be horrible
but i think that the circumstances really justify
it would be hard ball but i think as you play that i mean this current supreme court and you know the decisions that rendering i my opinion is intolerable situation for anyone who has any hope of a better quality of life in this country and they they are fulfilling the goals of
the all memo from going back forty years you basically erase all the new deal erase any any representation for workers to challenge their employers or seek redress of grievances this is just a massive shift in class power and just slipping away like the last thread bear
vestiges social welfare and not only that but like should a democratic congress pass any kind of progressive legislation you can get you can guarantee that robertson course it's and has spent waited their entire life to find a reason to declare something like single payer healthcare unconstitutional yeah absolutely
i mean you've read the constitution and so i mean we're we're one seat on the supreme or away from the new your or terrorist
i'm not convinced that roberts will go along with it
i'm not convinced he wouldn't years but when kennedy or any of the democrats does earth
we're looking at it real
a real judicial last year
because these are people that really like all they care about is the original constitution but actually in an era
oh really
oh but he writes in corporate or in the preservation of white supremacy it
so you know their stuff that we can do about this
in the objection is what about the listener and i'm like no
the escalation already adams your we're living through it
we have a lawless administration them
right now a governing the country
this the store they stole this you in court
so why not returned fire like the idea that we're going to come back
republicans were like oh on so so sorry
so so sorry about everything we've done and years it's delusional you know we have to come in after played herbal though it is you know it is hard to imagine a new democratic president wanting to spend capital on this contentious fight right off the bat instead of thinking okay well just wait for someone to die
the problem is it's a lottery
under this lottery system or people you know people from outside of the president's party
it was appointed by republican will have incredibly strong incentives to hang on and all or don't recognize their their grandchildren and anymore
they won't step aside because those are those are the incentives that the system that we have such you
on as long as possible until you can be replaced by some good hearted and so really what would be waiting for his
yeah or a serious illness and there's no guarantee that will happen i mean clarence thomas doesn't look all due to me but i have no idea you know no not as president trump so
when the
when he died we did some research into antonin scalia and to be honest the fact that he live that long is fucking incredible so again you can't count on any of this stuff and also sorry notorious r g b fans maybe she should have retired when she had a chance
she's know your and that you should accept yeah don't want it to him
and prior to i mean that also just like anybody looks like over sixty so i stepped aside and twenty thirty and while democrats lot of the sun and the democrats should have appointed some sort of like doogie howser known at her legal
eight as old as well
elements
the other thing like the age thing here you mention that there's a sweet spot that you have to aim for between like you know old enough to have experience but not too old to just be like a crypt keeper like do all but also getting rid of lifetime appointments for these judges i do that too
yeah in the book
why not offer them a compromise let's amend the constitution let's get rid of us but once and for all every president would get in there to acquaintances sprint or we could actually spell out advice and consent obligation and so it can spike one nominee they spoke to nominated and like three or whatever like the procedure think about it
but republicans going to say no to the just not going to happen
so community
one hundred percent are just hose
about the horrible where it's not just the supreme court but you can also expand just records the appellate courts you can create new ones
because them done in the past
there is a workload problem
some of those words so and then there's a i than the other day about federal judge appointments at this point in the obama administration vs this point in the trump administration and the trump just been like full steam ahead he has gotten in like three times as many people as obama even tried to and they are all like people who know
ass dogs for find our street magicians you know just like absolute lunatics and monsters getting in these lifetime appointments that are going to shape han this country until i'm dead probably and only i'm not even that
will be an office and so on
nearing retirement
and one of those republicans to last two years they are one of those shirts and they held up
term anyone
so they were hundreds of sentences on earth when going to authors and so you can be able to do you for years what it took obama eight years to do with just a flip partisan control district court after just district court order to to or
it's all perfectly constitutional dependent on on republicans or balls were you have to and six basically and hundred and sixteen
and so again all of that behavior which was really transgress little in terms of the expectations of american politics
they just because you know a further escalation
and then people who worry about than us the next escalation
so we're not going out of democracy it to worry about if we don't do stuff over the next few cycles know well that that is when this incredible to me but the idea of like an get the obama administration again they absolutely should have gotten rid of the filibuster when they had the chance and had some sort of a legislative a legacy to it
even get dismantled by the trump administration but they didn't because it was just all about the the friendship and comedy of the of the senate and just like this idea that like oh one of the rippled okay one of the republicans going to do in retaliation it's like they're already doing it so i don't understand what this this fear is about like oh man you know her
republican party think gets really crazy and out of pocket it's just like it's already there like what what do you where are you afraid of what do you think is going to happen by i don't know
giving it as good as you get and mom's it
around when they were you during the dark were arrested
the beginning of the movie
it keeps you sent a radical islam regarded spoke external was like you're only making it worse
yeah
okay to get any worse
i can imagine things getting much worse than they are right now
you know we have a couple of other communities that when our next two cycles don't you know
that we really are
russia road of what it's like a sure and dumber it it's not real it doesn't have any real content to it it's just it's just you know ruled by the wealthy it work for the wealthy using every procedure else was able to them
yet now
real quickly like the the the last few things that you talk about his first electoral reform and you talk about changing the way changing the winner take all form of elections could you explain that sure yeah so we rent one in thirty five separate elections that also works that those in this country and they're all decided on
when our so you can win those elections were forty percent of
two problems with this one is it leads to leads to to autism was one of your findings the lot of political science
you both agree on is that this system leads to fewer major political parties
sixty percent of americans said that they want a third or or twice when they go to
in our our electoral system really going to get sick and start
one problem
the other problem is that what thousand and twelve democrats one more votes for the house
and yet did not win the house of representatives and people estimated that we need to
the houseboat nationally by what get between seven or eleven points in november to take control and that's because of things like gerrymandering
democrats
republicans in a partner
democrats cluster together and city hustler i don't have a single republican random chicago where you know
no i wouldn't know where to find you know everyone i know it's a leftist but that's a problem for drug district
so there's a reform out there
or spoke recall sarah
instead of having a single member district
you'd have three or five member district
those people will be elected it earned the right choice
so that you know you could vote your heart with your first wrestler vote for the working families green party however and
person doesn't when you're going to notice them redistributed get away
your second choice
it gets your vote
so it would avoid know what's happening in california right now are democrats themselves by running she going to canada it's and the stock to armor insist on this is where this is another case where ranks spreading
oh
it would eliminate your and you couldn't germany in germany now
so german and will be gone like just and songwriter and rotors anymore
it's a former proportional representation on the idea that you know the percentage of a political party guts should in some way shape or form translate roughly and to the percentage of the and that's like my will be going to back to the right now and again
whether we prefer the us not on the constitution
so you could fix it with a simple act of congress lot of the them and then it's gone and the wholesomeness transport and i think americans would really like the system that comes out of the us or five art isn't august
and people would no longer feel like they have to folks were already that doesn't really represent what they believed
i picked another thing that contributes to the decline of the system people are really sucked out of it yeah i think it also contributes to i mean that gets to the the last thing which is about voter suppression but also voter turn out like what you're describing also deeply demoralize his people and from the electoral process
you know there's there's a really inspirational going on and a lot of states right now to restore the rights of exponents you are deprived of the right
sticks to get people automatically registered to vote
to get rid of some of these voter id laws
some people don't realize is that is a clause in the us constitution gives congress the right to do whatever they want to the state procedures for federal elections so all of these things are are something that to be wiped away with a single piece of national legislation
called the modern than exotics
lol voter id laws that are designed to suppress the already
it could create automatic voter registration so that you don't have an out like complex bureaucracy to register to vote we just are registered
create a holiday for federal elections what wouldn't you know a lot of things that would turn out because like ninety million people set up with sixteen presidential election
in a lot of that was because the candidates but a lot of it because there's just there's so many different where is that people are prevented are discouraged from voting and this country and it was one thing we know about those ninety million people that didn't is the
is that are less educated or less well off people will open you know statistically would vote for the left and higher numbers and the road so to me this is just it's like a slam dunk it's another month
you come out with expensive piece of legislation
six has a lot of these problems that you saw activists in virginia
when they were i was like a hundred seventy thousand stones and then magically democrats on projections
so it's another thing and i'm not i cannot believe that this wasn't addressed the last time darker and so unified power and you see it but you know hopefully we'll have another opportunity and i think it's really important
because when turn out goes up you know the origins of the left to go up to think it's pretty simple i mean virginal now we're discussing
some ways to not just
increase turn out for the a left wing population but also to let's be honest suppress the votes of people we would not participate in our democratic process so i always thinking just blaring rap music and all polling places would be a good place to start
a literacy test you are read a monologue from felix and you have to identify all the sound cloud reference any references yes some sort of like a new form of literacy tests at the polls but based only on the type of shit that like felix is really interested in i was thinking voting by snap chat filter just on election day there's like a
there's a snap chat filter like republican or democrat you swipe which one you want they get a lot of young people out there
honestly i don't buy the cost of mad men
yeah kit
something christie it's told i think you should have to vote by a starkey sub tweet voting voting by kissing booth where you are present but a member of your sex so you vote by kissing someone in your vote counts more if you kiss longer and more passionately voting
with
bathroom makes sense
oh virgil you also you also mentioned you only get the franchise achieve a victory ray allen fortnight that's why idea i also think that before you vote you should have to officiate an interracial marriage so yeah they are or you know i also i mean this is my
a radical suggestion here i don't think you should be allowed to vote after out don't know sixty five like as soon as you start collecting so security it's like you should have the best most generous pension provided by the government a top of the line healthcare but you don't get to vote anymore because it's sort of like you're just you're running out the clock now it's not really your can
we're so your opinions or less valid is that people are gonna have to live in it for another forty or fifty years why like jack's idea that everyone in the planet should get to vote for the american president except for america
do i think we've lost that yeah absolutely
it's not too much laugh but like i do you want to get we've we've gone through now the strategies that you lay out for keeping in maintaining power and making it possible to achieve the kind of legislation in society that we'd all like to live in however in reading your book like going through this there's this idea that
the democrats have to take our take back power to do any of this stuff but i'm wondering like in reading this book i felt like it's sort of the obviously the republican party is what we're concerned about because they control government but in terms of actually implementing this strategy
i was struck that it seemed to me that the biggest impediment that is the democratic party itself as it is currently constituted on an institutional level and i'm wondering what your thoughts are about that
i mean i agree and disagree to a certain extent
we've seen a lot of in instruments i'm an early since two thousand and seven
you know that done one hundred percent
two thousand and two
thirteen onwards it's gone
there's some people are still there
you know sort of a policy center at a party has been moved left
and a lot of ways that's that's what a credit due to the to the standard
and i'm starting to it
but i think that there's you know it takes a long time to transform apart from the inside
so a lot of these older folks who are committed to a different way of doing things you to different economic model
who came of age during the clinton era you know they just have to be pushed out of our they are they have to be successful each hours and receptor terrorists and
skinner take time regressive left is not winning every single day they engage in right mouse
but i think that they are really reinvigorate a i've never seen them
and i find that really hurt me so you know i guess i guess what i would say
the democrat like right now the democratic national go russell change in this country it is really aren't on
i think there's some people are going to go
you know seventeen ago
as a lot of people perceive to be and center or when to old institutions and norms
you just don't get it
i think that they don't get what people do it everyday people
this country
what i do think that would be better off under a democratic government and we would add and that
we can simultaneously try to make that happen
hold people accountable wants to get into artist minutes in its day stray too far off the reservation them which aren't them and emirates get much more aggressive about just like republicans have done
you know what i'm thinking about the last relationship organized labor
you know they work on this project and two thousand and eight remember god and so does the kind of you know that's the kind of policies
what the real trick air is maintaining engagement
don't laugh beyond the election itself so when we get know if and when we get into power and when when man we can't just do an article like everything salt because then you're going to see the parents are that democratic i'll just as to slow sort of a snip the money on when and motors like walk towards if if we don't hold him accountable we don't get the right kind of others
it was a long answer that's now i mean when i was preparing for the interview are today
i just came across peace in the the washington post
by jeff stein about what happens to what happened to new jersey democrats when they ran on a millionaire attacks and then got elected and wouldn't you know it they're not so hot on the millionaire attacks anymore so their husbands or tags enough as it is
but like the point you're making the book is that like the republican party really is the body through which this demon known as the conservative movement occupies and the democratic party is really not a political party has such is more of just son of a collection of different interest groups
jockeying for power pudgy so the delineate a little bit more like the actual difference between these two parties and how they operate
i think at least this century
what you've seen as republicans have been transformed into like a european style parliamentary party
that is there an adult
not the rigidly committed to going out about what gender you know to the point where they can't even joe to raise revenue to closing attacks loot or
originally written or spoken crazy going to drown them
and so that's very different
don't it
which is which is i think is a coalition different groups who work together to sleep
who don't always snare sort of policy preferences across the issue is it's you know
teachers' unions and organized labor color
students and young people at an unwieldy cause him to try to get on the same age about always the change
one that's encouraging to me is i think the data is starting to reflect
you know the people in congress and move into the last you know it's there to the left or where they worked years ago
more or less than that works and years ago
because republicans are the their long march where they are older at the farmer
i think a lot of people are skeptical albeit what we've been in this country has been so the democrats to march after the fire rough
but i think that there's a cemetery is not just in terms of artists or or comprised of them
or artist act and and power
they're still too many democrats were going to do so
what they originally him in an office and what oldest reward us bipartisanship and it was like no know going on at all
and in fact it just uses the democratic base and frustrates the democratic
i don't think that that's come out work as strategy and don't want them to go out spite of watches
republicans have not read and on a policy you know but i want them to start acting like a parliamentary block and or same weather oh yeah but in order to could get to that point of moving like if our goal is to move the democratic party to the left and not just annihilated completely as i suspect many of her listeners with dear
hope for you you mention it they it you know not to relive the litigate the sixteen primary is will all be doomed to do until the earth
just fries itself and the oceans boil but hey that's our bread and butter on this show is endlessly related getting the democratic primary in the beginning of the book you outline sort of three broad strategies in this ensure liberal democratic debate about where the party needs to go the first should be the british
anders model of appealing to working class voters with the more left wing populism should have more traditionally democratic socialist message the second is the centrist route which is about peeling off moderate suburban republicans and independents who don't like trump and like sort of bringing them into the folder
persuading them to jump ship and the third would just be like two thousand and sixteen as an outlier just keep doing what worked for obama and o eight and two thousand and twelve and just doubled down on the you know this idea that the demographics and the youth of this country are just inevitably tilted in our favor i'm wondering
as a political scientist
why is number two on this list the strategies even up for debate after thousand and sixteen election
mean in my mind it's not i mean i don't think it does message is having any reason and spoke with the actual democratic worse
just message just largely
mark
although new york
who are terrible rhetoric and and earth
responders or so
also what actual owners more
i don't know how these things
but if out there as a potential strategy
it is sort of embodied an actual electoral strategy is really oh man
super adjust your barracks were going to be able to pick up a lawsuit
i don't think you're actually seeing the when i'm suburban districts
it's not happening
on it
couple of months ago
and we saw no progress when in pretty good republican suburban counties
or districts and
which is evidence
primary voters and not necessarily seeing a strategic choices
an arm
and i don't see anyone in the real like mark and molds
in primaries and then again in order to the general actually i'm going on
is nowhere near that kind of creature is the center and erratic imagine that should be yeah
i mean but there's a lot of a procedural hurdles to clear if you have a more open democratic primary process them in there are still a lot of these procedural hacks that are these locks and dams through super delegates and close primaries and things like that that our hands stringing a more
progressive or left wing democratic party
yeah i mean i don't know what's happening right now it's shocking to earth still superdelegates in the system
i hope that getting rid of them as article compromised
you can we want more people in the process i also picked up we need to talk seriously about getting rid of
which it and this is a way i just like a oil rich misread it's like you get to get rid of superdelegates get to get rid of august and we all agree to have open primaries
i think that that's reasonable compromise because the caucuses as cool as they are
what's cooler than standing in a hazy will see him for ten hours
i said what's cooler than standing in a high school gym for ten hours
and who doesn't have ten hours
so i think the goal should be like let's get and more people involved in the primaries
on the philosophy that the more people are in the primaries
better candidates will get more other watch like the actual our preferences of democratic or so to me anything that gets more people out and armrest and so we should be working ensure but but you're right i we do want to reduce the ability of neat inside the party to direct to direct outcomes
it's the way the politics works for a long time i think it was uncontroversial until recently but i also think it's it's totally out of stuck with voters now expect a local targeted you know you don't want to have a party structure
at all like a party structure that able to disaster and erase era pursuit
i don't get that any brewed remedies democratic voters want
and the party to out as much power
david ferris on the final note of what we all want to need my last question for you
wood burning of one
yeah you here for extra year and here
after out myself as as a as a need support from the cause my asthma
yeah but i had less him off
this you know his overhead
come to jesus moment election
in retrospect you know that
should have just believes the polls
so bernie doing better in the general actually i think there's a real argument in it
voters saw something and
didn't see any other candidates
remember back into sixteen when i walked in the classrooms which are sold it in interrupts
and they all loved bernie sanders
scanners and that it's evidence that he is speaking to people who want to different objects
in a way that hillary clinton didn't
he has a cogent see to go to the ideological lot longer than any other democrats locked
and i think that he would have been much better oil
sort of like galloping corruption what we were seeing and attempt administration so you know there's no way an hour for sure
when they would have a lot of stuff at him
but again i'm i am yeah
i think you were on david ferris the book is it's time to fight dirty available in bookstores now thank you so much for joining us david
here is by
and no a reading from the book of chap by the book i have selected this reading
it is the introduction to chapter kids live in which we outline are the statement on the problem with the american lip so their dive into this this chatter begins with to epic graphs
what did the rules to you that was so offensive to the republican party senator i'll tell you what they did the rules got women the right to vote the bras got african americans the raking over the rules created so security and lifted millions in elderly people out of poverty the rules and it's segregation the past the civil rights act the voting rights act the rules created medicare
liberals past the clean air act and clean water act that conservatives do they oppose every one of those programs everyone so when you try to hurl the word liberal and my feet as if it were something dirty something to run away from something that i should be ashamed of it won't work senator because i will pick up that label and where it
as a badge of honor
those with the words of presidential candidate matt santos as played by jimmy smits on the television program the west wing
followed by the second paragraph
if the rule you followed you do this of what was the rule
anton sugar no country for old men
okay
no our own words
pretty liberal do they not bleed
of course will bleed all over you like a romanov a second cousin
do they not like us prefer things to be good rather than bad in some very general sense yes
and as the first paragraph above lays out do they not have a record of popular legislation to their name
to be sure and boy do they love to bring it up
why then do we live
the essential problem is not that liberals are as bad as conservatives but rather there is a giant sucking void at the core of there being in the place of real beliefs liberals have guilty consciences in the place of politics they have a democratic process to assuage those consciences the process this process
pitts tepid reforms against the deranged and revenge just right wing with no such inclination towards consensus or incrementalism despite its claim to the mantle of american progress the liberal algorithm produces positive social change legislation only when pressured sometimes terrorized by militant and or
popular left wing movements without an organized and popular left liberals and up negotiating themselves into oblivion moving the country inevitably to the right
if you're of the millennial generation and even slightly left of center liberals in the democratic party has been the only game in town as long as you've been alive your parents most likely protesting the war and support of the civil rights movement and have been patting themselves on the back ever since
but the litany of bold progressive legislation liberals always point to is at least thirty years old and it's been eroded by both republican and democratic government since all those great liberal achievements have been systematically dismantled both by the right who made such destruction their mission and democrats and liberals themselves
who believe they have to innovate their ideas and moved to the center to win elections
your parents slightly considered themselves pretty radical and they were your age they were known to enjoy good vibrations solid wages backed by union power a college education that cost a nickel and the ability to go to the doctor without selling their car to pay for it but since those days americans jerk to the right and so liberals had to do the same in
order to win elections and keep the country for moving further right
this is the basic liberal mantra and it's fitting that it takes the form of an excuse it's end result is a political system irrevocably weighted towards the forces of reaction coincidentally by almost every metric you are poor and your life is more precarious than your parents were at a similar age get over it snowflake this book is your purchase
a patient trophy
unfortunately the eternal wimp out shows no signs of slowing down these days there are two kinds of liberals those who vote for democrats because the alternative is worse and those who get teary eyed at the thought of supporting cory booker are some similarly phony slug the latter are just moderate republicans and should be written off completely the former
sir deserve better and probably have some misplaced attachment to the political tradition of standing up to the right wing
these poor souls can be spared the chop or reeducation center with our patented liberal veto treatment but only if they even by the lessons in history laid out in this chapter and inform on their parents to chop oh central committee
that is the introduction to the live chapter in the chapel guide to revolution in stars august twenty first sounds like a book i like to buy
you'd be crazy not to buy this and increasingly all of the information need to buy the book can be found a chapel trap house dot com which has links to booksellers where you can pre order the book well that about does it for this week so virgil it was a it was a pleasure hosting with you without the rest of those riffraff cutting in oh your
your and a gentleman and scholar thank you very much you are a cat and a dog
more of a kappa
so next time by by scientists have yet to discover own room
self consciousness
let alone how the human brain processes two dimensional images in the three dimensional phenomenon known as perception yet somehow reason we declare seeing is believing
your scientific illiteracy makes me shudder
and i wouldn't want your roots
i'm telling anyone the to saw anything last night
