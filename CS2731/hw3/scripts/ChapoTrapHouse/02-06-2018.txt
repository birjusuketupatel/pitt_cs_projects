yeah well you always keep on board in the chamber
no gun
so i've been hearing this question quite often
and i heard in a lot
when are you moving out so i'm were you turn to and for segregation and cover okay
i keep getting asked a question how does one get increase her nickname
you lost me oh how can i come off with greece your neck game or what kind of a nickname should i use what should i call myself give you as a cold hard truth about this the way i know it to be and how it happened for me and pretty much everybody else i know this thing is this cats
that's right
agree or game is given to you by friends your crew your guys the jets
all get nicknames because all of us sooner guy and very much nicknames
in the way we got our games was either for something that we did or something that we were known for so they called me of the guy was always trying to grab his girlfriend's wrist but didn't call the it's always been neatly big bird because of a necklace that you wore you found a dead bird
he took all the bones out and cleaned them up and he drilled holes through put all the bones any add the school of the earth hang on this necklace and we thought that shit was fun
so then he got the nickname
heard he was also that
another i mean i chose the game
call him the seamstress english
school team is loves his frankenstein engineer
lucky was go back to europe
one of the gaming to be knighted well that that guy some good advice it's like you find the community in your neighborhood of guys who have been banned from places bird leaning with one foot up in yeah trying to enforce segregation yeah that way
my nickname was a dump of milk shake out a black person said at were worth yeah but this goes cool
is a limb and his buddies
that serial killer his dark triad buddies are representing serial killer the asians and high school
is a little club called years so my young buddy you know he was known for taking his young cousins and tongue wise to them so they would hurt each other
eyes go go shoot so we been do guys be and cats actually a guys been cats will mark barron officers catalog he does what kind of looks like one of these guys you know if i sort of their they're like older sort of
their mentor like you got a crew of high school and he leads like the doc brown to the high school researchers have today like you they go they go to old man maryland's house and he tells them how was that many gives them jesus you are you and they get sleepy are you think what i'm thinking do says wild prestige tv series mark marion as
as the boss and mentor starring start like the head rockabilly we're going to have to use a big stars were going to have to get a young viewership
it is going to be little pond little is going to be the head rockabilly okay we're going to get around certain things with that and
i'm head writer obviously everyone gets the cameo you're going to be the malt shop owner hell yeah
quit lawyer that at my shop kids yeah they're always going to take your big cashier hall of thirty five cents which you
the biggest amount of money you could make that is a zoo pixie go out the door a turtle window will actually he mention that the only way you can get greece or nicknames is for have your boys given to you what are to so let's give each other greece or nick that yeah great joe felix just because of like some shit
it's funny to me and the crew were to call you create jack okay cool
hey jack double meaning crates
okay so it's i mean you're known for but it's also something that the dumbest pieces of shit in the world would think would sound cool
so you can just call virgil over watch because rockabilly don't know what that is because they're afraid of pc gaming they're afraid of computers generally
computers they just ushered in an era where no one rumbles anymore that's where they don't like them but these guys they go on a computer and there's people calling them an asshole and they get mad about it they're lighting three cigarettes at a time and studying it out on the monitor and fucks i rockville is another thing is they never smoke and entire cigarette they will lighting and taken two puffs and stabbing i gotta say i because of the
cyber bullying really did did destroy rumbling
rumble anymore they just go on the internet until people to kill you know who's like killing you inside you know who's like the day walk or of rockabilly is because he can be very online but he's still iraq it's boy you are most
who's everyone else yeah oh yeah yeah yeah lot of or for
thread what's called a scar specs because he wears glasses he has all but i suspect that
will i think like college boy whoever we all just me the holiday more knowledge that would be your name college college
matt
i actually mats would be the professor so years has to be something different years has to be old man
not that i now i think mats should be the professor and wills should be what's the westside dandy yet west side and i was thinking of the
you would think that prevents not always these gives can all be university related
back and okay
there is a perfect match have a crusty any
is the anti pc professor
okay one revising your damage already be
spider
pig pen because you live in filth i don't live in philly
change my life
my you're living by email
i'm just got so dirty you had to move that's not why i'm they do in order not at all why i moved it's not at all why i moved i moved because i don't want to climb the ladder to piss any more
like having a balcony
to find a more racist building and i you know okay yes the chain on the toilet broke i didn't want to say so
i would just wanted to move and resolutely think the higher now than and their rockabilly is where you are now oh no i mean there is like there is like a chad colony on my four year is the clutches mean
not all of they live
also i just i'm just leaving my door open up trying to do cool dorm environment
guys come in any i'm watching the three hour ex and see on interview deja academics to have any like old console systems playing so faint wants to come in and play some mario car or mind the nazis only battlefield all the time we're not
it's like what the rockabilly guy said you have to adapt for the modern world i think
embers rockabilly name the too scared to be the she'd be scorpio
okay scorpio as a tribute you can if anger in his love of rockabilly what about amber alert to at all
that's
why would i hundred if you tended to double a week or yeah
oh that's cool
robberies are already things though
this is our radio yeah
hands cans now whereas the headphone i think it's radio because he's told me that his favorite cuba gooding jr
and i knew that three year ago rockabilly is love that movie
if the american flag with somebody with their intellect reflected him
representational politics matter
has anyone ever seen juices wild of course i have said
well that's when we for the early odds with stephen dorff where it's fifties greece's rumbling and i honestly think that these guys probably watch it every day they open palm slapped
every morning when they went to high school and that's how they ended up what i thought it was just the outsiders i remember that's that's an too
that the amazon has passed
also it's written by like a fifteen year old girl but also it's just too old previous generation of rockabilly these young guys these young cats
oh affirmative aid saw deuce juices wild on cable and it broke the brain that's why we have to make the juices wild series so they have a new thing to watch yes but now i mean you do you watch the movie with what you wanted them when i wanted to be in the military was thirteen or fourteen i watched i literally did watch black hawk down
every night for month
get a lifetime ago if someone said to me i would have been out a question did but now it it's just watches over
warm breeze
what a game or i still was like i was i would run like my parents broke like run up really fast doing
to like seven have many miles because it was like on the p t test to be great hey i want to watch black hawk down a big yeah they kind of fucked job but it's like they have nothing to feel bad about because they're katie ratio
and i literally thought
killed so many more killer
so i'm like mission success what kind of
why it's called uses wild said about a card game as their the juices that's the name of the gang know but they're not playing cards and know it's a double entendre it all their wild another classic one the walter whole movie streets of fire were out of oh yeah
that's not up here came willem defoe plays again the final boss research that movie yeah pretty awesome he's a genuinely terrifying person if kids are fat guy with the critic frenetic are
but since the cryptic okay if if could be cut out it was a man of many phases and if he had not been murdered by the state department and obama he would have gone on to a rockabilly greece or phase one hundred percent as of greece circle have a handle cryptic art that it's not a grease or name
that's like a friendly another and is quite literal that's like a representing like that's like a fuckin
yes or at sea or or a flat it's gone by artists that's yeah maybe lately yeah like gotta pick up and ever is a good point because you had it is earned his cryptic it just like here here's an eagle riding a motorcycle red roses and eagle riding a motorcycle just thought what if he did that maybe it's a for any type situation
and he got kicked out of the community for me it's go and like a little it if we're eating out women and decide ran through all these different sub cultures until he found a home at rock abilities and well you know i was like around these people
i was highly exposed to these people in southern indiana know how our yeah i mean i was like watching ginger english movies well everyone was like breaking their carburetor said that the car would be intentionally louder
nothing and i was like i fucking hate these people it was just down and watch down by law
thank you very much a way to feel
subversive well being extremely conservative if they were a little younger i think a lot of them would be out right
though they share like error codes and some fashion sense of believe the fred perry palos well yeah and teddy boys greg is just a nazi now so well in atlanta as a any a lot of skinheads end up like that not the not racist kind they call rockabilly skinhead retirement
i'm not joking it's literally what happens it's like i look stupid with a shady had now i'm a little too fat for the show i think you know these these subcultures as you're describing that
harken back to some mythic past be at the nineteen fifties or people who still dressed like cowboys are pirates or whatever are all reactionary because they want to add enough and i'm going to go on the different direction and i'm going to be cyber punk from know and i'm going to live in an anchor i'm unaware like a plaque see through plastic raincoat
wearable tech and i will spell my name with a one instead of and hi i'm going to go a little bit beyond you
zero cyber punk know invented a new thing it's called jetsons
oh and chances are all about the nine hundred and fifty as this thing
that's better than a reactionary with oh by the l a
it is it is isn't this in the books that you guys like not
retro futurism is here saturday the truth this is the crossover where the flintstones and the jetsons mean i know was an issue at all
that's called such now listen to the fifth element as our look book
as was i think matt dressed as ruby rod is busy
i want to know a guy old than i am i'm going forget fast for the future and going alternative reality i'm going present day sought style but if the british had won the war of independence
have higher order had basically there's going to me with a gander at us rubble an insufferable sort of like fuse british english accent it'll be really awful everyone will hate it yeah
combine that with street were so it's like a snap back to work cork
it's like it's a down in a candle but it says thrasher on uses icon yeah like drew that up and they're like this has to stay fit more like this is too cool people aren't already i like that i like imagining met in this alternate presidents where the british won the war of independence so americans still technically part of britain and the only concession to that
that is you wearing a track or to have but still dressing exactly like you do know exactly as it's just you know cool
what he would have been he would have been like the or way to be a weed back then was like you were sort of a weed for like muslims and turks yeah a bunch of her converted yeah and matt league of you war like a really long flowing t shirt it would be leg sort like a captain
you would be cool



county will carry whoa
we are back back from the rockabilly discussion and most importantly absolutely no time has elapsed
and now
wrap rock block back continuing to record this up for the first time for the first time and distance we took that break you know if we start recording and now the eagles have won the superbowl of the stock market crash fifteen hundred and four kids so things you're looking up the good looking good
we all one hundred percent thought the eagles are going to win and they did and we call that of the most important then again sega matt yelling all throughout the game the eagles are going to win by exactly three days
that's right again
no i was actually very certain until the absolute last second with the patriots were going to live will you add your bets by changing your mind every fifteen seconds in a matter what you say look i was right now i was wrong i'll admit i have
certain that they were going to do the same exact thing with them last year which was tied up with two point conversion touchdown
and then when an overtime grossman could be wrong about this one
literally that's it
the sports ball that doesn't mean any ordinary place because
battle between the nazi team in the regular races team you want the regular racists to win
and on excel raise
i'm going to argue the patriots are a little more walk him
tom brady most sex positive
wow that was
other fan support criminal justice reform talking about unfair of way certain criminal defendants are treated
shudder to philadelphia though because the best part about the he was winning the super bowl was philly you really came through with the videos from less than a address ass and i got a real kick about washing those we saw some cars being overturned we saw just random vandalism
we saw a guy literally eating shit eating horse shit off the ground to a bang and cheering crowd of man proposed marriage to a woman who was drinking from a forty hour
was know i that's weird
as i got the post here is this is this is a new social movement it's occupy broad street
it's good probably best of all was seeing the owning of the ritz carlton collapse and little done about forty people and then people running through the streets with little pieces of the awning the only thing i'm disappointed it is that nobody pulled down the results statue on on was looking and would have been a perfect moment to just fuckin
wrap a quarter of his back and forth said
a statue of a rat frank rizzo and or and replace it with the joe paterno start
when you enter
we'll watch the streets you watch the skies
philadelphia doing great feeling great this morning
i phone hey guys version if we could turn that many people into the streets willing to do violence for a good cause
nice but that's not how we do it in america just for once
have you ever seen the phone go pop riot
seen them live them but tell me about it i was there
so yeah it's it's the day after the superbowl super bowl sunday the big game our national religious holiday basically says something that we all do as a nation we all watched it over here it verges place last name
i think arctic away from the big game was just goddamn america burn it to the ground assault the ashes and of course the game itself is mostly incidentals all this what really matters the real median message is the tv commercials well i mean that's true but i really
i'm struck by the ephemeral nature of commercials now compared to when i was a kid and part of that is just the weird the way that you remember things but i think i figured it out and it is that when you when i was a child the olden days when they were my news boy cap
john uppers though was a chimney sweep the you got like five memes a year
and two or three of them came from super awkward
go as a means you got the beginning of the years like these are the memes sparse about for the rest of the year you're not getting any better
fashion as we like to and we loved it it was like so every time every one of those commercials we were just bated breath because that could be a me name or
quality of fraud that of budweiser and bronx yeah but now i got the mass media i mean every five seconds
we don't need some broke commercials to be the mean repository anymore so it's just it's a base coined a language and decadence it's it's it's fifty brands of toothpaste we don't need
you know these are these were very disappointing commercials i think we allocate i would say i would say that the memes haven't gotten worse commercial names of always it's just that they're more means because the producers the production has been democratized now instead of like your mean being like of these guys say hello
oh to each other in a funny way it's groundbreaking stuff leg
blurry picture of a sponge bob and like thinner get socked all
his eyes
you know cold pockets of course
basically the yeah i think far you've been five years spoiling you in the greatest generation they would get maybe one mimi here kilroy yeah a little awkward stalingrad corpse
learn mad about x box or her
like that guy kissing the girl at times square and v j it was the only mean america had for the entire nineteen for the rosenbergs
classically well i mean that was for the common people rich people have pretty much had a stadium out of me and proportional to everyone else for a while that's a bohemian grove it's if you're making means of each other henry's dank memes
when you finish suck off an hour
blurry
very blurry picture of cocoa shoving a golden a corner
polish aunt in latin
before we get
this year's crop of ads and there were some there's some disease that are worth discussing i am reminded of the guys remember this is from two thousand and ten there is a doritos add were like the kids smacks his mom's boyfriend or something kids off my doritos i remember that yeah i remember that front of the show
dennis prager wrote an article about why that ad was bad and i just like to read from it right now a little bit this is is ed article is the doritos ad was not funny
by far the most popular add shown during the superbowl
was the doritos house rules add tens of millions of american saw it as hilarious that is unfortunate anywhere aware of anyone aware of the manifold social pathologies the depicted did not find much to laugh about and then he describes the the ad and he goes here are the major elements of dysfunction this ad depicts first a child smacking and adults
across the face is not funny
it is in fact one of the last thing society should totally
someone has getting wailed on going to say that
i will deal with the widespread defense of the child's acts in he was only protecting his mother later in real life a child you it's an adult needs to be disciplined if a child good night
if a child did that to me
i will grab his offending our client are forced to make it clear he will never do that again
i don't either
new jersey karate move and back flip off the wall and than actually something really cool cool off if the child that to me i would do a tactical take down and use felix were those he's fantasizing about finding a child as do the tactical take down and then attach one of those balloons are metal ghosts
everything to recover else and recovery system yeah and then he would be whisked away to the child discipline center
so he goes
after i mention this on my radio show some psychotherapist send me emails disagreeing with you
the police came to my
they noted for example that violence breeds violence some cliches are true i find this one meaningless the truth is the opposite immoral violence violence moral violence such as just wars police work and appropriate parental discipline reduces violence
i am well aware that the vast numbers of americans and europeans believe that engaging in any physical discipline of a child is wrong i held this belief for most of my wife until my sidekick
i never hit or spent either of my sons i have changed my mind because of all the find people who have called by show or written to me about how they were spanked and now believe they're better adults because of it look at the i turned out fine other did his favor
it is a given that i do not defend physical or any other form of abuse against a child of all the world's evils child abuse may rank is the greatest he just said reverse child abuse is the greatest
turn abusing it
because on like this and if he goes the doritos kid deserved a physical response from this man
in pressure on the offending or with regard to the argument that this man was not the boy's parents and the terrible fact that there are far too much hitting an abuse of children by step fathers and boyfriends i do not believe that only parents may physically respond to a child hell yeah just vigilantes to drop kicking children and fucking parking lots cobra to
they take his gun and he just goes house to house disciplining children and so he goes out reviews in this guy defense corrective rape really dark place where outright well we actually read already and about and literally he wrote a series of two articles part one into that we've read on this show way back in the day titled what to do when a woman isn't it
the mood of the answer is have sex anyway yeah oh okay yeah so i was right
all the question my raped darn then
always been having a normal one
he brings up with the second part of this commercial and he says
the man acts like the man who the kids slaps them an axe and speaks like a lecture and moron and the woman should not have exuded sexuality for a date in front of her little boy
fluid it's like the reality show
her as sexual fair about centers secreted sought sauces and said he agrees with those a twitter means that really
my man crush monday's my son
sick of these to reduce as urges dripping with raw sexuality
adding that to horny you even watch the game is actually copy islands in every bank
so just just a number that jim from the memory banks
to bring it back out bring been dennis back into the p
choke a lot about people becoming like highly literal in this particular moment but this is a man doing a deep read it they doritos
with no sense of humor whatsoever and like no sense of irony know oh look how silly it says i'm i'm you know the bell hooks of snacks commercials it's completely fucking in seattle little
that's the thing and we're going to get into this more but lake whenever there's an award show or a music video or like ads and liberals are like oh my god this is so important and it's good or cry because of bruno mars is crushed velvet three piece suit it's actually very important about masculinity
my name is should have ever seen and then i see a conservative is like bruno mars is crushed old a three piece suit proceeds three decades of fatherless but this is a cancer in our country and i'm like oh there actually is something lame or you can do with they're both playing in the same pool of shit
i think that's funny is not only that the dennis is critiquing is to reduce commercial so intensely it's that he wanted the doritos commercials to depict the men strong arming this child and disciplining heaven or proper way during a doritos commercial played for laughs in a superbowl
i though i love just my ideal the readers commercial the dad gets into a gun dumb and launches of the kid into orbit and then there's no chips in there anyway
one of the and doritos
it's like those those car commercials words like a little girl who's like i have leukemia but i want to be the was a dead and there's like a minute long like very heartbreaking seen or the like her parents like crown her president on her deathbed and she dies in everyone's crying and it's like oh yeah by the way hug day
let's talk about that
forward to the andrea yates three those commercial for next year
are it will talk about i will get some of the martin luther king one will help the martin luther king that's the one that most people are talking about today this was
there's one either want to talk to us that i thought was even weirder but this is essentially a martin luther king's speech played over just images of like the classic american a bullshit to sell dodge ram pickup trucks and and it was at several points during one of the speech
the officially licensed martin luther king's speech to dodge ram trucks they showed at several points during this commercial troops and my troops coming home
the troops marching information famously an airline
if i wanted to see prius tried one up then by using a stokely carmichael speaking as they you know if they wanted to show real america they should have just showed all like tom and michael's facebook guys that are like i'm doing me
so yeah that was the biggest goddamn america moment it was really horrified martin luther king's words been licensed by his his family had family i've looked into this and apparently it's like a split in the family between one half of them controls the licensing and the other half controls like the museum or of like other archives are like
things but anyway they lessons that to dodge ram
to hawk they're awful pickup truck and again dodge ram drivers big demographic for people who are sympathetic to mark with one thing he said about the content of the character it because it means affirmative action is bad they like that quote the one thing that my little digging it and now this is the second thing that by other the king said that they can remember which was i don't know something about believing in i just go
i don't even remember what the fuck unquote was in the thing
i'm glad i'm glad it happened like i'd definitely a brand acceleration is because like i think people need to know that they don't love you are speaking of brands caring about you i think the next example is even better
i don't which was the worst of the this was even more nauseating than the martin luther king one this is the hood and i add in which they said it was filmed like at the superbowl right and they said that we replace some of the metal detectors with hope detectors and attack detectors picks out people out of the security line
who were hung guy owners are driving hundreds of families it's evil or then removed from the line from security taken through like a concrete tunnel so an interrogation chamber in which like you that someone who is holed into a room before boarding a plane and ask if i
had been doing any journalism in syria as soon as that happened to me it is a very real chance i would have volunteered out of anxiety imagine if you will you work and the quiz on where you traveled what you're doing away he believed in but instead were showing up lifting video from cancer survivors thanking you for
having a hundred
i why can't you can't
that got failing
you know her anxiety inducing it is to be carted off by an authority figure into a windowless room i have no idea what the message of that is it's just incoherent it's like a mark lane or store
that's actually what the onset group and started out as we detect do we have detected
his presence of hope that you for buying a volkswagen
i had out outtake i live they were horrible out
on the pavement fraud
you know they're going to have one where they take people out of the crowd and drag them into a tiled windowless room with a with a drain in the middle of the
poker ever get back on their neck but then when they pulled the trigger a flags come out that says don't litter
at approximately thirty hunter thirty hours the day suspect reach for their pocket and i unloaded my f nine hundred to stinger missile on
please get another cancer patient they were killed in the blow back of the disposable rocket disposable lot and tape weapon that i fired as a follow up shot
i guess by take away is that it's good that it shows that stadium security or airline security is just so pointless it so it's are such cave added security theater yeah weak land where the interests of use it for a cool little marketing campaigns that francs before and after people who were water boarded then told they were beautiful
all in charge of airline security we get the exact same all
okay how about have a the the t mobile add that featured a bunch of babies to eat or a lullaby nursery rhyme jane got us are based on nirvana's all apologies yeah which is largely regarded as kurt cobain suicide yeah it was just like i can just keep going
everything that this is the one thing i'm a very deep acceleration as i want them to exploit every beautiful thing on earth until people finally getting oh they're saying this is all western civilization suicide note
well that's the thing it's because that's our expel shots hated that commercial so that means it's good
woke to like it and he was at a carnival contract despite them it was one of the better
like gotcha commercials where you watch something and it's a nirvana song played his alibi and then a bunch of babies at various races and he watches for thirty seconds and then at the end t mobile
have like no idea and it's completely fucking insane and it was kind of weird and called teach you that there is some narration over it's like you will be able to love who you want to learn yeah make equal pay
kara south this guy and a fuck pepper a mask is like drive a truck into a team emotions luck in a cell tower
oh god i'm not talking about
i said what you call this that i called it as soon as their commercial and it i thought some child is going to call it low t mobile and fifteen minutes later that guy who's the real clown prince of the all right oh and benjamin who was at the fucking night of freedom yellen about murdering pedophiles or something hilarious like that
he did it he said more like loot t mobile and then just just the next sentence was just soy
gone from soy like they have this half cocked pseudo scientific floor it's basically modern day fluoride paranoia about our soil makes you a woman or something because leicester which is true but now it's just a free floating signify are you just say so out and said something
you don't know noble is soy the heck incredibly powerful wealthy individuals who own this multinational corporation or soy their islam do you think there is going to be like another
an equally reactive spike from like the work clubs who just going to by like fifty phones oh yeah absolutely there was then there was there was one add that seemed to be pitch towards the mega people but very subtly just with ah yes i know it when you're talking about and it was the one where it showed the building a factory
oh yeah the first shots of it are they putting up the exterior walls of the area and it's very hard not to a nearby
watching that the thought that they're building of the wall
and then even when you find out they're not building the while what you do find out as this is a company building a factory in america bringing jobs back it's all in the narrative of mega so that's clearly like somebody realize all these fucking to walk ads that are just pissing off like half of the book potential customers let's put it towards them suddenly enough
though that we're not going to fatally alienate the woke but we will baby subtly suggest hey we're a few oregon
oh it was actually it was a spot purchased by baron trump and it was used having the guys act out his minecraft an issue and think just flashed at the end it was something actually they kept doing so nice arrange detached things like america's defenses some some ominous namely oh yeah it's for slip mats anti slip mad
for your car for
but i have almost one hundred percent sure that his a factory makes rubber mats for the floors of cars floor mats floor mats okay but like but that only and slipping high elf for floor
can real of our tactical for man
they picked bell at like if i remember correctly it looked like this is a border town
the he saw was a loser
wall yeah it's clearly meant to evoke the is added someone taking over a water bottle and then
racist easter egg roll the guys building this building why are they all have punisher teacher
you know this companies back on the up and up not because of trumps because the tommy boy
i've got
he sold all those the car carburetors that he finally got the hang of brake pads
but that that the t mobile commercial that's the new type of commercial the two new tabs the commercials are the post modern ones are like oh
it's like oh my god you break the fourth wall is everything
the
here was tied we didn't get on a series of ads starting david harbor right addie from stranger things that it was like is this a beer it is it a sport said what if it's a tight but but the other type of like those that's for like the younger set who are like this is exactly what comedy bang bang
is also really like it takes all of the comedy from now that's really funny like comedy bang tim and eric and his leg
what does the terminally own funny thirty five year old duisburg made this but the other type is it's like a bunch of vignettes which are also made by cocaine addict thirty five year old who got into ads because he wants to tell stories and it's like a phd in philosophy from the new school yeah
he's he is like
you know it will be a multicultural collection of babies or like a father talking to his son going like daddy
why can't mommy be poised about and then it's it has nothing to do with the product they're selling
will be like at the end like flashlight and
be the america you want a busta
that was beautiful inside one was weird though because we thought maybe they would address the tide pod thing but bet well because actual i guess a couple babies have died
i guess they consider that a bad thing
race bad pr for them so they they're trying to get as far away from the type of thing as possible i think they should have gone for at the elephant around that like we're making the tide pods like a turret brown color
the child will not put it in their mouth were make it less look less like candy issued of they should have done that what does the pod do use thrown in the washing yeah i was an improvement on i don't know why my asking
deal is liquid
tired of pouring and laundry did thirds
why shouldn't for a problem nobody was widely used to be solid that's how you'd you'd you'd do the laundry detergent would come on a solid and then it became liquid and that was this huge innovation our back to solids
that's a slow
there's a gas tank is all its surrounding a liquid it's both i i think the gas completes ago that dialectic
i think we're all hit die of inhaler i have
i'm i'm or evangelist i think we should go back to watch boards and close lines of people get comically caught in running from stealing a pie
oh it was through community and key unitarian and oh i mean think of all the good music that you could be yeah
an artistic can you imagine if instead of doing this shitty pod guess we all were overalls and straw hats and one of those plays the wash
one of those plays a bunch of clothes it's like a guitar
i love the moonshine jug
one on youtube editor
you would be one of those guys with a giant drum just back and yeah you'd also be playing a tuba of the same time i let my bad i would like to be the watch or guard because i invented this idea of the washboard guy in those bands he was like the cool guy he was like the vocal he got those who have gotten laid so
we can hammer playing the saw with an old kid
absolutely the vote this is the last episode of the body
i'm not here is maxed out loud for one thing after the were pivoting to country band right
about an hour over the chalk and cheese bad going to be mumford and sons and daughters
mumford failed
i think there's one other add that was maybe pitched at the more explicitly at the trump demographic and that was the the ad for people who are sigh curious
i'm sorry you of course about the church of scientology had a great add that was just like hey ever wondered what we're about all your that's my mother gang gang style
i love have their fetching it like you're probably wondering because you haven't heard anything about us before
new we just started with me here
another thing called science
yeah it also was another one that was sort of assembled stock footage which i thought maybe they would try and do a little bit of they show the meters in the ad the day that's all that there was also i think just a lot of like people walking you an old person doing yeah a woman
picking up a child's just stock footage yeah i think they lost all their like hollywood directors after going clear came out that the kind of like that show the meter thing because that's the new thing is that you lean in to what people say about you like little pump with a harvard graduate thing just put the meters and the ads and yeah put like the which i tied pods entire
she's gonna type of a bitch doubt i think they should have gone when key self preferential hobo
a parody of the office only michael scott is he new
the office john phones
and as the gym yeah
the highlight admirals and ask galactic leader mug
it's like kind of awkward and wacky it's like a they just cut to david miscavige you just like because the does the little look to the camera as he passes and people who are like cleaning a cruise ship with toothbrush
or his wife
there are seventy of the bathroom banging on the door
love out nor them that will be ryan yes
well i've got to see the other disappointed me the most just it was a missed opportunity was the danny de vito mm add oh right now
i mean was pretty good
the funniest it was good it was fun like danny we're always happy to see what i'm saying if your idea that the screen if your make if you have this technology to turn the m and m's into people why wouldn't you use it on the green eminem
could you imagine this day she stacked
our world
i am going on deviant art right
old out as of amsterdam
you can't even imagine how it should be as a burger girls the m a i think you should write a medium more you are really expensive writer and you have thoughts a i can never put into words boys
your fit a blast on the green evidence
or maybe it was good that they didn't have the green it out because what if they turn the green eminem into a woman and it's a human woman as just a let down because there's no without human woman that could possibly be as beautiful as i think it was a little economy and desire
but you're right
she is the and she is incomplete
you're an object you please
damn little am
let's talk about something slightly more brain damaging what do you say yeah yeah
megan mcardle
yeah that i noticed i notice everyone was criticizing me regard old today
say if you don't like megan mcardle one don't you make your own
oh shit be taking part in this negativity
megan mcardle you can
we're going to take the kitchen appliances and spread of more
and you'd and build that power
i am i am looking forward to the expropriation of all of megan mcardle kitchen gauze
so i think so
this gave us today because little bit of kismet meghan came out today just today with one of the worst twitter threads in lawyer
it was real dog unbelievable basically boil down to mega these attempts to say yes i am a rich new york city private school kid failed child but because of that i know what it's like to struggle and scrimp and budget because i spent years after college like with prepared
some point so let me tell the poor people what they're doing wrong then how their fate as their own faults which is the hope but underlying premise of all of her bullshit
he he had some really funny things to say about how
the years she was unemployed she felt like really scared and afraid even though years living at home she was living in her parents palatial apartment in new york city
access to all of their wealth and then she says when people point this out well i didn't feel like i saved in a do oughta do you want to talk about that
girls and i want to talk about left in it
the witless this the absolute just mindless oblivious this of just not processing it when people point because her she starts off by saying i understand i was born on third base but anyway it's like know you're done you're born on third base you can't you do you have your experience is
not relevant here
he describes it she says as long as your class trader it's fine but i would have sounds of class yeah other wonder we would have killed well a long time
i'm exactly from the same background as mcardle accept my dad was in the legitimate business and
otherwise known as being a spectacularly corrupt head of the new york state new york city building contractor yeah there's nothing shady a vote here
legitimate businessman yeah her father's name actually is francis x mcardle and for seminal nation of his
for three can sit like a mayor all administrations in new york from the s on he was managing director of the general contractors association which is so fucking crooked that they tried in the late eighties to have the states organized crime taskforce tried to have a permanent make a new permanent investigate
of agency to look into it and france x mcardle was quoted the new york times saying he was unaware of any pervasive patterns of corruption regarding his group and that he didn't think we needed more people tripping over each other in search of glory facts or whatever
he said while holding a briefcase with a bunch of one hundred dollar bills sticking out of so is she describes her experience of
poverty are working hard in scraping and budgeting she says in my late twenties i managed to strategic retreat from the upper middle class financially i graduated from the rate march
i graduated from business school with six figure educational debt and a job that promptly an argument
you didn't have a snooty i spent two years during your uncle lawyer and a little bit attack work she says during that time i was uninsured i have a bunch of chronic health condition as your pants that pay out of pocket he says i have a bunch of chronic health conditions for which i had to pay cash i was living in my parents spare room that was impossible by i have heard of any kind of serious
okay emission you would not have been able to afford paying for them in cash so as they cost more if you're not insured or evidence of being now and self diagnose out and brain she had a home to live in and could pay all her medical bills yes and by the way megan whatever i also just doubt she paid her own medical goes live as long as it's one hundred
why she says i was living in my parents spare room which was a bit of luck imagine that he had to grind for this
says but i was very broke and very scared of whites
then she says this is even worse she goes eventually i had a fantastic bit of luck i went to a blogger meet up and a woman who worked for the economist website and met her and i said if you ever have a job opening please let me know six months later she did that is not lock not an hour that is the professional managerial class
fucking networking system you went to a networking event probably a lady networking event these things that exist in new york i never been to one but my friend likes my friends like to text me from them because they're terrifying do you want to go to mine
your lady blogger meta also sees us i mean
she is someone who was one of those coke funded propagandists that whole time i think on the coke they are will she was on a fucking conveyor belt at no point in this in this narrated of her can really in poverty did she ever mention what exact time she became a fellow at charles and david coax institute for humane study
i'm not mad about the networking thing because my life stories kind of similar i went to networking event called the beer power i met will who gave me a shot he said hey i think you can do racism with the
while and then i like that i was only paying it forward because i was originally put on by a little guy and in the beer nerd
yeah are lucky enough to be nice to be a nerd and like just passed through a membrane into a world of influence and but you guys all mad at a networking event called iran club
that's pretty nice
i here's just the last two in her in her and and her epic thread talons basement
i'm sure to be the last few things here that meghan says she goes now the fair thing is could i have asked my parents for money yes and these days when i tell stories about being uninsured or some desperate thing i did to stay within my budget the month of rice and beans was the low point my dad will
ask why didn't ask for help and i always tell him the same thing it honestly never occurred to me that i could
so i could have and knew that if i lost my job and everything went sideways they would always take me in i didn't feel like i had that safety net so yes i do know what it is the script no now you know her act no incorrect just because you in your own self regard had created this like amnesia
the self hypnosis that says that you were unaware that at any moment you could fucking pull a parachute and be fine that doesn't erase the fact that that safety that was there yeah that you in a secure position that you could never fuck up that bad he was like something out of every in the position of an actual poor person who's
could literally be ruined by one bad fucking decision because there would be no backup that that never ever was part of her life while she misses that she was uninsured or whatever and she always brings this your parents pay yeah yeah i think she always brings up the fact i know it it's like to be uninsured when people call her that she spends most of her a good port
one of her co space arguing against things like single payer healthcare or a public option at the very least because in her mind it will stifle innovation while he's like look you can go uninsured people are dying from lack of health care and her dad will write a fucking shit
well if we have single payer healthcare than there all be hours even months to get into a blog networking of
even after she got that cushy blogging job she was still struggling because she had to pay eleven one hundred in rent for an apartment that she says was a fantastic steal it took her nine months to find
i like the she also said like somehow i knew that my parents were always be there to take me and like yes as i was living in their how yeah you've lived there and also for most people like moving back in with your parents is like
relatively traumatic step backward they don't have like a fucking like spare room
the fucking upper west side that it's basically like living in a really nice fucking apart and again i have like gets like you live in the basement now i have to stress that i have basically the exact same background as mic make in and was also after i graduated college and leached off my parents for quite a while however i'm not fucking lecturing poor people about how they need to
put away twenty five dollars every month so that and ten thousand years you can have a down payment on a house because nothing in those intervening years will come along to take away alien as well
right because that's the thing is one of those stupid things is oh you know one month it's a bus pass two months
healthcare unless something happens to you later reality happens as that any setback is catastrophic jan what means that kind of that kind of busy oh you're you're you're not you're not the profligate at grass and over again there's nothing
and you know righteous about like you know never having taken money from your parents that's fine it's hard out there who gives a shit and most people benefit in some way they with the parents tim help him yeah yeah like and parents want to help their kids when they can but with a fucking idiot for acting like your
parents didn't help you will know that to stay in the palatial mansion of a joke are made about megan's parents and her dad and particular is that she she never called home to us for money because she knew the phones were bugged where the theft
meghan sub asks me about all this money that we definitely don't have a wink wink
megan took away a bugged lamp like meadows
i think it has been the
didn't your time on your organized crime just worse at this point a month listening to her or she is
all blog she save your dad's life because the hot shower aged on her case was in for a monster you have been like while on a marginal level insurance corporations are vogue and blew his brains out in the room
oh patient person was responding to me and said i think you've downplayed really important differences between you and like a poor person differences between a privilege person going through a rough patch is not the same as a person suffering from generational poverty and her responses how does it change the math not your emotional attitude towards the math math itself as usual
matt like twenty twenty oh she's talking about the math of if you save twenty five dollars about that still twenty five oh yeah but that's because she has the back the backdrop of her parents' money and house that she lives in that means that she can save that money on again i'm anti saving i don't think people should have to save so like
i literally think people are like while you know people are trying to be frugal what a few bad with money you still shouldn't over and not have out that on earth over one hundred years ago jack london in a great short book he wrote called people are the bis people of the abyss where he confronts the devastating poverty of the east end of london and trust
like go and live i'm sort of like gonzo journalism a very early for he dispenses with a lot of these concerns about thrift and the poor in particular and he makes the very good case in that book which i recommend reading that basically every time thrift is council to the poor by the well off essentially what they're saying
his demonstrate to us that you in fact can live on less and then you will yeah every time you're like as you're you're showing oh i can scrimp and save just this tiny little bit more to get by proving that you can get by with less and that you're owed from it's like working really quickly one day then comes your new internet into the
that twenty five dollar thing and that was something about jack london already also talks about an entire chapter about quote the thing that happened and he talks about like there's a lot of people that are just sort of like at the above of just literally sleeping on the street maybe they have like an actual bed to sleep in occasionally but they're always just one thing away from complete destitute
and that's what's completely missing forget things out oh man matic less than that it's not a real math it's megan has the response you right here you still haven't said anything about the math of living on the money that i had given that i did not get alone coach signed or asked for financial help i will absolutely agree and maybe less afraid but it didn't alter my purchasing power as experience mad free
she had free housing she either
ability to pay for health care at any point from or para that's everyone's primary and like budgetary like need his rent and then and then the emergency thing is health care and then what smith
okay let's talk about the rules guys rule the about
the okay it's megan's new rules if you thought that was wasn't inane then there's a treat there's more for you this week begun came out with a great column for bloomberg view saddled after forty five birthdays here are twelve rules for life she's trying to get it
niger than peterson
yeah i noticed that little thing there so it
all the time we spent with maggie and don't you think she's a good person to give you advice on how to with a three and real misery yeah
so here she goes yesterday was january twenty ninth meaning that oprah winfrey and i are a year older sixty four and forty five they're actually twin she's beginning her column by just suddenly mentioning not subtly at all but just referencing the fact that her and oprah share a birthday now both business mavens both
strong black women
self made heroin
she says forty five is somehow a very definite year there is no question that you are middle aged at forty five wouldn't take stock the building years of your life or over and what you are narrow is pretty much what you're going to be terrifying thought age age
oh dear forty five of folk with a vision family build forty five on resting on your loyal laurels of building
so she doesn't like sister here he is your twelve rules for life
she goes i oughta have some rules
these are what she's clean and her forty five years on earth
rule number one
be kind rewind
be kind mean is easy kind is hard okay this is this is sort of setting the tone
really
she's setting up that like yeah it's it's too easy to be cynical and we need to do the hard work of being kind i was like establish before were being really mean to meghan which we have been doing going to continue to do so megan is one of the most cynical hate for walking a whole alive
she has not an ounce of kindness in her doesn't but as as evidenced by that last bit of just utterly witless blink heard
self mythology and which she is somehow struggled in her life she's in anyways hertha everyone else they don't understand the math and therefore they deserve the same day
thoroughly mediocre a person who literally wrote a book about how she's failed so many times that she's now successful and doesn't really make her entire family are as a cellphone yeah by her own ability and a hallway so she goes somewhere in eighth grade many of us acquire the idea that nasty put down
on the superior smile the clever one liner the signs of intelligence and great personal strength
one grade when everyone started reading those garfield can't i went to eighth grade with a young christopher hitchens oscar wilde and that's where i learned that she says but this kind of wit is to borrow from the great john skulls a he's that way they're ready player one guy like him yeah
epic bake is like a red shirt while you're there is one of those guys is famous for the emperor and of blogs and ninety ninety nine where he talks about
he's famous because you broke the story about how apple have a new type of headphone into those and for that or they should just an entire sector of people who should be given their own autonomous region
us when she goes that kind of with is to borrow his phrase playing the game on easy mode
she's going like all just keep only relentlessly make when i culture and as they're doing it easy what's really hard is writing incredibly convoluted bloomberg articles about why any attempts to regulate the economy or have a more humane stop people from hurting the that yeah are in fact wrong
be chain and flick it number rule number two politics is not the most important thing in the world
it's just the when people talk about the most that's because everyone shares the government only you are married to your spouse and kids knowledgeably expound on their habit of gnashing of soft boiled egg and catch up into a disgusting paste
your scissors it out of these and make that alone
her intimate live right in more socially sieges game either good throb
hard boiled egg
beautiful taste has been as she has like a william sonoma feed bag
she she's going keep some perspective about politics it does it matter as much as the real people around you again this always as if not only how many have a well i think this is mega attempting once again attempting to in some way extricate herself law of the ghoulish things that she's helped accomplish in the world like the
iraq war yeah wall street bailout and just the general on going and misery my neck night and in america yeah my net negative effect on the entire world that doesn't mean as much as the fact that i'm a good neighbor yeah exactly and that on base the my husband who and you i slurry
i actually do have some sympathy for those idea for people who don't have any power if someone doesn't have any power at all and they have done backward views who gives a shit her first rule was be nice to people and that her second rule is all these things i talk about it doesn't really yeah
person that rule number three always order one extradition a restaurant an unfamiliar one you might like it which has responded if you don't like it or you loss was a couple of bucks
nine hundred bucks every month so i was you know he he addresses if she goes if you can't afford to order that one extra dish than the restaurant is too expensive for your budget and you should find a cheaper of go out and waste a meal every
when you go to hard hearty use get the box prize and the monster suits you never know there are some weird disordered eating pathologies in that household
rule number for give yourself permission to be bad i'm glad you've created yourself that are worth behavior
that is why for people deserve to live and how well she said it was generally talking about that and she's talking about herself boca
she goes toward messed up out riding to anyone except other and megan mcardle yes you know what you're really good at things you've done many times before mastery is boredom unfortunately we feel we like feeling like masters we hate feeling like idiots so we keep ourselves board in order
protect ourselves from feeling stupid this is a bad a of the car and alliance yeah i know this is just describing her reading whatever she's saying that like when you're playing your favorite verse earth and play a different class than you're used to oh well that's good yeah i agree with the okay number five
go to the party even when you don't want to nine times in ten you'll be bored and go home early
i was enjoying this i didn't really care but now she's she's trying to tell introvert loot
you fucking piece of shit
i feel too much positive energy towards people that's why i have to stay inside and do absolutely
stupid piece of shit you know it's like to be an introvert
but the tenth time you will have a worthy experience or meet an interesting person who just happens to give you a job with the economy
i find it arguably of megan mcardle gets invited that many parties all the third thing is is that either at least a while ago she was part of a very vibrant social scene and dc with all those other blogging nit wit
it's easy to hardy there where it was chronicled in the harmony korean movie kids
is based on a glaze is just the man i know that those guys would hang out and i just i always think it'd be like it would be like one hundred and twenty days of sodom puts the party mark to fuck him by graphs and shit
horrible
pop up all not eating seen and that but it's the egg slurry
okay rule number six and this goes back to her advice to poor people save twenty five percent of your income
no don't tell me how expensive your city is i have spent basically my whole life in new york and washington dc was the vet paying living rent free you can save if you want to what you really mean is there are all these things i want more than financial security and you're right you do you want them more than a financial security right now but when your comparison
shopping brands of generic dog food or begging your parents were alone your wish you save the money so cut out of the things in your life that matter less than financial freedom that will let you take important risks was sleeping easy every night
yeah there is someone who lives on you know sixteen thousand dollars a year sleeps easy every night knowing omega when he decided to be something wrong with buying generic dog food
suffering yeah
yeah i mean you might as well just killed
dogs content eating junk out of the toilet this is a warning to anyone who's seen her dog grade i will conquer
i will blow your fucking bruins
just let your go free in the neighborhood to take dominion over in a fucking joke i'm going to do the feeling i get to read ran as a pit bull
i want to be one of those the one of my five aren't it after their second divorce got like five adopted pit bulls that attack that shelter and that's my favorite type of person that diverse and whose only political issue is the vilification of
any what do you what do you think about the thing about the election
actually the noisiest dog
i only a bad owners their little beautiful angels
number seven don't just pay people complements give them living eulogies
my sentence
our i just killed the club
give them living eulogies
i would certainly like to give megan mcardle a eulogy
so while i'll tell you what tell them an oxymoron tell them exactly how great they are and how many ways embarrass them here is a funny do not break eye contact get two inches from that hair is a funny thing i have learnt by being just a little bit internet famous it doesn't matter how many times you hear the words you're amazing and here a
why it never gets old they do not go out of style you'll be wearing them to your eightieth birthday party along with a dazzling smile
who is telling an early as thing also like what does it like to receive tons of praise and not immediately think this person's blowing smoke up
why does it like to just take a compliment i don't know what that's like gets back to the essential point every one of these rules for life that she's doling out is just how she wants other people to treat her as i never questioned her politics always be nice to her never just the question any the honorable thing she said
or written extra that he had given her extra money then or give her dinner treats and chain or compliments and all the time
a sadist is gas lighting her by telling her oh great she was alberta i want us to all go to one of these awful parties and and go through and demand that you give us will each of us living eulogy megan
rule number eight that thing you kind of want to do some day do it now i mean literally pause reading this column pick up the phone book that skydiving session right now i wrote it to go to florida to take flightless
this one is really really stupid and pointless not going to read the rest of it
number nine
somewhere around that same eighth grade barack when we were all experimented with being mean we get the idea that believing in things makes you a sucker that good art is the stuff that reveals how shoddy and grasping people are they could politics is cynical that realism means accepting how rotten everything is to the core the cynics aren't exactly wrong
i'm still employed so that was just my little material injection there is a lot of shoddy grasping rotten this in the world but cynicism is radically incomplete early modern his critics used to complain about the sanitized unreality of nice books with no bathrooms the great modernists mistake was decide that if books without sewers
we're unrealistic reality must be the sewers
can you follow that when was the last time this person read a book that did not have a horse on the cover
i like their lives sort of coming together to me and it's lake
could just be called like the power of three like a religion that will smith invented after leaving scientology just complete asinine or shit like
positive it is i should have the most radical thing you can do call a suicide hotline and ask the person on the other and how they're doing
with the fathers isn't i think it's actually worse than that especially with this rule number nine which again i think she's attempting to to read con the culture to make it more hospitable to people heard people like her what she's saying here is that art that confronts the miserable conditions of the president or makes a stinging critique about the world we live in is fake and see
cynical and good art that actually smart people enjoy is nice and has a hopeful message know when he shifts and you can believe in things like austrian economics
soccer i think there is something kind of to just horribly boring media people would soon with the navel gazing movies about people who have bad sex in brooklyn and people like that so realistic and it's like no it's not just you just have a bad life by all the other side of that is megan want
it's equivalent tv show about like a blogger going to nice dinner parties and ordering two meals at everyone here
i've got two meals one for the will hurt
now the movie is definitely the nora ephron classic julie and julia the audience for megan mcardle is er rip towards air on thirty rock
that guy's got it
rule number ten don't try to resolve fundamental conflicts with your spouse or of room
the low as three aware of that general egg paced and leave it just let it fester own one day blow your brains all over your delicately pointed kitchen
