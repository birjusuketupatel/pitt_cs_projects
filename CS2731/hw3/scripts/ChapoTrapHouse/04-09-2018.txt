mr have been regular normal online for calling in and letting us know how normal he is okay is only ever having a good one it's amazing he broke richard nixon's record for the most consecutive days i think a very good day always good to hear from a move
and shakers and the actually laughing right now henry
just coming back to the gym
there are jews there was some something of that richard nixon getting epilepsy by accident
he he has he ever heard of him tell you what a load that's way
he he will yield the no child is because agenda is when children
a clapped pops is sitting over there
tentacles goddamn this thing have ever seen i've been fighting gets these people my entire life they won't just show me the tentacles so moving on from one corner the media is the other i think vince
well end up this week in such a perfect constellation that i think it would be a good idea
she should have a deep dive into friend of the show and editor in chief of the atlantic magazine jeffrey gold
a jeffrey the great helmsman of of mainstream liberal thought yeah the west or east coast in general and you know what is going to be people accused of being a negative segment but i do want to say goldberg he's an impressive guy he went from being in the w w e to being the
editor of the top magazine an orthodontist waiting room said
so never never let anyone tell you what you can and can't do that's what i got was jeffrey had an amazingly busy week lot of ups and downs lotta ins and outs mod but i want to begin with his interview with the new saudi crown prince muhammad bin salmond
another front of the show
now you'll remember when we covered thomas friedman's
sit down throw job with the crown prince in the pages of the new york times i think jeffrey goldberg has topped if you'll allow that phrase even thomas friedman and just how sloppy he can get to this beautiful new prints are precious boy goldberg and talk about big boy in the early kevin was there that
we will probably why they got kevin fired because they're like know too many big boys in one place we will get this kevin saga a moment i visited a very epic i did see a picture of m b s
in his jeans and he is a large you know
they like six five and sick
out of size fifty levi's yeah
he the other thing about that picture it was probably the most disastrous part of the saudi pr push the be as heroin reveal all my
my hairline it's receiving a little bit it's going to be fine i'm doing natural holistic treatments it's going to be backed out where it's supposed to be right in the middle of my eyebrows but cavity will cavity williamson whoops sorry wow good solomon which is the
he as soon as the english version and and that's why i got mixed up his hairline looks like chicken wire
his hairline looks like you need to take a hacksaw to it and go over the top
as you discovered your hairline is currently just than enough to not be able to do corn rows for comedy gags and spoofs be as so you know to all the people who say like oh you'll never know what it's like to have like us or something
actually i do i can't get corner of my hair's is within this is why we're gonna do go fun me for hair plugs so that fields can do cultural appropriation we weren't we weren't getting quarter rose just to have may have corners it was for a video about will little corner
but now i want to get hair plugs that are permanently corner rows just i didn't i small just staple than there so
the crown prince is doing his charm offensive america right now it's part of his big this huge pr push that we've been talking about an issue for a while now all the way back when we talked about saudi vision twenty thirty is bold new plan to reform the kingdom and make it a little bit friendlier que
important allies in the west namely america or rather the american media civic and stop covering the country like it's a you know
totalitarian theocracy that did nine eleven
hello dad doing a genocide right now yeah and are also doing a genocide right now they put out an entire magazine in supermarket shelves across the country that we as a national enquirer i think public yeah it was fifteen dollars and somebody took a picture of it i think it was nebraska or something can you imagine some fucking corn oscar
he's got his mountain dew and his and his mega size doritos that he's waiting for the checkout yeah we know trump country and he sees this picture he sees this thing like wow this guy looks like he's really going to reform the middle east i better take a look i wish i could bet you money on how many trump idiots bought it i bet it's no less than two thousand
oh yeah because cigars and i would think about how i felt that are i think about how many people shot their career eggs or just did whatever idiotic thing like when into starbucks and said her name was the constitution
they probably saw that it was like oh he's nice to trump yeah he's the guy who's going to get rid of all the terrorists because he put trumps fat face on the side of the bill i think what's important now in addition to doing a circular and every supermarket in america the real the real goal here for m b s
the go to guy is jeffrey goldberg if you want a he's the plug if he's the plug he is the plugs so like the one of the most prestigious flagships of the liberal media and is also a committed partisan to the whatever the israeli conflict does or thinks so
dominant partner so that the idea that we don't want to reform saudi arabia and its leaders is very important at a time in which the united states and particularly israel has to tow the line on this rotten country because we all have the same enemies in the middle east and jeffrey goldberg is perhaps one of the most reliable conduits for
for that particular one of thinking be it from the american or israeli intelligence community is this is what this guy existed you it's why he's the editor in chief of the atlantic which i think we'll get into later so let's let's let's begin in this interview here the headline is saudi crown prince iran supreme leader makes hitler look good
you make hitler look good as the beside to give love a bad name
well received the interview begins this much at least can be said for muhammad bin salmond the reformist crown prince of saudi arabia he has made all the right and among those who would celebrate his and are the leaders of isis al qaeda hezbollah and hamas four year olds in the value of quash as well as yemen's
rebels and all of them to sway over the entire clerical and military cigarette models who just want to be left alone
and it says here it goes on he says our conversation took place in prince colleagues living room beneath the painting depicting the nineteen forty five meeting between for president franklin roosevelt and king abdul us has it been south the founder of modern saudi arabia was d j lead shout out to that reference to adam curtis and
film bitter lake which takes its title from that very meeting in the suez canal between roosevelt and the founder of the house of sound and beginning of a beautiful a beautiful relationship that is really blossomed into so many wonderful things in the modern world the collaboration between the postwar united states empire and
fanatical theocratic oil rich saudi arabia has been awesome for lots of fun franchises all over the world you've probably visited their locations and afghanistan the caucasus region
anywhere they just you know they're like when a doctor gets really into franchising subways now that the interview begins where he tees up a nice big easy softball for and b s by saying could you start by talking about islam and the role you think it should play in the world gives him a chance to say islam is a religion
peace
and then go on to say
our duty is to spread the word of god but we also believe in freedom as well but then he says now today and the triangle of evil and goldberg says the triangle of evoke an m b s's yes i will explain in a moment in this triangle they are trying to promote the idea that our duty as muslims is to reestablish the caliph aid to reestablish the
mindset of the caliph it that the glory of islam is in building an empire by force but god didn't ask us to do this and the prophet muhammad did not ask us to do this so he's talking about how fate mindset and he wants to reassure of the readers that saudi arabia and islam the modern version of it does not seek to establish a caliph it by
source
goldberg says about the triangle and yes says first in the triangle we have the iranian regime that wants to spread their extremist ideology their extremist ideology they believe they spread it the he didn't he mom will come back again and he will rule the world from iran and spread islam even to america
like yeah you know all the things that were accused of doing actually it's a ran it's doing it and it's the she
and he's bringing up our good friend the hidden mom everyone take a trick
because you know that the people who actually did try to establish calif it by force very recently
might have remembered hearing about that they really definitely were in favor of all of the she ideas they were very she from when they were they were worshipping fire doing all the bad things that they do i like that
you know they're not accomplish iran his goals on any geopolitical aim they just have to collect the dragon balls
get there one wish to bring ayatollah khamenei back so the first part of the triangle is iran the second part is the muslim brotherhood and the third part where are the terrorists which are al qaeda isis and everyone who believes in calif eight months later
i'm confused
i think it will reveal itself as the interview like the molly it's like in advent calendar
oh week we guards area oh god yeah
oh we get the biggest piece of chocolate it's the mahdi now goldberg is of course a serious journalists you know he's not going to use this opportunity to talk to this young prince not pressing one some hard tough issues
per crown prince salman kinda cause she's six ninety of the n word and bloody as jeffery he says isn't it true though that after nineteen seventy nine but before nine hundred and seventy nine is well the more conservative factions in saudi arabia were taking oil money and using it to export more intolerant extremist version of islam will hardest ideology
be understood as a kind of companion ideology to muslim brotherhood thinking and b s responds first of all this will have his i'm pleased to find it for us we're not familiar with it we don't know about it
define the word please
do you use it in a sense
goldberg says what do you mean you don't know about it
the says what is what hobbies and goldberg says you're the crown prince of saudi arabia you know what will have isn't this them and yes says no one can define this wow of it's like neo liberalism
you know people use for you know that is an old line that is an old line thing that will hobbies is or and then it's not a real thing and they're just normal islam which is pretty cool i mean if the guy started my religion got kicked out of his village for so many women to death i'd probably be like yeah who's that bitch i don't know when
when you're when your main she finds your second phone when your main family finds your second secret family
hobbies and you'd that second family doesn't have to be secret that we talking about will have islam or marco rubio folks marco rubio allegedly so he presses it hobbies i'm an m b s's no one can define will have isn't there is no will have risen we don't believe we have wow
we believe we haven't limit we don't have the thing that we don't know what it is yeah we don't know what it is but we don't have it to define it even if we did have it we believe we have in saudi arabia sunni and shiite we believe we have within sunni islam for schools of thought and then he goes on to talk about those schools of thought and give it a sort of filibuster this long
meandering answer about all the different schools of thought in sunni islam you've got a
and then goldberg gas but what you know he's pressing him here you know this is real journalism today i'm a journalists he says what about the funding of extremists and yes says when you talk about funding before nineteen seventy nine you were talking about the cold war you had communism spreading everywhere threatening the united states and europe and also us egypt had turned
that time into that sort of regime we worked with whomever would get we could use to get rid of communism among those is the muslim brotherhood we finance them in saudi arabia and the united states of america finance them true very true wait does he go on to say they stopped doing it after seventy nine know he well in the cold war they were doing it
and then after the cold war
that's like when they when it became its most coordinated that's kicked it do a his ears and seventy nine after this year the grand mosque
after they were like we could take over to about men and send them overseas the proxy wars and accomplish even more goals
because we have more money now that will holy shit that was the cold war when we had to the fee communism as
yes tells you we
the america funded the muslim brotherhood to this is making a lot of sense to me and this is the first time anyone has be able to explain middle eastern politics to me i'm sorry if i was i was talking to those other girls were and i didn't know you're like me like that
for nineteen seventy nine
so they have a little back and forth but these the funding of extremism and goldberg gets a chance to say this line i spent a lot of time in pakistan and afghanistan in the late nineteen nineties and early two thousands banks jeff wow
you take any interest in cab rides other jeff
about a you angling for an internship
you have a global perspective
my my summer abroad was the most wonderful experience my life so they go back and forth of this and then goldberg says you think you'll ever be friendly with qatar again
as it has to happen one day we hope they learn fast it depends on them
so here's what it gets really good goldberg says it gets to the heart of what goldberg really believes in and wants to get out of this scenario he says you speak extraordinarily bluntly about iran and its ideology you've even equated the supreme leader to hitler what makes him a hitler hitler is the worst thing
you don't want to hitler dude
ib says i believe the iranian supreme leader makes hitler look good
goldberg really hitler didn't want to do with the supreme leader is trying to do hitler tried to conquer europe this is bad goldberg says yes very bad hoping
oh but what does he say that he says hitler tried to conquer europe but what around of you is worse than that but what is as a that iran is your as it is it he doesn't say they want to make the a oh no
in the triangle remember the triangle
right right right
that's why phil jackson and the manager
no to he does sec goldberg says yes very bad an m b s's but the supreme leader is trying to conquer the world
he's trying to counter the world's done a pretty shitty job he believes he owns the world they are both evil guys he is the hitler of the middle east in the nineteen twenties and thirties no one saw hitler is a danger only i including his family who receives him warmly in a close relations with yeah
have heirlooms that hitler gave them that they bought but
so could be nice turned to take over the world mean he's dead a commie and am sorry
i know the supreme leader over i just woke up they should have more than two letters differentiating the learn name oh yeah well that's what makes them worse than hitler yeah well actually the thing you know he was as bad as hitler because is hitler and himmler and they did that to confuse people who was like rabbits season and duck season maybe khomeini's and really dead baby i'm right about that dragon ball
what they're going to bring him back to life when they collect the body balls around is trying to take over the world and we have to stop them before they do just like him doing a very shitty job yeah control like one point five percent of the world have a military budget that the fractional so
the instructional to just look at a map of the nation of iran and persia over the last thousand years to see how many times it's expanded his border
they were really close to taking over the world during the peloponnesian war was young and the first one harvests the spartans stop them
okay so he says here
we want to avoid war and goldberg says is the problem in your mind religious and i b s's as i told you the shiites are living normally in saudi arabia we had our internet
have it and more i wake up i make my key i get bulldoze the job i internal security agents and it has no problem with kids like you said they're living very normal yeah as dollars no shiites no problem so he goes on
he filibusters again very long very long answer on what obama thought about iran vs trump he basically says they both believe that iran is a problem but they are different approaches to see he avoids criticizing obama goldberg said then that ass speaking of painful decisions are you making the situation in yeah
worse through military actions that are causing humanitarian catastrophes there is a lot of justified criticism of your bombing campaigns that is a really artfully worded question and it does bring to mind the freezing and that the new york times or other outlets will use to describe what's currently happening and gaza right now where it's just
like some critics might be saying that your of war is something that they might consider genocidal or the new york times this is a real headline from today
sporadic rifle fire from the israeli side of the gaza border made clear that the palestinian protests could elicit the sort of response that killed twenty people
so going on and b s's answer to this is first of all we have to go back to real evidence real data i'm not a read the rest and be as just scrolling through screens minority report style and half those greens are just instagram models and he's throwing arts and commenting like i love you you're so beautiful home here
the other side of the screen just google like how to pretend something doesn't exist wealth rob
many of us to leave fox dot com masthead and so yeah he let some skate on the idea that he's marina nice entire he and genocide in yemen
and then you know is now much more in the center he gets some to say that israel has a right to exist in saudi arabia has no problem with jewish people either
and that prompted david frum to say that m b s is now officially better on judaism and israel than jeremy carbon is right
as the head of the country where if you were jewish you're not allowed inside in and if you practice the religion openly you will be executed well he is right though i mean this is a better friend to israel and jeremy carbon that's true that's the thing that's all that matters when people when from and goldberg talk about being good do not talk about being good for jews are talking about
creating an environment where where jews are open in a society they're talking about supporting israel that's all that matters because the whole goal for all of these mother fuckers is to get all the jews in israel eventually and turned and just the steroids or nuclear power house down there every single do in israel for a huge part yeah that's the idea
well you know when to big boys get together you get a grip big belly full the truth
i don't care so has all this money to spend on propaganda but they still sell the tabloid they don't just give it away they sell it's because they're in america nothing if something's free it's worthless that is what we know that much about us to know how many fires have you've been given a new
they of thousand yeah we're i would have you followed up on probably the only the fire we are giving out to get a new host for the show gonna
i've got a filing cabinet full of them in one of these days when i get some free time going to go through now
imagine imagine they're like the smartest as they're just hanging out around convention centers selling the b
handing out the issue of now but it's classy and there's fun at the national arabia in it there's garcia
why it's murder money last word puzzle for before we get it the more jeff oh there there has been this in a molten month long posts where b will talk to whatever shitty liberal journalists whether it's goldberger friedman et cetera et cetera
the one thing he got that is worth more than a thousand of those combined
is the rock code sign you up he got code signed by dwayne the rock jobs johnson doing all rock johnson as he is now called it's a very bill maher joke with put it in the real time how about this why doesn't he just by the atlantic or any of these other publications and more than enough money to do it remember when people told us we should run a new site no one wants to get into that business
now you say for this propaganda
effort makes sense that they would sell this fifteen dollar glossy magazine
as counterpoint to that i will direct your gentlemen to the book that i have displayed on my bookshelf
jean paying the governance of china a book that includes many glossy photographs and a fairly high production value high quality given out for free by the government of china can you believe how benevolent here
yeah so i don't know who's doing better president gee baby has which may be the greenest world leader of our time
i am closer to conquering the entire world in iran or saudi arabia and also unlike saudi arabia iran deserves to conquer the world then the interview with m b s there was a good kick off to jeffries we put it wasn't even him just letting this asshole say iran wants to conquer the world with absolutely no push back whatsoever
not even close to being the most embarrassing thing that happened to jeffrey goldberg this week
the most embarrassing thing for sure was the hilarious implosion of the kevin dee williamson saga and his unceremonious canning from the atlantic almost as soon as that fucking
the merciless as we've been calling and that's not a this pronunciation people were saying oh man it looks like a hairy pussy the very smart joke you need a high cute q to understand a jesus christ
so jeffries role in the cavity williamson's is underrated because people have been largely focusing on cold stone steve austin the fan people's eyebrow
is the the el nino of big boys
if if focusing on kevin and and also the intolerant lives and the intolerant lives in weather kevin's a martyr or not but there was the real the real player here is jeffrey goldberg who made the decision to hire him to be a contributor to their new ideas section and when the controversy first started coming out party
luckily kevin's comments regarding that you know women who have gotten abortions deserve to be home hand sorry
jeffries response to that was in effect i don't agree with kevin but it's a tweet come on people it's a tweet you shouldn't judge people based on like a throwaway comment or whatever this was the same argument that brad stevens made and jeffrey was implying that you know again the rules are being too precious it's important to hear other
ideas even if you disagree with them and basically said kevin was talented but he was just trolling he was taking a a needlessly provocative position in an attempt to sort of older with her own lives and stir intellectual debate
are mostly on the lip yeah then it came out kevin williams had indeed said the exact same thing on a pod cast that was a bridge too far
and in jeffries response to it he seemed to say that a tweet is one thing but him saying the exact same thing in an audio version is too much and he said here
he did not want to judge people for their worst tweets are assertions in isolation
but then on thursday mr goldberg wrote in a memo to staff that he had come to see the writers or marks on twitter is something more than merely churlish the editor say the pod cast episode from the same month in was mr williamson elaborating on his anti abortion views the tweet was not merely an impulsive deacon textual realize he did the moment post as kevin had explained it mr goldberg rose for
furthermore the language used in the pod that was for allison with what he runs contrary to the atlantic's tradition of respectful well reasoned debate and to the values of our work just because he was sweating when tweet it it doesn't mean there was any heat in the moment
a quick aside here treated the moment
i'm reading for the new york times coverage of this but it has this little nugget hear that is just too good to pass up the pod cast in question was in national review show called mad dogs and englishman hosted by mr williamson and charles seat of you
the title of that pod cast is more offensive to me than kevin comments on capital punishment for women oh my god that that would be the name of mornings and crew show in the raj if it's still existed
oh my god yeah that's what god that opie and anthony would be called and victorian england just very upsetting
it's hilarious about brothers were is probably like a whiskey review corner or something oh god we have no knowledge in english all the was yeah yeah they drink is jane they're probably smoking really shitty cigars while doing it
given mess of lupus is thinking you have you actually part guess you find a more controversial opinion from kevin he walks back hanging the women and he says
they showed tie them to train tracks
in line with his he's a method method of doing things but what's funny about this is it reveals jeffrey goldberg is an absolute fraud because his hoy whole thing and trying to hire kevin in the first places like he's provocative were a liberal magazine but we're not afraid to challenge ourselves and have ideas from outside the bubble and
then when confronted with kevin's actual beliefs his defense immediately is he's just joking he doesn't really believe that and then he has to walk it back when it becomes obvious that yes indeed he does believe it so it's not about us look and respect someone like jeffrey goldberg has for conservative idea that's that's just it it's that the thing that needs to be
gotten away with completely is the idea that there are any ideas being discussed or were exchanged in any of these things i'm in the times op ed page at the atlantic there are no new ideas being transmitted no one is learning anything you are you are intentionally
riley up an audience for response it is just a click bait model of online publication brought to the mainstream that's all that it is it is totally vacuous that's and that's all that it exists to do that's true but like the other important thing about particularly about what the kevin saga tells us that
the current state of the liberal media is that they are at a crisis point in their crisis point the media
in their sort of self image and conception because the atlantic is a magazine owned by david bradley who is committed ideological neo conservative but souls in pitch to an audience entirely of cosmopolitan liberals new york times has sort of a similar dynamic of with it
the thing is what they are selling to their readership is the fantasy that they are smarter and more open minded than the bang idiotic hordes that are beneath the voters this is was that's the thing this is why it is most the most important qualification for kevin williams center brad stevens or any of these guys is that they're against trunk
here's the problem
these people had their only influence now is with liberals the conservative movement and actual body politic has completely pass them by there is no such thing as a you know anti trump conservative now not on the ground and on the actual going out with any actual influence over government or policy every single anti term conservative
has a column some more exactly there are probably like this is not an exaggeration i believe is my best guess i would say there are probably between five hundred and a thousand people in america who think trump is bad but the iraq war was good
so it all these people have counts and their own influence is with a liberal readership however
the the one more the abortion particularly still is the red line because lives can you know they they're happy entertain thoughts of foreign intervention or cutting social security or free markets however things like wanting to hang women for getting an abortion or just the right criminalization heard demonization of
abortion is still something that most people who read the atlantic rightly one nothing to do with not even nothing to do but like they don't think rightly that it's an idea or a thought that should be given serious treat me like feeling in the magazine that makes him a liberal pro choice exact well they're going to the record away that all this other contrary and islam does it
exactly and here's here's the thing though is like there's no more need for people like heaven dee williams and outside of these sort of you know hot houses like the national review or things that has pitched solely to ideological conservatives have a certain variety
what the fuck use does it have for the new york times of the atlantic the hire these people just a goose their liberal readership and to considering whether maybe we should criminalize abortion these people have no power they have no influence over policy or the conservative movement anymore so what does their value add to a place like the atlantic of and
it's flat in the audience it's to make them feel like yes that are more broad minded than either the looting swine who voted for trump or the anti far hordes of of elaborate leftists and but thing is they still laugh lines you know they still have a lot of things that are unacceptable there have to be because
anything that what the fuck are you you have to have some sort of container and so there has to be a line i think that's beyond the pale and yeah he fucking one across it be in his zeal for triggering lives congratulations you triggered the lips and they don't hire you know because you did it you you're to go to triggering the labs
go back to the national review this dynamic about conservative intellectuals i want to read a little bit from a post by henry feral from this week
that i think really does a very good job summarizing this settle who has any use for conservative intellectuals i want to refill a little bit he says
the conservative movement perceive the need for intellectuals both to hold their own fractious coalition together through fusion isn't in the like and to justify their goals the liberals who dominated the space of serious policy discussions and could possibly stop them liberal policy types for their part needed to understand that what was happening among conservatives and perhaps perhaps hopes to influence
a little the result was that the conservative intellectuals were in a highly advantageous structure or position serving as the primary link between two different spears which didn't otherwise come much into contact as network sociology one or one will tell you this allowed them a fair amount of arbitrage and enough slack that people like jonah goldberg were triggered a serious thank god
remember that
the problem is
saying like
the never trump people number they defected en masse thinking that it was a fairly cheap gesture of independence we all remember the never trump issue of the national yeah they they were born defective and they never stopped not only did this damage these intellectuals personal ties with the new administration and the conservative movement but it opened up the way for
conservatism that basically didn't give a fuck about policy ideas and the need to seem serious any more the result is that conservative intellectuals don't have all that much influence over conservatism anymore the problem is that without such influence over conservatives these intellectuals capital with liberals and the left is rapidly diminishing too conservative intellectuals don't have
much of an audience of that conservatism itself why should people in the opposite side listen to them anymore they're actual ideas are mostly not that strong some of them are good writers but good writing only go so far the only plausible case for paying attention to conservative intellectuals quite conservative intellectuals is that perhaps the pendulum will swing back
after trump and the old regime will be restored that might happen but you wouldn't want to be betting serious money on it and i think that gets it exactly right about this sort of panic that asshole
everyone who has invested so heavily in the idea that it's really important to engage with the thoughts of the other side are at a point now where they really can't continue this charade for much longer because conservatives never ever pretend to take seriously the ideas of of course roles are the left and if you're going to war with they ever ever
even conceive of hiring like a left wing voice to write for the national review or weekly standard and if you're going to pretend to care about the other side's ideas then the other side loves trump get some actual pro trump fucking conservatives get bill metro go to the one
there are zero pro trump columnists at a major mainstream like liberal audience thing so you only have these these ideological unix who have no influence and speak for know what i mean if you're really interested in representing the country get one of those freak ish positive trump reply guys get one of those children look
get well our kids you can't seem to watch their face or wear shirts that fit and just reply like and okay would have loved trump and stuff like that put them in there are no one cares no one knew yeah it's going to represent way more people than yes nightly whiplash or homer simpson in the landlord costume
the other people you're hiring but i think they should be noted that both david bradley and jeffrey goldberg are ideologically committed neoconservatives which means they're happy to fucking deal with social liberals and they don't mind it at all i don't care but they don't give a shit about it they the part that politics doesn't interest him in fact all domestic policy
six are entirely negotiable to them it could shake out any way they be fine as richard nixon
refer to it it's building outhouses and peoria
that's domestic politics to them jeffrey goldberg as even said as much during that i think the two thousand and eight election he said the only question in the selection is what the president will do to prevent al qaeda from getting nuclear weapons everything else everything else you know taxes education infrastructure that's all just window dressing it's the only
question worth addressing and then of course unspoken and that is how to confront iran's militarily as well i object to one point though when you say that kevin williams and was just triggering the lives with his outrageous abortion robotics about his day of the rope fantasy for women
that's not the case this is a very personal matter to him oh that's
the front of the show the baseball crank has been one that have been williamson's are indeed the global defenders recently and correctly points out that you know
consumers have been hearing for years from the left that you know you man should not have a say over women's body this is a women's issue that's what abortion is
apparently that's not the case this is this is a major issue that impacts kevin reading from the crime was kevin feels who voice kevin feels especially strongly oh sorry
now he's that's coming into the little sick but
this is precisely why this is a sin match recall kevin feels especially strongly about this issue because he's a sort of person who could maybe wad have been aborted after nine hundred and seventy three they extend no similar empathy to how this affects him
personally and
links to kevin williamson's big article about the issue which i'll read from right now and the national review this is from twenty fifteen about that twenty week abortion bill adult the house republicans this is the forty second anniversary of roe v wade i never need reminding of which anniversary it is it's always the same as my age i was one of those who entered
the world through a pregnancy of the sort we call unplanned though i do not object to being called the result of human action but not the execution of any human design i was bored about three months call it a trimester before row in my case the result was an adoption mine wasn't as it turns out the sort of success story you'd put in a brochure my adoptive parents were divorced only a few years
later and there was subsequently a great deal of unpleasantness of my home upon which i do not intend to dwell some had happier families some far worse eventually i discovered that i had certain talents which friends encouraged and teachers helped me develop i i could food upside down
that wasn't visible in mirrors i had the uniquely american experience of playing high school football in west texas for what was the longest
friday day walker lights were my friday night frogs
learn to trade at the mighty mighty daily texan at the university of texas and then moved to india to apply it i was editor in chief of a small newspaper for it was thirty and started daily newspaper in philadelphia few years later i failed at that but it was tremendously fun and on are better days we put out a more interesting project and the enquirer i published a few books had a few rejected
i walked in the foothills of the himalayas and driven a convertible through the alps gone into a bar fights pick plated packs preclude as part of a classical guitar do it i would work at the only magazine i've ever really wanted to work at and bill buckley once asked me for a word he was unable to call up at the moment there have been a few rough stretch
cheese and some that have been nearly perfect none of it was optional
papa papa
bought a king is it possible to give somebody like a five hundred trimester murky abortion well that's true that that is the most depressing thing i have ever her okay oh yeah you want to abort me guess what bill buckley placed his lizard hand on my shoulder i got i got my book rejected i've been in a bar fights i've
had a little drug called key law i've driven a car
oh yeah i could go to the movies by myself like that i climbed the gentle foothills of the
get off of the airport the airplane in katmandu congratulations you're in the foothills of the himalayas
i've got into a hot tub without my key shirt on
yeah i think if you're if you're a pro life position is you need to ban abortion or else kevin williams that will be aborted your fucking up because he's not really a sterling example of the people that you want to have have around the this is great to i love the he takes it personally because he could have been aborted because it's
the guys who were like yet dude don't insult the military i actually almost signed up for the national guard up
could have been the
nike fucking crawled out of a dumpster high they all that and who is an after they like scraped him out with this was the climax of the article people like me we unplanned the millions of us now live the first part of our lives outside the protection of the laws of these united states are he's areas of the dred scott
our lives and very often our deaths are instruments of the convenience of others that was different in my case by a matter of months it is impossible for me to know whether the woman who gave birth to me would have chosen abortion if there had been a more readily available alternative a nineteen seventy two i would not bet my life neither good nor bad parts of it on her not choosing oh virgil as you rightly pointed out
weird place now where genetic screening is able to tell earlier and earlier if you're fetus will become a national review columnists and we're in danger of losing them all of them ma'am your child will be perfectly round
things man your child is already trapped in the uterine elevate your child
will never be able to write the new york city subway
two things one he could have been reported before row
a idea that there were no portions before row fuck you're a fucking idiot if you think that people were having plenty of abortions they were just unsafe and and often dangerous for the mothers they would actually throw the baseball crank after that so i am so against it
and to anybody could have been a fucking abortion this idea that only only unwanted that or only a poor women are only people who who who go on to adopted kids might have been plenty of people aboard plenty of women have abortions who are married who have children already it's a choice the tongue thirty percent of ice some estimations of them
african woman and made any of us could have been fucking aboard the idea that he some fucking special to the cinema escapee from logan one are you saying we're also in the protected class of we are a whole lives
guys oh my god we're everyone in the through were all survivors anyone in listening right now i just found out i survived a near death experience
i don't want to protect
my actual send nudes actually would like to talk about this recently personal perspective that you mentioned does the pro life movement no favors to have kevin williams in as they're either as their spokesperson saying the thing that they all actually must never ever actually say which is that if abortion
because criminalize women will be punished with to have to force of lives if not executed
certainly put in jail as is the case in every other country where nothing is illegal like el salvador there are women in jail for having a miscarriage and yes it like that
in indiana to yeah i've done that
not on the law just not on the law and way but we do you do that but also the idea that like had i been aborted i kevin williams and wouldn't be here sharing my brilliant thoughts and writing with you is perhaps not the dust sales pitch either kevin makes the point and his defenders have done this as virgil pointed out there was you're getting into this big debate
this is personal for kevin because you know he missed the cut off by about a week now he's out for justice
and he's out for justice okay the privilege to move it will do better to not use kevin as their spokesperson but me because i actually come from the exact same circumstances discovered i was pouring through a teen mom and adopted very shortly thereafter no i don't i'm not saying i would prefer to be dead
i now that i have my life i'm glad i have it i very well could have been imported but however i'm a few so you were born after road and yeah but that's not that he's assuming he would have been a porn or not will or will order will looper him yeah it's actually a time paradox on my own father and i was i was actually wills by law
your parents i also loop heard i went back and keep going you're doing great dog see this kid i need all hang out if that's right and anyone is is is a survivor of abortion then i think we should go bigger i think you should be tom hanks and they should put these big billboards up that say hey america tom hanks could have been aboard
like all his movies now imagine they don't exist but i mean like for me personally like i know it's i i i believe abortion should be legal i don't think it's a i think it's a moral decision that
woman has to decide for themselves i don't know where i would come down personally on the issue if i was ever involved in a pregnancy
however if you ever have sex will someday we'll find i'll find out hopefully knock on wood however is a tried for years you and me at a thing is the point is
why would an existing and not existing for the moment of conception is so then they could be said about everyone and i'm sorry like if my life just blinked out of existence at the end of a doctor or a unwanted pregnancy well then i can't say that not existing really bothered me before then i actually i'm with character guard earn i'm sorry i'm was shopping
our i think you would have been better if none of us have never been born well like i said now that i'm here it's pretty good and for now for now but again
cheap maudlin sympathy act that seventy williamson is going for by being like i could have been aborted is the cheapest fraud imaginable and people are calling him brave for saying it and it's just like yeah
i love the idea that now he's wreaking his vengeance on the women in the world but now he's another knowing that his defenders have taken up in this his grotesque idea as virgil said his day of the rope fantasies about all the horrible it's out there that would have killed them if he had the chance is defenders are saying well you didn't listen to the full interview he goes on to say
i'm sort of squishy on capital punishment is an idea he sort of waffles on whether he's even in favor of oh yeah
he waffles in a pancake city omelet that oda
he says he says he's not sure if he favors capital punishment but if we do have capital punishment it should be hangings and execute like beheadings rather than lethal injection make get a spectacular as yeah he wants to see the old style capital punishment and then he said he also said that he doesn't believe laws can apply be applied retroactively so
defenders are saying oh he doesn't really want to kill a quarter of all american adult women he just thinks they deserve to die so all of that is totally incoherent by it just made me realize way to me minute all of kevin's politics emanate from him hating his birth mother and fantasizing about murdering but she's not a portion
doesn't matter to him no know kevin hates his adoptive parents that that is definitely true if your readers articles about his relatives in lubbock and how the uttered hatred and can can tell you that he really he hates having he hates his birth mother and adopted mother and all moms everywhere yeah so he hates all parents he's he's like the conservative memes
about david hog and anti
yeah he formed his politics when he saw the beastie boys videos where they throw pie in the mom's face for telling them not the party
it's a gun
i this entire williams that thing though it is a great
you know that museum exhibit where they give you slices of the human body and you get every little part works
this is kind of that for the conservative victimhood complex because there are whole thing or whole thing for a pretty much my entire life has been like oh you're liberals are a bunch of pussies you just come up with these new identities you could go into slot yourselves into make results protected class but the moment it turns around on them it's like no i'm actually in a
abortion survivor
either you know
they who spent years and years and years trying to get everyone fired the fucking dixie chicks that everyone i've i've just kept running have a more recent fucking collin capper nick the second it can be turned on their like you should never go after someone's job and i actually like i'm more sympathetic than most people like i'm more
more negative towards getting anyone fired than i think anyone in this williamson debate from those fucking people who did that more than anyone who pretty much got the ball rolling on all all that shit
whenever it can be possibly turned around and then suddenly they have every type of identifiable
identity quantify or and they're just so opposed to going after anyone's livelihood and the enemy and who gives a shit kevin williamson is going to be invited back into the castle
while he's liberals landlord and also i mean sorry jeffrey goldberg you fired him but once you invite a kevin williams and in your magazine he goes
get some fucking garlic buddy one kind of parents medical thing though
i would like someone to explain someone of the of the connor fry corps or brett steve
people by the way is a molly hemingway brought this up is connor fry core is he going to resign from the atlantic you really should going to resign design connor resign be principal buddy but there i need them to explain to me what what or tweets
our tweets an example of the budding hive mind of a liberal neo stalinists enforcing political correctness on people or a place to blow off steam that doesn't mean anything
which is it because the people who are saying they're just tweets like brad stevens wrote their tweets the guy written approximately five million columns
about the awful tweets of the left that prove that were headed towards blogs so what the fuck is a tweet is it only a tweet when it's one of your fellow media class schools and when it's the hoi it's pitch works maybe that's i guess that's the thing
certainly per he made a good point about this a while ago and he brought it up again with regards to the williamson just like going i sort of said it earlier but people in the liberal media class are very invested in this idea that they are charitable and open minded to their colleagues on the right so much show that they invest this idea
to invest so much in this idea that it's just intellectual debate it's just tweets they don't actually believe the things they claim to nobody could possibly i believe that you could execute a woman for making a painful but personal medical decision
no sorry there are plenty of people who really do fucking believe that and what's more this whole like abortion pro choice pro life debate on the question of punishment is actually a very good one that i think we should be having and that i think the pro choice side needs to be asked quite point blankly what punishment pro life pro life started
well
it's it's easy to confuse other
that's both the people who want abortion criminal lions should be asked and they should be made to answer quite frankly what sort of criminal punishments will be in store for not just the doctors are the women who procure them let's say you drive a woman to a clinic let's say you give her money to get an abortion
are you an accomplice to murder as well there's a whole litany of crimes and accomplices that can be opened up now and i think there should be forced to delineate exactly what kind of punishment is in store for these people should roe v wade be overturned and they get an abortion in a state where it becomes illegal because it really does expose
fundamental problem for the anti choice people that has been kept at bay just because it's not it doesn't come up because it's on the context of of roe vs wade the the the implications like the actual legal implications are sort of pushed away because it's still theoretical but
the because abortion most the hinge on this question of whether a fetus is a person and it is something that is metaphysical impossible to know all you do is you have intuition is one way or the other and those sort of shape your politics from it but two people most people intuitively if you told them who has more rights
pullman woman who like you could talk to him who has a name and a personality and memories
can speak words and and has like bob hope
tv or whatever might be a real gamer girl exactly has a favorite book
and a dime sized collection of cells
people will intuitively say the woman and that that understanding is i think what goods the sort of ambient pro choice belief that people have but it's all kind of soft because there's no real consequences to what it's all just sort of i guess but when you put it in the terms of okay should a woman to get
the portion be killed or thrown in jail for years
the incongruity between the life being protected and the life being either ended or basically destroyed by prison is so vast that people are able to make that oh okay now i understand i'm pro choice it should also be noted that even in a pro row american society and from you know much of human history he
even religious institutions like the catholic church for instance regarded
terminating a pregnancy before what was known as the quickening as to be not abortion before they've seen highlander to rely know the quickening meaning like when you can feel it kick like
returning to meant see i mean what are the most covertly evil associations everyone america the may we can thank them for a lot of our current abortion debate framing and then i ever get out there and they said they sort of pushed the line as terminate pregnancies are unacceptable or like it that it's ending a human lives
one to killing a baby a like infanticide am a rock stood wonder why we don't wonder why we don't why our healthcare system is sort of like a cruel practical joke rube goldberg device or why we frame abortion is like you were trying to kill kennedy williamson thank you to the may also starting the method
anyone just can't become a doctor we could do it
i think we're we're almost out of time here but before we go i wanted to bring up these to quote you asked me to source oh yeah over yeah so
when closing thought really said before we go back into the the jeffrey goldberg story i just think what all this proves is whether it's like the new york times of the atlantic are all these supposedly liberal institutions who want to challenge their liberal leadership and open their ideas to critiques from outside their comfortable bubble
forget this bullshit on the right right them off completely if you really want to challenge people who are liberals challenge from the left that would be useful in a civilized liberal society the debate should be between liberals in the current democratic party and those on their left everyone to the right in that
they had no have ideas they have cruelty and corruption that's what they offer look who's president look at the movement as it actually exists not this like fantasy parlor game that you have in your head write them off completely you're not closing yourself after like being open minded by writing them off it's called exercising judgment and just a
bear level of morality
yeah and i want the pages of the atlantic to be a sparkling debate about whether the labour aristocrats of the core capitalist country
can
or spread out forcibly spread out throughout the rest of the world that's the fucking debate that's worth half and now it's certainly make their readers uncomfortable he addresses they're looking way or than fucking breath stevens part about another column of all college students seriously though if you want interesting people in there who actually have an audience because i guarantee you know when it's clicking on these other
fucking articles get brianna grey alex press or ryan who are so many people you could hire that would write interesting things that people would actually read that will prompt the beloved parlor debate you love so much that burning is excellent at trolling the lives lost all my name
he still lives let's get him on there you know but again you fucking put jason a who ruin their no seriously i really i'm not kidding either may want to interesting in there i want my was third world is them to be something that these guys have to grapple with and set of something they've literally never heard of none of these people actually believe
that like the institutions that they preside over should cater to every conceivable view so just quit lying to yourself and keep the right in their own little silos are they belong their own little funny farms talking to themselves you don't need to engage them they're not they're not intellectuals they're not they're not serious thinkers
they're not serious writers like i said they represent cruelty and corruption and that's it i'm talking about williamson people might have this might have cost him his job but if you are talk about his ideas hanging women have had abortions is literally the only idea he's ever had the distinct
like william sony and as opposed to just bog standard conservative massage therapy which is the rest of his fucking i'll put you wanna pick somebody who would actually really piss people off but he wouldn't do it just advocating has been sort of woman genocide actually interesting and actually right put it all read in there who oh mama
you would piss the lives
i'd funny how every eight over he could actually fucking right but again it gets back to the essential dynamic at play here which is that for committed neoconservatives like goldberg and bradley and the people who run the times opinion page what is really out of bounds is the left they what they think out of bounds is hanging bankers who are responsible for the finance
so disaster or for the holes who started the iraq war that to them is out of bounds and that is why that they will always continue to play for see with these
oh fait ball the just tubs of it have de williamson or up
with h l merkin
let's go back to the north to the story of jeffrey jeffrey origin this is a funny know i assume you've talked about this on the show before in your in are now what this is a two hundred assistance for one hundredth episode where we should have done something more fuck we had like fireworks at the start i don't know
okay you may have talk about this but he's had an interesting post college story i'm reading from a ring from our posts made in the atlantic actually in response to glenn greenwald calling for comment clarification asking if he took a loyalty oath when he joined the idea of here's the quote
as a teenager i felt a bit like david ben gurion set adrift on long island i thought that israel might have been meant to be my true home so i moved there in my early twenties only learned that in israel i felt like george washington know the rest of the paragraph does not make that makes sense
why did he gets teeth pulled one of us are here
here's the money quote from eggs this is from an interview that was posted on his website but taken down for some reason
i was a social his eye and it's growing up on long island i lived in a non jewish part of long island and i are the usual or something between usual an unusual experiences with school yard anti semitism and those experiences sent me in a way to seek out some answer about my jewishness my parents but sooner or later regret site and take me to israel for my bar mitzvah
what i was there my eyes were open to the idea of jewish power i didn't put it in quite that way to myself that but that's the way it worked seeing israeli soldiers jewish soldiers more to the point jewish tanks jewish machine guns was quite exciting to a powerless thirteen year old boy suffering at the hands of irish pub remus children
about wrong
rock broke the irish were slaves walk the irish did the hall
well that is very edifying though because it hits are very very western pathology politics or not the execution of power and opposing forces and division of resources it's personal discovery third all the palestinians i really have to find myself as a growing up i had cool tanks and machine guns it was bad
it's not business as you that there's nothing ennobling about about being abused her pressed because this guy got punched by some oh doyle brother and then he decided to go to palestine isaac beat the shit i would say what the scientists that person to say said kristallnacht has nothing to laugh about us even save getting punished or beaten up he just says schoolyard bullying which just means they're probably
being a little butterball yeah yeah
the cast of and burns movie called
here's a here's what is so telling about that quote about like just being around jewish tanks and jewish soldiers this little pussy had to fucking travel to a foreign country and then be the scans in what he regarded as his own personal military state just feel any shred of self confidence
that just even be safe that way then he had to assert himself on prisoners on armed shackled prisoners
isn't this a zionist eat pray love but with jfk is it just eat eat eat eat eat pray love
so he goes in the early nineties he joins the idea of him loose israel and then becomes a a prison guard and here's what he says about this
it was hopelessly exotic for me i mean i'm from the south shore of long island and then all of a sudden i'm in the negev desert by the egyptian border as a prison guard in what's probably the largest prison in the middle east record scratch charting the future leaders of palestine it was pretty exciting
hi you're probably wondering how come to hot dry american summer
so yeah i know he felt like i said he was a fat kid from america is probably a nerd probably never got way probably felt inadequate and he had to join another country's colonial military force to feel good about himself is like wouldn't make love and hung out with the cops this is wonderful says
enriching journey of self discovery if jeff goldberg have been bored forty years later he would have been that college aged woman who go try to fund raise crowd fund her second birthright trip
man that is deep twitter long now it should be noted that in two thousand and twelve he tried to walk back what he wrote in his own book about being a prison guard and he said he says here in an interview about it he says the actual title of my position was prison counsellor men or not
i saw
i got to go to the big counsellors deaths he goes a proper translation is prison counsellor
i saw the just across the lake to the woman's prison
oh and counsellors he goes i know a lot of palestinians think you might have a state one day i'm going to tell you it just doesn't matter
doesn't matter
that
jokes on you critics the actual hebrew translation of my job title was prison virgin
so all of this just leading up to of course jeffrey was a put your hand in my pocket your lead is mine
jeffrey of course then went on to become a huge boost year for the war in iraq saying in october of two thousand and two in five years i believe the coming invasion of iraq will be remembered as an active profound morality nailed it
reality morality
you know what maybe that self discovery in the prison really paid off very present lead little jeff in two thousand and two he also said of people saying hey maybe this iraq or is unjustified in a terrible idea he says here
arguments made against invading iraq are made by people with limited experience in the middle east their lack of experience eaten up a single
lack of experience causes them to reach the naive conclusion that an invasion of iraq will cause america to be loads in the middle east rather than respected great called you have all the all the people who made that call who you know just by accident were one hundred percent right they never had the self confidence that you get is a fact
in long island who was bullied by the brothers big mall and
showed it up and gets the to the blow job from a board idea of conscript a man all those articles feeling for the iraq war that was self care okay who were you to judge jeff goldberg just quit the atlantic put a cash on me link is bio so anyway jeffrey goldberg exercising the same judgment and his kevin williams and higher
as he did in his iraq war predictions hard to say which one will prove out to be worse in the long run
well you know
had that seventy williamson saw his own shadow and big boy season ended
right so that about does it for our a retrospective on the career of jeffrey goldberg and our profile of abortions survivor having millions and if you've learned anything today all the members of the show abortion survivor so please stop us
