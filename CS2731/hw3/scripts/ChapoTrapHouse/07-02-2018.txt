chapel this week said to report
sick and she was don't fret you still got a full house that's ringers that we're bringing in to replace starting with t our friend a rookie roles host of champagne sharks t v what's going on
everybody doing
full name now is preferable you it's all good
trevor dogs to you heard of docks
joining in joining now on a sweltering day in brooklyn one hundred degrees that new york city so we're feeling is here to stay but also
for into the show catherine krieger
nothing
again catherine krieger of splinter in an active blatant cronyism on my heart so guys it's been a week now since the local elections
since the special enough the special elections is the democratic primary we talked about on our last show alexandria kazuo cortez and her stunning upset victory and at the end of our most recent show i said
you are going to see in the coming days and weeks a reaction to the casio cortez his victory that is going to try to get you to doubt yourself or to believe that it's not important and more importantly than anything to try to get you to believe that the democratic party should absolutely not
even for a second think that this could work or that there's a future in it
so i'd like to go through now a week's worth of takes and analyze them with my co host and our guest hosts let's begin with
in yellow green home in business insider headline democrats need to choose are they the party of alexandria of casio cortez or the party of michael bloomberg don't make me choose it's a tough choice
sophie's choice yeah democratic are in a way out
compromise can't we have universal health care and band soda
the two choices
not a democrat and someone who is about universal healthcare but the stop and frisk every patient
many common
daniela greenbaum by the way i looked into her she is basically like the off brand barry ways but she went to that are ram she went to barnard and political and went to the wall street journal and was also had of barnard's like young college scientists the organization that's not even like a go back to a transformers that's like come
some like thai thing called transforming machine
so
daniel our rights
the republican party had a big tent
then in two thousand and sixteen it's fringe elements elected donald trump leaving moderates and politically home were weird how talented election the fringe somehow one that's kind of odd that would seem like by definition the fringe would be the minority fringe elements of the republican weird who again
an overwhelmingly voted for now approve of the donald trump is doing as president elected president leaving moderates politically homeless and democrats
and democrats both politically and emotionally disturbed there's too much going on their weights of the republican party was the party of the fringe and the moderates and the democrats with the party of the fringe doesn't say it's just says that they're in disarray but it just says just
the can party had a big tent right about an ad
the moderates all ten of them who know who i'm voting for hillary clinton yeah who are now what holding us hostage
til the democrats get serious about deficit reduction there are you going to they're going to write out there their support yeah they're going to write in george h o you push your colon power whatever stupid thing old people do they had a big tent but then unfortunately the ted became small and they just wonder presidential election related yeah ok
like the center been got pulled out and it fell on everyone and they were all around the classic circus yeah
so she says here
the news this week highway two very different kind of democrats earlier in the week kinda familiar rumors and rumblings that former new york city mayor michael bloomberg amateur know them
former new york city mayor michael bloomberg was an independent his entire republican yeah yeah yeah well he was literally never gonna grant is planning to run for president in two thousand and twenty the he be calm a democrat at some point she says your bloomberg is a political independent at the moment but reports have suggested he would run this time as it ever economic so
he's what do you guys what do we gotta do to get the job with the race speak at the dance
gonna be all smoke and loved it was a primetime speaker for hillary yeah
we've heard because he smelled up on a on a snack or phone
with women men who are not going out to never for new york city mayor now
always ran as an independent and a republican or a couple of young was just wasn't holding them a burning that being a real democrat
no doubt that that's totally unrelated well now michael bloomberg is now a democrat by like the transit of properties of a theoretical future state in which he might run as a democrat yeah i'm bloomberg is also about a or a bunch of money into the mid term's right if you see those your court republicans like peter king of
every cycle early on there some story about some rich asshole who is going to spend a billion dollars on one party or the other parents go hundred and one ever check the receipts on i i i'm going to spend five billion dollars to elect a libertarian those iron in your first virgil spending five billion dollars the hope
the natural law party is coming back the koch brothers do legitimately de lay down huge amounts of money and sheldon adelson to they actually do spend a ton of money on the problem to me as if you do have the receipts there's no cause a different problem isn't why i just one person or to brooklyn people donating billions and once the quid pro quo
now they just they love america they want to see well here's the thing i think what happens is they start off really early on and say we're going to spend all this money but then it comes with the and strings attached and then when a candidate gets dominate that their likes to donald trump they say oh not we're not spending that money and more well he didn't need any money though matter self made neither with michael bloomberg
the beloved had tea and yellow rights we've heard this before but the question of whether the seventy six year old will actually run this time around is far less important than the question of what democrats would do if he or someone like him does the answer to that question of course is that there are there is no the democrats right now there is the parties left for
orange and then it's more centrist counterpart on tuesday twenty eight year old alexandria a casio cortez dethroned representative joseph crowley a power powerful democrat who had been a ten term incumbent across sea of cortez self describes as a democratic socialists and espouses many views that differentiate her from other members of the democratic party
some of those differing views are plainly contrary to those traditionally held by democrats others are simply more extreme fringe variations on the usual themes
she advocates for gun control in criminal justice reform but she's also called for medicare for all at a federal jobs guarantee without advocating a concrete way of paying extreme measure and and where it her to pay for its her solutions and only source of axes check this out she goes with out a concrete way of paying for these
three managers her next sentence her solution to these sorts of issues tax wall street
that would seem to be answering the question and outside that anything concrete about how to pay for any such a stance on a black harry potter
important democratic
that's closer to where you stand on the once her plant tax the rich and than ten minutes of sputtering
there's no concrete that kind of rich oppressor vs poor oppressed framework might work on your on more exciting congressional district yes but it is sure to fail on a national level in states like south carolina alabama arkansas georgia tennessee state region
louisiana and mississippi where hillary clinton significantly outperform bernie sanders in the primaries a more centrist approach like that of bloomberg would still garner much more support i'm not a and kidding me oh problem bravo had to where is the goal to win primaries and lose those states my story
it seems to be that democrats in the south voted for hillary because she was more centrist than bernie and i honestly don't think that there's any evidence there's no leverage for that those electorates are usually ideologically further to the left that i would think bt and
primary voters yeah but they just they tend to like reflect sort of local leadership price rhinos people are were long time connected to the clintons i mean what she's really suggesting is michael bloomberg stop and frisk bear would sweep
the southern democratic primaries that are like eighty ninety percent african american voters yeah
sure there isn't as daniel says there's an added benefit to support a candidacy like bloomberg there would be cross i'll support a national candidate who runs on the same platform on which cause your marquez in new york gubernatorial candidate cynthia nixon are running will not garner meaningful republican support even in the age of trouble but a bloomberg
i could attract all those republicans a former republicans who as a result of trumps ascension have found themselves politically home
i voted for hillary or going to pick up all of though not all of good
for for hillary hillary clinton
then voted for hillary none of them
why would they fought for michael fucking blow up or it's worth noting that michael bloomberg ran three races for bear and in only one of them did he win by more than three four percent he doesn't really have to all his that his hit the last time he ran for mayor he almost law yes you are bill time said as i think it was very very close much else
that got it okay i wanted to us all the democrats can do is run candidates that are further and further right in hopes of as democrats and in the hopes of getting knows orphaned republic getting those honestly and twelve
yeah let's most amazing the the news they can learn from decades ago but you can even learn from just last year they know that the speech that who did this whole segment of a dedicated to this mythical west wing republican like this and republican who was just go crazy when
be reminded about how we care about this country above everything and it's good republicans in the regards to drop whatever they were doing what you be heard the speech and splitting donald trump's phase and be like mr trump this is not the american i grew up knowing that didn't work on his face and it was any two thousand and sixteen
yeah this genuine psychosis i do want to go back to one point though
i remember the last year jackson mississippi elected lumber a our revolution working families brigade ran promising to make jackson the most radical city on the planet
bloomberg country right there were bluebirds going to do stop for a second hug he's not a fine
it's going to win over all the good news similar tammy duckworth senator tammy duckworth cents a day again sort of just being like now let's not get carried away saying of a casio cortez you know that her message can win in the bronx a can't win in the mid nothing can yeah has they just fucking lost the midwest
yeah you might as well say one of the midwest nothing in women in the midwest we should burn it to the ground and just frolic in the ashes are just forfeited to republicans for a generation which isn't a paid i want to have its kind of gas learning because they use lost their know we didn't
i've got nothing on
the one you got your candidate you got your message you got your chance to triangle eight a month yeah he'll off every moderate republican soccer mom
and world war two dad young evangelical you got every you got your perfect chance to do a phone off with racist ties who's just destroys every concept of what statesmen the supposed to be worse is incredibly competent incredibly moderate
candidate and none of them fucking voted for at all that the test has been done that
data is in no
sorry this isn't a thing this is scott like a difference of opinion this is literally a thing happening and millions of people deciding it didn't fucking happen
it is a group psychosis have ever encountered those people and still see them online where they see you talking about somebody calls your quarters of someone else
oh friends were this you don't like winning elections you just lost like say
he talking about that they're like talk to me when you win an election you get your ass non stop everywhere
i guess you know like when a lexus she just wanted an election
she just one she beat a guy who's been there for nineteen years he was one of the biggest guys the democratic party
she just wax him by double digits oh but how that one that said there was because of hillary you see that one that was a really good year she was the message from that one was hillary open the door and now we're seeing candidates like cycle casio cortez walk through a sometimes i thought a lot
honestly i have a lot of the wrong
she loosened the lid on the pickle jar
or our abilities of the bronx here's another good one version i you saw this one today
news max tv host he's a former n y p d officer from the from queens who retired to florida and is also a rebel tv host drink in that bio for just like going to return a wing conservative media
he was going off of a daily mail hit on no casio cortez which basically amounted to
she claims to be socialist but grew up in our house
they found the photo of the how she grew up in in westchester county which is not the bronx it's only the county literally next door to the bronx it was a very small house in westchester which is not monolithic rich obvious yeah not a guardian
large minority population there are very large or population there and it was this very small how's it look like a servants quarter and the men occurs
a
gotcha
ouch of right there and the her school run is it and if she were to prestigious brown university i went to boston university
factor because the you have a very basic a veil
and thought that been brown university even though it's never referred to by that ever like the idea is like she claims to be from the bronx but actually spent part of her childhood in neighboring westchester county right i gotta i gotta done i here's a good one
this is the next piece by lloyd green opinion contributor to the hill who know the hills always gets one
ron anyone void green used to be opposition research council so the george h w british campaign and nineteen eighty eight and later served in the department of justice
okay so this guy begins with by saying he was let us be clear that oh sea cortez is an unvarnished leftist think of jeremy corbin and bernie sanders just younger and and grizzled wasn't varnish this
that's a good cricket
who's have varnished leftist yeah
been the fuck off i'm not amish not socialism is her badge of honor when she claims that hamas is simply a palestinian analog to the ferguson protests take her conviction is a given you can also place a good bet that come two thousand and twenty kazuo cortez will be the keynote speaker the democratic national convention would you think about that
last one do you think that's a safe bet
it all now
if they were smart it will be but i mean over we're going in this episode but again this is another example of how someone who is ostensibly on the right actually does it better job of describing cause your cortez his politics then for instance nancy pelosi or tammy duckworth like sean hannity graphics tear yeah excuse me this is not
someone on the right this is this was a respectable conservative from george h w bush was an honorable man i love his socks
so he goes the pupil is about to become the teacher and that she'd been sort of the pupil is if that's become that's not sure
that should come as no surprise well democratic leadership in congress is predominantly old and white their core voters or anything but in two thousand and sixteen minorities made up nearly forty five percent of the votes for hillary clinton
yet the democrats was slow to react to this reality now they have little choice as they stand on the brink of becoming a majority minority party redistributed policies and identity politics room is fast approaching storm clouds on a nearby horizon clinton tony a neo liberalism of the triangulation just got pelted with a left hook to the jaw and the parties to bars are looking
dazed and confused
yes lot of rain down and then friedman level of mixed metaphors
that's crowd democratic party failed to reckon with minorities
built to reckon with the fact that they're about to become a majority minority party and most of their support or nearly half of it comes from minority voters i think he's just saying that the leadership is disconnected from reality together is not me the lie is actually a better me of the better the better analyzed
article than the previous ones yet every because greenbaum is obviously offer any under this enormous delusion that there's some huge swath i mean this guy's article says democrats can kiss swing voters could buy i think swing voters is like a bogeyman term at this point
i don't think it really exists
whoever you want it to be in any given argument by he needs white voters
voters who won't vote for a party that is dominated by non whites yeah exactly so white racists borders the unicorn that he's saying that yeah pretty much i want to jump to the end here he says you're wealthy swing voters will not by kazuo cortez selling wealthy democratic moms and scars
generally roll their eyes is cynthia nixon if the polls are be to be believed nixon trails andrew cuomo by more than thirty points in new york and the primaries less than three months away yes some saw their younger selves and miranda hobbes then they grew up going back in time it was fun to be hip watch your folks hate on richard nixon hang out at the saloon on broadway
are all the bars to the bar at the saloon
or with it
spit into the platoon allowed clanging noise but turned into a bar fight will someone starts a player piano a giant tumble broadway but to burn wall street down to the ground is a whole other story who does not secretly wants to be related to a hedge fund god or apartment
this is where this is what this article gets really interesting because up until then he was i think giving a like an okay a pretty honest assessment of like what that guy's view of politics was like looking at someone like cortez but now like like when he's projecting all this other stuff on like who he thinks his audiences is very strange telling out absolve yeah
who yeah who does not secretly want to be related to a hedge fund
on but parties and say yeah my brother works and wall street
yeah i want to go to the hamptons get red eyed poisoning
idiot cousin and after he brings in a bunch of like oysters the oldest the follow up is even better he says let us face it the big short was mesmerizing i think he missed the point of that movie
the point of the big show it was not that like these guys around the world big short is how cool yeah it's all is mesmerizing and who wouldn't have wanted me married or were only two girls walking around in secret of using the big short with the wolf of wall street because i would make sense with wolf of wall street the big sure
short all of the nerd
yeah like i wouldn't want to be like christian bale just bang and hunt around and sell for
money but even both for wants
i think the lesson was ostensibly that look at him as the euro know
as an hour
disagree
i want to be like termites drugs are cool as period is going like all the scorsese movies
during you into this incredibly flashy and dollars in existence and slowly teasing out a morally bankrupt it is but the whole point like you don't get to be a fucking guy who does open for george w bush and right for the hill and have an intact conscience so you're not going to get the twinge that a regular person gets watching them maybe that's not right
just like cool cool cool lambeau cool cocaine cool because another that registers as anything weird he finishes by saying trump is working hard to trash the first amendment shred the rule of law and gut reproductive freedoms but when the smoke clears kazuo cortez maxine waters and democratic progressives
may well leave greater and more lasting cultural and economic resentments
so the theme of these first two beginning that daniella and now with lloyd at the hill is the idea that the democrats are really playing with fire when they are advancing an agenda that really appeals to the people who vote for them when they should be advancing an agenda of the people who watch the big short and was like
well i wish i was related to steve corral that last paragraph is incredibly important because he says explicitly he says trump is doing all this awful stuff and swings suburban voters are horrified by it but if you suggest that anyone's going to come for their fucking money they're going to not give a shit about first amendment or
or child prisons or but getting rid of row
choices all that stuff or you raise their taxes you do any kind of redistribution they're going to fucking switch and the thing is he's probably right about that because but that and that really would doom any kind of movement lot too early in this country because the people who vote generally are a collection of relatives
well off middle and upper class people and they have economic interests that align with that and left a left wing democratic party is going to alienate them and the only argument against that is that maybe just maybe people who aren't middle and upper class aren't comfortable in this fucking me
pressure hello world we're living in might be attracted to that and think for the first time in a while it might be worth it to vote for the spurs why here's the other thing we live in a two party system and necessarily until our
means of electing a legislature were to change radically it's always gonna be a two party system and right now some sixty percent of the country is irrespective of their class interest alienated by donald trump an alien by the republican party because they can see how batch insane these people are so they have
no choice except to stay home
i think you can in this moment and just in this moment
use these resentments against the trump administration to augment this kind of hypothetical oh cause your court has coalition
and i think that would be a workable majority but only in the short term i think you're right that ultimately any kind of like actual redistribute of policies would you know shuffle the dac again and question is there any proof
nose or any proof for research that shows people actually vote this way as and i live in this part of the country but a thousand miles away
they
this person one this is going to change how i'm gonna treat my home election based on what's happening in the europe because really proved to be partially think this way because i mean just always been the french candidates
not a green that fringe but just to accept a hypothesis at the putting forth is always been my candidates were electing different states have different series
oh that's kind of a weird but the go by your business when started to vote in your
local election i wonder if people really think this way it's probably just go to reinforce your original perception of the parties and not change that much i mean you saw the insane tea party candidates two thousand and ten
he did not do that much of a disservice to the republican party overall i think what matters it is i think this basic conception of this moderate voter that's out there that is disgusted by donald trump but is afraid of anything to left wing is probably accurate but i think it shows that any election strategy we live
hang on these people is absolute was no because because those people were either cultural democrats like they lived in one party democrat states like massachusetts or california where if you are in any way kind of conservative you would still probably run on the democratic ballot line and there
not going to go with the republican party those states aren't going to realign not rapidly anyway so for the time being they don't have a home and if you want to talk about the these these suppose a moderate republicans as bad or it out there they're not voting for the democrats anyway they didn't do it we did that test they didn't vote they wrote in john k sick
or they voted for gary johnson and that's it but i mean i think i think this underscores the point of why some y o casio cortez one is because she went after people who are normal democratic voters who probably never voted before or have stopped vote i don't honestly people say that she says that i'm
not sure if the evidence backs iraq because there wasn't like wasn't a big boost in turn right if you comparing apples apples other competitive races in new york
it's a similar amount of votes so i mean i think she just had a message that resonated with those people who turned out and i think that's a strong take away her as great i think people kind of and the rest me how i know a lot of people were talking about her as people who are normally politically engaged or sharing them on youtube
people think differently now a youtube is such a big deal
i smoke it whereby a type of things that get tons of views in hits on on youtube and i think that really helped you get a good narrative
yeah she wasn't inspiring age was running against a rotten out of touch incumbent and i think that goes to show how strong messaging and strong campaigning and having very talented hardworking leaders candidates volunteers can
when primaries over with a far left platform a competitor who views as she is way more prisons and those errands and way more empathy building in those as and any hillary at the spring years in the air for different things and she just never for
fraction of their reliability starting it's tough to compare our who doesn't certain states are certain areas compared to the two different people you know i mean in the home stretch that election two thousand and sixteen the horizon feature her ads feature donald trump yeah she then one add the long one where it was just that slow close up of her face the closer
and i was just her talking about her her resume she was qualified ah she was the most care the most qualified candidate of all time
the he also seems to be arguing that
weapon rising economic present is a bad and the other side has had no problem weapon isaiah racial animus for natural selection but for decades well yeah but that's that's fine with him it's not going to hurt him
officials and but it might end up hurting his pocket and try to get a job whipping up call an economic growth
and truck with more willing to talk labored and hillary sadly enough like in those debates i mean you to have any good solutions for him but he was willing to admit something was broken whereas hillary would just like it's really out there was really pathetic because a lot of those flipped well so obama to trump flip phones can often be described explain just by the fact that he was ill
really the only candidate saying the word jobs
only one the rest she didn't talk about jobs at all
resume and she talked about how vulgar and massage and racist donald trump is which should true of course and peppers
and debate that wasn't enough
i mean here's the real think it's something that i've argued for a long time now the democratic party absolutely does not and should not be does not need to be an absolutely should not be a big ten part and whatever anyone says like oh we got we need have a big tent you being too much of a purist about this i mean you should
when their face because the wrong they don't know what they're talking about a big ten party with no means it has no ideological moorings means it cannot lead it cannot legislate it means it's going to be inertial and it's just going to rot and lead time and time again to any movement no matter how repugnant
it's a movement such as i don't own fascism
that does have some kind of potency that's not as innovative as a big ten party that's just oh hey come on and you can just park your ass here
just hang out with righteous the party of principle where the party opposed to on accountable while the people get to feel warm and fuzzy about forging temporary alliances with moderate republicans who will stab them in the back the first second but we're not even talking about forging alliances because when you talk about a big ten party you're not you're not you're not saying we're going to do
national politics you are saying we need to water down any our platform our speech anything we believe in order to accrue these you know free radical voters and we saw and twenty six seen it can't happen it's not the case these modern republican
they believe repugnant things they could never ever and thousand years build a and elect really popular movement of their own so they have to kind of like like
bacteria
float around looking for a host where they can spread their shitty fucking ideas
there was a tweet you put up i think perfectly
describe as there's no you're right i use of alice mouse and
usually read it out
who's kevin feeling i don't know who he is you put up a tweet he some oh i see our allies some guy and live with an archer and or archer avatar which is all you fucking years are you need to know walk off like this kind of shows that for a lot of these people what you describe is a feature and that a bug that this idea that there is no logical morning
in matches there but it's a typo
the almost like been put upon for a noble
this is the price we pay for being noble were kind of bad luck but we have our principles and i think the impotence is actually a feature not a bug but you put of this tree and is said in liberals ideal world they still do they still don't win and this guy's treat is something i was kicking around last night
what about a perpetually balance court something like ten justices five live five con
so what every major decision deadlocks every time yes he's a spot or even his wildest dreams
this nation is to just be imprudent you to that
as lame i blame the introduction of the world cup and soccer culture in america for that wretched kind of thinking wear ties or and isn't even occurred
the rest of it says his vision as replacements coming from party regardless of who is in the white house so basically whoever you need to bounce in the matter who's in the white house you get for to be like it would be like the lebanese constitution where the president has to be sunni and the prime minister
necessarily the president is maronite and like the speaker of parliament is a she is of money point that's what it would be somebody and fighters five spots for the dams five for that and one of the five dams dies in a hang gliding accident or something they are replaced by the dams and somebody pointed out that this was the plot
have a west wing episode yeah yeah yeah
yeah two spots the phil and he could have gotten to mediocre liberals or he could have gotten one brilliant liberal legal mind if he put up there with equally brilliant one of those babies about build the perfect boyfriend
got two dollars
but the thing is that guess what it does it matter if they're fucking moron it doesn't matter if they need a helper monkey is to feed them if they vote the right way and and vote for the left position on an issue it literally doesn't matter if the writing their a concurrent with crayons there
brilliance means nothing that's the fetish that they have is who but they're so smart who gives a fuck how fucking smart they are what matters is how they're going to vote and i remember there were a lot of people when the gore such thing was happening with course it's got nominated i saw a couple of people insisting you can't go you can't drive a snap go
message you should take or such because he's so good scholar he's a good judge my god
you might not agree with him but he's smart think of who truck
from could pick if you don't pick him he could pick someone qualified as a matter of gonna take up hitler
attach it to a fucking car battery if you put them on the supreme court it's still just one vote it's still just the fight for what were the other all that matters is how they're going about doing reddit be imprinted with good optics then be like a powerful winning but in civil i think it's because they have no skin the game
they actually don't really care that revealing they have no skin in the game
academic and yeah spectator sport it matter who loses particular court case because either way we're taking care of it i think centuries and is more be old you've been left vs right with these people and to a agree they have more aligned with the centuries of the suppose it opposite
with her because even someone as articles there are more cool with a so called centuries person the other party in the fringe on both yes because they meant they want their vested in the fucking economic status quo and all of those with the democrats you have the process fetish that were talking about and the you
the fetish for swing voters and those basically just act as covers for the real truth which is that it is a party controlled and directed and structured around the interests of wealth and that is a reality that would make a lot of the actual voters sort of uncomfortable or unhappy because
lot of base democrat voters are actually you know in some way maybe maybe not well articulated it in some way hostile to capitalism as it exists now in america and if you if you like sorry but if when nancy pelosi since we're capitalists and that's just the way things are she's really telling you what all of this is hi my all the stuff up
perish the a process other stuff but sick worrying about swing voters in peoria it's all a cover for the fact that they don't want to change the status quo and the best oriented and they would be a pyre hundred and they just want to hold onto the ball for a fourth quarter like they don't really want to pass it don't want to do anything with just let the clock run out
because the winning winning in the capital given the right thing to have other down by twenty five but it doesn't matter it's even they're still in power regardless there in power positions of power to influence regardless of whether their party is in power and in many ways it's better to be out of power as if you're in party in power your base might expect you to do something and they has to be fun
emphasize the democratic party is presently exist is structurally and in the personnel at its top invested in not doing any of the things that people at the base the people who have been alienated since the wall street crisis and by trump and other people have been steadily getting radicalize people who are deeply alienated from an accurate
order that does not work for the vast majority of americans they do not want to change anything about it period in a sense they can't they wouldn't be a party if they did because they wouldn't get the money that keeps the lights on they wouldn't keep that remember a class of consultants and scumbags who circulate in and out of government law
lobbyists that is the actual architecture of the party and all this stuff is just window dressing for that and
that's why it's going to be interesting to see to what degree you can actually force them to change and i'm kind of frankly skeptical that you will because you have to create alternative structures that kim
they can can that can compete with these monolithic well here's what you need to troll of the ballot access and money with the things that make politics possible they have a stranglehold well i mean i think campaigns like alexandria cause your court as as show us
show us a blueprint for starting this long process and you're describing but you're absolutely correct things what needs to happen really somebody needs to come in and check out the money lenders yeah and that i mean that goes back to what i'm saying about a big temporary he's whenever anyone talk show big be temporary you should know like one you don't know what you're talking about you don't know how elections
the blocks punched in politics and to it means that you are afraid of alienating any one it means you don't have any actual political enemies it means you want those wall street guys you want the rich hedge fund guys you want these these super i wanted and is doing exactly what is
suburban shit had republicans you even your even really thinking are all these people are thinking deep down inside you know this twenty five percent of the country that's baying for children to be locked in cages and would or would absolutely without question support worse things happening to those people we need to get them back on
our side to their ultimate fantasy is a one hundred percent part
that's what that logic leads you to what really needs to happen is the democratic party has to become smaller it has to excise like a malignant tumors many sectors of the party starting with the entire wall street donor base of the party and campaigns like alexandria cause cortez
and bernie sanders show you that you don't need that money to run a populist party were one to will merge okay
next media reaction this is a good one
this is by headline from cnn democrats are in danger of going too far left for thousand and eighteen this is by joe cunningham editor's note show cunningham as an editor at the conservative news and opinion say red state
in a contributor to the hey ride dot com
tomorrow's as advise on a this is a red state account which is genuinely concerned that the democrats if they go too far left will lose from the early twentieth and just pointing out that up and they're just giving you some friendly advice sometimes you can take advice on how you
should run your campaign and organize your beliefs if that advice is given to you by your literal mortal and and we know that always acting in bad faith should hear about that's the thing because they're impartial they're the best person math i want to read the way the fuck outta here i think the fuck an asshole trying to act like they're fuckin hillbillies
sons of the soil come on to the hey ride and here's fifteen articles the wrong made by some fucking i want a plague industries drag and we need a bag hey ride party that's what we
first of all catherine can you describe what you're cutting him looks like he's the round this boy i've ever seen
i think he was a guy and game rooms
honestly i our
yeah that was a suspect
i'd like to have this is the barber he was founded the world
he's a big round boy with a big old beard wow
like this this is his read of our recent politics he was just sitting around the who and then lays on country wisdom down for you city slicker president barack he says president barack obama lead the party and left for direction
further further than his modern democratic predecessors in the white house which is kind of true but then he says worn guy more in terms of rhetoric on issues such as immigration in l g p th rates than in terms of policy while i mean that is what matters here so in rhetorically he moved the party slightly to the left in terms of immigration and l g b t
earth are the most important thing however his health care overhaul alone invigorated the right wing and by the end of obama has tenure we saw hollowing out of democratic officeholders across the board obama never embraced socialism but pushing the country as far left is he did invited backlash once if the democrats go further left into
eighteen and twenty twenty the push back is going to be even worse skits some money so this guy's been a writer for wow and somebody look up the shit he was writing about about their in your palm and minutes i was just thinking that i know this mother fucker called them a socialist on multiple occasions there is no fucking way that red state dot com about call obama fucking so they were not making those disk
stations you know if they were probably right a messiah sides of the shall i
ape or neoliberal relatively new centrist horse shit you're lying sack of dough
so yeah this is joe cunningham says here
there is evidence that the democratic leadership is trying to keep the party from deviating too far but it seems they might be losing the fight democratic leaders including fear stroke critic adam schiff have urged other democrats not to push for impeaching the president pelosi wants to keep control of the caucus and has signalled she will fight off any of our challenges from her left which includes
refusing to support sanders plan for universal healthcare and raising taxes but many in their party base apparently believe that they didn't go leftward enough in two thousand and sixteen and the groundswell support for sanders insidious this hillary clinton was an awful candidate who survived the primary process with help from the parties establishment and debbie wasserman schultz in particular and her lack of appeal to the
in public was just as much to blame for trumps victory as anything accurate and throw with aren't she didn't go in any direction and that was the issue
yeah she didn't have policies here's remakes she had them on the website though
so much of the democrats base wants to move further left and nominate about socialist to take on the far right conservatives they view is the enemy add to that rhetoric like we heard from maxine waters who effectively called for protesters to target trump administration officials and you have a recipe for more extremism and ultimately voter alienation
it's a dangerous over correction and it's not strategically smart you know you know it's always alexandria and maxine waters and i just wonder what those two people have in common
say something i can't put my finger on it but all of these reactionary white writers are warning us against these two women in particular
also and
similar social you coming from liberals centers because they're always online talking about trust
you know trust non white women of color trust all this stuff but their magical yeah did the magical exercising
the hell out of year silly names didn't need the hell out of except when they don't fit the centrist mine and it's like trust black woman
one or listen to women but no know her
and on paper
all the talking about this intersection now the the
a press advantage you have
you know it increases your like or how much you deserve to have the you know what i mean
yeah you're putting your tweets about intersection now the end is nigh into sectional website for white women in the black woman now that i've seen this fund raising and showing that and that means anything to them
this is a lot of intersection or opportunity she's not rich
unless you listen to that article she's porter rigging she's a woman a paper will be great
we want michael bloomberg
joke and him finishing out here he says it's a dangerous over correction and it's not strategically smart again
just the love the idea that the democratic party should be taking strategic advice from an editor red state dot com and that's the kind of shit they wouldn't do that yeah
you he wants what's best for you
the body's been there before
political stakeholder the american public's response to obama and to trump has been for someone to swing things back the other way they weren't moderating voices and government it's looking more like they're going to get the opposite however and they aren't going to react the way some democrats think they will like it or not the american public as a whole is going to want more
civility from their politics not less what does that actually that why they don't like did donald trump because they want to moderate and the white house i don't what does that actually mean people want a moderate government by then
we want a neutral government doesn't make snow that's the thing is that and that's the that's the third of the floating signify and all of these articles that mark moderation is never explained moderation is never to be ah while it's about norms up all day
the government doesn't want to learn and know and a president who will uphold and respect and every one of every political stripe unless you're a catatonic you know unless you are
unless you're the mother in psycho wants a government with a mandate a platform some general
actually does something but also the schools belt to not learning anything we just test this theory with the most moderating non believer in free to finn everybody liked her exactly like it wasn't that long coat is so we're just split up these premises
not only that the landlords but i think this guy say what i want is actually moderate and what he wants and if he if he wrote it down was sincere about it would be totally abhorrence yeah to and fifty sixty percent of the here here's here's like the the disconnect in this comes from more than both the media essentially believes he conservator
movements own self conception and the way they've sold themselves is that you know this is david brooks line that being a conservative is about you know what what's tried and true yeah
or new experiments are different things and spent and i mean and liking you know things that are okay
possible utopia and that they they wanted this about preserving the status quo
that party exists in america and it's the democratic party
the democratic party is a centre right party that is mostly conservative and it's outlook
essentially yes would they like the world to be more humane and our country to be better in certain ways sure but basically they want to keep things yeah and even handed the keel and not do anything too fast or too soon
the party is a full on revenge just reactionary party
you said if you went down the line and their what they actually want from government it's to turn the clock back one hundred you that includes every single one of the never trump site every every single one of them yeah so if you you should be forced to talk well we want moderation i want you to fucking you have to do like a p style requests should require you
to have to define it what is moderation and you're like well it's a five trillion dollar defense budget and both wars forever largest incarcerated population in the world that lead reading of standard of living for everybody who doesn't own a boat i mean that's and that would be it and then people would know you're talking about instead of just being flow
signify that just means basically just means a reasonable person because that's the thing americans pride themselves or not they don't want to think of themselves as giving away their reason to some ideology we think that's bad we think of that basically as as for loss of self
you are a person to the degree that you maintain an independent judgment above ideology and that idea so powerful that you can package anything in that garb and people will be like yes even if it is objectively insane reactionary gibberish that will lead to the death of everyone on the earth they couldn't be any its pace
typically like fucking death cult shit but because it's it's it's draped in the mantle of moderation and because there's no one there's no real political differences between the parties to sharpen those distinctions and make people have to find their terms it just gets put under and this is shackled
what you were saying about democratic party shouldn't be a big tent party and like right now the democratic party is sort of at war with itself because its leadership and what and largely that people like it's most committed voters are largely conservative and their out but not conservative in the sense that they hate gay people or like want to turn back the clock on social progress but they want to keep things basic
where they are now even though the other for the other people who have nowhere else to go but the democratic party it's not fucking working for them and that's why they doing this when no one was really excited but hillary clinton other than that are hard group of powerful well off people whether you're willing to challenge in trench capital and
the most recent incarnation democratic party is categorically unwilling to do that i've heard glimmers are seeing glimmers of we might go after the drug companies we might go after the oil companies may be very lightly a soft touch i mean you look at the day which was obviously policy in
ending to help people intending to increase coverage
what it was not a challenge to the health insurance company
medical companies what does this will accommodate cunningham were saying about obama move the country the left by rhetorically and that's the thing is that they can only talk about like yes obama doesn't want people to go bankrupt from there
it doesn't want health insurance to bankrupt people or for people to not seek medical care for lack of insurance right but he can only talk about the solutions to these problems euphemistically because he can't go on
you can leave the a market based expansion modest expansion of health insurance
availability in the country is a radical left proposal you're a baby you're a dumb baby i don't care what you believe i don't need your vote i don't want to talk to you if i wanted to impress you are court you i will tangled my keys in front of you
hey here's another fuck off
rookie i want one more before i get the final one in terms of a group of people who i think we need to court about libertarians with zero
magazine all of from former shadow guest robbie suave
he says
that's cool idea democratic socialists who think you're having a moment it's me a libertarian who's been through this
you will libertarians of this country have never had a moment anything close service
yeah she wrote me yeah it's me
as a robbery
very worried about
he writes your democratic socialists and the ideology which cause ya cortez identifies appears to be having a political moment to which i say as a libertarian who has been through the whole an idea whose time has finally come
luck with that camera and wrong the signs are easy to miss read hadn't happened yet
talking about ron paul yeah yeah but isn't libertarian now they been a crack head anytime after nineteen ninety
doesn't
use a cracker to does a time
that has gotten so much bad press how who doesn't mean a crack an
libertarians how are you a tried and true two thousand and eighteen libertarians
the answer is they've all moved on to the harder shit like great and yeah yeah
nazis and a few of them i will give credit a few of because the libertarian as i'm basically it failed alienated from the status quo so it's harder for them they just become regular conservatives or whatever they end up most of them become nazis and i will give credit to the few who are true they take the principle of freedom of the idea and they take oh i mean to be social
and some of them to do that and i give those people credit for most of them are just becoming nazis the ones that are left are in it for the fucking paycheck like robbie slavic rest of them are the ones getting paid by the koch brothers getting paid by all these fucking stitched up think tanks and and fake fucking periodicals that no one on earth pies and that's the big difference and that's what's was on
they released as well
when he writes in the period of time between two thousand and nine in two thousand and fifteen a group of republicans it appears like they wanted to shrink government stole some power from the old guard time magazine senator rand paul the most interesting man in national politics and libertarian as it was finally enjoying it's political moment even the new york times thoughts
also okay wow you so you got the biggest fucking slack jawed rooms and politics to be slightly impressed by your fake fucking branding exercise congratulations oh yeah but i mean the point is a it delivered for the people that funded oh yes oh yes well here's the thing they did they did win because the what libertarian leads to wins
you elected while in two thousand and ten just justin a marsh and rand paul you also like to dozens of freedom cock his site comics and they are at work in this raiding are fucking welfare state and just because they recognize correctly that
all of this
on a great artists principle non aggression just because they've left that shit by the wayside and if abandon any you know half hearted bromides about you know oh
we you believe in multiculturalism and she like that
does it mean they're not fundamentally libertarian listen to this listen to the smug asshole he says while it's true that more and more people desire cultural freedom specifically the kind of customers asian choice and control over their own lives
a libertarian world view providing
political libertarian isn't had much less support than it seemed voters didn't send the see party to washington constrained government and they ended up carrying far less about crony capitalism that may not a it
about illegal immigration that's capitalism father has or what does not political libertarian i'm going even saying well here's the thing like they met it pointed this out to me and like the libertarian like again the twelve people that robbie suave any editors at reason represent their vision of libertarian is it is only attractive if they sell it by agreeing with things that liberal
and left already wanted anything like that was the ron paul revolution was a punch a dip shit college kids a little i or and legal weed excited about that because he was the only candidate and either party saying talking if that was of the only thing the thing is there's nothing libertarian necessarily about either of those positions as positions are at very watch at home on the left and
that's the thing about this that makes it so funny is that this guy is so up his own ass
fucking georgetown happy hours of the others put polling fucking qaeda operatives that they don't realize that libertarian is it is entirely a paper tiger
funded by wealthy people who give it the illusion of popular support whereas socialism if it is properly understood it becomes something that can like actually reach out and be be persuasively appealing to people literally is the aspirations of the entire working class
that is slightly more fertile at toro ground than twelve point dexter's in dc who literally all of whom went to fucking george mason and are getting getting paychecks to believe this shit to create this fantasy that there is some cosmopolitan libertarian isn't that doesn't revolve into straight nazis them as soon as
since pressure is applied to robbie says a casio cortez doesn't appear crazy she's an eloquent if naive and and specific defender of far left ideas he's not as naive as me the guy who literally things that the point of capitalism is to give me multiple places where i can get video game
oh and he also said that are harder after the yeah he said that a paragraph above he he says
sees chris hayes to his credit was mildly incredulous about the future congresswoman's agnostic definition of the term and he's like he's he's talking about how cortez when she's asked what does it mean to be a socialist says things like to me it's about the dignity of all people to have health care education and a job etc not being like workers control the means of production
when robbie was on our show i specifically asked him about the actual libertarian beliefs of murray rock art and hans hermann harper which he disavowed explicitly said that's not the kind of libertarian i am to me libertarian islam is about as he said the getting the widest array of video game reviews from a different
i'm sorry i thought i'm not that i want to you by idiot and every moron who gave us them
because the free to post all day about their fucking video game preferences she goes i be like the idea that his ideas in a socialist government you get you get one video
from from like the cutoff who central committee
every game gets one review
you get mad you you just were chopper years euro to commence chris person with the only one allowed to do video game reviews you know ideally they would be no
he says there's no doubt social as the schism
there's no doubt socialism as defined in incredibly loose terms as a vast social welfare system is gaining popularity among democrats but libertarians have learned the hard way that it's all too easy to draw unwarranted conclusions and misdiagnosed the moment especially when the new york times phones over you think people actually like
obviously very used to the feeling of being convinced young and naive or moment that you were very popular only to find out later the horse meat hook reality of you actually have no for and he said everyone hates here and no one wants to play video games of you know no one will join your plan nobody is fucking struggling as a young
person to make this world is going to think you know the solution to this is the regulation that's going to take care of it
and they know that and that's why this idea that there was any any comparison between these two movements is absurd because libertarian ism mostly got relevant for a minute there with a combination of dark money and literal trickery just putting like the couple of good you know you got like a bunch of rotten fucking vegetables and you've got to the
that's what they did rudely who lead know the around or is bad
and that's the entire and it was never anything because it's just not a thing that's going to it has no and the way that people who has no and the people who fund it like the coax and the mercer is etc
p p peterson's or whatever the people who arranged the reason magazine cruise or whatever
these people are explicit about not wanting are caring about puritanical libertarian is they want the government to be shrunk just enough to like for them to hoard even more creases like well have to go to the moment they don't really have to give a shit if like it's been the polish the d m v or whatever
and those few good fruit that they have like you don't need to be a libertarian to have legally you know you can have legal weed with a bunch of government regulation california it's just it and it's like the least the very conservative era support legal weed and as far as i know there's nothing that talk about that's appealing
only get through libertarian isn't stuff you get just a terrorism is just a nightmare realm of pure social darwinism where people are fucking been picked up in the street giant fucking what sort of link or yeah like selling can bulldozers right but really the thing is i i really do maintain his they got
what they sensibly wanted from donald trump living up guy okay they got the time that are reading it
deregulation they get the eviscerate and it's also so many social safety net right they got this fucking right wing supreme court justice who is go to keep making decisions like that and they got something
a little bit of their opposition to the iraq war no more big land wars just these techno wars were
these video game board where we're not going to die they're going to die so you don't have to worry about it you could read your fucking video game reviews something else they they didn't literally get the wall and lot of loading but they go with the wall represents which is terrorizing immigrants yeah so so make people talk about oh i see these liberals laugh
oh the trump where's the wall and the people who that was red meat for them i yanked near to purchase these kids in cages
finally i didn't have a war but we have a chain link fence that's all the won't we need as long as the wall separating immigrants from us we don't care if it's a chain link fence
in a cage or of it's an actual literal wall i want to see through it
between libertarian rage at trump right now is the rage of taliban holding up the mirror and seeing his own reflection and that our professor
i mean we're we're over and he gets our last meeting series that is of course still have the theme of a day l se but one of rod dryers readers
dip into the roger air mail bag and play the twilight zone music one of his readers is from new york's eighteenth district
how how insane well someone asked me how many times they called the cops a week as a really must be why
because a reader of this blog rights as a decades long kevin james
mr king of queens
a reader of this blog rights as a decade long resident of new york's congressional district just one effectively by alexandria sea of cortez and a stunning primary upset of the democratic incumbent though i've eliminated some biographical information at his request i can tell you from his past comments on the site that the reader is not
a christian okay
as a reader and again
always preface you have to take this with a large grain of salt
rod i'm almost positive is reading these letters to himself
i think of run there are there are some interesting tells him around trail mailbag i think of the film split if anyone with with james mcavoy m night shadowlands some was being kept in the basement what just he's he's there's five hundred versions of him and they are right like automatically write letters to the other than he wakes up and oh
older they all these letters to the editor the need to put them on my website okay so this is reader who again rather would like to stress is not a christian
joe crowley was the congressman of my district and i was rooting for him to win more so because he recently stood up against a protected bike lane proposal and to corridors and a community the department of transportation a bunch of crazy far left progressive activists and the mayor were trying to force these bike lanes down arthur
road despite a huge outcry and we push back enough where joe crowley said no and our local councilman and it or not supporting the project now with crowley gone the snowflakes who demanded these bike lanes might become involved in again
i saw this slice electorate share his bike legs
this is so this is just like that
politics
it's the same mean even if it isn't him it's functionally the same person as they crank who wrote about the thing when britannica we're going to get these of say people like the at the sight of a bicyclist these are the people and they exist it's hard to imagine them
see someone on a bicycle and they get mad i don't know how you get to that point but there are people like that moral that continues that being said i'm not surprised that cause your court has won her campaign posters were everywhere and i mean everywhere every single grocery store or store front in my neighborhood had her post sir
even my local grocery store had her poster up and when i went to the owner who is a good friend and asked him if her followers asked him permission to put it up he said yeah they told me to put a poster on my window and i said yes when i told him about her politics and that she was for bike lanes and all the progress of craziness he immediately rift it up and
that that is absurd
it's like bikes the people ride bikes it's radical let it isn't the on the minority is basically a giant avatar for people and pie
it's like a fuckin rube goldberg murder machine for people on bicycles the idea of just putting like some space for them not to get squad yeah i gotta i gotta say i think believing that the most important issue in politics is going to mobilize the most people his bike lanes
is a lot more same to me then what all of the centrists and liberals talking about alexandria cause your cortez is when believe this does affect people's daily lives people feel it
and it just goes on you're going to find out the bike lanes is definitely not a not all
so he goes in the funny thing is the poster was upon his window along with an ad for joke crowley just by walking around the neighborhood i saw how bland crowley's campaign posters were there were few and far between and number and i had a sense that the last three months that he was woefully unprepared for the tidal wave that was going to hit him many of the store owner
super of cortez is posters had no idea who she was or what she stood for her election in large part was successful due to a very well designed pr effort and propaganda came of the activists who work for a little door to door putting up these ads and all they had to do was ask permission from the business owners if that wasn't enough people were actively stopping
austrians on the street and campaigning for her why my local park every home
i think the biggest trickery
she'd never hit her positions political stop at first
because i don't know this is really good i don't know where her funding came from but big money was definitely back her up from the t shirts to a bicycle from the t shirts to the well designed posters to the glossy campaign cards something was definitely work here is if there weren't a million articles about how she
if she had an accord children no longer need to be ah dick round but i'm not that it is no other option but big a million people with twenty dollars in a park
they couldn't possibly be actually of actual ground swell of popular support it's gotta be money is what this is also like real like old person boomer mindset is that they see something that's like pleasantly graphically design their like that money was behind that i don't mean to areas
awesome to was her race or background is it probably thought okay it's probably on the black and spanish people in all the poor people voting for her how did the out of that first of all are they even allowed to vote why did my dogs are french as the mets why aren't the all phones that's that's another
look into so how did they get the money to give her cc he senses that there's something off with these well designed posters and he goes as anyone who thinks that the racial component was not at play here is fooling ourselves her campaign poster look like an ad for a political candidate in a latin american country
what the fuck is he talking she has them
it persists
excellent
that's what i say about like he was wearing this hat with all as fruit on
an epilogue like a huge
covered in battles see as her add looked like a poster for a political candidate in a latin american country and i guess it worked a marvelous affect the large hispanic population in this area okay guys
this letter was hinting at the crazy but now are really going to dive into it however what was really bizarre for me was the fact that the overwhelming majority of activists who are campaigning for her like a bunch of fanatics were whites in all capital
when i see stuff like was i can't help but think that whites especially white liberals have some sort of in built suicide complex where they want to give away their own country to non white new here we get some absolutely mind boggling sorry
oh yeah
it's absolutely mind boggling to me and it's going to be hilarious watching these weights eventually be pushed out of the democratic party for the record this guy lives in a commercial district that's eighty five percent non white he just loves being pissed he goes they're going to be pushed out of the democratic party and straight into the hands of the all right
you're describing what happened to you
oh cause your curtis is far left politics of the future the democrats and if they want to get their way america will be well on the way to becoming a third world banana republic make no mistake this country is in big trouble there is a lot more i can say about why i've come to these conclusions but in the last three read my manifesto
i've seen enough to believe that some sort of civil war in america is inevitable race or yep and then he says first it'll happen along political lines then it will morph into conflict along racial ethnic lines i expect that will see classes between right wing left wing groups in the streets there will be very reminiscent of the bloody left rate battles that to find turkey in the late seventies and early eighties
he's out of this chaos will see the military step in and establish martial law and that will be the end of the united states falling apart like the tower of babel before it i know what this guy talking about because there's this guy who would always come in with a big boom box and play rap music really loud in his pizza place
this verse the first indication that things are going down hill said they really really realized about
conservatives would have parents that your to is i used to only the fringe really believes in camp of saints or what's the what's the other one to turn it down
but leave in different differing degrees one group things it's going to happen tomorrow but these guys think it's only one election away or yeah like you know this one bad choice of america and then all the masses the more them come from the abyss him just drag you know
they're absolutely convinced that's the catalyst to make it for fascism it's just that death drive of the eventually just all going to sign off on the idea that america is doomed basically needs to die in some bloody racial regular ah you think the new french reign of terror is going to happen at any given second this is so crazy to me is that a casino court
as one a nice of something of election but this guy's literally like race war is going to happen because of it
so her and her platform wasn't that radically
so a rod says i've been an update there's like ten updates on this post he goes i've reconsidered whether or not to take this comment down because some of you say it's racist when roger dryers readers are calling something
he goes i'm going to leave it because i think the readers observations are debatable not correct but debatable the fear of voters like him have the power of identity politics are realistic as much as the fear of left wing voters have from right wing a lot is she did not run here for a but that's thing that's thing for these people those things are racially coding and read to trouble
lucian is racial yeah taking money from me who's going to get it them that's how they think of it it's one hundred percent the way they think of it and anybody who's white and has any kind of social standing racial biases the concept of redistribution
and then these these white people that he so horrified or i bet a lot of them are ones who really don't have anything and think that they might actually benefit from redistribution he writes at the end here but there's no escaping the fact that through a lot of people who look like the joe crowley's of the world the ambiguity of that statement it's time for one of us will be interpreted as other rising those who do not have the same
identity is the candidate
cause cortez is one of us well who is them in this case it's a guy who's been in congress for twenty fucking years and takes fucking donations from literally every you all than the i swore have her the and then a finishes with another letter the ever readable met in virginia rights i am thirty five a readable in letter fucking written in his own
semen and i am thirty five years old and for what it's worth i honestly feel like there is only one category of people my age or younger and it ain't a majority who believe any more in i have a dream that my four little children will one day be judged not by the color of their skin but by the content of their and that's what if someone asked them if within those second speech
don't have add a vague else to say also by the way i guess what if you guys who were if you guys really want everyone to judge you are the kind of a character you're fucked because her truly awful your bad or the scumbag nazi pieces of shit and lucky we of people are fucking rise up and put you in camps
you are talk about fucking continent you cut your characters dogs
by the letter every fucking letter from to rob trader seems like it was written on toilet paper and center hannibal lecter
next time i'm going to send you something where i just want to bring in one really quick
the thing about it all day the funny thing about this is that millennial socialists are an anti materialistic are anti bourgeois they think socialism is their path to materialism and a while lifestyle avocado toast in brooklyn loss for all and all i could think is every man a king how hypocritical
i didn't get a chance to talk about it but i hope i don't recapitulate what you said on our fiscal how to ensure will but i was at alexandria his victory party and on the way over you know and the conversations i had with a lot of people involved and that the been unnecessarily her campaign was that we think she went
marvelous campaign she got the word out it's a victory in that regard but you know hey if she gets thirty percent of the vote that would be a huge victory for us
and i when we got there i spoke to ryan grim of the intercept who told me he was walking around the neighborhood and he talked to ten people and every ten voters and every single one of them was voting for alexandria so when those results came in it was a shock by i mean it seems like it would have been a shock to anyone on the
around and throughout out that night i kept hearing from people people would come up to us was a you know they'd heard the show and said you know i just just recently or few months ago a year ago got politically active and i'd been canvassing knocking on doors for alexandria or four months
now hours every day and it was the competence of her campaign in this one of these volunteers that put her over the top and i hope this wasn't off the record but i spoke with someone close to her campaign who said that long before she was getting all this mean
the attention before she was his breakout star and later last couple weeks of the primary that the place where they got a great deal of attention online was the chapel sub reddit which is a very politically active
left sub reddit and i was also i also learned recently that one of one of the modern was banned for posting the ice list
to which i say some propose so if you were elated as i was sure you were by alexandria his victory and you
this event kind of crystallize to you how important electoral victories can be not just as a way to legislate but as a way to build a movement to get the message out there because as we've seen the with her on all these tv networks evangelize

get out the vote period of alexandria his campaign
she gave her staff her people to alexandria to knocked down doors for her she went out and she knocked on doors for alexandria and she's locked in a tight race of her own and i think she is someone who deserves to be paid back for that investment she is a leader she's a unique
and member she has been a community organizer for justice in brooklyn against police brutality against war for several years now and she has a platform that is just between you will be a fraction as radical as the person that i know and her victory would be yet another mess
