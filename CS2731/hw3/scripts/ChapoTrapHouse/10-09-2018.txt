we'd somebody recently was on twitter and airline they de m me and they're like
brian i'm listening to your all your back catalogue and i'm listen into a show where you can't stop talking shit about how c b d is fake
sell it
well i've got at a change of our since the head of the first time you try to you walked into a smoke shop on campus in had some like gum or something and you were like the guys it is now i can't get high i can't get high for the rest of the
that's i was mad about that yeah i know that people have gotten mad about meters by and you know with medical marijuana retail marijuana available now people are afraid of course of kids using it so i've begun dosing water
school districts with c b date
they can legally take that legal marijuana but they won't get high i just one thing to me no more heavy medication rather just be chill i just went to my daughter's middle school my daughter is in seventh grade and i went to our school first to drop something off earlier today and i walked by and as like this is so ohio they have a narco
can kid in front of the store and i kept ever these kids do an airway
not shit
it's ohio yeah i guess it is well those cops have done that thing now we're like if a cop gets like food poisoning or something like i think somebody sent me with a little bit of fat know it it
yeah well i love i love and cops are like that's like the tier above abortion survivor
cycling like i was in the same room as know it's like you know it's not like you don't just instantly die if you touch it know we had a police force here that claimed they were is flyers put on their cars and they had been dipped in fact nelson when the cops touched than they would over know
then they put pepsi and our car knowing that there was aborted fetus parts in there and they give us apples with razor blades
thing as wild i just we have a new one of the ballot measures in in ohio this time as issue one in its treatment for drug offenses no jail no jail time for drug offenses and there was a dark money pack now that's putting out these memes that say if issue one passes a person that's walking around with enough now to kill ten
she would not go to jail
you get that number
i love that i love like ten thousand people or four hundred elephants
the packers probably funded by private prison
pretty sure that's disgusting i know i know i saw its the police still yeah at all
yeah ohio's cop i'm in columbus is cops are like now becoming the one that people say when they say there's corruption and it's like they just arrested they are they arrested stormy daniels yeah
yeah
now the vice squad so they arrested stormy daniels in about a month later
the cop shot a woman who was like a sex worker that was insane or he was fucking show at a store it was second even charged or what but now the vice squad is as they say the vice squad is our whole it was it right
it was it out of uniform cop with your shovel been trying to push her into a car yes yeah basically try the kidnappers he had her in a car and and apparently he parked next to the wall of a building so if she tried to open the door she wasn't going to get out a car so she get him and then he shot her like eight times or something
maybe going to fucking charging and though there are now i'm always he got oh my god
yeah he got off to said that they actually said she stabbed him and that's why he got off
well they don't bust and nobody gets in trouble here at the guy that just shot to me or rights and cleveland got a new focus got in a rural place like just they they don't get busted i mean they don't get busted anywhere though it's not like new york in l a or any other places like have done and as my only fuckin convicted van dyke that was like holy shit
i can actually have i couldn't believe that because in chicago we had like a special operations division in cebu
and it was basically just a shield can initiate like they were just fucking extort drug dealers and rob them of their backs and then sell them we didn't and it's like no one really went to jail vicious like our i we won't or we won't have the shield union any more you happy
you're not going to get these gripping dramas
so slightly not as serious brian
your cousin got a little with lot recently yeah you should a murder bryan on twitter you got to find this thing and the street fight obesity serious page but he posted something about a state rap who was an enormous piece of shit the state rap is a guy who say so a couple weeks ago
a little eleven year old girl was at kroger and she got a taste for shoplifting and the creepy as thing the cop with and see honey i don't want to do this you made me take you but anyway
an adult man rising and eleven year old girl yeah shoplifting fifty eight hours worth of stuff
and creating with a taser and and apologized say honey i'm doing this for your better yeah i mean i can't imagine if you're a cop like this get said so much on every pod casts that on every on twitter all day but like if a cop can't deal with an eleven year old girl the paper
just don't need to be but so this state rap in some backwards ass county in ohio
said well maybe she deserved it
if a kid gets if my kid got shot i would look in inward and see like what how i failed as a parent maybe these people should see maybe these parents should see how they failed when their kids get shot
taste or shot maybe they were just acting like a punk
my cousin posted something that was roughly like i wish someone would kill this guy how am i supposed to believe and the government and then he got arrested the guy bragging on his facebook page about getting him arrested and and hr have felony free speech is very important to the republic it's very important or relevant
air of are really ask him what they're using his facebook pages sort they say things about left his stuff on his face we get talking about it and but like he has stuff on it's like leftist like imagery on his facebook page and of course is he works for us so i think he had some street fight stuff on his page and area
using that to say he's like a radical leftists generous yeah he's black
black girl a family block but the good thing about our job is when i contacted a lawyer i talked to a person it's a lawyer was like you know shit breton i shut up about this and he has like you should check with their lawyer but the first thing i said what i told him what happened and the first thing he said was he got arrested and i was like he's like isn't that good
for your brain
i suppose i guess though but i think what do we had to go to jail
i mean like if we're going to make the thing and lake it's a death threat to say i would like it if someone like fuck like
then you just wipe alex three quarters of the good things online that's all i do is a hobby someone dies all day
saying i'm not saying i'm going to good or pace i'm saying like i would enjoy that happened yeah
and it's a guy with like maybe one hundred friends on facebook it's like he's not some influential guy that's like out there say like let me get my minions
said it was just there was one of those type
i feel like it was just the dude saw that thing and he felt so hopeless and then that's what came out in the thing about is that jake does work with those kids jake worth that risk and homeless youth
it came from like a very passionate place and was obviously a tear flight
neither but he's not he's not facing a felony any more they not have is a misdemeanor territory don't take our lead know which just really lucky and you like the regular guy who has to pay for a glint in premiums who you know it's a fucking rough world out there and you know just you know say to the next year
mom screaming and screaming on the x box message the person who killed you in cod
org and hit a heavy bag get one of those pudgy bags as a clown that you put water in the bottom comes back up and pretend that's all your enemies don't you know don't take a risk by been epic and i want our job
i want to do the new george carlin thing on your show roque were killed death shoot stack and seven
they were i have been stabbed the best burger
what it's all about another a religious miscarriage of justice is early going on
as a running columbus as a new york story
i was reminded every game today this is from new york would just call days ago
headline
transit obsessed queens man will not be released back into community
sorry says here ever since he was a teenager in queens areas column has been in trouble with the law always for stealing subway trains and buses
and the story goes on and it is basically about this guy who i regard to be something of a folk hero in new york's it absolutely i haven't heard about this guy before there and it's what it sounds like he's a guy who is this entire life has been deeply obsessed with trains
he was stabbed as a kid by a classmate have received by trees is part of his recovery and ever since he was about like a teenager he has been basically coverage during and
driving an actual trade like a c train at fifteen not hired by the it was covering for an employee you want to spend time with his offered that's cold
yeah this is perfect for of this is this is anarchic as bright as well
talk about ourselves fucking love it
when arrested for more than thirty times for for taking them on joy ride subways and buses
we were writing is sort a joy you can join my route
he will he picks up on these places he does the actual
i haven't being paid
it is now fifty three years old he was in brooklyn supreme court on friday hoping to judge if measure freedom freedom let him live in a supervised grupo instead he was committed to a secure adult psychiatric center
like a woman style horror show for sure
a man offered to drive the clay
was a job and supreme court justice roof shilling for who would not agree to be seen on camera sided with prosecutors who argue that mcallen is dangerously mentally ill when you know why this is why you can ever vote for prosecutor for any political office the as like this is a wonderful all
whimsical man who is actually helping the community and has this amazing interest in this thing the city and state led fold total disrepair and this for this fucking law school
this joyous fucking hawes is like knowledge is put him in a cage for however much time it's like you know
just this wonderful whimsical guy are sociopaths prosecutors are fucking to break that habit
this is the first incident said in nineteen eighty at the age of fifteen various was arrested when he drove and in the service he trade he was covering the employee shift so he could visit his girlfriend a passenger concerned when she saw a young the area sitting alone and the operators give the train was stopped and various was arrested
the news of the young subway banned it was sensational their throw through all of it
revealed to the authorities he was working for the game
oh really
banned it how is he he's like a bandit is wally
a guy sees a python on the window sill and find is a quicker way to cool it he yeah it is days link tell the aid in town that was fucking cool
as a comrade
what they called on i just all this thing
so he returned to school but then he was labeled a true it is feel you should reform resulted in this confinement in a mental hospital it was there that he was given heavy doses of anti psychotic medication and he was diagnosed with depression psychosis over within days of his release from the hospital areas return to the subways and t friends were so pleased that he had
not reveal their complicit activity that they walk with him back into the fall
transit world was a violation of his probation and he was sent to kill know so ninety nine of course he was diagnosed with asper syndrome but he has like by all accounts a savant like understanding of the new york city transit system both buses and subways yes it's a type of do that
you feel like see i know our job doesn't exist in nineteen eighty nine hundred and eighty a guy could just get in a tourney
dr people the people that work for the train or like it's pretty whimsical it's with this guy's doing and i i i wish we could pull that off because that guy should just be a character in his part of new york
give him a job at the yeah
they destroy i mean this sounds like a great position
taking somebody's and instead of utilizing their magnificent skill you're putting them in a cage people people hate any type of greatness
hey haider eyes of true greatness for the past forty years
in jail for charges involving transportation is never get arrested for crimes of violence he has never injured anyone is banned from a rail yards bus depot other official offices what if his many efforts to find employment areas volunteered at the new york city transit museum a job you love but he was fired when his boss ultimately realized is that
oh shit
oh this guy who laid
the more than i ever could
that's off the fucking tragic
as a part of this following nine eleven various volunteer at his knowledge and skill to make the new york city subway system safe
various lead a team of federal agents york city intelligence the factors in new york the police to the subways subway system identifying locations where intruders were able to enter without being detected
various was actually incarcerated run
take it in shackles from is growing as eyelid by theme of federal agents to tour the subway system assist in law enforcement with their efforts or his contributions the earliest receive no benefit instead the department of was notified the various was easily been any
terrorists could gain valuable knowledge as a result he was placed in solitary confinement
he'll imagine the fucking fat guido minutes like i care to katie that someone could use points brain to initiating islamic style
yeah i probably am online what if osama bin laden gain access to professor x's cerebral
the way it was easy though it was like so easy after nine eleven to just be like i bet i think this guy's talk and osama bin laden
no maria so finally i be the last summer he was arrested was in two thousand and fifteen where he drove a greyhound bus around new york city and
he was ultimately arrested at gunpoint by five new york city police academies
this thought all the size of you know where he's going to go he's just follow and around but
prosecutors have argued that he is a dangerous criminals to be put away for the rest of his life and some horrific of mental institution wear were of thinking here there is a go for me going on right now he's currently incarcerated were putting it up yeah but there is a go for me for his legal defense i mean i think this is
going to be appealed hopefully but i mean i remember learning about the story a long time ago and just thinking what a folk hero this guy how the guy who just you know rides in works the trades
this
i've said this before but if the emperor north more now the first time he tried to stroll into a nice fancy restaurant downtown san francisco you would have been strangled to death by some mech fucking cop psycho yeah one week they would not have fucking plaques of them all over the sun not just the fucking cobb psycho but like your the prosecutor
how do you do that you go into the court you like i want to throw in this wonderful man who's never heard any age ages helped has never once committed an act of violence or even put anyone's life in danger through his action then what do you do you go to a ball pan
okay live the rest of your empty cosmopolitan existence you a look in the mirror and wonder what the fuck you're doing with your life to fight they are you wanted to do when you let a law school you know that can creep they'll think er sant water sit in law and order of fighting the good fight we actually just like last week there was a story in ohio about a
a woman network a giant eagle the deli counter giant eagle and she would eat like four to five pieces a ham or salami every single day that she worked there she worked there for eight years and the loss prevention people at fuck in at giant eagle fired or and impressed fallon
he charges and said she eight nine thousand eight hundred dollars worth i am in the times
oh now see were in charge with grant that for hang out if the were just like smuggle the peace
if the great escape just smuggling lunch meat out of the place in her stomach every single day
she was just she probably cut to images was like one fattening and five
picky people there oh that's too thick oh that's too thin those are all separate
that's what law that patient moving the ham from the rocket was stored or stomach is individual taking of tiny land that would he leave like a class z felony and misdemeanor just as so they don't they don't add up now
no an obscene it like like the loss prevention guy is a deck obviously and he's the type of do that
loss prevention guys like the yellow punishment law a guy
no but then there's like that with to with the cops and then it went to a prosecutor and now they're in court and this is still going on this person's been charged with felony for the just say like penises
our society
yeah it's so gross you live in or if you make under like eighty thousand dollars a year you live in an authoritarian says i am saddened say you are
her radical boot if you make under that amount of money wasn't if walking country you're so you're so underrepresented in any kind of government like democratic structure that you're effectively disenfranchised even if you do oh yeah and it's you have no ability to change this at all though and they and they use and the only way you see
the state is is this is awful croak coercive to boot and of course no one really love them and up becoming like
for wars conspiracy guys because that makes sense and like the state is a concept is just the that fucks with them like i remember that that bundy ranch guy who killed those cops in las vegas i don't have anybody remembers him and his girlfriend who dressed up like the joker harley quinn en las vegas strip they shot too
yeah they shot two cops at a pizza dropped and gadsden flag on the bodies and then ran into a walmart whereby the way they killed a good guy with a gun
to who is there and he was a concealed carry he saw the guy and he thought oh at computer engage and he didn't know that the girl was there with him and sheep little boy okay and then they ended up dying in a shootout with the cops these this guy by his life story i think he's from a higher is in the midwest
shitty schools and then his only in a counter with the government was that he kept getting arrested for pot yeah all the time and it fucked his life up and totally like robbed him of his ability to really do anything besides just sort of scrape by and even when he started getting better at that something else will happen and he get not the square one
that that's the state of course it's like a drop by reptile rothschilds or whatever the fuck while nothing like that thing about it is that like that's why it makes me crazy when nice like rich liberal type people go on twitter and talk about like these poor people vote voting for donald trump and stuff and yeah they don't vote because who would who
i vote for like if if i don't know if you make twenty five thousand dollars a year you don't you don't care who's the president
unless years
shit this president we've you make twenty grand a year
they're trying to leave the house without getting older assets seized fucking cage for a decade a salary
if over drop and it's like you want to know why they did because ever since you got the nomination till now the establishment attempt to undermine trump is the emphasize the he's not one of ours yeah he's not part of the establishment and so it's like yeah you mean like an asshole who make my life shit
contribute everything that makes it hard for me to live you saying he is the opposite of you guys the he's the total antithesis of everything you are saying i might have to give this guy a look
you mean they're by hand for fifty cents a pound she's carving it up and selling it for six dollars a pound and doesn't have enough money to eat a fuck and ham sandwich on her break and borrows a few slices that are going to go in the trash anyway with a ways to have the food yeah the food all its up with the got the of garbage dumpsters are unlocked last don't
efficient distribution of resources that's what you get this happened this is such a thought
oh my god yeah
it has that i do is that ohio's struggling keep have recently we've had order episode verge of were just talking and without us knowing it were just like slowly walking into an abyss yeah yeah
our whole thing now is that we got to college where people say know my boss is ripping me off in fucking me over and it's like oh let's make this fucking
looks have a laugh at i funny
my idea late for our columbus episode sons' lives show was like let's watch a movie and make for today
you was just that we just talk about anything at all that happens and yeah i'm really on all the human condition is just pure authoritarian misery
you give anyone powered all that he lives in the middle october so little they also like the weird thing is is like you can spend all my village you're going to spend probably three days year and you're barely going to see things about the police were like the thing that shocked me the most about getting the new york is when you're
about fifteen miles out in new jersey there's like flags for the police department there's police graffiti all over the play at least have at least the police are upfront there you know because i suck at think but this neighborhood as a development
they built this in the sixties it was originally blue collar neighborhood know it's a blue lives neighborhood
i would love to be like the market go pro police graffiti that will be good
i want to be the bank c of of verbal i want to be the guy that came up with every time a cop gets shot that sells the stickers and says the name of the city and and strong after it didn't
hurt my favorite thing about the blue eyes better movement
yeah because there's an official who lives matter fucking twitter account i don't know how they got their check mark
not fish they're not like an organ or anything it's just where the guys the most january out with the ideology
we actually had a round robin tournament and of course they posted every time a good shot like look at this but then they also posts every kind of kept dies in the line of duty which means like yeah he was in a donut shop and if i could choke to death on a corona they have like all these cards like accidentally discharged you know up and then sometimes like i think it may be an algorithm because they just post a like six
getting arrest but there was one they posted it was like all got arrested for rescuing animals during wildfire
what are you saying we're keeping like a little thick were sick
we're keeping the people say or how good our idea was a blue lives magic yes the route com for cop s
i mean that that blue lives matter stuff is so big like everywhere we traveled and like the one thing that we notice when we were on tour through the midwest was that you never see a blue lives matter flag or anything on a shitty car it's always
thousand dollars ruggedly
that's the classic felix tweet from during the black lives matter protests when he says i don't understand why they have to riots says man well cops put his groceries and as porch
every guy with a new s u v or something is like he's like all you do is show cops you respect them and they respect you
it's wonderful they're my best friend
it's like yeah you're like a rich guy who rich white guy he smiled at them
wait i don't know why they do their job they talk about college were attacking you specifically they talk about cops the way people like give advice to people like hiking about bears
always you just don't show any fear yeah
are really comfortable around their personal armed guards
these guys but my favorite my favorite my favorite death are
bless her account will report the cop tragically died
in pursuit of a suspect on foot
he'd been in effect
you just blew a fucking a order well as to run for half a block or like every plane on know everybody like the resisting charges such bullshit because like everybody's afraid of the police now because everybody except for like three hundred pound white guys like work at the local mill that doesn't exist anymore
i don't like you know like an engineer isn't afraid of but everybody else if the cop starts talking to you go into panic mode immediately i actually when we were touring in virginia we got pulled over and i thought panic has he been in the car vapor being out of packs which really fucking smell
in the car and i was and ass down a hill and i got to eighty seventy nine miles an hour
and it was seventy have gone back then i don't i do that and i wish i had this guy pulls me over but i pull over on the wrong side of the road to the battle his i pull over and he pulled me over but he looked at me and he was like this guy's like just a scare dad has never been pulled over before and i was just sit in a car like
i sure wish i hadn't done that and eleven
i can let us
yeah man fucking blue lives mother funny man you just have to act scared of them that's how you deal with the police now yeah when they up you and that's a huge they want they want to see you submit to them
they want to be god forbid they want you to show the belly
there's all those there was a kid
this been a few years ago to totally forgotten his kid in miami
i believe got like grabbed by the screw off by a cop and planted on the pavement arrested and roughed up because he gave him a quote hateful look yeah that was the cops test about a guy look at him wrong we had a guy here that said the guy was talking shit to him and he was on the ground handcuffs so the
the cop stomped on the back of his ad and it was our camera people that video circulated in that guys back on duty
a neighbor and he also had shot another guy he pulled up they do this summer policing program here where plainclothes police drive around an unmarked cars and try to bust drug back those law and they jumped out of the car and this fucking guy took off running because he was like these two guys are chasing me with fucking guns and they shot him and back and the same
op also cake the guy and back to the head he's been a problem zach rosen people know his name in town and he still works
like he has been in trouble yet and it's fucking either one of my favorite new york style pizza place
because they were raising money for that
i had a picture of him sitting on a horse with a black girl standing next to the horse like a little kid and i was like what the fuck
love
i love all the like every time like a cop just like and loads of fucking bazooka into a child on a tricycle there's just like a totally organic story words like a cop played a pick up basketball with china know look at this cop doing the huge dance
drop where did we have a columnist polio cop now that's a dancing cop and he goes to all the rap concerts and dance and
we only got one of our boys and blues your know he comes down does the dog in
mock did you have you seen the video the f b i agent at the bar like he's like doing that he's back flip his gun and also
she gets this poor woman
more recently than me
f b i agent if you guys seen the it's beyond
a video of the horde cop yeah a cop in uniform at a club just like taken his phone out like just get good
of just it has
this guy inflated of i'm just doing her ass is like a foot in front of put photo but it's like that such a weird thing to do yeah like even hours i've already guy were already geiger the urge to be a public like i gotta get this yeah
just annuity and
it's like this fucking cop sees the he's like
pretty great but i'm knocking i know i'm not going to be able to remember it
that are being able to remember things like last year and oh no amount of money i blurry video the it fucking back if that cop gets in trouble though and they show the video that someone else recorded as in recording so was asked at the club i guarantee you his defense will be the same as the event guy who just got
found guilty of killing mcdonald
his defense said yes we all saw the video of you just like this goes could be walking away or just like in no way lunging towards you from ten yards away with a three inch knife you shot him like i don't know how many sixty six
first of all day testified that he was shooting at the knife and you should really out of his hand like a cat
that is like it even follow mill or something
train you to speak to your manager the i actually have slow motion ability
i am able to go on the bullet time i call it a cop mode
i was doing i was curving the it as in the showed in the film wanted
he's such a shithead that he found a way to be convicted as economy my
cook county jury your fucking idiot the the only way they haven't is because there was video of and even that is not a guarantee that oh not out yet
as a reporter and of activist in chicago got together to leak it get it out there it was going to be fucking buried forever and we know for a fact around them manual kept it hidden for a year so that it wouldn't come up before his real change and as that's probably i think why he's not thinking another term because he knows that that's still a time bomb
if there's like a smoking gun proof that he held that back is going to blow up all over again and it's just going to destroy his career so it's trying to go out on top so yeah we saw that video right and it's arguable what happens on it yeah
however in addition to him testifying that i was trying to shoot at the knife
his his his defense said uri like yeah you saw the video but we are arguing that the video is is irrelevant
to the matter at hand because the video doesn't show what he saw from his perspective
cop will just be like yeah that video of me that will have to work in
see when i have seen from my respect
ah cuellar ass
those assets
filled with explosives i i was i when i was looking for any identifying tattoos i can afford it to the isaiah eyes
horny thing that has been make me laugh lately is that right after that stormy daniels thing it came out that the columbus police department had been doing all long term undercover staying on all the strip clubs and
it was going to israel
pay high quality of our oil will pay hundreds of dollars for fuckin l o a lap
fuck fucking taxpayer funded stripped the strip club at the end of which they get to arrest every yeah yeah that's disgusting watch commander i have tactically asked her cane did not think several the dancers actually like me as a person
i got a shot at
she's you comment get on house where my body
i have created a perfect
square perfection
so i can ascertain myself into my tactical george jar
not to bring for non it
with over watch for
over mr kitty
oh my
six fucking months
investigating the sea of strip clubs are given hand jobs didn't have back then
novel idea of his abuse of power by screw that they decide that they're going to do a literally politically motivated hit these guys basically deputized them to donald trump
and said we're going to help you mr president because we love you so much we're going to take this lying bitch is getting you in trouble with her accusations were going to make her look less credible so they literally just in trapped her so that they can discredit her allegations that's just like a fuckin that's that is literal fashion
i wonder like i would love to hear like how this all how because they didn't really talk about how it all went down because of to columbus police department most police departments they don't have to tell you shit
when they arrest somebody they don't have to make anything public
i just don't even know how they got away with be and like we're going to go arrest stormy day and
what a fucking idiot what a fucking bunch of eighty will take even because it's illegal here
there's like the strip club laws here really like
they're really specific it's like you're not allowed to like put your finger on a nipple and they're like oddly specific so i think that it just they were waiting to see one of these one of these people trip up and it didn't take much to arrest her that was wild
again it was retaliatory i think yeah one hundred percent i mean if you're a vice cop you have to be a trump guy gets one hundred percent
i think about that a vice cop is just like a guy who wanted to be a national review bathroom sick a writer but with some somehow too stupid for that
like a guy who's obsessed with sick or something and then do whatever it takes to find a sickle
only the bottom of the bathroom floor
this goes it's like are you sure you know you're for purify in a look within maybe they spend all their times being fucking tyrants like starting says we're reasons
pig
shit like i'm doing it for my kids that don't have but you god willing i will a
yeah no absolutes wine i don't think anybody i do think like if you went around and ask like one hundred people ninety nine of them would say get rid of the vice the vice squad on any police department because that i mean like nothing they don't they do they provide zero service to any but
all right
so that is but an appetizer
or are little taste of the chapel street bike that will be happening wednesday night

how many aw like roger air
he's been as mad said quiet lately like the like the golden state killer
you know some ancestry dot com results
some interesting information oh no
no no no there's not need not be okay
this column
this is a rod column that really takes you on a journey it's really pretty special
and i'm thrilled to share with iran i
this is from just earlier this week
the post american conservative dot com is simply titled nathan's story
hard to tell where this one is going to go but it really in my interest is hate really takes i am i really hope it was just that he was fooled by nathan fielder
keynes and ends there is i don't like the idea of him telling someone's life story
it's about bringing bad firefly make philly
none of my clothes know what this is or where it's going by the work so i'm the only one laughing as here for the first time yeah i'm the only one who possesses the secret rod knowledge
i don't know about that
okay this is how it began what what a fraud was one of us
just as sick on there there's a stranger in the bathroom
just a stranger in the bang birth
it begins like this
i've had these two stories open on my browser for a few days now
i'm going i don't destroy my other hard drive
one is that in incognito town
i'm going to go ahead and post them as a preface for something very strange
the first one is about a rash of cattle mutilations out in rural arizona oh boy you know
fuck that point if i ever
and he's quoting from this article
a cow and ball were both killed overnight an ear cut off a section of hide detached the screw them in penis carefully removed the vaginal cavity god the blood drained he just describing the operation of a slaughter out
no discernible tracks were found near the carcasses which were lying near in infrequently travel the road little blood was found on the ground and the cow was wedged up into a tree as if trying to escape from something by the way the i think the news site he's getting this room is corrupted facts dot com
now it's actually from i'm i'm sorry we have to go back does he think that when they're scared cows high increase
it would certainly appear that way not from the midwest
he said the south east asia louisiana i know says gumbo
the loot they were wedged up into a tree as if trying to escape from something that mean this is not rod writing this is no rod writing by the way this is corrupted news in fact report dot com
it is decades of living in the scrubby pinion juniper forest north of williams the sixty six year old the hand has raised horses and small herd of cattle and seen animals killed by predators such as mountain lines and coyotes he has witnessed scavengers such as ravens and vultures picking it carried but never has he wins
mr deliberate dismemberment he saw last week for people to come out and purposely killed and mutilated animal for their own pleasure is just unreal it's sickening he said as he took his weather beaten hands into his well worn pockets
that's a little journalism they like
try to be a little to right early
around on in your hands in his pocket perhaps they were very special you know now this is a brand new salvage denim city slicker
this is why they have to start making movies about journalists just this guy from like you know the hawks bit press is just like oh i'm like the spotlight
especially since every time some pencil neck fucking journalists tries to describe any fucking like white working class guy they end up just describing a tom of finland painting
yeah i am really muscular hands and by
biceps i can't believe somebody would torture and kill an animal for their own pleasure he said walking into outback steakhouse
there is a twinge of sadness steelworkers voice but elation as he said we work hard play
the state inspector who is investigating this said this isn't random the people who were doing this i would say are professionals he said they was no way way when professional cow
i'm a professional cow vagina
yeah that that's the kansas city mob that the only thing they do any more i had a barrel for post
your understanding you show up at the bus station a downtown kansas city there's a guy a trench gaga wanna buy a cow pussy
like like that he is putting a mob boss is putting its out on cattle and bowl
i want their pushing up by spite of our border
okay so that that's the first story that rod how did his browser window this is the second and this is rod again
the second item is this description of a new show coming up this month on net flicks the chilling adventures of sabrina a darker take on the arty can't
renate
no
should have no he's doing he all right
i yeah i also know where they're going but haven't
louder a flaccid pro are feeling the chilling adventures of sabrina a darker take on the archie comics teenage witch character excerpt from a story about it now this is the excerpt not rod the series which stars
here in in ship who played don draper his daughter on man been as particular orphan daughter of a warlock and the human begins with sabrina spelman sixteenth birthday on the horizon a milestone for which kind in which like a demonic but mitzvah every which are warlock must minutes
yeah
yeah they're guy
must participate in a ritual that includes signing your name and blood in satan his autograph book like a bar mitzvah
and subsequently going off to what is essentially hogwarts from hell for sabrina however the choice becomes a dilemma she's half mortal to and while her father was a heavy a half or so
fucking a cat say something either dies or fucking does it so my mother my mother was a mortal and my dad is a warlock so i get my eye of newt at seven eleven

i had a mortal not in the literal sense of mortality but in a way to categorize the done magically inclined yeah see this is ray science they don't approve of
thank you which find her texas
the cards and rather care i don't think you need a theater
that is have and the community so going on it says the new teaser certainly drives home the fact that this is this darker redo of the cheerful ninety sitcom sabrina the teenage witch is coming from the makers of riverdale the dark streets all time he cars and trio of cool girls and matching outfits all keep it in the same universe as the hits
c w show but now is in riverdale just like staff quarantine porn like a porn but it's like it's like dark archie essentially in our area
where did you have less money
is that doesn't it
the models swarm have
but do you think i got a c w programming
if say having your game with right cause it cheerful but the viewing rot also approved of the nineties t g i f sabrina the teenage witch because i highly doubt it
he thought the idea of a talking cat was anti biblical i pure rod has an article that slick but really how can clarissa explains
it says just the end of the description of this you know he says but no beals above is here and seven foot tall angry goat flesh and thankfully a metro nick salem has been replaced by an actual cat l same okay
how do they make an actual can't talk
here's a ring as an a b c g i evolved years or they get back to rods actual commentary
this is rod breaking and he goes okay the mainstreaming of satanism in pop culture whether you believe this has nothing this has to do with spiritual realities or is merely symbolic is undeniably culturally significant the guardian being the guardian suspects that this new wave of pop up
colt some of which sabrina is but only one example is a manifestation of the political will
what is what does this church
isn't or keys an orthodox christian aren't they supposed to know i mean like my people believe that satan is like walking around and buying a bus ticket we have a very literal interpretation but is this this this even think this is not canon for orthodox people is why i'm asking i wish i knew anything about the sugar
i think like regardless what denomination rod is or isn't he he's going to switch around a few more times
but he he has a nineteenth century interpretations eight in which is like a mean guy new tricks you into being horny yeah
he went on tumbler any found half of push wake reading tarot cards and he's like oh this has got to stop
what about a greek orthodox churches that they do korean you knew the euros credit as are on
so it's not to worship in there because they keep all these exotic birds
ha ha ha ha ha
i've got this bird shit everywhere they have they have jesus on the cross but he's always turning under a heat lamp
the what the priest is reading scripture he's like yeah want to be for curse for dude
i'm not going to i'm going to skip over this guardian article because it's basically just about how witchcraft and cool and which is being adopted by young women is kind of a symbol of feminism and female power etc etc everyone here is a in the dark lord
which is good and cool
just the last quote from this guardian article says when you break societies conforming rules as young women as young women are you are punished the which is an icon to help young women be strong in the face of the push back they get every day so for me these new shows or heartening yes even the horror films okay now we're back to iraq
those first few things that i just talked about this is all a preamble to where the story is actually going this is like the prologue this post called he goes well i agree with harrington that the cold boom is a sign of the times what it signifies is another matter i'd say now that's a set up
you to tell you about a strange telephone call i received yesterday
grandpa same simpson as article where that
whoa oh covered over be the type of books on the colts will speed up as above
i hesitated about whether or not to blog about it don't worry about it too
get of his head as never hesitated before blogging about anything he's a pastor
the color an old friend from whom i hadn't heard in a decade or so gave me permission to blog about it as long as i kept names in identifying details out of the story his name was flash flood or
i love like ten years like this is true detective
the investigating you all back together to scour the mc bathrooms
so he goes
he said others may draw hope for it he wasn't exactly sure why he felt the urge to call me about the matter but he did background nathan as as all called my friend i forgot about neat and it's been so long even discuss nathan i completely last clean ember we need to talk about
nathan
you're hearing about recipe it's not as good as it used to the here's the back or nathan is a devout catholic who lives in a major us city and who works in a for sophisticated professional mill you he is in early middle road was tuxedos to work
he is it an early middle age a husband and father he and his family go to mass daily to fashion weekly i would have noticed
oh i'm sorry
you go to bass today's it i want to have been crazy
when it goes is why do you do that
is out
that's felix's me and my cousin character year we went to bat daily here
you know what this contest where we can go to any mass free for the rest for logs also not as if you if you were you a mass daily like you little you to skip a major meal
yeah do we get a foot up his nephew
ha ha ha
okay guys that's the background this is all the preamble are you ready for this turn here's or he drops
nathan started his story with his jaw dropping line for the past year my wife has been under the care of an exorcist
yeah
you never disappoint
i've never had that particular fetish but i get it
i guess i do
have you considered lancaster veron father
so i you think being caught by some guy that were fast friend spread their
i was about to say like what are the odds that he's like oh honey i would love to go but i see my exorcist
i have to go on a cruise is my exercises
oh shit will draws out of the my wife's services john read corn

okay
i don't know nathan's wife as well as i know him well have you tried putting on a habit or hey
but i can tell you that she is worldly and sophisticated even a lot is devour we are right
he is one of the last people you would imagine having a problem like fifth
you know i sound like a fantasy
damn i can't believe i got possessed i got sixteen hundreds on miles eighties
like i love that only bad people get possess very proud to one of us
the least agree to repossess
will not ever
my be mere man i think our felix i don't know
probably you would probably enjoy the demon to mind
can you imagine would hit it out
oh and hit it out
can you imagine i think we'll is the most likely to readers unwisely i don't know there's i yeah if you're a courteous man
you would be you but you were on this tour i guarantee your go to go to some antique store and purchase a strange lamp or violent just got oh that's cool i just drink it yeah year the nicest guy any like antiques
i feel like virgil like he would get businesses but the team would like his internal monologue would defeat the demon
ora ora we need our living room water that's gotta be a different than the bed or water because you're in a given how jesus as the prince of lies nice ad hominem why are you try some facts estate is just like thought
lucy shows back up and how i'd say was like
you are supposed to be presenting that guy for a longer time he's like yeah i can spend that much time in the bathroom
and let's get get the heck did carriers friend's wife getting plowed by a guy had a bishop fact
nathan sold me the story of how things came to this point
i won't give you too many details out of an abundance of caution
is he holding a flashlight under his chin when he's right not happen
rather it i just like this
this is the of behavior the midnight snack his own
goes it turns out that his wife had an eating disorder as a teenager and tried to kill herself twice back then
now in the middle of her life depression returned but with certain strange characteristics that seemed yeah maybe call
mass every day you fucking freak
now in the middle of her like this is what i was like just imagining what this marriage must be like and he goes now in the middle of her life
depression return but with certain strange characteristics that seemed off
he began to despise religious things inexplicably
and again he said they go to a mass daily
what what insane person wouldn't get sick of that
i tire me sick of the fuck a marvel movies and i see like three of those a year
you imagine if you had to watch like
yeah every fucking day which is the exact number of times you should go to matt yeah every time you don't have to go to mass daily no the dough instruction to do that like twice a week is crazy now i think james joyce use that as like a footnote for someone who is that extreme irish nationalists
you don't unless you're in like an occupied territory there's no reason to go to that my hairy i'm pretty sure you don't get extra grace for going to mass every day
to go to a letter had just frequent flyer miles
the mezzanine section of heaven with the open bar like it here keep your cat it is all open a guy who guy even imagine what their marriages like i can not you're going to find out by the guys there's a lot there's there's a lot more of this ago so i i gotta get through that so he goes when he
went to a quote healing mass there was a manifestation that indicated something dark in alien was at work at in her catholic exorcist today work in a professional way
that's not really ruling out all other medical possibilities to explain the behavior before they start the exorcism of nathan's wife has not been a single event but has required multiple sessions which are still going on
yeah daddy
the exorcism of this is why says a good porno ne the the nathan nathan has been part of the rituals
he was visiting cries in the corner
he told me that eight different spirits have manifested themselves through his wife
oh boy
yeah a strange strange being possessed my wife told me that she wanted me to make her cum once
eight different spirits have manifested themselves through his wife he's been at this long enough now to discern which one is which
they revealed through the rituals that they entered into his wife's family through her grandfather who was involved with the colts in a ritualistic way
when my family brings their work home
i love it when i just get should face to watch heretical but call roger hair and crying
but going back when he says catholic exorcist their professional there's no such thing as a catholic exorcist right because they have denounced actors
the have know it
oh my god get on that they still do it they still do it and white american evangelical protestants look modern i don't like i said though it's more professional it's like you show up and it's like that loony tunes cartoon you in the demon both punch in and say born and sam more and wales above
very professional
nathan said that depending on which evil spirit manifests in particular moment his wife is
there is dina there is patrick think i need to finish this he says nathan said that depending on which evil spirit manifests in a particular moment his wife's face contorted into expressions that he has never seen in her
nearly two decades of marriage yeah he's smiling
she's smiling
removing all the time is literally just describing been married a robin williams
is that were thing this is like every fucking day this woman is poor woman is that to go downstairs and her husband has his back facing her in reading her the options for breakfast in latin
yeah i wonder i wonder if anything about the marriage has your depressed know it's got to be the eight demons
he's basically doing she's basically doing like some sort of demonic fucking improv show
it's like i need one of the kings of hell and a profession
mind your gold the old you'd still try to take away from the show
however it's yes
mind you nathan is one of the least woo friends i have get goes to church every day of his life again he works as what you might call a symbolic analysts in a very worldly occupation and lives in one of the biggest i don't know what the fuck that
advertising rain so he goes way
oops and colors triangle square circle circle
finally normal
a church or five of the afternoon on a tuesday just him and bonita mussolini's grandmother
so he goes
he has been a faithful catholic for as long as i've known but not especially interested in that mystical side of the faith once you've seen reality through the eyes of spiritual warfare he sold me yesterday you can't go back it's everywhere
okay here we go he told me other detailed stories including accounts of bizarre pulsar go see things happening in their apartment and his wife being unable to stand the presence of blesses objects and then in parentheses
is a classic sign of possession
yeah i mean i brought home i brought home general franco's skeleton for commercial
to possess again readers he goes again readers if you knew these people nathan in his wife you would be even more shocked by all of this you are now
this is the kind of family that takes european vacations and lives a sophisticated causing an adequate as it yeah yeah
the family who goes to lords
and yet his horror has overtaken them though color that
he's got needs
the wife goes through periods in which he hears foul blasphemy is and feels compelled to commit suicide in the exorcism sessions nathan says the demons under composure compulsion from the exorcist speak of these things in particular how they intend to destroy nations wife and her family life
far be it for me to endorse the episcopalians but maybe it's time to take a step down to allow our church
just like anything later early anything be yeah whatever
be a fucking unitarian like and make fun of them but like it's nice to like give blink it's the poor people or whatever they do like the advice that probably coming you know
like the worst thing unitarian do is be on real sore throat
yeah
this is where and four when will she be free of them the exorcist can't say the fight continues in regular sessions in our long phone conversation well as i've known as the recession's a day
in our long phone conversation yesterday nathan says that this ordeal has taught him about the power of prayer and the churches weapons against these things he knows that his wife is not his enemy despite the things that sometimes come out of her mouth and he is resolved to hold from to fight for her
through his prayers and to help or be free of these militias intelligent spirits
i like the idea that there's just malicious don't the spirits
people talk about
my wife that he kept saying things like know if i win the lottery first we don't do it was bought a book in liberal a chilling old high school
nathan is the sort of man who would have been played by jimmy stewart or jack lemmon and the nineteen fifties you know how i
yeah
can you imagine that that's the worst movie ever made the man who love church
me tell you right back by wife she if it's so many evil spirits and side of a you don't even know why wife he put fifty in two thousand and evil demons inside of her it's basically it's please please please
he
so all mean that having entered into this world he has learned that more and more ordinary people like him and his wife are turning to exercise
that's a good fight for itself society a dick
i give you like like just like a cage for how you're doing as a civilization how many people are consulting exorcist seems like a good short he has come to see the demonic attacks on marriage and family are increasing and he wants people to know there is hope
but laying claim to that hope require is recognizing the nature of the battle i don't know how i would do if i were in a situation in which our be lying in bed at night and my wife blurted out i hate you
oh boy oh boy
a world i can't imagine a world where by yells i hate you instead of just muttering it quietly
oh like
worst thing you all like oh and i heard from the wise just pretend to be asleep
oh my god this is like it will at last be a demon who else could it be
i imagine you're lying in bed at night and your wife blurts out i hate you and then started growling and an otherworldly voice that's eighth is reality now
that sounds like that
to be our whole message that's that's like a pitch for cbs sitcom
if he is he's a good church go man she's process by
if he if she is like depressed obviously tremendously resent her catholics like husband issues like as a gag like one of just pretend to be pizzazz and growl at he fucking rocks
both iraq and coming
coming to cbs this fall my wife the legion
by the way i love it again he's is like of you imagine if you're lying in bed in the middle of the night out of nowhere your wife blurts out i hate you and then starts growing i think what he interprets is grappling is just the sound of her vibrator
he starts humming in a weird frequency that's she's was asked by eight david
the worse than which is named hitachi
or one of these people
they seem like they're really enjoying life though they're basically living in a d in the game
this coming back soon
oh i think i think my bag boy he's a drought
that's nathan's reality now why he is not afraid when it does this ever come back to the horse vagina is no no
the cabbage it rather oh yeah
you ever do that you accidently like paste your elbows on you're jerking off to
as around i mean i'm assuming he's claiming that these cow to sections are satanic ritual
same with the first the prologue is that like there's just a rise in a cult islam and demonic activists are but cattle mutilations are not the workers say this they are u f o's every fucking don't
can be utilized classic fucking
activity
what's a hard fantasy psi phi divide in this part
a passenger side of a fantasy world and everyone knows that cattle mutilations daily it's not fucking say i do aliens want to immediately cows

no i don't know that quickly and aliens are lazy
and as always the synthesis of these to these two systems
oh
where the allianz a real but their religious and are in fact name the covenant except the sadness aliens and there you go with wide open power felix is the best marxist among us
i've just a dealmaker to i love making deals made one
that's a sublease is was making deals as his is nafta renegotiate okay wait sidebar
he renamed the nafta
no renegotiate nafta is good deal
however he renamed it
the us mexico canada
and he didn't say deal but you know that he wanted tail agreement he said the us mexico can't agree because north north american free trade agreement was too bulky he just had to put list every country that was in false because he forgot
and you know he wanted to say deal well i mean wary eye on canada us mexico
the calm agreement
i'm up
okay back to nathan this is this isn't nathan's reality now and he is not afraid he has to play is early afraid he hit me yeah
that he's either terrified or full of shit
up up up not being afraid if i have yeah
david's it by while he sleeps next every night for that frayed buddy you don't really think are demons living next to you every night
yeah your analyzing getting caught
he has to play his part in rescuing his tormented wife dude just give her a divorce if you want to fucking rescue your heard from her torment to my money
even the know
play who i should say this is great
this is a great line for rod
yes a play his part in rescuing his tormented wife who i should say fully consensus to the exorcism she wants to be free of this through that's the first time rod has ever taken the idea of consent seriously
that sounds like one of those poly couples where the guys like yeah by wife is totally into it
a
what nathan's wife is going through now is like what director william fried kin
a non christian witness then film that his recent documentary the devil and father a more a he goes on to talk about this you william freaking documentary i mean i'm a big fan of the devil and father jones
it's a great movie so he basically just goes on here to i another letter from a friend of mine who met the devil when he went down to georgia
challenged their to a have accessed
oh really
this whole article rod
vouching for nathan's credibility is has been oh this is a guy i am with sometimes and he called me on the telephone
after ten years have no contact and
this really just shows how american he has his real vouching as he works with symbols
so he can't just be a crank yeah her amp or sand percent sign a pound sign you can he sometimes a euro sign that circle with the line through the indicate you shouldn't do something for it and better the killed key
i just i love our rod responds to like any stimulus that all like you're really that's really like only child magic i mean i know it's an older child but it's like just anything he's given he's able to create a world like if you showed him kingdom hearts can you imagine
not on
the walls are bringing down goofy he's met a roth say
anything would drive him insane
so that that is the story of nathan and his wife however if you're a fan of roger i like i am you know the real gems are in the comments or yeah yeah
this comment your mother said talk in hand
my suite mates
you know like a rug call it was like a day or like a fucking like like a port shank or something and then this is like the fucking the thyroid these are the people who write letters and call him on the telephone and the to be like rod my wife is working with them
our read this comment
the encounter i'm about to describe happened six years ago
oh boy i'm disabled and can't drive any longer okay i rely on friends and terror transit for the disabled to get around but six years ago i still took the bus fairly often the driver was moved from another route to the one i use the most often there isn't it
tangible coldness to the woman which i cannot recall ever having been in the presence of before okay this straight
let me at all
not kill me to have a good day i tried taking heard numerous times i tried hailing her numerous size as he gave me enough it
i thought that that
okay
and he enjoyed driving half a block past awaiting rider were stopping half a block short particularly in winter weather and most of all if the waiting passenger was obviously limited mobility
classic demon
that i don't know that's a demon i like how you know a report of of demonic activity is just a hippie yelp review the paper i experienced a horrible counter won't middle school a young man slapped all the books out of my hand
goddamn imagine how many millions john pradesh encounters and a daily basis
the slippers order was half an hour late clearly the work of meals
so she goes i mentioned her to one of the parrot transit drivers who looked at me with dread own
he told me that frida no kidding was president of the local drivers union
if we yeah
if you're a member of a union
you might be
up
as the stop when you're driving a bus my papers by the doubt
any working class hero is now automatically a demon a surly bus driver it was not kissing your ass is now a demon yeah god bless this woman this this kid who works at mcdonalds jacked off at a big mac he must be possessed by the devil
i just like the idea of a bus of the sign at the front just says
do not accuse the driver of being possessed little has even
so it goes here
one day i tried a little test on frieda
a lot to me that though

i tried a little test on frida before i went for the bus i took down a wall crucifix and place it in the inner pocket of my jacket
my trip to walmart was uneventful
any know is as big cat is like you feet high and has a sad he's it like she's carrying a saw shot gun under her like bubble goose jacket
so it goes you know convulsions or shrieks from free to however when the bus returned and i boarded to go home free to seemed incapacitated he sat behind the wheel as though in a trance and her eyes shut and head moving back in for her
this woman whom i never noticed whom i never noticed the human emotion was moaning as though she was in agony
i know it's anecdotal people can dismiss it
yeah fair here is the best part i know it's anecdotal people can dismiss it perhaps she'd just been assailed by been thrill crickets
i love catholics i love that
because that is literally out of the idea of exercise that began it was with another fuck it period
it'd be like that yeah
oh my
it could have just been menstrual cramps but i wonder
last last i reckon i find this paid him like buy her a big presenters
radical support for freedom
last i recommend hostage to the devil by molokai martin it's the hardest book emotionally and spiritually i have ever read if you lack confidence and jesus christ it's probably best that you avoid it
the
there's been so much catholic magic in the past month
supreme court
connor mcgregor
oil of catholics because like day like evangelicals lake
oh we have to adapt to the bone world and like we made our church and help
like catholics try to live in the modern world and just lake
to the older dumb as concepts in there their just like just hearing them like go about their day in encounter like people who don't like that and be like satan
see somebody will jam on their hands on
stick moto there you go oh getting mad at your face after you receive a five percent tip that's the work of satan
this gives me like a deep visceral sympathy for free that because it just makes me think that the last real job i had with where i became a five guess through which was i worked at barnes and noble and i before i got moved to the info desk which i was very good at night actually kind of enjoyed i was i was at the cash register
for hours i would get so bored and frustrated that i would slowly just kind of lose it and buy like our three or four which is almost vibrating with frustration that i was there and i would just be like just angry and i would just have to like consciously suppress my desire to scream about how awful this was just standing here
doing the same thing it's like it was the worship of the world because it was a combination of the mundane sort of factory reality of like working on an assembly line and then like having the smile at people that like having a customer service that was the worst of both worlds and had just imagine if doing that somebody come up to me
flicking holy water at my face
i don't think i would have reacted well i like when i was thinking like this week
you know about like different like dumb liar guys with my friends and i was thinking about this guy who at my old job of being a bouncer who you'd come when i would bounce in the back near the bathroom huge king out there and he was like the type of like dom liar guy who like befriends the manager of a bar so you like really can't tell him to fuck off
what's wrong with feminists who
and here we get free drinks
he's literally disrupted being a bar patron is awesome but every time a woman walked by a quarter
and was yeah she's saying there was one one time the most distant memory i have them is this woman like said oh hi where this guy's name was out of earshot he goes yeah you are almost a quarter put my friend texted me she had herpes and i just left
it it's great because you know that stories ally like why would you lie about that but just like just six seven hours of a time these like a mind numbing interactions and yeah i would just stare at one point on like a outlet plug for five hours just been like
this is all you kill yourself just because you feel like this now there's like the rest of your life isn't this is feel like this version of once they had a job
it's been a while
i had this idea the other day we all have rod we all love the police we all of her
and we all love the
letters that people right to rod that he includes his post real rattling as articles and i wanted to do with this kind of long term troll where i would in theory myself to run by his writing and an email saying you know i'm a good catholic got to go to mass twenty four seven i live in mass and
just as some issues going on and basically just write him and nine letters seem plausible and i mean like most of these don't seem plausible and eventually it evolves and just stores including
quotations from chairman mao
i would encourage all of you to just do that everybody if you have some free time just befriend rod hello
what's on your mind but make everything magical you know like oh you're really matter your boss but your boss is a secret gremlin one
alright guys that was really a manicure presents chopper trap house the exorcist starring rod air and may thing
pittsburgh pennsylvania
that is it for us and i think you guys so much
it's for you guys folk iraq we are sharper trap parents think you guys so budge
cheers everybody can i
