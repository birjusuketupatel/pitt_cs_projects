
feeling like my my my elevated sense of humor was offended by the crew to eat something like celebrity death match for at least there were fucking attempts at humor now is just no no doubt the joke is that they're all sad they all those jokes and both jack horseman they are there are jokes in it yeah oh oh
season three episode fourteen the depressed horse shit heard realizes that his attempts to spend an open relationship are stemming from him neglecting intimacy that stems from childhood issues good thing i brought my hand because that shit is a fucking nice lap
so why i'll i'll go and you can't play with serious topics is now what are some sense the way it does it is the same as always fucking shows which is to say you know this guy he's a shit but he is aware there is a piece of shit but that's not enough but then he's just going to keep knowing his pieces shells and especially on it has to go or
saying was wrestling
michelle i'm not i'm going to be honest with you dude i've never seen the show
i've decided that i don't like it
i don't think their comedy should ever take on serious topics in fact i think that the hate of comedy was when the main comedic genre was like fat guy trying to move the safe was so good yeah
i think there's i mean the shows weakest point i figure it's very feeble attempts at satire but i think what it does very well is it makes the horses tribulations like that
have a man
oh wait wait wait so he's doing the thing a person would fuck
holy shit to do oh my god what if what if the budweiser clydesdale self harm i got one for a while that
she'll be any different if none of them are animals
it would be there's jokes
oh no doubt of and you say and show as jokes the jokes are literally the puns because there any other upon the all the jokes are plans the lowest form of humor so it's the pressure on our jobs there's banter
what what what a project horseman was on celebrity death match against agent smith from the
enemy agent smith was like looks like you're going to the glue factory mr horseman our this before
when celebrity death that versus the horse head from the godfather see
oh yeah that's the kind of thinking that made that show brilliant i can't get coming up next a very special episode of both jack orson the one where steve platypus kills himself
so who it was also increasing you like this just shows also increasing asexual representation and media are now we're cooking
another slap her i prefer the intellectual and sexy cartoon for adults have an earlier era eon flux on mtv
i am flux
i was honestly too scary for me as a kid sister for me now hirst has and obama skinny everyone was assists
no thank you a little thing called stripper ella oh hell yeah stanley was involved in there
yeah it was it a block with surprises
spike tv is a adult animation block with the red and simply where they're gay and they fuck yeah and gary the rat gary the rat
who will be like the high point of of cartoons
a western culture and that's the culture of the make fun of the late nineties so much but
if you told us at the time
the best it's ever going to get a big no way i would argue we can be better than than than the partridge family killing the manson family and machine
we can do better than that turns out now can't do better than that and i love and happens depression and then everyone's brains explode and now all we are sad horses lynette too
iraq's well let's look at the news
yeah yeah let's take a look at the front pages to take our minds are as bad comedy out there
it's it's so depressing
rad it sucks so bad it's bad so let's rewind the clock to the beginning of the week
we talked about a day
mean news story that dominated the week up until you know a couple days ago was of course the the pipe bombs being mailed to prominence democrats and robert deniro yes and we that story
it resolved itself fairly quickly and predictably in that the person who did it was just honestly what of the stupidest
it was equally stupid insane man
that now but what if he has exceeded you smart and a as we said fox news brain destroyed boomer as i say we also you will you were on that episode version also know that oh no oh i know my older our act you were afraid that it wasn't of fox news mag now
i thought it was probably a faxes gravel but i said and private it seems weird how literally none of them work not by accident if you sent thirteen pounds one of whom will go up turns out not if you are this incredible moron
so is this fox news stripper with the magic my kicks ass with the deal with the trump detail van who was like a late bloomer early access or exactly when we would have imagined another interesting threads caesar say ah story is that he's also stealing native american vela he asked
multiple times he's part of the undefeated seminole tribe but apparently that is also bullshit yeah i can always okay
i was willing to hear him out before but now there are no he's lying about that's honestly what you're saying is running for the massachusetts
the real time
a lawsuit against cheap and nails or something because he had some sort of rival stripping company that was using their copyrighted material something like and he was claiming that he was working for ship and adolescent i said no and as normal manga stuff lawsuits against ship and dales a lawsuit against circuit yeah
they don't if you read it
his tweets it look at the van it's clear that he is impaired in i'm way but also not indistinguishable from one hundred million people on twitter
lately i didn't
but i thought the most interesting thing was that he had his house for close down after the mortgage crisis by
by a company that illegally robo signed his mortgage will happen all over the place and then it was later part by steve fucking many options bank so they'll trumps can't say for love his beloved trumps treasury secretary helped steal his house from yeah thank you mr president
it's wonder if you think i made it onto any
we're sticker on his car i don't thank you mr minute
thank you for a to do you have given me the honor to live in my van thank you for suicide squad against or is a thrill ride just as a quick sided then i'm here
i would say it's very fair to say won't be running requires me about this with every extra bumper sticker you have like one two three equals an exponentially increasing level of insanity i think that's a very very yes that's a sign that you see some of them are they
back in their car has over seven bumper stickers walk away it's true i will make eye contact with them have slowly back away
regardless of their political kona now
it has knowledge i had this tennis instructor who was like a run
very easily how many fucking chapter on our entire life
yeah
a hard core like nine eleven truth or and he went out and yeah sorry
yeah i can't believe you've been sitting on his a shitty beat up car and he drove around and there were pictures of american and israeli war crimes
on the windows of his car what guess that's cool how he must have been a really good terrorist threat any would and he said like yeah
people don't like it when a off
a lot of as the looks and acts but you know what era your serve was never better so totally worth it ace everytime the only time i ever want to drive is just to get the most confusing bumper stickers possible
i want like keep hanging i'm for i'm thinking of a free cyprus

oh okay okay
we already had domestic glad it's called circumcision
that's pretty straightforward i agree with that i would have were getting your and
if you tailgate me convert to islam
so yeah now i think i'm buying a car all here's what we're more calvin peeing on another calvin's face
that's like that's just like author or have era
calvin peeing on a word with the word is disrespect
and it makes you think like it's lazy democracies back for being a pro respect it's part of my viral marketing campaign for my awful new film cycles of hate that's about the lives of six people into research new york city and oh by the way it is this is an absolutely true and baffling bumper sticker there's a guy on
it's very park his car parked all time
any as back window cow
it's the sons of anarchy logo but it says new york chapter
yeah we don't have any motorcycles out here with the world's only motorcycle club the ride the subway baby
his family stickers
that but it's all nine supreme court justices
oh wow what be very is no one likes all of them i about
that's my team some people got the red sox i read this the record that sucks so much for joining us one hundred and i i fucking
it was only fifty out of the week us version or the supreme court justice bumper sticker idea so yeah there's the pipe bomb story which had the added benefit of
slightly frightening but more absurd than anything else
is this really was just like someone whose brain has been melted by fox news
the internet and he's already you know already extent mental illness i decided to send pipe bombs that like everyone he saw on the new everyone who was mean do his beloved donald trump okay so there is that and of course people were already in high dudgeon over an outline because it involves the tax on the media
and this overall question that we've been talking about again that this political climate of tribalism and disrespect and violence and know how is it over how he ever going to get better or change your problems are that of course the weekend rolled around and i woke up on saturday to find out that some fucking right wing lunatic neo nazi walked into a synagogue in pittsburgh
ugh just slaughtered eleven mostly elderly
jewish people and that one is just horrific and like they are even know what else to say about it other than the fact that hey if you ever even remotely you were concerned about the caravan or concern troll the idea that it is just an absolute
racist hysteria guess what you believe exactly is the guy who shot those eleven people oh yeah because i mean he attacked the synagogue very specifically and in his own words because of a jewish community group that was working to resettle refugees in america he will need about the caravan i think about an hour before he walked in the door that synagogue
he was obsessed with the idea that you know what did they show that charles for the you will not replace us it was obsessive the idea that
jews are financing the replacements of weights third world immigration in america this is an idea that is aired on the conservative media and in fox news probably about it again an hour before the shooting and probably even after it that's mainstream republican thought i mean late one degree removed with them
any emily st george soros all the time like that's still see jews are doing this but they just say george soros enough liberal elites
like it's couch in those terms but yeah this has been this has been a state at the bottom of all this country's anti immigrant hysteria and paranoia there is that idea this is the idea that motivated guy this is why he killed eleven people he said to the cops after they're doing a genocide to my people all jews must die this is just
great out neo nazi all right white genocide fantasia the base and based around this idea that the caravan represents an invasion of america or a clear and present threat to you know our lives here in america
economic refugees from honduras just desperately trying to cross mexico or seek asylum in the united states
there was a lot of back flipping after the shooting a lot of contort eating their own bodies to would it just happened with the right who had just spent the last month screaming about people being rude to the d h s lady at the mexican restaurant
people being unfair to jeff flake cetera et cetera
you know taking on this very precious definition of violence and the most violent people in our entire political arena
just started become problem
let's raising awareness of the issues with raise awareness of violence all lives matter should whenever this happens because the moment that you actually started thinking about it is what will said just the logical conclusion of kevin mccarthy winning about how george soros is funding some great replacement anything like that and the thing is that they're actually
stuck with it which is why they're pushing back so hard and not really doing the sort of apology you'd expect after an attack of this magnitude because there is no other explanation they have nothing else to sell people when they're trying to explain what's going on in the world because there is a straightforward explanation for things like refugees
and the caravan and everything that people are scared of i mean you have a combination in central america of countries that are financially collapsed into not failed states with the help of american military coups and genocides carried out on me in the last thirty years and also reports now that a lot of people in central america
who are trying to move out are people in small holding farms the can't fucking grow anything anymore because all the sun there's an water for some reason sometimes happening while and economy they're coming from honduras by the way they had an election that was overturned by coos rotor by this country and hillary clinton
personal account as i threw say
overthrow guy who wanted to redistribute land maybe make it easier for a poor person to stay in honduras
like that's pretty straightforward but if you can't accept that as the explanation for this thing you have to have some sort of conspiracy because it's the only way to to square the circle of what's going on and so it's the same thing with the way the talk about soros and
you know there's a straightforward argument about the influence of money in politics it's that all the rich scumbags use their money to control the agenda of the government
but their ideas know these guys like the coax or whatever they're all they're all just concern american citizens who want what's best for everybody george soros you'll notice when they talk about soros their don't talk about them having any kind of self interest of the agenda it's always he has this like long term plan to replace the white people to some sort of subversion of our democracy
what does that get him
what what what so how does it serve his interest in it only serves as interest if he has some sort of alien agenda that you couldn't make sense of because he is different from you in some fundamental way i use a jewish lizard man and of course you know
i mean what happened on saturday is the single worst hate crime perpetrated against jewish people in american history
eleven people yeah it's the same boat of course we know where this is going again it could not be clearer who did this and why this is this is a this is a guy who hated jews he hated black people hated immigrants he hated muslims
dude in right wing propaganda in media who committed an act of mass murder on behalf of is very clear racist right wing beliefs
but we know where this is going of course i can i've already seen and delicate least a half dozen articles about this or tweets about this
it's all going to be like it's going to you about how anti semitism is so bad we have to come together to confront anti semitism be it the guy who just murdered eleven people or louis farrakhan or bt yes or anti zionism and they're already trying to do that in conjunction with the israeli foreign minister or they're like that
is taliban
the education minister who
among other things basically anyone below an orthodox jew is unrelated you etc etc he believes in a version of genocide reduce air but now i mean to this to those zionists it's like oh congratulations you've got the fucking world you wanted all that fucking netanyahu shaking hands
with fucking viktor orban probably the single most anti semitic world leader on the fucking planet
this is what you want the destruction of the assimilation of american jews do american life you got exactly what you fucking wanted and for all the people that spend all earlier this year talking about fare con or linda sir
or or fucking whatever you know it's going to come for you to and just don't fucking cry when you get what you want some going to miss you
lot of thing is good in tel aviv
not a big one thing going well
and this is part and parcel of like a huge and concerted effort to portray jeremy corbin as a vicious anti semite to a bernie sanders as an anti semite that's a cool one
i'm taking place in the background of as a reference netanyahu literally shaking hands and align himself with viktor orban in the far right wing nationalists in europe they don't want to use in their country and guess what
neither does netanyahu he wants juice if feel afraid everywhere in the world so that all come and live in israel now it is
fuck in know so he'll have friends
like a perfect marriage because
they are on the same page about muslims and they both want no jews in their country what what what the israelis zionist and the far right when her in europe or america share they hated squishy little fucking pussy diaspora you more than any because that's what they to leave
if they're not like we're like biological races with the hero choose instead they don't have a country that therefore they can't be part of the nation and the not trustworthy and that they they want to undermine all of your solid you know social orders that exist because they can't be part of it well if you send him to israel then it's amazing how quickly
up all those things so i mean here's a thing
there every single anti semite in the world have any real consequence or power and i'm not talking about like all right great burgers or people posting on the internet and talking about actually anti semitic world leaders media figures politicians guess what they all love israel including
our new friend in brazil paulson era yeah another and
the next thing but honestly depressed me more than anything this week
is the election of boston arrow in brazil an hour right fascist offices are no question about using our rate fascist who is spoken openly about the fact that he is immediately wants to murder probably tens of thousands of people extra judicially torture kill them
then pull those the fucking rainforests and kill every last indigenous person still living there
yeah like an out and out open fascists brazil's actual president has been sent to jail by that foreign country for maria for forty for the former president bill he likes israel so oh you know he likes israel now he's a big fan of israel lot of his supporters and of waving israeli flag he plans to visit there soon
yeah i did you really think paulson arrow or viktor orban be like jewish people personally no i honestly not
either they play they love israel they love israel and just the i'd be prepared for it because you're about if you have any any level of criticism of the israeli state or of zionism in general get ready to be guilt it into believing otherwise well i mean
new hero the resistance max boot has tweet just now where it says speaking of anti semitic dog whistles it's not only global and george soros neo con is often use the same way by oh my god
yeah okay
where's your cash a do
that is for you all right as to how you fucking warm what a fucking oh my fucking god much boot
that as i know it's not enough know
it's an office now enough for him to just like crawl back in the world after both the helping purpose out of his fucking diseased urethra
he asked every yes to retroactively make it make it unfair to criticize him or bill kristol or any of these other fucking asshole
the display that is the most nausea golfing for your second scumbags are the architects of a huge percentage of the current crisis that or it and they're just they just walked away from it and then like you know what let me tell you how to fixes this thing i help make aren't broke the fucking world
and now it's now it's now it's the same is shooting eleven for can used to death in a synagogue to call you what you fucking are go fuck yourself see what was so repellents about the immediate responses to the shooting
with so many people like maximum boots
for the whole the both you could have who's instinct was to use this to grind some other acts whether it was
about farrakhan or they're mad about being called the neo con i'm sorry again my lord i know i had a mattered sanders or again i don't i don't i can't believe i have to say this but i think it bears stating nation of islam numbers and out walking in the synagogues and gunning down jewish people linda source or is it
bt as activists or it's just openly killing jews in the streets of america
it's this guy fucking power and guess what he was on gab and fucking like every other right wing fucking shit hole like that that is who were there is no fucking equivalent of this on the left and and isn't that quotes because i'm not an american hundred thousand email and reactionary might buy anything economically colts
he has a right winger and as far as an axe to grind the attendant to like you're anti zionism is just as dangerous to the jewish people of america than like four on neo nazi his and white nationalism is this idea that oh you know you can't go over there
only the only this man is responsible for his actions and you know you don't do it uses the grind it acts against the president now fuck that trump is absolutely responsible for this shit i mean responsible in so much as he is open the gates all this he is fine that his supporters believe all this shit with the like he makes no difference to him
am and i think as i've said over and over again it's not that he says is for i'll go out and kill jewish people but in him being president and him saying things that he does and the people he surrounds himself with his language about the caravan and soros and and medio de mi and to me that people i think he is given
people who are inclined to do that essentially a kind of permission well that's the thing is though is that the way he explains what's going on in this country in the world to rile up these these rooms
i don't think he necessarily wants them to draw these these and similar conclusions and these races conclusions i don't think he cares but said it's the inevitable thing because it's the only way to explain the world if you believe this if you believe that there's this conspiracy that things aren't operating on any kind of record
nice bow material basis that that isn't just capital accumulation working its way out in imperialism
then you have to fucking have villains identifiable people not forces or classes and and they have to have an obscure in a cult agenda and so people are going to make the people have to draw the conclusion because there's no other way to make sense of it otherwise it's just it's just noise and you don't want that you want to be conquer
sweet enough for people to put their hands around so that they'll say on your side and keep going your rallies and and voting for your your guys were staying activator because that's what he is honestly done i'm like any politics american president i've seen as trying to keep his voters activated after he won which is basically the opposite of what obama
most presidents not even both very few of them even care to do he is trying to keep these people in that election day fervor all year all day throughout his entire presidency and that's kind of never been done but surprising because it is it makes sense to do that now it's small
politics but the thing is it's a piece people are going to keep getting more anxious it will be
keeping more and more scared of the they have to keep worrying about the caravan they have to worry about the consequences of the caravan maybe they were you ever they've got super airborne anything i want to clarify this point because it almost sounds like you're saying oh the republicans have just chosen this tactic of stalking
white supremacy in the country
whereas maybe they could have run on something else like taxes or whatever but i believe that it's the case that it's not a choice it's a necessity because that is fundamental to their movement whatever it is right now
i think it's i don't i think the thing wouldn't necessarily take it if they had other options but i think you're right that they don't have other options because it's the only thing that gets the popular gets popular passions up you're not going anywhere
people to stay motivated and tax cuts it's not going to work even though that's what you actually want that's what for both of these people are they really care about that's not going to keep these looting deep shit showing up at these rallies with her q shirts they need another story they need something more visceral and terrifying with something with enemies something with monsters something where they can be heroes and fighting
and that's not going to work with fucking tax cuts and getting rid of the mandate for obama care
that's why i have to figure wake every country that i grew up and like the best country in the fucking world to live with your jew it's not going to be the case because it's a miracle right that we haven't had as much of a cultural semitism is like france right because we're very we're one of the lease in class conscious
countries on earth oh yeah
and a lot of anti semitism i think a lot of it is just it's people who have never fucking mad a jewish person and you live somewhere where there's no one like that you will this fucking shitty life that socks and you turn on t v in yeah you see like lloyd playing find or somebody and you
you don't really know to do is you just you don't know like the cultural history or the consequences of the history semitism are you know billion things you would have to know like okay why why why as a separate group of white people it's like very powerful you would just have to suddenly figure
sure that this is an alley group that just wants to harm you and not just that like okay some like german jews
and finance and there's an achievement things are the simulation blah blah blah
but it's going to get worse from here because yeah the only thing that will keep people coming out is that election day fervor and the only reason most of these people vote is because fuck the other side
not excited about anything else they're going to do i give you working st paul this is exactly what the tax
exactly what axis is exactly why is enough and excited for that but if this is the only thing that keeps republicans coming out yeah we're gonna we're going to become more like hungry or somewhere like we talk about one guy in particular
which is very germane to this discussion of like is a republican party as it's currently constituted like is there any difference in the modern republican party and just like a white nationalist political party
steve king of iowa
steve king of i were poke and congressmen he is the closest thing in america that we have to like an openly white nationalist a european style right when he just the other week
to some funded junket where he visited auschwitz in poland
he visited auschwitz and then immediately after it gave an interview to an extremely right wing austrian newspaper i think where he said
it was very profound and moving but i felt the need to get a non jewish perspective on the hulk i wanted a polish perspective on the holocaust and i wanted to find out if the communists were worse than the nazis you know what happened is he went to auschwitz and then he snuck downstairs and in the room with a bunch of filing cabinets
and he opened up the box that says jewish lies and i found her dog
if they gotta they gotta honestly put a guard other door it's like it's getting embarrassing but i read lloyd through those a man this guy has grossed but you know steve king
far as i can know he doesn't actually do anything for his constituency
he doesn't pass emily isn't sponsor any bills really what he what he does do is go and press junkets with f for right nationalist politicians and europe
we'll there is that fucking lunatic and other very explicitly white nationalist political movements in europe
and then he says things like you know we can't have a future with someone else is babies and i remember a while ago year ago jonathan chait wrote an article in new york where he was school once again doing what he always does scolding the left for being too bellicose are to quit to tar the entire right wing in this country with the
the sort of neo nazi label and steve king was one of the examples and i asked him is one of the only times he replied to me on twitter rice said john how would you categorize this quote and it was the quote about we can't have a future with other people's babies and he said oh you know i think that's sort of edging closer to rain but not oh
openly white nationalists and it just like what the fuck are you talking about
are you drawing here john and why and i think again very telling if you think about fascism as the rise of fascism as historical phenomenon
this is guys like jonathan chait do they would never ever be as ruthless or parsing to the fucking right wing as they are to the left edging is a good description of jonathan chait writing process
looks as eluding price and it looks like you're trying to sign into white nationals and tell me how many school buses are in this picture and i will decide if you're actually an artsy as john steve king very helpfully kind of laid it on the table somebody in front of them about hanging out with all these cycles you know like users vander racism minorities
like you know from the austrian cricket hate crime party and he goes hey these guys would all be republicans have their in the united states
crack they would be rolling that to parties they really don't have anywhere else to go they would definitely be horribly steve king is like you got a feel for him and away because he's literally just he's like what do i have to do is like looking for hitler his ashes to rob them on his face is like no to and this job changes like
think he's like a newt gingrich public
so many of these guys are like him and that they're just medio figures they don't really have any kind of they don't have an even have an agenda they just they're just kind of hanging out and they love triggering the liberals and people love watching them trigger the lips and it really just shows how hollow even they're like idea for politics this is that it really is just spectacular acts of outrageous races
some the get people mad at them it's not really even designed to be and even constructive even on their terms it's just it's just nihilism provocation and then the next step if if you if you have a political movement that it's not really dedicate anything of his denial a provocation against lives
jews and immigrants are not realistic spectacles violence
that's the next step and that's what happened in pittsburgh and that's why i think like you know bauer and gab is a natural outgrowth of all this this whole moment is sort of instructive and that kind of shows especially coming the exact same time as the election and brazil is that it really does show how the different
basically between fascism as a as a coherent an effective political movement
and fascism is sort of an ambient cultural feeling in brazil and the united states are good good comparison to point that brazil is almost a textbook sort of postmodern fascist situation where you had like a social democratic president of priests
fighting over and economic and social crisis the high crime and
stalling economy
could basically get could through the functions of the of the administrative state she was she was removed from office
an impeachment proceedings that was highly dubious by a bunch of incredibly crooked conventional conservative senators most of whom had done thing far worse than anything she was even accused of
by the way when paulson arrow who is in the senate voted to impeach her did so he dedicated his vote to impeach to the guy who tortured her when she had been a insurgent during the dirty war when they had the dictatorship
and when they removed her from office
the guy the replaced or michelle terror from the from the old fashioned like establishment right basically had no popular support no legitimacy by the end of his term he had something like two percent approval rating as remember talked about the episode she did was ben fogle just no no popular support at all
her attempt to sort of just to cap a taper left was totally without the sort of grounding in a popular
mandate that would have made it stable in the long term and so what will happen is that a party led by this guy who'd been a bozo the a clown and just over a far right provocative who are for all of his current government that had been a very small party just fill the gap
and became this massive transracial to degree and transport class party that harnessed all of the resentment of corruption and failed economic development
again against basically the left party that had been power for so long into this effective mass organization and one of the good definitions pocket definition of fascism robert patterson says it's the suppression of the left amidst popular enthusiasm and that's what
that's paulson arrow is is the conventional right the establishment right wanted to suppress the left party once and for all but did not have the legitimacy to do it and a long term basis and poem
this movement
arises to fill the gap and that's fascism
and so now we have a fish out fascist his personal personal life largest economy in the world
a massive country yeah the fifth largest country in population and they're going to those the fucking rain forest which by the the of hours
what's left of the amazon rainforest in brazil which has already been deeply deeply care summit you understand the course of our life they'll finish that are now saying he's going to turn all over to agribusiness and basically kill every indigenous person as i mentioned earlier the amazon rain forest provides i think a quarter of the world's oxygen yeah it's one of the biggest carbon sinks
the world but that's fine with okay we don't really need it's only a quarter in an era of were what the un says we have a decade to handle global warming cutting down all of the fucking trees we have left that absorb carbon is definitely going to help but as i said so that is fascism on the march as a mass movement with purpose with support of the elites and with actual
voters with an actual popular base of support among among actual citizen
we have the united states is still the establishment right wing party
republicans who are losing legitimacy the same degree that the democrats are in the slow rolling continuing crisis that we've had ever since the economic collapse because we never really recovered from it and we're just sort of re inflating the same bubbles that led to it in the first place and are just going to pop again and that legitimacy is is
weakening and to sort of prop up their support they are courting these feelings of the a great so that stuff shirts like paul ryan and and
john painter and and these guys who don't really give a shit about anything but but the tax code can stay in power and they're happy to use a clown
perfume figure like donald trump as the charismatic front man for they care but they want the judges exactly but you know in the long run if the crisis continues and certainly if we have another collapse
the that patina of institutional legitimacy that they still have is going to be even further eroded and that's when you have to start thinking about a genuine fascism as a feature of american politics in the streets
but that's also going to depend on whether or not the left it begins to an actual threat which they haven't until now but we'll see i mean that's the thing is that the left is also starting to emerge
in power
and influence and try to change the the agenda and the dynamic and that's the kind of thing we can lead to the right turning to these sort of fascist movements to try to counter it
i think that distinction is a very good one and keeping in mind in like the contrast between like you said fascism as a sort of ambient cultural frequency and it as a actual mass movement
which i don't think we have in this country now yeah
yeah but it doesn't mean just because it's week now it shouldn't be opposed all the more vigorously because of the fact that you know better now than later
and i swear it's really about the gab thing i've been enjoying that because i was it briefly about so gab is currently being the platform because the pittsburgh shooter had an account on it he announced his intention to kill these people on gap i mean gab is basically just like an incubator for future school shoot school or mass shooter
and what i find interesting about it is that they pose as like we're defending free speech on the internet
but as soon as this guy killed these people they censored his account what happened is free speech to discussing yeah we need a new gab
fucking bullshit and their cart
starting your class action lawsuit for the shooter goes posting lights on gab i mean i mean it is amazing how fucking shorter cultural memories are because i remember for instance when
culture tilted like popular culture tilted a little more sent your rate right wing than it did now the campaign the right wing campaign against the fucking dixie chicks was more obnoxious and more punitive and more insane than even the most fucking stupid liberal culture like
cancel acts causes yeah the nobody nobody sense the bush years has driven in public a fucking steamroller is over albums maybe that's because we don't have albums anymore
right over a bunch of phone or with as part of the already have laughed
then we need to remember though
i mean i don't shed any tears for what happens to gab
but
the way that this is going to be defuse the way this movie has been to be defused and the freedom this not going to be through any kind of corporate decision them the bottles aren't going to the odds are not saving us the only thing is going to save it as a revitalized
muscular left movement that seizes troll this country frankly before fucking crashes and yet you trust like jack dorsey forty one year old man with a nose ring and like his team of confused people who confuse people in another country who don't really speak the language being forced to work support for like thirty two cents
our that's your vanguard yeah i you know
i think that good man the one thing that would help in the one thing that i'd like to see are these earnest are presumed earnest and seer resistance liberal types coming to terms with the fact that there's no such thing is valerie republicans are valerie conservatives and that they're not
conservatism
you know it just boils down to white supremacy up and down from the steve king out now nazi types to the paul ryan types who you want to destroy the federal government on which sold and e non whites rely by the way just saw story yesterday about in georgia a bus full of elderly africa
american voters being taken too early
early voting on monday
were pulled over by georgia state troopers and essentially forced out of the bus and sent back for doing illegal political work or something
it is just like cannot be more obvious thirty percent of the electronic voting booths in texas are just changing people's votes from beta or to ted cruz and the official say there's something about it that's why i like the impression it was a the voting machines aren't malfunctioning and i'm like yeah know
shit
there's still people you know in the aftermath of the massacre who were saying it you know this
this is due to tribalism
we need civility and i want republicans to denounce steve king i want them to denounce matt gets whatever is an answer or in florida and what do you think is accomplished by that that you say the words and you
your absolves of your sins you are republicans to just to ritual penance while staying in power and continuing to rely on a voting base that is now largely made up of explicit white nationalists made up of people who believe every single thing robert power did is walking he's not
it's a like that like oh yeah of course soros is paying black lives matter to the story by community and is paying for all the caravans is going to flood america with illegals and to be a supporter of this version of american nationalism and to frankly be a supporter of this you know global capitalist system as american hegemony is to be
a white supremacists
oh yea but that's not gonna worries and even economic migrants to the country is to be a white supremacy okay
that that's what it boils fine but that's not going to work that's not even when i didn't suggest anything when do you mean what i'm saying that that frame of of putting everything and a racial category is not gonna get the keep the numbers you need people to sign onto a left wing agenda because there's too many of them are white amount of white people have
an instinct reversion to the concept of white supremacy a lot of them to out all of that's a problem well yeah but you're not going to solve it by scolding people you now have an alternative i'm solving anything right now i'm on a show
okay obviously none of us are solving and they are saying that it needs to be framed in terms of of of pointing out the way to which their agenda harms people's in their day to day lives and how a different sort of economy would help them that has to be for a be the first thing people here because the rest of it honestly as much as it's horrible
the hear this from for somebody who does have you know what
considered obese advanced moral sense
just
white noise pardon the term sure i don't necessarily disagree with that i'm just i'm just frankly sick and tired of having to broke these compromises with white supremacy that the democrats have four years now in very much so guilty of why i started with the police when they go along with all of this nationalistic
militaristic nonsense when they say things like oh this is the sort of violence that should be happening in the middle east not here
or the other thing is i mean saw some of the new republic today it's like decent people can support trumps like tax problem by all these other policies but not his stoking of you know anti semitism more violence against the media and i'm sorry no decent person can support their on the hubble can tax plan or they're fucking immigration power
is or any of that one more thing
this is a regards the democrats and these the browser resistance here's the other thing so far i do not want to fucking here it was going on all week even before this fucking synagogue shooting joe biden in particular obama as well as giving these they're speaking publicly about this and trying to be statesman like the
he talking about it's like trials and they keep talking about this division in this country
we're so divided or whatever and like the problem is the division and not like one side of it i started a problem in america is not that were divided if you're a democratic politician or anyone with any moral sense the problem in this country is the republican party and the right wing movement which is a vehicle for they
are the problem they need to be defeated it's good that we are divided from them but let's go a little further yeah in terms of like actually identifying in combating what is the source of this division
that people are angry or that our politics or so divided is in it of itself not a bad thing
i mean it's an inherent in politics is by definition division because everyone agreed he would need politics politics is managing disagreement and conflict but what's needed to do is not just to say those are the bad guys but to elucidate explicitly what makes them the bad guys what is it about their control of the levers of economic power over people's lives
ability to to to a commiserate the vast majority of people for aggrandizement and their cynical use of of racial resentment and and right wing fascist appeals and order to maintain that that's what makes them the fuck an enemy that's what makes them the that's what makes the division the because they can't have it all
if you have any they have to take it from you to have it all to going to do anything it takes to make that happen i want to respond what will notice the people the left of center people who say i you know you can be a decent person and support the tax credits but i don't like all this white nationalism stuff that
where you draw the line you have to draw some kind of distinction there and implicitly that is the idea that you can have this economic conservatism right you can have this small deregulated free market stay without militarism
without the racial violence without the racial caste system in this country and that's impossible that's absolutely impossible that's a that's a liberal fantasy basically and you can't for instance have the you can have this rigid economic racial
hierarchy in this country without mass incarceration you can't have a prosperous american hegemony without
one hundred billion dollars defense expenditure without torture and violence and murder that we export you have there is no all a cart approach to this is a total isis of exploitation that needs to be overthrown
yeah you can't you can't get people who are being fucked over by an economic order to go along with it without a whole lot of of cultural grievances and resentment based politics and fear to distract them from it so there's no honorable republican party because stripped of all that shit they were on that path before trial
they were looking over your face of electoral relevance they wrote the paper after two thousand and twelve because romney was the unadorned republican agenda of hey tax cuts a corporations are people hey business friendly any lost people like this guy doesn't care about me if he saw me you fucking him his keys because it was a fucking valid
and they were panicked about that and then against their own desire just by the by the
the sheer yearning of the lump in american reactionaries for someone my trump he just gifted them the fucking solution to the problem as a i can fucking sell this dog as long as i can give it the pageantry and the spectacle and the racial button pushing that it needs to be
to be appealing to people who would otherwise find it clearly exploitative and not to their benefit and packs it back that paulson arrow as any mentioned earlier i mean i think that was in here with him and trump much to my own she attic what we're learning i was wrong about it is will it
cities figures there is nobody too stupid or foolish or out there who cannot achieve this high level of power know like that illusion is well whelan yeah i hadn't gone now it's gone i mean and it's one i had up until very recently yeah i'm in italy as often the case is
the canary in the coal mine we had berlusconi a figure everyone looked and said how is the bongo bongo porno tv over the fucking perpetual prime minister of this country and then when he fell he was replaced the leader of the biggest party in italy of the five forbid is a literal clown
preppy grillo he was a fucking tv clown like you walked around with the big lollipop of the propeller be any on his head
bows and arrows a guy they drag out on the brazilian team for years and say check get a lot of this dark a ligaments know him what an idiot and now is the press that yeah there's no limit to it because we were you saying is we need to find and who the dumbest person on t tv is now and just make them they'll they left leader see we thought about this and i want to talk about it
in a future episode or something because i honestly don't think that can work for the left because then because those figures your carrots up on speed
because because the strength of the left comes from clarity of purpose writing it comes from identifying economic sources of exploitation and misery and identifying the causes of them and then identifying solutions and trying to speak to the speak to the needs of the material needs of people clearly i got it i yeah i know exactly who he's kind of he
this each figure today because in the nineties he was on the sitcom where he was he adopted these three orphans and it was just like very like for how see type sitcom and his career took a downturn now he's you know addicted to drugs out
i him at a
fuck you
with this guy tar he's of
oh jack or spin
honestly though i will form the draft matthew lesko super
that's you on a free believer the government add he comes out arenas his question marks it and donald trump is like you look screen
oh you're triggered by the cool that it or not
there was a do your job
research skills the man that's really like the other with short circuit truck because you don't try to make these like really awful shitty singers like people try it on trump like those question marks should be exclamation points right so you're yelling too loudly right it's like you beat you become him
donald trump's voice shows he starts moving his hands around he's like frankly i feel like people asking for free money is a symptom of a culture and matthew lesko was just like tossing things that he's like good to get start a this
you could even be a landmark say
oh my god
here's my i closed my we're going i'm one of those visions out how has that made one of these okay because there was year two thousand and twenty three
field marshal and per wife matthew worth it
up
ian abrams tank

the guy who just be standing record is a pakistani martial artist and they have a whole table set up with a double row of walnuts and he just goes the make an incredible noise the entire time just just absolutely sure reading on that the entire way down and i think it is almost two hundred and under a minute
insane and is fucking forehead is bleeding and the whole time he just like
oh and just plowing through all that either guess i just keep that in mind yeah that's going to be as folks were going to plow through the wall of fascism
heads rather pleasant thoughts we can national cat

beijing's vasco gotta pay for alcohol bullshit
don't state year for video you're forcing that's honestly going to make your words it's like you wake up and you drink and energy drink that should be banned and then you just crash after thirteen hours straight of awful anxiety don't force yourself to feel something you don't feel inside and don't take that there's a baseline of happiness because there isn't unless you're just like
the perfect
hi ah college football fan dumb ass guy and chances are you're not you're not that lucky
but you know the the most desirable be fine
is that you face all the awful things that you see everyday and and keep going that's really all you can ask for an hour of made fun of this advice when it came from my grandmother you've got to keep going the advice of people lived the the great depression but it's true there is something to it
you know you can feel shitty you can feel very hopeless at times and you can feel
what's the way out
that is exactly what they want you to thing you want you to feel fucking beaten down and there is no join your life and sometimes it is very hard to find that joy
just what i said
the sas episode when i said like you know you know they've won when you stop caring about the shared are you start feeling sad or angry or depressed about it like there is good reason to feel hopeless i mean like it does i mean it does feel like fascism whatever you want to call it like advice is just tightening around all of us
then of course the backdrop of catastrophic climate change as well there's reasons to feel despair but nihilism is inherently reactionary
believing and nothing is is handing the keys to the kingdom to all these holes but i try i think the way to to prevent from all just from becoming more build or to sort of self indulgent to spare is to try to act on your beliefs anyway you can i mean i don't know
re listeners situation so i can't give any kind of point out is small percentage illustrious who should not act on their beliefs
but i just like you know and this is hard for people who sort of live online but get off to the degree that you can and talk to people around you if you have a job coworkers
oh organizing at the workplace in organizations
campaigns
do something to feel like you're trying to push against the tide because otherwise you just going to get drowned by it
i will put it this way i don't know the exact course the future
neither do day but if they were sure that it already won they wouldn't want you to stop caring i think that's a good place to leave it
throwback as as
i'm good start but actually i have a great idea
come here and even a trial
maybe i'm naive about how can anyone can tell you i ask of my campaign
farmland to get a better job
and
was you know about the pan am
i was able to get money to my family
oh my fellow government about
sex fair amount
having a coffee shop
