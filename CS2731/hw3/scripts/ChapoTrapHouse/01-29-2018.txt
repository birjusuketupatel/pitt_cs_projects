thanks that a toddler does
my head of off know did you
i've been reading it because it's funny either way
so what do you think sure we get our anger and on criminal one ryan m f grim yeah right
grim and so on will talk socks and politics yeah politics and super bowl or talked me into
we're going to give you all the betting like one of the replies to jerry priceless about his book is i used to like sci fi nowadays the government intrigue is so deep it beggars authors imaginations much more this lowly reader
folks any accuracy use a document
right now onto the main event
weeks interview role that tape
all right we're join now by ryan grim live via satellite live my certainly from the top of the arianna huffington broadcast building and studios ryan grant joining us now to discuss the block buster a piece of shoe other reporting him anything just turned in for the intercept
this week about the dc c and d c c cc the ditch teacher if the d trip turtles
but the episode titled there we go ryan
before i asked you about that i want to i want to get something that happened this week
not in the article per se but i think is largely related to what the article is getting at here
and that's basically where the democrats stand now post this like government shutdown they decided to back out of it some would say cave
on reopening the government with and like when this happened on monday the line was basically they did it to preserve as chip the health care for children and that this is just a ploy to get mitch mcconnell and republicans were they want them on a dock of oh then i think on thursday just
came out that they would not be tying doc or linking it to any future budget negotiations to i have that correct yeah more or less yeah so what is the line out of the democratic leadership now
going from this is a brilliant bit of negotiating to further capitulation on the very issue that this was supposed to be about when the nice thing about this was that we're going to be able to get an answer within the next couple of weeks
there and so part of the line that's coming from them is just wait like we've got this like
there were sitting down with graham and durban and he are going to come together on something or we're going to pass it through the senate and then we're going to jam paul ryan and the freedom caucus and we're going to force them to take it
and the beauty is that within the next few weeks you were going to know whether or not that's actually gonna work but what you saw i think was all two thousand and eighteen related democrats have these nice bunch of folks running in trump states in two thousand and eighteen and they started getting scared and me
saw their poll numbers dipping and chuck schumer had designs on you know it started out like democrats like well let's see if we can not get annihilated in two thousand and eighteen to whoa if we really run the table here we could actually take the senate and so anything that gets in a way of taking the
senate
is going to have take a backseat and by their lights which getting in the way of that is negative perception that they are shutting down the government because of
favre illegal immigrants right
right in states where you don't have a vocal population of dreamers okay so yeah exactly
so i guess wait and see is the line that we that's that's the best that they've got right now
times report the times of war that joe mansion was close to actually retiring and of right yes election this year and the article implied heavily i don't think they came out said it that schumer worked harder to end the shut down because mansion as a moderate in the problem solvers caucus was very
yeah unhappy about yes
that sounds right
and he's a case where you can safely say that if he doesn't run like they're not winning that seat and two thousand and eighteen
like there are a lot of states where you can make an argument that there might be progressive populist that could step in and rally
and actually win a general election
there does not seem to be that possibility in west virginia and so they're looking at them thinking okay well we we lose that see we lose we lose west virginia for like two generations ryan you're saying that but is there any chance that they could perhaps get don blankenship to come over to the donkey side prompt give in
given just making your a barren you america humour has impressive recruiting abilities and he would fit the profile of the kind of
successful business manager greater sell funding in a it
and it doesn't cost much to self funded and election in west virginia
makes hard choices not afraid to get
surfers
a few a cuts through custer red tape is big on criminal justice reform
yeah he's first hand experiences experience the excesses of the system
don attica blankenship yeah future criminal justice reform
so this is this is how the democrats are looking forward to two thousand and eighteen which they are hoping and being a wave election a like a backlash against donald trump
i guess that schumer in in the senate but i want to want to talk now about the peace that you only wrote for the intercept which is really all about the house of representatives and as we said the the d triple six mafia
and their plans for it
you open this piece with a group of activists in lancaster pennsylvania who these are grassroots progressive activists who like after the thousand and sixteen election came together and as you quote in the peace basically said that we don't want to ever get out organized again and our own backyard and they are coming to get around
the core democratic policy issues like preserving the
and then also locally making sure that you know the state of pennsylvania is your house of representatives is kept out of the hands of like tea party freedom caucus yeah hose
these people they call us around a candidate name jess king
can you describe what happened after they've got a fair amount of momentum and indeed fund raising what happened when jess king sort of ran her propose campaign up the flagpole to the bigwigs of the democratic party
not much is basically what happened and i talk to a couple of people on the establishment side who ended up endorsing her opponent and essentially
they didn't really even know that just king was running you know the the parties just like luck
endorse this woman christina hartman in two thousand and sixteen she's going to run again so let's all endorser again and so yeah so just just king she reaches out to emily's list for instance and emily's list know sends back a questionnaire
are you pro choice
are you really pro choice are you
are you lying about being pro choice you sure you're pro choice you know she's so she fills out her all questionnaire gets back to them and that's and that's kind of the end of that and she finds out later that emily's list is endorsing her opponent who had gotten wiped out in the in the two thousand and sixteen election
same with most of the congressional delegation same with ed rendell same with katie mcginty who ran for senate in two thousand and sixteen and last same with this group called and citizens united which was founded by three veterans of the triple see and is ostensibly campaign finance reform group
but they
they endorsed this this this her opponent as well so you know
so she you rally dislike pretty huge grass roots support and she hit the one hundred thousand dollar mark pretty early which is for washington that's kind of a number that starts to get get people interested like oh okay this this this this is somebody me how is this
israel is a one hundred with her grassroots can they are able to raise one hundred grand on her own and her own people without the help of washington and the d triple sees a larger fund raising apparatus like basically all small dollars and yeah basically all local what can you tell us about the difference between just
king as a candidate and cristina hartman the one that they ended up backing i mean you mentioned before and think biggest importer one casino hartman was already a she had already lost before and underperformed hillary clinton in this district still with her the apartment was she was a consultant in in washington
for awhile came back and was a consultant
in in lancaster or in lancaster region
and when she ran she she ran as kind of we're not the you know we're not the republican the republican is terrible is gross
he's just like donald trump
your vote for us and very kind of on objectionable democratic platform if you if you go through her website or if you go through questionnaire that actually filled out for lancaster stands up you know
it's a lot of things that sound like they are very progressive and then you read kind of the questionnaire the just king and you're like oh that that's that's actually mean something like that something i can disagree with so whereas you know the the pristine harm and approaches more like i'm for more opportunity
more access to the kind of and citizens united is actually a good example of that kind of rhetoric it's like yes let's and citizens united
and everybody wants to rally around the idea that you should get rid of scissors you know it's terrible court decision
oh actually what does that mean
i mean and citizens united
but how what how we're going to do that and citizens united
and then what are we going to do after we end that because
citizens united was just a couple of years ago and things were terrible for that too it's like how hillary wall street to cut out high frequency trading and everything just went down and said
large down to the supreme court say citizens united
like citizens united that was founded by a couple consultants right right right
it was a project is up a pack connected to this
a consulting firm called mothership strategies
i thought that
we wrote a show about these people that would be called to out here
yeah it's called i'm a little baby nurse me super
ryan
frank i want to return the article something that just kills and can't
i am really answer your question
sorry about that her her whole strategy was the the clinton strategy that ed rendell strategy of okay we're going to lose some working class votes but we're going to peel peel republicans out of the suburb exactly
age and jerking strategy is the opposite yeah we're we're going to go when those working class people were going to bring our base out we're going to bring the hispanic vote out and we're gonna bring we're going to bring more voters the polls then they bring to the faults exactly know the only group that ever accomplish that we're going to lose working class and pick up suburban
people and it paid off with g it in the early two thousand
the only time it's ever been done successfully right you right here
just says her her her own campaign she said
she planned to focus a populist progressive campaign on canvassing and harnessing grassroots enthusiasm here's the key part if suburban republicans came along attracted by the promise of medicare for all or tuition free public college then great but they would not be kings target
we have lambaste we have made fun of this line that came out of the twenty sixteen election it for every one white working class vote we lose will pick up to in the pennsylvania in the philadelphia suburbs and like this is the this is the real like ongoing test case for that already losing strategy which their doubling
down on again going into two thousand and eighteen what's a wild as that she underperformed hillary clinton
so like let's say that hartman in two thousand and sixteen in a tough year or whatever for democrats in pennsylvania
came came really close to winning and over performed hillary clinton and if you're the trouble sees okay well she was really good she she she outperformed our national candidate let's give it another shot but she actually there were people who went into the ballot box and were like yes i'm voting for hillary clinton
and then looked down at the next one
and they're like no i'm not voting for her i'm voting for the guy's name a smoker
conant i'm going to vote for smoker instead so to underperform hillary and then
you know to immediately rack up all of the establishment endorsements when you jump into the race again
doesn't show whole lot of reflection about the the the strategy that was that objectively collapsed in pennsylvania right
kind of a tangent here but you quote ed rendell saying that in the peace and i know schumer also said that in two thousand and sixteen was that a talking point that the hillary campaign distributed to surrogates to defend their shitty strategy yeah it's certainly became a talking point yes yeah so couple i'm like yeah we call it ed rendell
because he's he's he still the boss of the pennsylvania democratic party
but yeah it was it was like that was it we're gonna yeah yes it's true we're going to lose you know bob over here
but we're gonna pick up a couple ladies out here near the pan era you mentioned at the end of this opening story about lancaster pennsylvania you say you right in mid october the d triple see hosted a candidate week in washington bringing democrats running for the house around the country for training and networking
hartman was invited king was not as part of the canada gathering and off the record happy hour with national reporters was hosted by the detroit will see in the quote wasserman room with the democratic national courtyard
you
there's no fighting in the laws them in a room
he tripped week is ache olympic village
yeah yeah
it's balls for condo it's an all star weekend like hardy be says lobbyists don't get cold
like they're big elaborate
party room when right when you walk in and see it's literally called the wasserman didn't see
their party room is named after debbie wasserman schultz
this is the party they want to recruit a new candidates
again it's just like this
this article at least in that they had this happy hour
wasserman
the washing machine room
popping bottles in the washing machine
people hating on the outside because they can't get in problem solving wasserman room
there are times in journalism where you just have to be grateful
i mean i think it's this article really becomes about like the overall culture of the democratic party and like efforts
slight indications that there may be shifting in one way but then you think there's a party room named after devry washing machine
and the mind begins to balk i want to get to the next thing probably like this is a thing that we should do well and maybe it will become a the next and see chair will have to have an actual position on the name of the wasserman
because i mean perez is probably country with wasserman
that the difference
i thought the top or as the in viper lounge with lana del ray
among often like the lancaster pennsylvania example i want to go down to the thing which i think has been like the sort of the stinger that has been most chaired out of this article can you describe for us what the rolodex test is who knows it and what is it so let's say that you are
thinking about running for congress or you are running for congress and you you obviously want to decouple see support they've got they've got money they've got big email lists got bliss have lots of rich people who are now looking to give to people that the party says i should give to so you won't impress them so you sit down with their
with somebody from the digital seen the most rudimentary version of this is to take your phone out and scroll through your contacts
and say okay
this guy he worked at the law far more i used to work i'm sure he'd hold and house me a fundraiser i bet i bet he'd be good for fifty four hundred himself plus you know he could do a fundraiser for thirty you're like okay were right about thirty five thousand so you and you go through your rolodex you go
your contact list
and you kind of add up
what you can shake out of that and if you know depends on the district
you know it's a lot more expensive to run in new jersey then it has to run in west virginia but if the number is an impressive one then all right let's let's talk to you go through your phone and maybe i've got five thousand bucks out of here
thanks for coming by we don't validate
let me see here rachel millman i think she's good for ten grand
felix can i have ten thousand dollars
get it back whenever i'm going through my contacts right now awry in i see is three different drug dealers i knew in college all name white mike
i thought well you only give once you know just just because they're and there three times does that mean they can give can
we can rely heavily on the white mike
no amount of her support wall as a good boy the first ten names in my account airport are different numbers i can reach my mom at all
does you boys in the senate that's our that's how the show got started
and the bomb you can either occurred
mean that actually is a favored way of
finding a campaign patrick murphy's daddy put about a million bucks in a senate campaign and that was the reason that the cc endorse him over alan grayson
was that two thousand and fourteen and sixteen so yeah actually rich parents that that ends the phone test right there was thrown back in your pocket that's the best way to do anything that your mom you just get permission from your mom you can do anything the world's your oyster cancer and harris's dad died so that she could be a senator that's beautiful
for quite a gift now
obviously know money money talks and bullshit walks and politics is a prime example that you need money to run a campaign and you mention it's more expensive to do that in certain parts of the country than other others
how about the example that you use from minnesota
and just how well it seems like are on the surface obviously the d triple see there are no dummies they know that you need money to win
and you know having money equals a viable candidate and they want to support viable candidates right at the same time
this rolodex text test does favor a certain kind of candidate that has increasingly become more and more distant from the issues and beliefs of the base of the party and you talk a little bit about the case of angie craig and jeff erdman yeah and jeff erdman and and on
i got to put a whole lot about him in the in the story but he's he's been an american government teacher in in the state for two thousand and seven years and think a varsity football coach for almost as long as like friday night lights sky twice he was the minnesota varsity football coach of the year
and he in order to run he went down to eighty percent so that he could get out of school little bit earlier after the football season ended and go out campaigning and trying to get a spin off the ground he did eighty percent yes to keep keep their to keep his health insurance and his wife whose his speech
therapists took a second job
you know so that he could go down to eighty percent now he's kind of a charismatic as you would imagine from a varsity football coach of the year he volunteered for angie craig in two thousand and sixteen
and came away
disaffected watching watching her campaign and so that's why you decided now
jump into the race that's an interesting bio that's the brainy jock type you know he's in the locker room talking about checks and balances and shit
he gives his american government teacher he's very idealistic about the process and public public financing of campaigns and me is also kind of a down the line bernie democratically medicare for all pretty college and of the whole the whole slew and he thinks that that that district in minnesota's is ready for it he doesn't buy the this will turn off
the the rural voters
hey when he was phone banking for angie craig this is one of the things that drove him to run himself he said the script was written for a kind of the metropolitan voter and he said
what if i get a rural person on the phone
and he said the supervisor said to him
you know there are deep thinkers out there are just tell the trailer park story
because angie craig grew up in a in a mobile home
real humble upbringing in somewhere in minnesota
and he's like just tell him the trailer park story
the second thing that drove him was somebody asked him a question at a at the door
you know the answer to it so when you had a chance to talk to to and unit in a queue and a said you know what do we do about that should be direct them to the website or white and she's now don't do that yeah we haven't built out the website yet because we don't want to put our positions up there so that the republicans don't know where we stand certainly because then they'll start attacking us for it and besides we haven't
gonna end of summer polling it
so now i don't necessarily do that just you know animal literature and and move on and he was like that there's just no way and he thinks that not only is at the wrong way to run a campaign but he thought that that was part of the reason she lost and and she badly underperformed to and not only did she underperform hillary clinton minnesota she got fewer votes
then the state house and the state senate candidates
so everybody on the ballot
she lost to literally everybody their show people you know there were thirty thousand people that went into the the ballot
and just did not vote for either her or her or her opponent they were there they they they took the trouble of of driving their asses all the way to the polls and and just didn't vote for so what you're saying is that trailer park story didn't work on the roofs
maybe the intel it to enough people i don't know
i mean again what you're describing is a pattern of the favoring of candidates who have business connections good contacts but essentially run a campaign to the extent that it has a message is not one that resonates with anyone or his pitch to basically modern
republicans and everyone else will be completely like the lack of enthusiasm here is startling thinking is it betrays like a fundamental lack of not only ability purchased interest to talk about politics in a way that connects with people's lives as you said like oh well we can't actually tell me what we believe the republicans will attack us for
if i mean why even run in their place at the republicans know that we're going to be on the ballot they're just going to do the same thing
to be one step ahead of them
it's not even like campaign i mean people have talked about like cynical democratic party machines but you know if only it could be that this isn't even that this is like fucking amway it literally is you're just you're getting a bunch of fucking losers who got sick of staring out the window their corner office because they saw one of those instagram means the phone
janet girl doing yoga
you know make it so that the world
is is your office and yeah i'm going to do that and then they go in with the only skills they have which is looking in their phone book and asking people for money
it's like mary kay for people who sold missiles to the saudis i got an idea what if dietrich goes out and recruits all of those guys who have twitter accounts about that posts success when mine said memes know and all those pictures are those like stock photos of guys and tailored suit standing on boats and shit yeah oh
people always like oh let's get rid of citizens united states
let's get rid of the revision that says senators have a natural born citizens because then we get michael hudson's boys so our same in all the prince of persia they would clean up could you imagine that roy tom perez he went over the moon just weirdly lives thinking the persian pops ah sorry unless they are ryan are you familiar with the
the princes of persia the persian body builders and muscle man
i'm not i'm not a little bit of report
it's the most exciting new progressive group on the ground right now
i'm going to get to google and are
the other reason i picked her to highlight lead i picture the highlight his citizens united endorsed her as well and it turns out that she was on the board of the medical device company pack where she worked for eight years and it was actually the director of the corporate pack in two thousand and twelve
love and from that perch cent tons of money to republicans in the house and senate in an effort to repeal the medical device tax which is one of the underpinnings of the revenue side of of obama care and so as a little unusual that the campaign finance reform group would pick her but all
as a detachable see
that is bother you that this was what she was doing in shortly before she was running as a democrat
how can you suggest that she's part of the establishment she's a lesbian
raising a family
flawless i didn't say that i even say she was part of the establishment actually all i said was
she was directing a corporate pack that was funneling tens of thousands of dollars to republicans in the hole in the house and ryan hold on one of the one of the one of the sort of things that comes up early on that you mentioned already is emily's list which is a big group that's like the big pro choice grew up and i remember back during the campaign there is a bit
big route when bernie sanders describe planned parenthood is the establishment like why did planned parenthood indoors hillary clinton i think he said something to the effect of well they're the democratic establishment and people got very angry at that but they are quite the mean like objectively groups like emily's list and planned parenthood are the democratic establishment really
large part right right the difference but the difference of course between plan parent grandparent actually does things yeah
no they actually like i have a grassroots operation that actually helps people
emily's list absolutely is a part of the establishment now
like i said they they make they endorsed christine arm and over just can't even though both of them are pro choice they have not endorsed kara east man who is pro choice woman running against an anti choice man brad ashford in nebraska
they have not endorsed murray newman was a pro choice woman running against an anti choice man in illinois he's a sitting congressmen so that may be why are shying away from that they have not endorse ruby lopez is running for governor against an anti choice man in texas
so they've jumped into a bunch of competitive primaries between women while staying out of that primaries between a woman and a man went when the man is even anti choice that's you i mean
angie craig
i mean she may have been on the super pac of a medical device company but c'mon if you are an executive at a company that sells medical devices
reforming health care to the benefit of the american patient is at the top of your priorities i mean let's be honest there you works it's you have a hands on experience in that's a plus people like their medical device as i like i have this rape and that's basically a medical device
stay alive i love my lifting belt
better erdman though jeff erdman like you describe this guy you mentioned his bio before like if you were like a hot shot campaign manager for like the democrats would you be dying to get your hands on this guy is a big bear of a man yeah the yes and
there there are a lot of these people that i like this are sort of like a consultants dream if you're looking for the kind of person that can can resonate they just don't have a whole lot of money another another one that i wrote about who has doesn't have any money this woman can mallard who met with emily's list and was about to get their endorsement what their families
landed the trip was going to go a different direction and so emily's list at to go to a different direction but she became a teacher because her father who is a coal miner she discovered was illiterate and so as a child she taught him how to read and that gave her a love of teaching and so she became a t
teacher she learned her politics standing on a picket line with her grandfather who was a coal miner and like
born and raised in this southern virginia
district and you know she can't get the day trip to return phone calls you were talking about money there
how much money is dee trip looking for because in my mind raising one hundred two hundred thousand from a large number of small donors in an off year is impressive and that would have been something that would turn heads say ten years ago right so the other thing that they look for is and the teacher will say our cooperation as a two way street
so they want and i think that this played a role in the just king situation
they one regular conference calls they want access they've put this down and memos they want they want access to your budget
you to commit to spending seventy five percent of your budget on television ads
and they'll give you a list of consultants who will places television ads for you to they have they have a style of campaign that they want you to run
and they call that you know two way communication and so it so it's not just money it's also what you're going to do with the money and my sense and i didn't get this on the king campaign but this is this is the sense that i god is that they were like know like work we're running a field campaign like we have whatever thousands
volunteers signed up we've got small donors were gonna like we're gonna we're not gonna go heavy on the consultants and and television ads we think that there's another way to win this and so that means that the money embracing on her down dollars isn't quite enough is not just money that's what you're going to do with it but in general if you raise one hand if you raise one hundred thousand
dollars and you tell a teachable see us will hire those consultants and will run this kind of campaign that definitely has you in their in their sights that's amazing that that's their doctrine because television advertising has one of the lowest rates of return of any other kind of campaign expenditure by field is a great example i mean it's not
also they will to be fair i'll say just tv or this is seventy five percent of paid messaging so but but that's almost all television ads is for was and why would they likely the others commissions for firms when you buy a long as they cause more there's more money kicking around the same as she world whirlpool it's the say it's the same
pyramid scheme aimed oh shit
t v is fine i mean rick and morty is on tv
you can hang out with all your friends like malcolm in the middle they should advertise on rick and morty oh yeah i can't
that audiences very engaged they know any aegis like oh you have to have a high i q to understand these policies that will be i'm a smart candidate wearing any that
that will resonate with the trailer park crowd
there are intelligent is where you do run ads during trailer park boys
yeah that's the problem there was an hour
okay you you run ads during spike tv while now paramount network flagship
boehner scientist a during the x f l one that comes back oh yeah i'll be a good one
in addition to these these two way street that the d trip talks about in addition to they want you to hire you know consultants and they want you to hire their consultants and they want you to spend this money on t v
also this year they're very keen to avoid certain pitfalls of the twenty six sixteen democratic primary and you reference a memo there was obtained by the young turks which ask their candidates think a series of pledges which amount to you and i will not bad mouth the leadership of the democratic pa
artie or its political per hour
the funny one was i will not do anything that will cost the party
the election general election
well what speaking of two way street
maybe the the democratic party should not be pushing candidates who are going to then lose the general election like it if if this is something that everybody going going to agree to but it says we will focus on our shared values as democrats opposing republicans in other words don't like don't say that your opponent
his sell out or is not as good on healthcare or is not as good a wall street streeter know that you have a better position than them just focus on the fact that you both disagree with republicans on everything how do you run that campaign then don't
yeah lose their
and the system the only way for these these lefty candidates to win is to create this is to create a distinction and to let voters know like there's a choice here on the more progressive one i have the backing of know just democrats are revolution move on whatever whatever elements of that constellation show that okay i'm a proxy for
the left here because the democratic voters would vote for that person and the triple see knows that fits a straight up and down here is what this person actually believes here's what this person actually believes the democratic voting base is going to go to the left every single time and that's what scares them because bait
think that that
that that candidates not going to win the general election i mean that's the that's the best life to put that argument in can talk of a little that rahm emanuel is a figure that comes up in this he was in charge of the teacher policy for a while
what was the role the he played in being a lot like in setting up a lot of the template we're now seeing this i don't know this pattern emerges throughout this article and all of these races and candidates that you guys profile
you start of a roms all a nurse yeah he kind of institutionalized what had been a trend at the detroit will see already which is that
the ideal candidate is somebody who served in the military
owns a business and as wealthy and has a lot of wealthy friends and so can can sell fund self funded campaign
and his centrists to conservative so can appeal to lose
the white working class or whoever they think that they're going to peel off there's this was two thousand and six their strategy worked for them in two thousand and six
partners or who worked on that election for the f l c o i thought well he's he said something like rahm emanuel
had the
the wrong strategy at the right time
said it a little bit better than that but there was a wave and when you have a wave
you're you're going to when you're going to get washed in and so who whoever he had put up was probably going to win and we know because at least three
candidates who rom thought were the best ones to win in the general election actually lost in o six to grass roots candidates
and rom wrote them all off and said okay when now we're gonna lose those now we're going to lose that district and into the cases they won in one of them they they they almost one
and so it it shows that there's really not an omniscient
mr emanuel but you also started like this idea of wave elections are also sort of fools gold if you're going on this strategy because a lot of these candidates they got in and then they lost almost immediately in the next cycle and so i actually think and potter made this point and i agree with that
that people should be thinking differently about forming governing majority is your you're not be when when you have inequality that's this high when you have you know dissatisfaction this intense among the public you're going to have waves all the time people are just going to be pissed that whoever is in power so your objectives should not be to create some
type of permanent majority but create a progressive majority that when it gets in immediately puts in place
some some big popular policies and then you're probably going to your wiped out by if they're popular there you republicans are not going to be able to wipe them out and i think that's exactly what paul ryan and mitch mcconnell decided they're like work we're about lose the house
giving them tax cuts
and thinking that okay we'll lose but democrats aren't going to be able to come in and reverse those tax cuts at least let's say they did six trillion and tax cuts let's say the democrats can chip away at two trillion of it you know they still walked away
with with four trillion dollars as a pretty good haul for two years yet and i may also the ability to point to something in the past i mean everyone always points to obama is
like high personal approval ratings and the fact is guess people liked him a lot especially when they saw him next to trump but that doesn't really mean anything
as far as wave elections as far as midterm elections because people
are not going to vote on the cultural signifies and cultural identity of the democratic party that sort of stopped being able to accomplish big things that people remember it after two thousand and nine and instead
a sense of norms and yeah that can be appealing in what this year will be wave year but when they get in there and if they continue to not really paul anything big like say maybe they do and earned income tax credit ear they ever some voucher for healthcare they're nothing that
mass electorate can point do they are going to get wiped out again and they won't have anything that the republicans will have trouble taking a hatchet to i mean we've seen all the incremental changes that were made her in the obama years have just been completely wiped out in the first in under a year of the but
residents say and it's even possible they could come in and do what city come in the the do medicare for all they do republic college they could still get wiped out
like that's like that's totally possible
blood those games that were made are going to be very hard to do you want to be the the republican that reverses preschool or takes away health care from somebody
this year showed even a bill as unpopular as obama care has been extremely difficult for them to even chip away at your they were able to walk out some of the least popular parts of it the taxes in the mandate
but the but the gains are are staying and so to even if you lose so it's thinking about like let's think about politics as a means toward making people's lives better
rather than as a means toward permanent majorities in the house and say yeah i i mean i got i got into sort of it
good argument with a for obama person about this about obama care versus damage as and they said well don't you don't you think that a republican would just completely dismantled a single payer system but what i said was look at the n h s you had margaret thatcher who is more of a steely eyed
ideologues and donald trump ever could be and actually had this paul ryan as investment in austerity as a belief and she couldn't even get rid of it and yeah it's taken huge hits from
from tories and from new labour but it's still it's still so beloved there is still such a tangible thing that now corbin is able to sort of run i'm poor
putting money back into the n h s and i don't really see any comparable electoral oil you can do obama care you mention no one wants to be the republican that comes in and takes away people's free healthcare and education and that may be true but sometimes politics just is about doing what's right now
what's right
there is something you pointed out in the article that i had never known before and it was about the house financial committee and that the leadership stacks that committee with vulnerable freshman from swing districts because that's where the money is and that ends up preventing any kind of large
changes to the banking industry that would be unfavorable to those donors yeah and in two thousand and nine pelosi even expanded the size of it
i think there were seventy two members of the financial services committee in two thousand and nine i mean that that's not a committee any more
that's bigger than are some legislatures and you're exactly right the reason is
you call every banker in new york and say hey i'm congress from so and so i am a member of the financial services committee know here my account details
and and so they just rack up the contributions and because they're from swing states and because they've been the product of the triple see let's get business friendly centrists in their those are conservative members and so they're the ones that are
you're voting down progressive legislation that the best example i i i've seen players live was when there was an attempt to make auto dealers part of the consumer financial protection bureau in my god like can you think of a business that is more need of consumer protections and the auto dealers
democrats are all in favor of this as the vote is going on the the freshman and sophomore sit down on what they call the bottom two rows and so it gets down to the bottom two rows and they start the freshman freshman and sophomore start voting no on this and so it becomes clear that this thing's going
down and auto to not can be part of this so now all of these democrats who had voted for it
say a way how am i recorded on their vote a your your record as a yes i meant to vote no to all change their votes to know because of the things not going to pass you might as well vote with the industry
so you can go hit them up and so it shows that like a single member is not just a static guy sitting in the legislature they have a dynamic effect on how how these votes go and so if you just looked at the vote it was it was a landslide but it actually would have been quite close and if it weren't for these conservatives
stuffed on this panel
so that they could raise money for the banks
the past and now you see all these shady lending products
popping out of these car dealerships it's staggering to me how short sighted that strategy is that if if our emphasis is just to have so much money that we're going to outspend our opponents in the next election what we'll do that at the expense of passing legislation that would either be popular or would actually
create some institutional cushion such as
car jack or expanding voting rights or statehood for porto rico or something like that that would actually maintain our majority if your plan a money game with republicans that's that's a long term loser
limit i mean there's there's there's a limit to how much impact spending is going to have i mean hillary outspent donald trump two to one it didn't matter
no that's right and
if if you see victories by people like just king
in these in these primaries
then you're going to see a significant portion of of the establishment in the party saying oh wait actually this there's money their money and this and there is winning in this paradoxically come out of citizens united with with a party that is hugely funded by small dollars know if if all of these days
eight house and states senate candidates that are running around the country build up their grassroots networks and and they rise through the ranks your you could genuinely have a small dollar funded
party or at least like a big enough portion of the party that it becomes the dominant partner in a coalition
against a party that funded by one or two billionaires like that's a possible
outcome yeah but it's the party is still going to be as strong as it's weakest member and if you still are people like joe mansion holding the balance of power and calling the shots you are going to be married to whatever his policy priorities are right right so so you have to keep elevating that weakest member but
yeah that's that's very true i mean there isn't you know there's there's thursday trip which for the most part calls the shots because all of organizations like emily's list will follow their lead but you don't really have anything comparable right now on the left you just have this kind of diffuse power among a lot of these grassroots groups like p trip or
faye join us democrats now
there's no like the right now has the and r a like so that their function now is to basically annoying the real conservative in the race like it's not even about guns
as like this
so if you're a republican and you want to know who to vote for and you want the most conservative guy you vote for the and i endorse candidate and there really isn't anything like that on the left and i think part of that is that it's because the left as a coalition of know a bunch of different interest groups was the right is white people
so that makes it harder but it does seem like that's something that needed yeah i think i think there's an opportunity there are ryan i'm curious this article has gotten a lot of burning i'm curious what if any response responsive you gotten from the d trip or it's surrogate son defenders in the media
have you gotten any push back on this article not a time i think i think they're taking their medicine
i had no they were pretty well prepped for for what was coming and so it makes the prime makes blow a little easier to take
we had a few quibbles here and there but nothing you know to the heart of it i mean let me know what do i have i mean they certainly didn't like it i'll say that but i think it's unnecessary conversation and maybe eventually they'll even recognize that one of the one of the winds that i heard that
today was this idea that like oh you know this is the intercept they hate democrats or whatever they're trying to tell you that the democrats are so incompetent that they lost an election to donald trump but are also so ruthless and efficient that you can't win a primary against them
if you read as not what we said
i forgot about that
really i actually think that i actually think that says
some of these candidates are going to win
and we're going to follow their race is closely
so like i don't hate the democratic party
i don't i don't i feel one way or the other about it
is a fact that they are endorsing in a lot of cases these is establishment candidates
but i don't think that that means they're going to win so i don't i don't i don't actually think they're omnipotent i think they're going to find out that they screwed up some of their own house races i think there was a good chance just king wings for instance i'm ryan you quoted someone who will alluded to brainless twenty six year olds running the
washington
so who is this class of people and have you met any of these these people laying the strategic decisions will the editor of the piece was twenty six and she has that the person quoted actually apologized on twitter to all twenty six year olds
for for that
yeah it's a it's you know it's a kind of folks who have worked on some statehouse campaigns maybe some states senate campaigns local stuff like they probably ran for class president
or ran somebody his campaign for class president which even stranger
but you know they've they've just always been into politics as as for the sport of it
not to say that they don't believe in what the same but like they love the hand to hand combat of of politics and and so they want they want to rise up through the democratic party ranks and so the they win a couple local races
wind up being so no midwest
no political director for a teachable see or southern political director
there you go on and generally you become a consultant
and you take on clients who are these candidates and that's where that's where you make the money because your i mean you have to make the money goes for a year you're unemployed
but then the year that you're making money you're making a lot of money because you're selling the same product
to like ten or twenty different candidates because you're basically telling them all to run the same same campaign and the retainers you can check it out
reports that retainers are pretty sweet and you know if you're making five thousand dollars a month
and you've got ten of those you're doing i guess just do it to wrap things up i mean what you have here i think is like the deep trouble people will say would you like we want democrats to win and their fears always that the general actor eight is more right wing than the democratic primary right
however i really think reading this article it's hard to come away from it at least for me
within the impression that at the leadership of the democratic party would rather lose with moderate than when with candidates that create an expectation that they have to deliver on popular or left leaning policy goals or to put it another way their their power within the institution the democratic party
more important than the overall power of the democratic party yeah if you do with the way that it's been done before and you lose it's not your fault
no it's just a bad year
if you try something new and you lose it's your fault
you should have done it the way we did it last time so i do think there's a lot of version there that plays out there though reminds me of some of the lessons you get from the dilbert books about that stupid boss
yeah
in closing
message to anyone of years
is god they're change the system run for something if you are legally engendered from running for city council or state legislature in in high school run for student body president it doesn't matter of their arrest you use a constitutional right to be and then i was the middle school president
going for a run for kindergarten student government was the again the democrats don't and their hands in their we started this change in the bottom up let's do it
i believe in you are the neighborhood association to be one of those asshole like gives out it's because people though the clip their lawns and yeah be the guy who assaults rand paul
i do it just do it run for just run for an election between you and your friends have a falling out over it or hate them and create a blood feud against the cut their briggs go to prison get elected in there
