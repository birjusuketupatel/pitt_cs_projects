one it's a bit a little light viral video of
raccoon climbing the u b s building in downtown minneapolis but hey we know it we've got a special guest to talk about this wacky critter it's minnesota native former governor jesse ventura
jesse welcome into the shower
we'll got from i'm on worth it
got out on a your chair
comments and i ordered clear on the fibers
jesse your former governor of the state governor of minnesota so i know you must have seen this raccoon and his ascent to the top of this office building we were all riveted by me tell you
glued to my limits laptop i was in mexico and let me tell ya i saw that little critter and i knew immediately that there was more to the story you call it like new well let me tell you something
there's always a dark side of the lighter side of the new which i saw that and i was you rooted on the fact first off you wish and shape all i i'm on the record saying always the dump
sure he was trying to crawl out of there who could blame your raccoon and shape all you want to get to minneapolis but you can because of the high res sure you're gonna go up chicago look at the facts look at the and look at what he was draw
that little raccoon wish climate up the building he was looking for and church way so what's going on in the building in which the u b yes building is pointing us he knows that he has the attention of none show the public radio you know that immediately he is going to l the top my range of the group state of men his shoulder
following show what does he do he climbed street for the logo
yes and he he wants to go straight to the heart of the banking system what's happening two billion dollars down a black hole
up and you know what the main stream authorities try to distract him and bring him back down and he was confused for a second it was ready the dragon steamboat blinded by blood
stumbling around the rain
that raised as are they should keep going for at rack on it
all right now the beatles' white album it's all their rocky raccoon you started in minnesota you checked into his room there was a good a huge bible
wasn't enough
what what is this record trying to bring attention to what what what what's going on in this building while you know i have a theory i don't believe either day you do use or gods
but i believe that when you human beings fail to do what we should be doing that
nature sims the animals to step up
this sort of an animal spirit imbued in an animal but representing us all in a way the
situation calls for it nature boy real show off the rich ric flair for a common procedure gonna die
guess he had me out
going to see more of these super intelligent raccoons i mean they're suddenly becoming more popular in movies yeah well i wanna know i want to know climate up that far we've got to what we need to do which we need to follow his work and help him and get the resources there were you need to be putting boots on the ground we need to have if i were still governor
or i would have had frog defending every level scaffolding just as a matter of policy every day or the week
and then they would have been there to intercept the raccoon when he chose to go up but i think we've gotta put the resources on the ground and find out if you were scale of that use the guardians of the galaxy raccoon we are groot is there a group grow and off that build it
he has big winner a little what just it's just like you all said you know like the democrats and republicans they're not talking about real issues so there
as for you've got the republic crash
or the demo publications
or sometimes i like to see the republic cracked of date
the i know we were going to turn to sources outside the mainstream media the two parties have failed
the american people they tag in just the ventura
gags out there the raccoon tech ship that sell free to works like i'm a tag team partner of billions of organic creatures album i
i can hear you chortling but i guarantee you somebody who is not george only is any citizen of minnesota there are proud of the light rail that i installed yeah
you can go right to the state fairgrounds on that goddamn light
when i'm sure well i'm surfing and mexico that's one of two things that my by goes to proudly i think of that and i think of a one time i couldn't get out of a camel clutch
jesse i got to say what i was watching the raccoon skill this building
a thought that spring to mind was an issue that i know you've brought light on before
i was thinking maybe this raccoon escape from some sort of government lab where they're making an animal's maybe he's trying to bring to light the issue of mammals and they're going on in these government labs that we don't know that's the first that's obviously square one that's what we're building our theories ah that's the concrete
what we know what we know we're looking for our don't obviously yeah as old as the land of ten thousand lakes
it on the side of the butter bucks it's the land the lakes we've got ireland and most lakes and i have information when i wish governor delivered to me he had manila folder
but the island of dr moreau literally with a leak in minnesota
i experimented with raccoons they were experimenting when i wish governor i tried to get to the bottom of it but i was stopped by the two party system and garrison keeler i just stopped by investigation but i was on it they were they were there were there were experimenting and raccoons
giving them different color greetings
they had peppermint color greco drug and around that is let's straight
all area had lobbied i had two terms i want to put a stop to what i mean i think we need to know more about what's going on at the lake woebegone research facility yeah i'll look or garrison keeler went down but the dark money behind still up
god chap
ask questions
oh the raccoon
you astray
follow the raccoon all the raccoon that is where all the answers lead cow and the raccoon whole hash tag follow the raccoon folk
put it on social media to beat we're going to be devoting three hours to that other



we are path
your shop for this week
i'm just not i this we have licks could be with us he
game for thirteen hours straight last night and slept through his non existent alarm but don't worry you're not fear we are not completely unmanned joining us is libby watson libby was up
i'm really sorry to hear the phoenix suns diet like one of those korean kids strong just scanning jihad illness and greatly he was gaming and the same room with a fan when he went to sleep and that's what happened
be thanks so much for joining us
resident
wants you to talk about this
ballot measure that's going on in d c right now about kept wages are making a uniform
minimum wage for tipped employees
we'll get it added a little bed
it's a interesting local labour issue but before then
just overwhelmingly were thing and like you know what what what what are we gonna talk about on on the weekend show and
like overwhelmingly can he the only news story
really worth addressing from like a broad perspective right now and the news is the you know the reality that the the writers for season two thousand and eighteen of america have decided to you i think push their luck a little bit and go
it's something really outrageous like child concentration camps to get viewers back now that it's become a little boring and i gotta say i'm not liking it yet and i mean it
shot
it was a concentration camp it's pretty pretty lame and i guess like aren't even know where where to begin with this topic but you know we're now living in a country where ice steals children from families trying to cross the us mexican border
friends them from their arms and puts them into privately run concentration camps
i mean how hard you know where to go by i don't know i'll just begin with this account from npr who reading here says kids started appearing at the shelter who didn't know the drill they had just been separated from their parents so they were experiencing an increased amount of trauma trauma said and
davidson who worked for southwest he a nonprofit that operates more than two dozen shelters for migrant children from texas to california davidson quit this week because the shelter where he worked in tucson arizona didn't have the train staffing to handle the influx of a younger more traumatize children he said the breaking point for davidson
came he says when he was asked to tell two siblings ages six and ten that they could hug each other they called me over the radio and they wanted to translate to these kids that the rule of the shelter is that they're not allowed to hug he says
these are kids that had just been separated from their mom basically just huddling and hoping each other in a desperate attempt remain together southwest keys as it has a clear policy that allows touching and hugging in certain circumstances
well never mind while they're yeah they're allowed to hug in certain circumstances
i'm going off that i saw jaw pollack of bright part apparently visited one of these child concentration camps and said that they had a problem for the kids in that they also they were field trips to the zoo so all in all we've been misinformed about what these things are what goes down on them right
seemed a stupid thing about that is joe pollack didn't go to one of the new year's census boys that have been separated from that parents as a result of the new policy he went to an officer
he resettlement
center where unaccompanied child line is have been house since two thousand and fourteen so not so excuse not to say so it's fine but he was visiting a completely different
facility from the ones that everyone else has been visiting another facility they visited this week we saw of one of the reporters who are allowed into one of these again child prisons we saw they had a one of these facilities a giant mural of donald trump behind an american flag with an inspirational quote from the
the deal that read sometimes when you lose the battle you find a way to win the war
and again you know i don't want to belabor this comparison too much you know reports came in their parents were told that their children were being taken to a shower and then hours later realized that they had just been taken away
parallels there are two striking to miss but a quote from the art of the deal that leads you into a child concentration camp really is the are parked might mark vi of our times only even stupider which is the real hallmark of everything
though is the stupidest version of anything you can imagine and the cruelest yeah it's deeply american i would say it's it's definitely a
got that upsurge
separation and reality sense that things in america have i think the only way it could be more american would be if it was sponsored by mcdonalds or something or if it was in an abandoned walmart away a lot of them
i didn't realize
you know you see stuff like this and like i said the accounts of ice agents
do in the old were taking your kids to the shower trick which again i don't like anyone saying that it's inappropriate to compare this to the holocaust is completely for shit it's like it doesn't have to be a death camp for to be a concentration camp the original definition of a concentration camp was a place it was yeah camp in which
ethnic minorities could be segregated from the rest of the population including women and children to make the fighting may male population first using the boer war by the british i mean it's literally by definition these are child concentration camps
and it's just we're dealing with it case of like such obvious staggering evil confronting us evil that is i'm sorry if you're a citizen of this country you are responsible for it's all of our fault with you voted for donald trump or not
our country this is happening within our borders it's happening in plain sight everybody knows or these facilities are everybody knows it's going on there's thousands of kids being held right now
and it's going on like i said on the open and i guess my question is how do we how do we deal with this and i don't mean deal with it like psychologically like how do we how do we stop this because like we just we feel like we're confronted with
both this the staggering evolve what's going on but also this terrible sense that you know
since of paralysis or fatigue that is just like where you throw up your arms and just go oh well that's just twenty eighteen dumpster fire year of the stupidest fucking century ever in human history where we do i completely agree i've been thinking about that a week and a lot of the times with stuff under trump
i my instinct has been worth for example the healthcare bill that almost happened last year and the tax cuts
know i keep thinking i mean democrats to be stronger and stand up and everything because the republican party is pretty much beyond any kind of
influence as a i it's most disgusting elements the reason people always rag on even like us for criticizing democrats too much when republicans are was but it's because you're a republican the just be on the fucking pale this like what can you even say or a republican policy anymore they just they clearly just beyond that
i've been thinking about i mean democrats are being disabled the right things on this and you know some of them are going to the facilities and stuff and all that's great but it just feels so few tile because while can to you there again the republican party is never going to they're not going to whole donald trump all his administration accountable as whole and they want this in a good chunk of them want this
so i don't know how we overcome the machinery of the state let alone public opinion and you know that good and i was thirty percent of americans you will just simple whatever it is that donald trump does it it's really hard to know you think about i mean i wish i had a good answer or i mean i have been seen some
representatives have been going to these facilities and demanding and friends to inspect these facilities who talked to some of these kids but you mention democrats him the right things i mean not all of them are i'm sitting in particular kemal a harris twenty twenty hopeful when on chris hayes is show
and chris hayes and to asked her point blank should ice exist
a government agency that literally didn't exist twenty years ago and come our harris gave a long stem winding qualification about how you know chris i'm a prosecutor and my mom most important thing if people are committing murders and rapes like the to be punished and if theory legal if you he deported so yes i think i should exist but no i don't think that
should be know separating children from their families and it's like you can't get come on
should be the easiest fucking question to ask any democratic hopeful for twenty twenty should ice exists the answer and no easy and eating and then just to be clear that that clear that wasn't from last week it was actually from march that she said oh really
this week
doesn't excuse not it should have been fucking clear years ago let alone in march that we should abolish ice but that was that wasn't this way people will reach sharing everything because it's like yeah you said this two months ago one of three months ago still should have been class so yeah i mean i don't have a lot of a
the twenty twenty field is going to articulate a complete and reason response to this and it is it must be said lake
his extreme and horrendous is what's going on now is
there has been a machine in place to know
torture and exploit and abuse immigrants four years now and it was happening under up on our and it's been happening for years so it needs to be a broader reckoning and just the small matter of child separation absolutely and obama deported more people than like the last few presidents before him
mind but what we're seeing right now is policy put in place that is crafted by into appeal to again like shouldn't be controversial to say this in the slightest
the white supremacist part of our population and government and i'm speaking of course about jeff sessions who absolutely believes this is the right thing to do because he believes america is a white country and in particular also in the trump administration steven miller
there's been several news arms this week about how this whole child separation policy was absent was his brain child from the get go and he's a guy who's been in the background of the trump administration the entire time and it's been very much under the radar and he's the one fucking just absolute reptile who i think is probably
it to this white house and anyone because his name is out of the news and he's getting what he wants and it's just it's just blows my mind like i mean in general i again i think the media has been largely pretty good about treating rest is the extreme disgusting thing that is but just not equipped for this level
you know illegal and open an evil activity like you see their reports is saying you know steve miller saying credit for this and stuff and like in a sensible society that would be that would be that would participate him being sent to the hague you know that would be like okay well we'll send this bitch to jail than there would be
an inquiry that would be an investigation would be some kind of way to say oh it was this guy's idea whoa he's going to present for the rest of his life as know i'm going to happen
he's going to leave the white house and he's going to found some fuckin consulting firm for the most disgusting republican this and make a good salary for the rest of his life and he'll be fine i mean again
gets back to this question of you know what has to be done as someone once said but i mean again we know where these facilities are and it's just like we're seeing like the limits of what normal politics can accomplish our normal politics have accomplished something and it's rending children from the mother their mother's arms and putting them
tent cities in the middle of the desert as a specific policy of torturing their parents and stephen moyer said you know raising the price of trying to live in this country if you were born here yeah
it's just heartbreaking i was at the gym and working out which i do you all the time to his i'm incredibly impressive and i was watching m s n b c and there was a girl
being interviewed because she had been she was there a part of a protest and she had brought letters from like other kids and people in america and stuff and she was just going to read them out loud outside the facility to let the kids now they're not alone and stuff and it's just like when you have other children
if i were the portland thing and it's like when you have other children having to stand up and do you know just like the only thing they can do like that is just the as heartbreaking fucking thing but i think you're right it has to be asked to be direct action like people who got to go there and they got to disrupt it physically hurt to start doing things that are illegal to physical
blocking the entrances and exits yeah letting people leave or go to work you know being arrested themselves again for starters will he get rid of every one of these camps tomorrow if enough people just decided to literally storm them and dismantle them and free the children inside or take them into their own homes and
going underground railroad it's been done before but i think what we would see now is obviously the retaliation from the state would probably be swift and overwhelming and as was the surveillance of anyone involved in you know fuck we saw what happened and jake for hours for just treating them as easy should be killed let alone
actually tried to physically stops of one of them from doing their jobs right of course and we know that border patrol and have no problem
she's shooting at can anyone who tries to help are immigrants at all
that is where the mine has to go if your rational person is to you like irrational means are things that seem like beyond the pale i mean it's happened before in the history of this country and yeah probably should happen again to be on that but at the very least jeff sessions shouldn't be allowed to be able to leave his home without
oh
yelling at you know like the home a bad man episode where have a hard working with saw that should be jeff sessions like the rest of his life i just want to share and then briefly that just came across the wires that i think as a counterpoint to me saying that the media has been generally pretty good on this witches
maloney a trumpet out a statement saying mrs trump hates to see children separated from their families and hope both side of the aisle can achieve can finally come together to achieve successful integration or whole and she believes we need to be a country that follows all laws but also a country that governs with heart and phillip russia who is the whitehouse spirit
she for the washington post said milan a trap seems to break with the trump administration not at all
zero tolerance
fitch no no she doesn't you
and fuse reiterating the whole point of this is too strong arm the democrats passing a comprehensive immigration reform that gives them things like the wall and also limits legal immigration
this whole was all an effort to try to create leverage to pass something that will be brutally restrictive
and do things like glue them legal immigration which which hardliners always insists there isn't a problem no
or and we're worried about illegal immigration
if you obey the law them we have no problem with you but the goal of this this bill the from trying to wring out of the democrats
do by means of this sadistic for didn't claim gooey on display is to limit legal immigration and drastically increase penalties for trying to get this country at all and anyway that is the other thing about you know when the immigration hardliners are like you know
the facebook people facebook america talks about this issue
it's it's all these people whose fucking irish or italian grand parents you know that or they came through this country the railway you know my answer to escape if the came here at a time when they're literally was no immigration laws you like movies will use literally just came up with the said hi
i'm linguine scallops
your name is louis school make your you go
but the other thing is like even he will talk about it now they're like you know don't blame trump don't blame eyes blame these parents for breaking the law and putting their kids and harm breaking
civil offense we're talking about these are misdemeanor laws that are being broken here like if you've ever driven drunk or like dirt dirt and faster than illegal speed limit like you are committing a more serious crime than overseeing a visa or crossing an invisible line without permission but yeah of course some
these people are coming here to seek asylum which is not illegal it's not illegal to come to a country and seek asylum but everyone is being treated as a criminal just crossing the border which is completely insane will also i mean again like if you're talking about people were coming seeking asylum from central american countries like el salvador there are a lot of them are seeking asylum from the
catastrophic gang violence in their countries which is in turn being used as a reason not to let them in the country from m s thirteen or whatever and i'm sorry like reason el salvador is such a violent country is because of this country in the first fucking boys gather is that case recently where the justice department
prosecuted a salvadoran woman
and immigration violation
and they said that because she had been forced to work she had been forced into labour by salvadoran gang she had forgiven material support to use a salvadoran gang and therefore she was ineligible for i
it's just the most fucked up shit pretty cruel sadism just writ large out or out in the open as part of it again a part of a policy that is about hurting people who want to come live in this country because they're not the right color and we don't want them around idea though we just don't have enough space or money in this country to any any more
people in the people who work there should i mean my god anyone who's working for eight team they have essentially disqualify themselves from any any job with more responsibility than a fucking dog walker
they should have federal law enforcement
authorities and the same any kind of immigration mechanism that we have to have because you have to have immigration enforcement in some way or another
she can't involve any one in this organization they would have entirely completely fucking urged
as a fucking compromised them up throwing them in prison yeah i quickly out alex arch here
peace for t y t last week about how ever on correctly were first southwest key is a nonprofit because it is but i think people don't realize how well paid executives i wrote about how that nine ninety s shows it
those executives are making like hundreds of thousands if not millions off this is what those figures from a few years ago but there's no doubt that these people are rich off this absolutely insane disgusting practice and yeah they should be prosecuted to absolutely
easy to fall into the trap and just being like oh you know trump is doing this obviously if hillary clinton was president ice would still exists in these deportations would be continuing a pace probably not with the same level of iron or outrage that we're seeing now however i think to see that is also kind of an hour
for how uniquely awful and evil are trump and the people who surround him really are again to return to a guy like steve miller like that this is something he's been working his basically since he was twelve years old calling into conservative talk radio to complain about how his classmates
wouldn't stand for the fucking flag or had sex without
his permission or something
look when you think about him and the people in the right wing media and
voters themselves i mean again it's racism motivating them but like i don't know what at base do you think he motivates someone like stephen know to get this far in life being so fucking rotten and evil i do not fucking now it
he has been this way since he was a teenager
mckay coffins had the profile of him and he was tweaking the other day that you know that this fits with he like he's basically just a troll and the he enjoys to see like people are liberals for example having
and connections have a child concentration camps but i don't think that can fully explain it like that's a lot of work just to get people riled up you don't know if he's like a sort of fortune lord
views just the troll you would be like hearing people are being like ah ha going to put your kid into a a tenth person who does but he's actually doing the rolling any more
policy
that's reality it's not just like easing people including kids in concentration camps to and lives is nothing i mean it starts that were taught in your own summer it's before the holocaust this
he talks about how you can't really debate them or are you in points because they don't really care about points they don't really care about are you familiar with make sense
get off on your discomfort of anger and like that
can become an all consuming world view
and i mean
what else are you going to do if you're if you're a person likes the with miller this little carbon call from from santa monica who is just filled with nothing but deep empathy for a majority of your fellow citizens
mean why not just basically commit yourself to becoming a comic book villain
hopes of crossing as much grief to the people you don't like as possible but i mean
it's trolling put but like all like a lot of these people who claim to patrols it's driven by genuine racism
kind of gets delighted when people talk or trolling as if it's value neutral as of just be there's there's such a thing of these guys who don't actually believe that you could spend that much time devoted to that kind of goal without having any real investment in what you're saying i think that that's that's sort of a thing people tell themselves
to not acknowledge the reality of so many of the people that they encounter every day on line and in real life and the fact is is that you know you become a troll because you you want to see people you don't like suffer and the people you don't like ten people who don't look like you and he's getting to do that he is getting the best
the both worlds he gets to troll people in maple loops mad and also maintain
wipes majority in america for a few more decades that might otherwise have been the case
yeah i think that's or i think the fact that he enjoys pissing off liberals doesn't change the fact that he is just a fucking white nationalist is what he is and i think again with trump and this is something i've said before but i think we're really seeing is that people with authoritarian personalities need permission from an authoritarian leader to really let this all out
you know and i think what we're seeing is a greater degree people are being less and less shy about just saying the quiet part loud in terms of you know
running for office as republicans on platforms of explicit white nationalism or just not even denying that they are i don't know a neo confederate or a nazi or someone who genuinely believes that white people are superior to other races and should be treated as such and right
as sad that's the direction at the republican party like it's it's only gonna get worse because it's like an entire generation is fucking state and as out there filled you know all the college republicans are just like this awful combo like stephen mailers and charlie kirk's i mean where we are
i mean i saw in another comment purring and yet another comment about sort of like during the obama administration all of the semi ridiculous paranoia about fema camps and things like that
well like now we see that that's just an obvious projection of what vague
they want to do to people who are not them and they assume that because obama is not like them doesn't look like that that's what he's going to do to them so it's just like prisoners dilemma thing of like who staff and fill the fema camps first because they believe is going to happen or should happen
someone has gotten some of the him locked up and it's not going to be them i think for that is a core belief for a lot of a lot of them up at the grassroots but a lot of the have a lot of this is made worse by the fact that the nature of american two party system and norms of journalism is that you have to keep
treating them republican party like a regular party
you have to treat it as the broad expression of a center right is that
right encompasses everyone from eisenhower to donald trump when i'm with a fast lead
very rapidly turning into a a very sort of celebration is racist party
there's no equipment in the american political system or in journalism to handle that there is no way to talk about a party
like that when it is one of the to you know because you have to sort of keep them in your mind
pounds forces between these two broad coalitions instead of instead of one sort of hyper racist
of apocalyptic death cult completely and they're so vulnerable to a soft bigotry have low expectations there is that tweet by a capitol hill reports saying no small thing orion says he is not comfortable with the constitution can i add that is the smallest possible thing
that is a grain of rice i mean is tiny
i mean again i just feel like
discussing this issue are talking about how how evil and bad it is just seems inadequate and i'm almost embarrassed to be doing it because
like i said this is all going on in broad daylight in front of all literally in front of our eyes and talking about it or just saying that this is evil isn't enough
because it's still going on and you know it can outrage you and you can vote against the republican party or the people that are carrying this out but at the same time i mean these camps are still being billed and built in filled with people and ice is still around and like i said it's going to take something more than that and i think it just a matter of
i feel like a hypocrite
because i'm not putting my life and body on the wind stop this either but i think we off to ask ourselves the question is like you know what are you willing to do or what are you willing to give up in your own life to stop this from going on and until until we each individually can answer that for ourselves
it just i don't know it doesn't seem like it just seems like it's going to get worse and we're just going to be left to comment on how dumb and evil an awful everything is yep i agree they're out there are some get organizations
provide legal services emigrants on the border
this one the refugee and emigrants sense
occasion and legal services
that identity last week
and they do you really get so they're out there are things like that us car still elites that are thousands of miles away from the crisis well i mean i think that that's a very good things that everyone can start to do is find the organizations that are providing aid and support to him
grants and their families and are trying to get into these facilities in any way possible
to find organizations that are doing that work and support them at the very least with money
okay moving on to another issue a local issue
in your neck of the woods libby this tuesday
there is a vote in washington d c for something called initiative seventy seven
can you describe for us what this initiative is and sort of some of the lot the sort of intense lobbying battle that has cropped up over what is otherwise this sort of seemingly minor local issue
yes so initiatives seventy seven would eliminate he tipped minimum wage
mostly as in many states tips work is empty see can be paid and low as three dollars and thirty three cents an hour and the difference can be made up in tips
our law is that if
employers have to make up the difference if they don't receive enough tips to get a minimum wage and so they spell would do with our system and
after an eight year phase in periods and by twenty twenty six day would have to pay tipped employees a regular minimum wage which by then will be fifteen dollars an hour
so that's that's the basic structure of it sounds pretty non controversial you would think except there has been a massive lobbying effort by a mostly by the national restaurant association unknown
as the other and and
and they have started a campaign called save our tips
which is they have their frame this very cleverly and very disingenuous way as
taking you know is something that would take away work is tips
which in principle it there's nothing in the initiative that says that people can't take anymore
this post their idea is that people won't tip if they know their servers are making fifteen bucks an hour which will start of the pruitt certainly wouldn't you know yeah i mean i can imagine a lotta fuckin gino wearing decades in dc saying oh excuse me i know that you make fifteen bucks an hour bitch again the tick i can imagine a lot of people here doing that but
i see you know i really don't think that is i i don't know where they're getting that from i don't know what evidence there i mean is obviously a huge cultural norm in america to fucking tipped so and as proponents of the initiative point out there are many other states that have a sort of won fair wage
alaska montana nevada minnesota california oregon and washington all have the system where there's no separate tips minimum wage and as far as i know people people still to it
who states it's still pretty normal to do so a tipping is so ingrained in me when when
visited holland i went to amsterdam
like all the tips are included in the restaurants there and i still couldn't stop myself from tipping because it felt so rude to just leave without leaving it to brown completely i mean when i go to england people again massive chips that they've never experienced menorah their lives because be blood in the u k to like five percent because with mean
fuckers
no via the american thing to do is for these these horror stories about people that will come in particularly in the sunday after church rush and literally like line up like a series of ones on the edge of the table and the begin to subtract each dollar
for every like not coffee refill not smile or if you're waitress or waiter says no problem instead of you're welcome
that's the whole subtracted everything is taken away but this thing about
this weird imbalance between
wage jobs and tipped jobs because people who were for tips as bartenders are waiters do tend to make more money in terms of like the cash they take home and someone who works for just twelve or fifteen dollars an hour at like a box store or another another a retail job however tipping
having that like so much like your entire income depending on tips
open the door to this whole other world of kind of i don't know harassment and just sort of like this idea of your server being a kind of you know
servant for you that you can reward and punish at a whim and no thing i want to mention
brennan pass this law unto us from a dc fan of the show who's involved with this campaign and he says another huge thing about if the initiative would or pass is that it would also put a huge dent into wage theft by restaurant owners which is a huge issue that especially in packs especially people who are buses
there's food runners and bar backs who are overwhelmingly immigrants and people who speak english as a second language so in this like tipping economy because it is cash and like it's easier for employers to essentially steal money from their employees yeah yeah so the the economic policy and
it has a good guide to the initiative seventy seven stuff and they point out that absolutely this which make it so much harder for you know i mean obviously wage stuff goes on in all industries but it it is rampant in the restaurant industry and they say in investigations of over nine thousand restaurants the us
department of labor found that eighty four percent of investigated restaurants were in violation of wage and our laws including nearly twelve hundred violations of the requirements you bring tipped workers wages up to the minimum wage
and it happens all the time this like study after study how
tipped workers are more prone to this to this way staffed and that is something that would be addressed by this issue and yet there were save our tips campaign has just obviously not addressed and anyway
and framed this i actually have odd here that i took from
founding farmers in dc when i say this
weekend and there's obviously no mention of says this measure would eliminate the tip credit system i mean they don't say anything about what that is i mean that sounds great love to get credit doesn't explain what that is
basically like everything else is about killing jobs over time and forcing restaurants to close which is another thing that the data doesn't necessarily back up at all
libby you see this thing where the the anti seventy seven campaigners with the restaurant industry people they did this thing where they created this kind of pop up restaurant
it was intentionally bad and shitty to give diners and experience of like it was called like restaurant twenty twenty and it was to give customers like a taste of what the dining out experience would be like if this measure passes yeah it was super fucking embarrassing
it's just like a very dc thing
and restaurant already exists in dc it's called boss burger on avenue you
do not
bosco has gone by the way it is clearly or pilot that was they really just reopened under a different name to yeah
so they have this twenty twenty six pop up where they raised the prices of the cocktails and like had fewer servers and stuff
but damn crawford his with the e p i pointed out onto it said that the prices the prices that they listed the coattails out we're not even very much above inflation
like why inflation would do to prizes in two thousand twenty six anyway so they're saying that if initiative seventy seven causes that cocktail prices will be one dollar and ten cents or and servers will make fifteen bucks sounds great i mean honestly yeah i would pay a dollar and ten cents more than my shitty cocktail if it meant that work has got a living wage i mean it was
he should have been a cellphone but the media coverage of this has been really really poor service but if the have a minimum wage like the than their american to be desperate enough to complement my big boy blue than when i go and eat when i'm not going to treat me like the special boy that i am going to just treat me like a regular customer and american and
new big boy moroccan to give me the special treats ray where they're now going i'm going to be tell an old ladies that they look like their daughters are any of that
i don't want to live in that world hey a a cop restaurant where cocktails cost fifteen dollars what is this the new york restaurant experience
yeah i don't have met
what i said earlier that i think i'm
when you hear like
a lot of the push back to this idea of servers making the standard minimum wage rather than a tipped one i think a lot of hostility again this comes from that that suburban authoritarian mindset
you really like the are like being a waiter is an easy job so to be able to feed yourself you're really have to impress me i bust my ass sitting in my air conditioned office of my big jet ski dealership six hours a day
and i come in there i want to see you hustling i want to see smiling i want you to ask about my biceps
i want i want to feel like the king of a particular restaurant because i am because i'm buying a twelve dollars salisbury steak of one of the many correct thing is correct opinions are offered by anthony brewer dane was if you are rude or imperious to wait staff or servers ever
you can be written off from humanity immediately yeah now i agree i mean the correct approach is that unless the way to literally sheets on your plate and they have to get the twenty percent tip
that's just like the normal opinion as far as i'm concerned that yeah there's a lot i like suburb and dad's that seem to think that big a waiter is like a cushy job so the vote for this is on tuesday this upcoming tuesday so if you listen to this episode know that there is still time
time if you're in d c to vote for seventy seven and against the the other and array the national restaurant association and vote for you know the the fair treatment of waiters by their employers and also i mean to save our tips campaign is just
so disgusting like even if you you know i think i think it's understandable people to see the messaging about restaurants having to close or whatever and and honestly a lot of people in the service industry have been lied to by that bosses about this and told that their tips are going to go away so you know i've told people here who are like while
you know everyone out you in the service industry is against this and i understand that but the save about sips campaign is just like is run by some of the worst people the guy running it is this guy nathan sprawl who
works at this link and strategy grew they work for the trunk campaign
they also ran a nonprofit that is my this guy is one of my past enemy is because when i was at the sunlight foundation i wrote about this organization called protect america's consumers which was like running fake ads against the c f p b and they were all very
very nice shiny and glitzy and meant to be
moderate looking but it was clearly fucking funded by the payday loan industry or some nefarious group because it was it was completely dark money and this guy was one of the guys running at so defeat the awful bastard nathan sprout on tuesday also all these fucking celebrity for chefs who are fucking fretting about when it's going to do their fucking business
fucking selling fifty dollar vaporized pig decks under
and they're going to fuck it was i i don't i don't think i could afford to pay my staff a living wage hey hello has and s yeah but no more foam issues get that the shit outta here server real meal with this no more appetizers that's just a single date served on a plate with this will of
oil around it as it's not food do some work yeah and also how about some real fucking coffee okay coffee flavored coffee
and lot of smoke in restaurants again hell yeah i smoke everywhere and me shoot up
my version of this is when they bring you bread and olive oil like a call i want to give me
salty but i don't want that grows will taste like your vegetables us like you have many me but version of business sit up with olive oil with a little of that the vinegar the to degrade port in a sometimes you don't even get that sometimes you get a gross glob of oil
best thing i want i want some nice warm butter when not unlike melted butter but you can easily spread on the bread and a half from the fridge yeah and then i want and they don't want like a little a little tiny little ball of lakes and nice like malden sea salt to just sort of sprinkle over the top my bread and butter
this is a real treat bullshit here
and will would also like the the waiter to be very nice to him
birthday
fucking birthday
to close out this week i have a reading series
absolutely touches on a lot of what we talked about in the first part of the show weird you know
what it's like to live like in a country
it's actually evolved and doing things that like you read about and a history book you would ask yourself how the fuck did like the majority of people just acquiesce to this and let it happen without doing anything to stop it
and moreover what is the media is responsibility and any of this or one of their strategies for dealing with it well one of their strategies is again trying to better understand the people who all think that this is really good and that kids should be put in cages and i have a reading series that comes courtesy of
the new york post's selena zito now if you're not familiar with saline as he though she is a just
fucking one of those had fish at the bottom of the ocean that consume the corpses of wales that drift to the bottom she's like one of those except for the the the trump make america great movement
essentially what she does issue she offers her services to the media and in a book she's just published as a kind of white working class whisperer
to where she always finds people in the heartland of america who are you know overlooked by the democratic party or abandoned by them which you know on one level isn't wrong with these the people she finds it always seemed to utter know be actual employees of luck
or republican parties or see exactly the things that a republican pundit would want them to or are fucking bosses aren't aren't actually working class
small business tyrants and
so this is a selena zito writing in the new york post
this is an opinion piece called these harvard kids got a lesson of their life in the heartland
on a blustery afternoon in april i filed into of in one with ten students from harvard we had just spent the last few days and chicken p massachusetts where we had chatted with the police chief in his force the mayor and his staff small business owners waitresses and firemen about the struggles living in small got their struggles living and
small town america
the under grads were buzzing with their impressions so i said who do you think most people use got to know voted for president none of the students had an answer it hadn't come up in their conversations and they didn't know i had privately ask each person who they voted for so i let a minute and pass and told them nearly every one of them voted for trump
students look stoned at first but then or recognition cross their faces okay
that's the beginning year and my first impression here is
what this piece is doing is actually instead of exploding my prejudice stereotype views it's absolutely reinforcing them that harvard university is a cancer on our society and that everyone a ten tens there and works for it is an even bigger rube than these fucking truck voters that they're reaching
out to for the idea that they would allow someone like selena zito to create this propaganda tour and goal some of their more credulous students into it's ending is absurd to the well what it does is it really shows one of the real cultural benefit for the elite
this post two thousand and sixteen election exotic station exotic cessation whatever a fuck it shut up don't tell me how to pronounce i don't know but exam sizing trump supporters and turning them into this other species
you could say it's condescending or whatever
or but what really is it's giving people who basically are too scared and worried and and cut off from people on in other socio economic areas and certainly and other races
immigrants or black community is or crew poverty in america that's too scary that's a that's a bridge too far for for being a adventurous seeker of other experiences but some a guy who like i said owns a boat dealership but voted for trump you get to treat him as much of an exotic
species as as like a tie immigrant or something like that and you get to then have an interaction that you're more comfortable with because the person shares your basic socio political and racial background
but get to feel like you're a fucking margaret mead or something because actually going outside of your bubble of of whiteness and privileges to too scared yeah it's like it's the guy who owns one hundred and fifty thousand our pick up truck but it's a pickup truck and he listens to like top forty country radio that's working class and you get if they mean by that and you get to feel like wow
oh i'm learning something about other people like know you're not these people are just slightly different versions of you just grew up watching different television shows
all part and parcel of this this scolding this kind of hectoring from people who are bog standard conservative republicans who essentially support every one of the policies of donald trump but nonetheless find him personally this is for our
again there is now my cottage industry of these people to come along and tell you the people who are has a fucking conscience and opposes everything that they stand for that actually it's your opposition to the president and his supporters are you're being mean to them is the reason that they vote for him as if there is someone out there who's just voting for pres
an interim because it makes liberals mad that isn't living in a fucking bubble of their own creation yes
is it like carla comes from the fact that champs election just surprised so many people in the media he could never seen it coming and i think they're a little embarrassed about that and i'm not trying to make up for it but every time one of the story is a show that they still don't get how this happened like how trump on it didn't matter how many
these people that you including into yeah right like when you're interviewing the guy with one hundred thousand dollar pick up truck
a pickup truck and you are displaying your complete lack of understanding of the systems of power in america and this stuff works because as i've mentioned before work some liberals because liberals really love believing that they're better or different than the people that a oppose that like oh i would never i would never unfairly judge someone
or because of their politics or i'm open minded enough to reach out and it's like oh you're doing like tom sawyer fence painting trick
politics and what these people are trying to do with the ceiling he does the world are trying to do to these these bright eyed college students is convinced them that
your political opposition to trump is why trump is president and if you don't want to eat president you should meet us halfway and exceptionally accept all of the conservative policies that we would prefer the country be run on earth and if you oppose that just don't say it too loud
or question the motivations of anyone like for instance thinks that children need to be put in jail
so it goes on here and it says we were only a few days into a new course i did i had developed with harvard's institute of politics again harvard's institute of politics if there's anyone who goes to harvard or is part of that program drop out now if like seriously what you're doing is worthless i don't know how you look at yourself in the mirror
they're literally being conned by this absolute frog
it says here it's called the main street project where students are immersed in small town america even though these kids it almost all been raised in the united states or journey sometimes felt like an anthropology course as though they were seen the rest of the country for the first time in that was their opening lesson i had been a national political
journalists for nearly fifteen years
by the way whenever and wherever i travel in this country i abide by a few simple rules no planes no interstates and no hotels and definitely no chain restaurants the reason is simple planes fly over an interstate swiftly pass by what's really happening
drama the area with if i should do
likes she she only travels he said
the original riedel incredible hulk tv shows you just sort of backpacks through the back roads of america helping people she takes the only true the proletarian form of transportation the hot air balloon so she goes interstate swiftly pass by what's really happening in the suburbs towns in excerpts of this nation state let's go
have and all those areas people are watching television
that's all the fastening fucking not missing some sort of magical community is everybody is sitting at home watching television i'm just really hoping on her travels selena zito on the back roads away from the highways and byways of america she will encounter a working class family either the one
from the texas chainsaw massacre or the hills have eyes yeah the sawyer family has a lot to tell you about the industrialization the broken promises to american workers so she says staying in a hotel doesn't give me the same connection i can get staying in a bed and breakfasts were the first person i meet is a small business person who runs the place
and those all the neighborhood secrets the same is true of going to locally owned restaurants versus chains
anything about this is if you wrote this article from the opposite side like as a liberal us that i don't got a chain right oh i don't eat i would never dream of going to the local apple be i need to find the local like farm to table restaurant and stay at a little bed and breakfast or the old woman who wants to talk your ear off about our entire family and
makes you go to bed at nine o'clock every
every like think i'll fucking stuck up that is what she's talking about like this small town american culture is fucking yeah the restaurant and what people in the mall and the fucking highway and that bland mono culture that permeates all over there
that is what is there it's it's only fucking snooty cosmopolitan types who go out seeking authentic experience elsewhere
surely this is good enough for the rest of if you want authentic authentic small experience you have to go to a fucking city to get that i'm sorry yeah no it's goto buffalo wild wings during a game if you want to see the closest thing these places have been to like a community and i do like she says the first but yeah talking to is a small biz
minnesota which once again just shows her actual interest and who she wants to get her pearls of of simple wisdom from which are the fucking mini mussolini's of america's vast middle not the actual workers so she could by the way most fucking fast food chain restaurants are owned by local people for called the fucking franchise so she goes also
you have to spend your time in a community to really report on it parachuting in for a few hours to interview the locals can lead to float evaluations that's exactly what she's doing with this operation mainstream bullshit she's parachuting in these gullible fucking politics students at harvard and giving them a tour of pre selected small business owners
tell them hey i'm not racist i just think all immigrants should be kicked out of the country and donald trump is a great leader because he kept my taxes and regulations which allow for small community to exist in america
he goes when you are short on time your instincts can get blurred and you gravitate towards the shiny objects the oddball people and conditions that make the most noise consider taking a broader focus on the bigger fuller picture those simple rules or what intrigues students at the harvard instance you to politics again any of these
students just baby brains
absolute baby brain if you were intrigued by any of this nonsense
i am god it's obviously like the student the the young person urge to sort of immerse yourself in a foreign land a strange culture that's very condescending and it's a classic cliche of sort of obnoxious clueless but it seems that it's somehow even worse to try to fit go in
like a jerk off fucking observed in america and talked to a bunch of fucking white middle class people and act like you've actually done that that seems somehow even worse than than doing the real you take your semester abroad in fucking france or spain or italy or something don't go to get the worse suburbs of america
to talk to you literally the worst people are nation can produce some sort of an accolade areas act like you're you're doing something brave you're actually doing something incredibly fucking cowardly because you are too afraid to cross and kind of cultural or economic gap bigger than that bigger than
voting preference literally and zip code it is so beautiful and funny to me to imagine like a bunch of harvard students being shipped and to think like the south and tasting sweet tea and day i wasn't earth is this or like asking a guy about his curly fries or whatever like what exactly are you eating here you know what what
you people eat like it's a very funny image am not afraid to say i'm not afraid to judge other cultures sweetie to fucking sweet
it's disgusting
way too much fucking sugar it's ridiculous shit together as have a doctor pepper is way better
so it says days after my speech to i o p directors said the students wanted to learn more from me i told them the best course would be a total immersion in the less populated parts of the country no different from the way i approach my daily job
your your daily griffith on behalf of the koch brothers who ever underwrites this bullshit chris clang a twenty year old sophomore from winchester massachusetts and sam kessler a junior from blue bell pennsylvania led the charge recruiting eighteen other students for the class which began in february because kwang his chair of the harvard union the nation's oldest collegiate
debating society out there goes the debate team kid it's all falling into place and kessler as president of the harvard political review they were both hungry to learn what shapes people's voting habits particularly the two thousand and sixteen election when donald trump beat hillary clinton in an upset almost no one predicted the best way to blow apart a stereotype is the challenge it
along and applied math and economics major told me so before we started traveling we had several workshops to the discuss their ideas about the other america
it's not the other america is the most mainstream part of american is the most ask kissed it's the most largely economically bless the from what she's talking about the people she's talking about are the people who even in areas that are economically
stressed are the ones who have sort of generational and residual well yeah i know they they actually go to a factory in youngstown ohio or the guy says yeah this communities
been hard hit recently but i just feel really proud of the business i oh god
two weeks later in londonderry new hampshire the students visited a gun range it fish and game club and saw something else they didn't expect forty women of all ages shapes and colors pointing pistols at a target
i'm going to guess here in london very new hampshire there wasn't actually a lot of ethnic diversity at the gun ray and you shut everybody from from irish people to french canadians
even a stray crow at susan also and a silver haired and structure and made her way over to the students with the broad smile and swagger for women knowing how to operate a gun she told them is the most empowering thing we can do again who are these fucking college aged students who were surprised to find out that women there are women gun culture in america
two or that like that going to a gun range would seem like who is so exciting and different i mean these are people who are brought up in fucking koreans i mean that they spent their entire life like incubator to go to these fucking ivy league schools though who the hell knows what they actually think about the world around them
oh here it is in may the students found more insights in the moaning valley of ohio where they broke reddit the iconic in the restaurant with joke sees the third member of his family to own the either
because his enthusiasm can students wrapped his he told them how he developed and grew a business in the downtown area him as a third generation good inherited
inside my mom's room which really helped me with no job of taking over for my dad i could have gone anywhere and i did said disease who worked for several teams in the nfl is and equipment manager but in the end i wanted to come home to this he added as he made a three hundred and sixty sweep of his restaurant this is the greatest city in america the people the heart i love my
community are fat check five pants on fire youngstown is not even in the top one hundred greatest cities in america
amid the air of just going on here later they dined at the fame trumbull country club where the robber barons as yes he is fuzzy on where the robber barons of yesteryear once made their deals today a new generation of leaders is helping to the club
it's footing and a post industrial age
we weren't bring back the gilded age that's that's a real of
my great grandpa used a hug peasants from the bag of a horse the students course is coming to an end and while no one got college credit or and degrade thank god they had all past the most important test they had taken a walk down main street and made a lot more friends than judgments they had learned that in order to understand the country's politics you first have to understand its people
that means getting out of your bubble and spending time away from people like you if you don't kong said you lose the ability to spark the evolution needed to bridge this country's divide again this comes back to something that i just fucking it's like a canker sore that just won't go away and i can't stop pressing my tongue against the what we need to do policy
is feeding the other side not bridging a divide with them now the people who support trump and like him need to be defeated politically don't need to be coddled and cater to people who disagree them don't need to be told that you really need to come to them
and agree with them before you can get what you know it's it's the fundamental delusion of sort of the folk understanding of politics that it's the power of coming together that it's about it's about people putting their differences aside because politics is literally differences so you putting them aside is
that's defeating the point of politics the point is to resolve the differences and you resolve the differences when they are attached to economic economic interests
with fucking numbers by overs steam rolling them that that's it
i just think i'm i don't like the idea of kong and others other future political leaders being inculcated with the idea that they need to understand and come together with small business tyrants the up america's rancid said reactionary middle middle class instead of working to defeat them entirely but they don't want to see
create their well the thing is they don't want the freedom they go to fucking harvard holy father
the people who sell the idea that politics is about bridging gaps in resolving conflict they all have an interest in that because they don't want people to look at politics as a conflict of interests because then people will realize that all they're all basically on the same side they all these fucking these lapping spelunker anthropologists
harvard students have essentially very similar
interests as the people who they're exotic we exploring in america smaller towns but i just like this idea that just going to some american suburb is is getting out of the bubble that is the fucking bubble yes like hasn't been here my whole life if i go to londonderry new hampshire i wouldn't feel our
place for even a second because i guess what i'm white and upper middle class i could go anywhere in this fucking country oh
might not feel comfortable or the poor actual poor neighborhoods in american cities that are these people actually would feel uncomfortable exactly and why do that when you can go and listen to some psychopath talk about how he's you know uses a bebe gun to motivate his workforce
in his
prime rib shop
giuseppe and here it says the students even came up with a better name for the main street project they call it hash tag eye opening
lending their eye opening experiences with the acronym for their institute again
an eye opening experience visiting a fucking and breakfast in youngstown ohio oh yeah i remember that politics is shown spice it was hired and the were actually have kids you want to like his fucking practice sessions or whatever so he got to remember that these people are challenged
hutch closes out here in our final week the class attended mass it state stanislaw us a polish notch my masters with that mass math was that it's a polish church in the strip district of downtown pittsburgh before then only two of my students had stepped foot in a catholic church oh my god imagine
stepping foot in a catholic church measured how weird and alien that would if you if you grew up in fucking american in twenty first century america so it goes at the end of may here's something that absolutely definitely happened by the way at the end of mass an older gentleman came up to me and said how nice it was to see young people dressed up and going to church
yeah he's saying that because no one under the age of sixty has a ten catholic church anymore
yeah it is nice for him get to know that the religion is a member of isn't dying in the first world goes when i told him they were students from harvard he beamed i've been reading for years that college kids these days are thin skinned what's that word snowbirds snowflakes anyway that they have no easy nurse with meeting some
one new are trying something different or won't be open to opposing opinions he said he smiles as he gave my kids in approving thumbs up don't you just love it when a stereotype is blown up right in front of you fucking that confirms every stereotype by already have this article did by the way in closing hear this idea that it's college
kids who have a problem with things that are new more things change in india earth are things that are different from what they're used to this is way to impulse in america in general like this rhetorical idea that you can decide what america is and what he has a monopoly and what america is
the same principle that leads people to say this isn't us when isis deporting people or what
obviously the answer is it clearly fucking is that is exactly what we've done hundreds of years
we had impulse especially liberal and centrist say know wants to say like oh this is what america is it's small towns and small business owners people die in a chair it's just like now i mean show and it's also i hope and denny's and a huge economic always way
yeah sorry i always
with chain restaurant chain restaurant and it's also people who don't businesses
people who washed dishes and everything it's a lot of these things so it's just weird rhetorical on her part to define and by picking these examples what america is because there is other people that she fucking talk to i mean it's just gives a shit like who is listening to this post i mean not to be parochial from my own background and biases be you know it's also america all of our again
fucking the cities where most of the people live where most of the funding
people live seriously
so yeah like yeah the new and different experiences are way more likely to find that in a major metropolitan area than in small town america
but again the idea that visiting american suburbs represents some kind of earth shattering
uncomfortable experience for any of these harvard kids is fucking laugh and anyone who gives credence to it is a pigeon waiting to be plucked so yeah for the saline as he knows of the world i'm sure it's going be plenty it's going to be boom times for them as they continue
you to work this act with a great effect on for like you said mostly liberals and centrists who are buying it
his they rob them blind with the other hand so think that just about does it for this week libby thank you so much for
