subsidized bad food at the rise of fast food courts are you know to be part of it is this is literally true
plates of got bigger sizes and we've made a bigger than they used to be so you need more food to make it look fall that's that's something that simple of low key technological change makes your bray be like i need to eat a third more than i would actually
saran and you get dancer like very simple like visual tricks completely change our be and their hunting that's good and easiest monkeys every meal leave something on the plate
it sure seems wasteful yet people don't want to do that only deck it in in great state and singing small plates so how are you dying virgil i'm not dying

by by heart is beating very quickly and often sweating it and this is if i don't you know

you have to go your letter those things like though which from the old mary melody kind of letters hair pan fuck it like magazines gun magazines that they have a better
i'd say it depends on the day but anywhere from a half a pack to a pack i mean magazine effects your digestion that's true go into effect your are raise well that's all i consider it a net positive though
why is that what they are making he makes his hair leicester some shiny
tick nickname and coat eat staves off all her alzheimer's
they say that is charlie
the thing is it's like everything has i don't believe everything about anything anymore or of that stuff
that's right
even like canada
bad for you or approve of i've got some basics that i stick by you just put like what gives you cancer or work would protection against cancer or what gives you heart disease where protection because after that it's the same thing
or changes while the thing is what americans don't get is that it's moderation
and so what they want is the thing that they're not supposed to eat and the thing that they are supposed to eat they don't have you need like kind of a balanced maybe have a little bit of their sunday and dunno outs know you gotta have one hundred percent tumor a died if you want to live forever yeah well there's the thing about kale people were fine
eller like oh don't eat kale anymore it will kill you and then they looked at like the amount of kale you would have to eat for it to have whatever toxic effect is so high but you know that some american eight that much kale how they held on decision here it feels good for you they're just going to the pizza hut
salad bar garnish well the the poison is in the dumps by oh that's what my therapists have be is that yeah that eighty nineties the top purchaser of kale the united states has pizza hut but they used to garnish noted on our hell and egg now selling anna and a golf ball sized chunk of kale just stay
paypal bet is to the next addition we thought it was praying for you it's like a cabbage whoa what are you all hail as don't go to have kids ever conceived of eat it
it's like what we were talking about though lobsters in the early twentieth century or they were like basically give into prisoner yeah it was considered a cruel to feed somebody lobster or of giant disgusting undersea bug
but they taste good they don't look like they would i couldn't handle looking in know little faces of the crabs we were eating in baltimore i was fine with the crabs i didn't like any other organs yeah there are the parts that are we didn't mean they're monsters are like looking at them i just i feel superior to them
they're just insects to the white sox the alien alien creatures i think that's the way to do it is just just revel in how
zito more fuck they are how of like everything you recognizes like a creature would be you're eating some geiger ask monster
came out of a meteor i mean i signed with an alien earth by crushing you're with us hammer yeah i enjoyed that the whole hand or action all the hair out ride
crabs that felt very atavistic and primitive borderline sexual you know i just realized what makes crowds one of the best foods and especially the blue crabs post of the bodies is that they game of fi dinner
yeah has when you are going through a carcass of one of those crowds of you find another little bugger of meat like you pull leg off and there's a little hidden bit of meat
that's exciting it's like you won the lottery that's okay our when i get are running a lot higher he went lungs or whatever it's like i level down although yeah that's when i was so i see it but that's why when a it makes me it's like hot what score by giving about this particular crab carcass that lady you know what am i going to leave behind versus what are we going to get the right one that lady who
had to teach us how to eat crabs because we're being crowded it should have we should have asked her to sit around the table and score are crab yeah assumption so we are really crab done were thrown out like half the crash and nefarious then we went through the bucket of half eaten crabs and eight the second hand
if you go out to eat demand that your server score you do
that's the law
whatever a passive my plate at the end i'm like can you just give me a little report on other if they say no if they refuse to san at your table and monitor your consumption and watch your coins arbitrarily are asked to see the manager yes in demand to see the man to man that third demoted and when the manager comes say sir i demand points

city where his providence it's resolved called providence
for technical bay by the way of the state providence plantations yeah i think rhode island prerogatives prerogative
i think they change that though they try to it and how have failed because people said it's just a description of the type of land it was it doesn't really what's your to screwed around with carter for ensuring about as well as date providence set the sport has has the longest day
as they said the plantation was racist about i think if they added to it it's also dubbed have a big stupid long as it's pretentious you sound like one of those westminster dog is that like the real day it was like his neighbors body but his real neighbors like cheshire wings of gold

going to show want to show off parable
we are going to do more tours
keep your knickers on everywhere the end we wanna do a year to her oh yes
delicious vanity mostly english speaking at anyway
what of holy shit i had back fast for the first through at that party what is that okay so apparently it's brood by monks it's for loco brood by oh yes amateur talk
got a little crazy why how well yeah it's it's fight use yes how was that i tasted like cough syrup hell yeah oh yeah
that i only had a bit but i was extremely excitable and then we were in my a bunch of girls were in my crawl space a lot of them were from philadelphia
and they were all giving their
philadelphia catholic school who is in trouble right now stories and i'm pretty sure we may a pregnancy pact is a really from liquor it's a really fun is is crazy up with your kid like syrup service grows like you and then you're an adult and you're just like drinking bottle after a bottle of it every single day
well you know we have to go to scotland just to like load up on buck fast yeah
get get the i want to try do i need book fan slighted know i knew that i needed just caffeine and booze it's just a apparently the bottles i like the number one assault weapon in scotland until though it was going to put robots that my call
it's fine
little book fast only outlaws or
so we did we were in dc for two days and then that baltimore for two and i don't remember anything about the vault we their indoors it was nine hundred degrees
we both buckle down what we saw a walk by i remember that we saw a walk walk walk about everyone in the y se yeah we saw so long he was doing the virgin walk he was he was the food waters are literally should be sure if have taken a picture and from the angle or a vehicle we would have backed onto the virgin from the mean exactly
it's the most virgin town in the world
it's the it's the opposite of the district of chance
is absurd and know but we had fun we will be played it like a legendary apparently punk the nine thirty club was plenty of great bands of play bulbs eggs at which point
the sky no one that remember know shuffle bare naked nose
we presumably probably
or later
so so the show great we had fun with folks that are sold out
but yeah though we had more fun day
baltimore to address those after the show us where we are all the crab
absorb all those precious heavy metals your body required
and then went to the aquarium but now my god and the bottom otherwise known as a fish jail the baltimore clarion already soldiers and marines like they understand them because they sell wine at the baltimore where and yes
and we are asking because there's beer in the cafeteria and like can we walk around with a beer and she's like no open containers and it's like what about wine and she said
no open containers so far and is terrible little bottle of wine and what's jellyfish on edibles and it was just really the most pleasant thing so either way i think that
in parts of it huge it's like standing over a tank that's right there and you could just touch it
and i've had some and i mean that's probably why you can bring an open container because people are just one for me you getting getting the sharks drowned yeah which obviously wanted to do yes in addition to a touching tank they should ever drinking during
boeing that to pay a jellyfish and patch or escapes in the rays and that was nice
as pointed out the jellyfish were sending all the kids at the aquarium into a very bad trip now i think it's one of those things where you take a kid that's like too young to see the wall just lake
yeah yeah they were very steadman ask kind of creatures and kids were not prepared for them
they were screaming they were literally screaming to charity and they were franklin harsh in my body gathered
jellyfish don't move in a way that seems natural if your your yeah well and i gotta say the people who organized this exhibit when they weren't trying to guilt us about fucking climate change of guy i now assume that creatures you
they understood that you needed to play like prague rock over the jellyfish and that was being piped in while we were very high and slightly drunk and watching the jellyfish it was the perfect jellyfish watching conditions in even outside the aquarium just what the general harbor zone as you approached you realize that they were kind of piping in
like ambient new new age music yeah what kind of wales sounds as grace eyes or it was great with a natural light on people were there i want to the gift shop to buy a large whale and they
intro to sell me a tote bag which you know i'm obviously a poser all posts the tote bags so i know where all those have a regular plastic bag and she says this is a conservatory
out a report africa toto
you when i'm not going to carry around a way that sir you got own i got owned wow that's a that as a big star us out of guilt that keeps the dolphins and thanked the size of my apartment did it has yet
the fact that they're trying to build a new line of dolphins the thaw is a moral question
elephants
ever really be happy in every way of kept her biggest let down by far dolphins dolphin show we see our dog shit so is also tour as a woman there who just telling us dolphin facts that are not interesting some of the evidence or bad other dolphins yeah this woman has this piece of less little trick fish why
it's like a rubber band or on a string of this united gauge your like you do with your cat to get a bad at all you who are a guy just sat there were too high to actually hear how depressing and actually was so they're trying to teach them to be able to survive in the wild but because they've lived in a tank their whole life they're not used to burn
it's so they would be it dolphins are supposed to look for birds because that's where they're supposed to find food and she says we're trying to get them used to birds because if we sent them out into the wild right now they would just be terrified of birds being overhead so we're trying to you with this fake bird acclimate them for a life in the wild because they've seen nothing but this dank
and their little lot of this bird on a string just smacking it up against the side of the tai shan dolphin looks on inside like could not be was interested in us yeah so there's like a whole group of dolphins in a small table part of dolphins oh poly part of the
though they're not do any tricks for us the woman says that there's you didn't do tricks but also they should at least have a bigger clinton should do tricks for me
the woman says that
these dolphins were born in this tag this is all the know which had my line means they don't know you know that you don't know how good the ocean is because ah yes
basically growing up in a skinner box office although how great is you go outside at oh yeah well being of the ocean until you hit one of the patches that's just dead
or you run into the pacific garbage patch get caught
to tibet
where you just swallow five hundred pounds of garbage so would you go back if you if you saw the daylight if you saw the ocean your other chance would you be horrified by it or is like when old people try to like go back to jail after being released
the outside world
sad perhaps very educational golf but jellyfish very proud don't feel bad about then they don't have brain and do not have brains perhaps is the most another call that we don't allow dolphins we've released into the wild to make the choice to come back yeah there should be just like an open door back to the tail like the tunnel or something and if they come back in order
as always been curious how many would go back and i'll leave i think most would come back but somebody leave
that's just a testament to how awful we made their natural habitat so how will we should give them a dolphin rum spring
feed them lots of myth my favorite animals and turtle
google turtles great turtle didn't get to interact with her has his own agenda
your favorite animal
havana well i don't know if i could says whatever their because i've seen of a bunch of other places it's called the look down i always felt the pipeline fish
looks like so to to poke played smash them together and put crudely eyes on either side
turn it into a fish it has this metallic reflective chanel it's like a child made it and uncanny it looks like it's made a battle and i love the looked out it's called the looked out fisheries it's it's making a circle with its hand
this
elway
pull there was a slot their everyone saw the slop i didn't see it we did see a thought
i know that i set out to slash because there's one near the exit that moved over right after you guys left they were doing the aquarium was doing kind of a rain forest crossover which you know it doesn't sound canonical but i think it was just like to fish from the rain forest or whatever but i think we're just an excuse to get a flop and was actually extremely don't by time we got up to the to the ring
for starters on the very top of the aquarium and by time we got up there was basically night and it was like a lightning storm outside oh yeah his grace rainforest bio dome on the top of a building inside a glass dome with a lightning storm going on outside link enter the rain but we're not getting rained on like being in a rain forest with a wet and looking straight up at a slav hanging from
the ceiling very dope a body a that there's a lot and the best view in the city so lifelike turtle i think represents our show pretty well absolutely and effort it than okay cool very slow animals get that we have the next day
we went to like the plays response to get in the parking lot of a strip club
excellent excellent ten percent
yes it's like if you never heard of baltimore specials
kind of like barbecue but really what it is imagine the army's roast beef sandwich i am a man go on a platonic ideal of how that will be the best possible world and that's what it is it's even harder
beef but it's all tender and succulent and the real horseradish and everything on to sauces
so baltimore was a blast with diet find john waters
try that hard to be fair you did try to read
somebody that's about it i get find him what to oppose grave a total of the socket where we drove past that anyway
oh out a year ago so they really terrifying custom ohio it's very metal holocaust
is it is grim i saw when i was baltimore years ago as one another
why is there a giant burning ball of human corpses that's what the statue is it's again they weren't really a literal with holocaust very literal like what they want looked about consumed with fire i'll just do that
metal as we said at the show you've made us wonder like what did fault and loyalty or are you got a guilty conscience
what you do during world war two specifically
what's also like as we were driving back we went past like dover delaware advertise like the turnoff for the dover nine eleven memorial
why why here i get i to say i everywhere what's that
now i was going to say was near where flight ninety three crash
hathaway now now just everyone wants a piece yeah i he wants a piece of that sweet sweet
what did you do delaware
where for
delaware got the got a phone call
nine eleven and saying old girl aware of has died that day oh my god wow are learning a lot to the real learning about the holocaust baltimore
the state of delaware
while the baltimore was what was that i honestly forgot what we did in dc or we at the numbers bundle
creating all bungled there are meal
via people leaning over one quarter and a second
fucking depression
i guess we interacted with walks and that's about it
some sidewalks heads the laughs it's good were much looking forward to reading to come so we were disappointed
extraordinarily disappointing because we were in dc there was supposed to be a rick and morty things pop up on a bad actually genuinely annoyed with this i was looking for we are ready to go probably both nights
the description us on a great the bartenders are world supposed to be dressed like mr me seeks yes it was called the wobble love a pub excellent excellent just tedious you know they've got a pickle back rick to carry off course they probably got one of those drinks were they used the dry ice to make it
smoke like the ocean oh they're different colors serve some mixed drinks in an urban meyer our flat had sadly oh gosh he would rule but these fucking jerks a turner broadcasting these asshole these corporate bitches these corporate whores who run the rick and morty thing network adults will benefits
say no you have to pay us more than you can afford to to have this episode that you have a shutdown that's ridiculous ridiculous i mean that's all i mean i will say that these people deserve to be ruthlessly punished for being so stupid they didn't think this would happen
but at the same time or it very much of the mac greening school of copyright oil i mean it's it's better to ask for forgiveness than ask for permission but that's what happened they tried it out first the torpedo these were the same people who did the game of thousands yes pop up which was apparently just called game of throne
and this dog shit
that even sir i think that these are you better as they went on because the game of throne as we looked it up because we were really fascinated by the idea when someone told us about this
i guess that's another thing that happened and the drink names are not puns it was just like you here's a drink called the mother of dragons cool yeah my lands was stealing us that apparently people used to dress up and get in line because that is what is cool and dc to go to go to the game of throne is
astra mean go to the fuck in medieval times now you get a real show their you to court or jam in with your hands toast blooming all at the heupel i though you're not around your fellow wonks offer awful now does go to any renaissance fair now
i draw the line to drawing the line i'm excited to dress up and reprise by adventure from last year the up say renaissance fair at the end of this month
it's kind of the speed to maybe you're going to get kicked of a renaissance fair
a thought and i like the most white trash headlines that we're both going to have and i think matt christmas kicked out of renaissance fairs going to be yours and mine is going to and mayan fortunate death at like a water park or something
the thing is matt
the reason you would get kicked out of the renaissance fairs not for being like just to generally disorderly would be like yelling at things that were anna karenina stick i would be chill i don't care you guys want to mix up the genre of the arrows that's fine i don't know i think he would actually be fine with that and he would go the other way and become the antagonists and show up in a
well in and a track suit and what he's wearing now
go but you have to dress up as a star trek guy and a bad year long have you have traveled through time travel to a primitive planet or something
that's very economical for star trek there are a lot of minutes
i felt fun
anyway so i want to do a pop up bar yes i think is i think it's easy oh yeah we just like find a bar that sucks and you just say hey your burst terrible the he goes here let us do with thing for like a few weeks
exactly yeah we throw in some props get some good some themed cocktails yes
did you just like a chocolate bar take over for yeah yeah yes someone let us do that if only there was another local part casting bar shut out to washington
hinterlands maybe whole at a ticket
we would have yeah we have the pond drinks it would be about our interests and drinks at the it would be absolutely horrible no one would agree on a theme by i would be really fun and they'd make a lot of money for that week it be a weird pass each end of the parts would all i don't know they were like baseball crank heads yes
they want work best cricket
speaking the voice of the yes they bust will have drinks like the a hot couch tardy ago
oh
what's another game or fuel game or a few old her home game where we only know that's a that's a seven think it's not too extreme cold fuck you need what does that mean
birdbrain i am put put said mean
fuck you mean it means when when someone says something stupid or that angers a fucking mean was birdbrain or yeah i mean i think that you send selling
i think they just like the silly sound of it
i don't know what to do rage comic theme during that are struggling mean theme drinks from thousand eight hundred years ago give me to do penis please
yes
has been going to go on are trying to think of another of losing it
jumping of like a whole list of of chap references somewhere but i don't want to see what i have a whole list of visual brainstorm was just all the things i could take your job way more seriously than we take our jobs yeah well somebody asked you if you've been to argue maintaining our
thirdly each you have a keen eye and i have never posted to the wiki or the tv two trips but can you post we have a youtube channel right
just making sure he didn't make can you post that video i took of man who watching yeah he's my eighty cedric i take a lot of it
but one of him leaning and staring glassy eyed at the jellyfish with the program playing in the back
send it to me and i'll post of jelly compilation of met the we have a stab chat
the snatch i do we have a finster do we have a private lose account
though we don't know what are we going to get on social media want to at through do a music was shattered weight room
pretty sure the pressure current affairs has loads private i'll snap give me give me a high life into the traitor go on
it's begun
yeah i think of a control thing and what drinks are called i'm tired there's a rum and coke that's why
stormy oh we did all the ones in a in a book really is a big reality let's just let's just do that they will go to let's make get the resistance the bar oh yes because we add add ons would actually be so we do an ironic resistance the barn door so right we joined the senate
we contact like all the weird drifter guys like thunder and the crash and steam and we say this is a serious power we love for you to be a vip show up and bring your the crash at the snow
he started of ale crescent saturday or reading and are probably listened to this right now so yes you ask them they would come you're okay
hey fellows
we need you to come in command your followers that come to this resistance bar
all the money all the profits will go to to i don't know joe biden exploratory committee the fuck are these people getting their money to a children's book that as donald trump being gay
the yeah
hot meal or
gym membership or robert mueller are they doing like billboards with a hammer and sickle and twelve
yes yes yes yes know they're all over the place now
g o p but the o is the soviets star gotta have read there's probably been you know i'm just thinking of these like viral resistance people and the various things they've raised money for it's it's heavily in the millions for just cockamamie ski oh god yeah absolute gibberish the total economy of
the hash tag resistance probably won't remember what made you kicked in half a billion dollars for michael codes the feds fun oh just gave lanny davis half a billion dollars that's where nothing too awfully i rather think back because that was going to tell the truth or something i get it would they give money to like the or something i mean that's also
stupid but it's like okay you like the guy you gave half a million the michael cohen like the imagination that there's like a one of those paper thermostats in an office somewhere for a fundraiser and if you just get it filled up all the way with red marker the dropped just resign is truth he just boop those folks they hit the top of the thermostat okay i have to
decide what they do oh yeah they they a bunch of money to protest in front of the white house yes oh my god pachinko machine
another six figure sub just that people standing in front of the white house with christmas lights wasn't the idea what that when that if you couldn't be there in person you could give him money yes exactly
you'd like by a virtual spot at the rally i love the idea of getting into the age of virtual protests were it's just like in some virtual space there is like a place where avatars like sims or mingling in front of some place and you can just buy assumed mit mingled there and then your protest oh okay speaking you agree
chefs have you heard of this app i can't remember the name of it but the gist is you can pay celebrities to yeah personal i read an article about that that is fucking grew yes okay this
celebrities like very hard that he lists
and then it's cool yes yeah fair deal as an ongoing
i feel like a member of the vander pump rules to say hamper your great in a little bit that's amazing yeah well i know we're very good for secret say you're getting that here
yeah it's called cameo cameo right right right and who's on cameo
there's over fourteen hundred athletes musicians social media influence and there aren't that many more i know i'm going to log on to the lottery
now are
dennis rodman yeah yes yeah i'm going to the allen's thing hundred two hundred and is now it's a thousand dollars for a video at those rodman wow
come on there was another article that have more more of the people are call amanda hess route a large profile of this for the times yeah okay yeah you're right thank you your father a fuck or do i buy the cameo
our around here
so yeah vicki polanski nicky bars in gary busey is arraignment
clear that he's on here
how much hercules that he was the had quiz daddy
how much is it cause
that's what's so amazing put it on on a price tag on your worth is a celebrity because it's all the they named their own prices so for example mischa barton seventy five dollars for a video that feels low all if a were oh it's three hundred and fifty lance bass one hundred twenty five those juicy manicure
maples barlow people who who are the real housewives nikki plan ski perez hilton yeah we are not see prices on your did a low hand classic the prices god it oh the guy from john and eight plus eight or china kate plus eight john yeah
america black from the friday like
thirty bucks thirty bucks
to get a video for the rebecca black all got let's do it right now yeah can we get her to say rebecca black's say your was in a trap ask it by the end of this recording yeah yeah put it in by one police what rebecca black
i don't we make them see demeaning things now
what those explicit i mean to be fair promoting i shall is probably did mean that's what i know
i listen to chapel trap house all the time it's what i get my information it's where i get my news in hot takes on culture and out okay i get will buy the rebecca black they but here's my idea we should all go on it should all made a cameo luck out and sell ourselves
people would definitely buy buy shit for the and i'm curious with the top earner would be like
i think it's feel sadly he's got them his followers yeah oh well he would be the camp boy supreme court because he posts a lot of videos to yeah though they love the wrist straps throat parallel wouldn't say unparalleled
he has a lot of action for those terrorists dogs
what do we set our own prices i'm going to set mine for one thousand you can have the guy the real life that wolf of wall street guy toward bell for he does it for a thousand nobody has paid we now now i'm working yeah he's basically just way because it doesn't cost them anything not to do it so he's just waiting for the day would
one rich asshole as a joke decides to do it that it's been worth the whole time i thought it was marketed as and economies that the more into manual are the more in or they set their oil prices on that sucks
are you are you're like that so no signs of numerical value two year olds of fame now i'll also mine for for fifty thousand and just rely on ads are trying to buy one
that's it and i leave i made by a vague for the
if like those
it's like the casinos
those higher boutiques the or something
there's like there's three people standing there there's no whatever their but if one person goes and buys one handbag they've made their bob
yeah but i feel like now and there's just no way that it would end wow like if i did it even if i said it it fifty thousand there would be a bunch of down fans that would pull their money to get me to say the anyway

i will say one of my favorite moments of the first lady of tour has been being up
with virtual watching gran torino okay yeah which is a truly ridiculous
movie
which deserves a re watch as well
seems like a text point zero we are going it wasn't made eighty years ago or literally this year will let me set the scene
usually this we watched a few million usually at this hour christened up man is asleep on the couch storing loudly he's how out amber is gonna bad and felix's in the other room playing fortnight and screaming at it so every lie for by on our is punctuated with him yelling at i presume that an eight year old yes
yeah
no lag in this fucking house i hope we have fucking better ping in the next one
needs to get over the lag issue
either
all ages now over no lag he needs the lag as an excuse for losing
that's what i'm saying
get over it just accept losing as part of life but my favorite part of the grand jury and was the a dent in the next day when we were in one of our various discussions about how the world of spiral spiraling into chaos and i think matt brought up that you might consider branding is a gun guy virgil you're like oh yeah i think i might do that too and everyone's like what the gun would you ever yeah immediately
hi tech nine yeah like the heroes at gran torino ones who who killed that awful raises committing a crime
around the neighborhood
got pretty that please
i just think i think you with a tech nine is a very funny image to me so all like this will be comes at a certain point where one he can't see the n word in it so we just uses a weird or racial slurs time a menagerie of yeah they really avoided the beach obvious have a source ground into the oh
only possible slurs for asian people that you can put into the movie and a lot of his hand waving a gun at minorities are pointing the finger at them and threatening them and i just kept thinking this movie comes out came out it was like two thousand and two dozen yeah yeah
did that movie today he would just be straight murdering them over and over again and the audience would would it would be primed to think oh he was justified each style yeah it's a dumb away from be know
mazda death wish now but i don't think so biggest thing about how poorly death wish holds up and saw death wish oh you showed it's insane in the same got deal yeah so like it's it's not the m
i mean for greens jury now it's been a while but i remember the moral kind of being minorities and are dangerous but some of them are women and some and some of them will help you
woke some ammo help you fix your roof and games as well as some of them will help you spite your children yes that you hate for no reason
some of them will prove the pussy priests in your district wrong yeah i did like the producers is totally useless priest who was an asshole
gran torino yeah it's so strange
oh yeah
here's your was a or when he takes the cake around
to meet other white other racist white people and they're just calling each other racial slurs all the time
like being reminded me of that white like me s and l skip where where eddie murphy's us old white people give each other things you do that just oh white people are just racist when they're with other white people and and you see him
like an irish guy says are you do and dumb domestic
it's fine you drunk bullock and it's and message is clear that no no racial slurs and find is because there was once for white people to it's a very big fan i brought this up in the car of the movie i always turn to is too long for thanks thinks everything julie new modern which is an amazing movie which could never be made to
day and it's just about three drag queens
who may or may not fall under the rubric of trans gender by today's standards but they are recognizes drag queens with the movies just being racists to each other and they're super friends forever it's an amazing you like
more or pet names
yeah i just think that there's a way to be affectionate and mean to someone and in fact i don't really know of any other way to be affectionate semblance so i'm sickened by well i mean that's our short work so you were when we talk about donald trump or hillary clinton were being affectionate but mean for friend sarah guys and we support and love
the mean we are the more affection
say about gran torino it's amazing that clint eastwood previous movies two years earlier where the flags of our fathers and letters from iwo jima which were praised oscar worthy and for like humanizing this conflict in world war two is ground zero of american resort resentment for for the japanese
praise for humanizing both sides and seeing how war changes and affects people and cleese would walks away from that use like yes now i've got my blank check to do my asian racism movie we need to convince clint eastwood to make another grant arena to return to redo gran torino and i just to see what his vision is now a younger
oh yes as i swear to god it's going to be walter a waltz stand in just murdering athletes who neil for the flag just fifteen minutes of that i think that's definitely the trajectory were what i really want to see and report back on the jennifer garner move me where she fights and s team
as a vigilante because they killed her family peppermint yeah what the most bullshit
so basically she's one of those angel families the trouble talks about who asked people to to illegally
yes yeah they called the age let the money they're trying to invent a new thing for gold star
other thing for illegal killed your
it's fucked up it's crazy propaganda yeah i no and like incredibly annoying and there is i think we should say if one of those a little mothers decided to get even yeah take the or he's going to grow out her mom just going to work couch can do pull ups yeah it's going to be like terminator two which she's immature
the insane asylum do pull ups on the she will get yes she apparently like lives in the streets and they're like like she's she's supposed to be batman basically and they're like why do you think there's no crime in this terrible neighborhood full of you know and it's because she
rome's the streets or whatever it has the local shortened name other put down her
although as a local shirt name of it
picked up in a are there or whether we are this we have this revelation to watch granted gran torino that one of the pre figure asians have drop was thousand and twelve are and see where charlton heston are natural
fuck
were actual has had died right then or something right
yeah he was as soon as he as beautiful as come see us he hit glorious would want answers were busy
talk to an empty chair that was supposed to have obama in it and he just sort of lauer said painful at school why a screwed up so bad why are we still in afghanistan
turk the audience's hoot and holler and all the people of the media including myself
but they oughta be the math it added they said this is a big disaster for the american political discourse know i mean it is embarrassing because where his grandchildren to be like you know he's a little confused right now
yeah know it was brutally awful that they did the other thing is is that we all thought it was embarrassing
it didn't help i assure you know it's something that her he lost but it didn't help either the do anything but we all thought it was just as a barrister anomaly and now our politics have been totally absorbed into oh yeah yeah know if you've done that for years on it
just clinics who would just run for president and yeah go to every event with an empty chair as you this part of the news cycle when it happened now no one would notice oh cardboard would notice now we're all here in the chair
you don't like a cheesy thing like that when when pat buchanan was running for president he would
he would dress up like america's daddy were like a sweater and there's a are seeing a press conference he did where there's like a set of of a small american a home like a like a dining room with doilies and tea cups and crap like that and you just sitting there avuncular and that was i don't know i guess that's for already one who senile
oil and thinks oh he's going to bring back that that nice room we were all in and the johns john birch mr were basically yes yeah that's exactly it

hermes how much peripherals matter because i was on my desktop murdered so many children now is definitely playing adults definitely do they had some point going to get old
yeah everything does everything in your life gets old after a long time or twenty four months and then it loses its sense of novelty and the you spend too much time with yourself and then you you find the next thing in your life is just your like spiderman you're going for building the building but you're going from thing to thing looking for a nuisance and novelty and you do that
you know by my math about thirty more time for a guy and then that's your life and it's okay
he needed to get away from yourself you will gladly escaped yourself the whole time where i'd ever caught up with yeah right
you could stay in one thing and keep convincing yourself that it's good it's the other way to live your life and you only have to do one of those really to do that for like sixty years but if you're good at that one too
there are two ways to play life there's my way and the other way or you can become religious but i haven't really figured out the math for that one i play donor county the other days for order and made that labour little some fucking
