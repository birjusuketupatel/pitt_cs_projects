yeah i know i hope she can assist this year
as met said once and for all finally washing our hands of this incredibly tedious i'm going to do it again i clean air clean my room
i cleaned virgil texas has room lawyer before we get into injured peter said i do have the fact that you may or may not know she you had a sort of a disaster befall you recently my house burned down here i bought a house burned down i mean i don't know of jordan peterson was involved but the house did know
you in felix are actually a member of the arson community arson
i didn't see the last meeting
kind of have my own or
this is only cow innocent boy
your house burned down when you are quite young yeah and that's why you are the way you her so yeah if you're considering yelling at me for anything
my house burned down when i was for no one got hurt except for my sense of safety
anytime you're like you know you have a policy
politics pod guess you should follow the news no i don't have have is david flares up sometimes and it causes me to not read or catch up with anything only play fortnight and watch every day stored on complex now know anything that's going on in the world not really care still still say a lot of slurs but that's because one crucial now
honestly in nineteen ninety four was interrupted for me it's so now you know the rest of the stories huge you're welcome to the community
you will also be displaying the symptoms soon so long he the already starting will ya he is coming out with little boat to what do you think i can't wait right
but i'll take into this way you are you've been made homeless by fire mankind's oldest at me i was homeless yeah i was wandering i was lost
in a heartless world and then one generous man to me in that was virgil taxes you're walking the streets of philadelphia he didn't actually take me and he's not there
before he said he left he said well i already have you will meet him there he was bragging about his incredible act of altruism that he was let you stay with in his house after he left it
and it's like the house that are you just want to say that we're going to get to one of the one of the rules is that you've got to clean your room and virgil texas is someone who does not follow this rule i'll tell you when i arrived the the weirdest thing is that he loves to drink these like bottles of electro light infused water oh yeah well my athletes but like he only drinks like
two thirds of the bottle and then he'll seal it back up the ass leave it like around the house and finding like like dozens and
and then it was also finding like these little like things that look like some kind of electronic device that had like human bodily fluids in it was a mechanic and to replicate it turns out is just his pen cartridges which is scattered around every corner of the water
i think is so true every time he comes with a gigantic bottle of water will take like a couple of sips other
cold society and hard for a forget about it leave it there but he these it there because he wants to have a bottle of water close at hand matter where he is any moment but he likes that old or water tastes odds finally i need water and got a brand
that's a real kind of us trove profiles for life i'd let it mellow
not get me smart smart water again i think the molecules are sharper than the other of war
he's still doing nothing else with this essential to massively own out the subject of his fake knowledge of water
we have laboratory test results indicating that he does not know the difference between these their water again
unless they say your your your house sitting for virgil he's letting you do this set of the kindness of what about taking this
it's ever been right now and i still have having you get the bail one less than one last detail i would love for you to share with our listeners what was on virtual to bed when you first arrived okay on his bed was some kind of creature that when i picked it up
it came alive
and started singing and
they had a friend too
i don't know what they support that's hurdles part of the unknown
was an angry bird yeah
all other animal is some overlap so
i wish i did the fucking it oh that's what it is the one of the fucking so characters i've over watch as a bird sidekick but the what the talks is a poor he enters the picture as a as he was leaving and he literally he like tuck the evidence of day
yes
he didn't put sheets on the top
oh they both have for
exactly
so you're making yourself at home you're you're in the park palace
again they fixed it makes the virgil in welcome degree and it stinks of versa for his charity
he said he went ahead to allay were meeting in there but he wanted to spend some time with his mother a lexus

okay
most get down to business here let's get down to the twelve rules for life
if you listen to the show we've talked about your and peterson for i'm sure you're familiar with him i don't think he needs much introduction can i just said there was an article in l a times recently about him that talked about him as being
he is the dark professor yeah but he has been referred to as a member of this article called the intellectual dark web yes either
this is like i think it's dave rubin his self christening him sam harris jordan peterson empire no fucking
i don't always go and snow on yet going dockers alpha yeah i'm already wide guard
absolutely our really is dark
hate it when the flag from always sunny in philadelphia
i don't know if these guys know that the dark web is where like you download child porn and higher hit men and like identifying there like an electrical movement with i'm glad you brought that up the intellectual dark web
mullen you are all these guys but like peter sit in particular i think is the perfect avatar of this because it's like yeah who is he
dark and dangerous like these these these controversial ideas she's putting out there all like he's just too dark and intelligent the fundamental facts about him overall but all of these guys is how own barely tedious and vacuous their actual thoughts and writing are okay let me far from being a danger
just so dangerous if you're trying to fucking stay awake or makes sense of end of it i did i did read the book and let me tell you is basically a combination of like the secret and the bell curve
if you if you're in a market for some self help bullshit with all the kind of narcissism and navel gazing and mysticism that implies but there wasn't enough social darwinism and for this is the book for you don't respect yourself have contempt for others
our devotion and makes that's that's what i believe in
just start things off like might the main thing i was curious about this book
it's a tome it's a door stop this thing and it's it's a genuine and you know hit in the published now is one on amazon for a while
reviews were raves i think it's a are five star rated boat except i wrote a review that was one star that i asked people like if the if they found it helpful to up vote it and for like a couple of hours it was the second most helpful review on their said my man has literally no idea what
he's talking about where you work in from purchaser you are going to learn her to read the book and the jordan peers and fans mountain a campaign to get it taken down yeah i can hear what happened in the marketplace of ideas
know i mean of course he is like all these people embrace that taken up the mantle of free speech in the open exchange of ideas and civil society but i'm both him and his fans are just about the most thin skinned darts and reactionary imaginable
who again like if you make fun of peterson or even just discuss him in any way that short of absolute reverence will throw a fit and again just take you on the road to peasantry the speech thing is something they really outrageously pedantic about because like he he's famous because
he said he wouldn't call trans students by their preferred pronouns
and like every time he is pressed on that he says i didn't say that i said i wouldn't call them by any pronouns are dictated by law
so what the fuck are you going to call them like i mean he's totally willing to obfuscate what he's actually going to say in service of some labs traction well that's a very good as any this is sort of like his ruse and i think it speaks to our to his popularity in like for instance
in all these interview clips of his that have gone viral sure you've seen them he genuinely does get the better of the people who were interviewing him most of the time because they're largely unprepared and they have they do the standards of liberal thing where they're like you're really believe this to you and we've talked about this before and then he does that thing where he just speaks really belligerent the in quickly
and it just sort of like plows right over them however unlike words about statistics that like most people don't know however what what he does is there was a famous one the one that a lot of people shared it's like vice was interviewing him and he was talking about like sexual harassment in the workplace and he was making the point that
lipstick when a woman whereas lipstick the point of lipstick and make up in general in women to sort of britain reading the cheeks and lips is
to convey sexual arousal it's like they likely to convey to exaggerated sexual response so he sang like when women put on makeup and dress up to go to work they are signalling their sexuality in a way so we shouldn't we shouldn't lie to ourselves about what's going on there and then like the interviewer like will just try to pay like was so what does that
why and he's like or i'm not implying anything i'm just really acknowledging that but it just like he's setting up these sort of like thought experiments and statements that would seem to imply that are women are asking to be have their asses pinch just because they wear makeup to work but one could just as easily say like when a man wears a suit like a blazer taylor jack
it is supposed to make your shoulders look wider and give your upper body is certainly a sense of symmetry and proportion which is also sexual signaling i wasn't gonna say anything will your outfit proves a jessica focus on mood
it's a new one with us track pants your and even look at the out one
that it goes in the jungle
separate what does the man and were when he parked here as he puts on a pair of sweat parents were you see exactly how he's been circumcised
this kind of guess it is appeal though is because he's talking about these taboo subjects like and it's exciting for some of his fans that like he's talking about the sexuality that slate lying behind seemingly normal situation
and they get excited about that
just accept whatever like money will get on a in a very vague general sense of course that's true but it's just like what is he implying here and the thing is i don't think he really knows what he's trying to imply i think his fans like pick up on these little cues that resonate with them because it's like exciting and controversial but i think he very strong
honestly tries to avoid the implications of any of this because like i said i think he's just incredibly tedious it's just like when you're when you're a kid and like you have a substitute teacher who like uses mild swear words you like wow that's cool he said oh you like that's basically how these guys are responding to him as his kind of like paternal authority
your who was a little on the edge well for like a lot of reactionaries and both good few years i'd say you can really rip shut up and my dad in audience and by pointing out how shitty the modern world is sparking terrible like most people who listen to you aren't happy either completely unfulfilled by their existence
they have no fulfilling relationships in their life but for most of them life for a lot of the all right guys it's like those stirring the morning
it isn't mark zuckerberg stock doesn't this is in vogue and stupid that
the only avenue of politics is like that sort of cultural consumption which marvel movie season this fucking stupid and tawdry don't you hate your life and they sort of like lose people because every time they all meet up they look stupid and kill somebody or you talk to them long enough there like and the thing that we do about it is we blow up a home depot parking lot
with the peterson it's that he just goes and sam harris
through bo sake bullshit
that it's not that his fans really super interested in what he has to say after he points out how shitty modern life is it's just that you know it sounds like something that smart and they're mostly hooked by like yeah my life is shitty i think with with hooks and also it's one step one is you identify discontent and that is where of
he's small less successful reactionary quote unquote thinkers stall out as because they really only have a spurious diagnosis he has an action item and it is just self help it's just it's just take control your life but because the life of a sort of under employed
aid relatively economically stable middle class young person is one with basically no supervision no structure and that allows you to basically do a thing like game until you let yourself because no one will stop you from doing that in except for yourself and he is acknowledging that and saying you have to be the one that
truly intervene in your own life and that is that's incredibly powerful either because people literally don't get parenthood any more like parents don't talk to keep their children about about these kind of things or people grow up so wedded to the the rhetoric and communication south of the internet that nothing is real and
they see it online so their their parents can tell them locally in the room all week and it's just going to go over their head but when the youtube and friends tell them to clean the room it actually resonates i'm not sure which it is i'm not one of these guys there was that the most famous interview he did was the one on the bbc with cathy newman and there was that part
i think she said something about are like well you know most fortune five hundred c e o's are men it's very exclusionary there are a lot of women on there and he said something like well yeah most men aren't fortune five hundred c e o's either and like that's true and if you're not going to be able to like offer a critique of a structure that has it
extremely wealthy people an extremely you know disadvantaged people you're going to get caught in places like that yeah well that's like whoa
you know like he's a reasonable one that's why he's not going to go away is because the other so i gather to mainly dominant culture of horses like the reactionary one in liberal and liberal one can't point to the world the culture it's created you go
actually you love it it's great
america has already made jordan beaters it's going to be around like forever until i don't know he starts a colder he he finally does like he intersects a mass suicide with haley's comet at the right time i don't know but yeah he's not going away because they have no answer to him because he offers a structural critique and it's
wrong and but it is and it's jubilation it's hard but it is one that seeks to offer an explanation and an all cultural come conversation on the the main stream is not comprehensive it's just individual think pieces an individual reactions to specific discreet events and
all coming from this sort of vague cultural liberalism
and which really just it has nothing to offer other than the status quo is basically good we could use more diversity but nothing that actually speaks to anyone's real discontent on any level other than like not seeing enough representation and order some ethical peterson does is like you said
and because like
he hooks the marks as we've described earlier but i think what he offers is this kind of union psycho and analytical thing trick where it's just like you can with this knowledge that i'm going to impart to you you can recreate yourself is sort of a character in your own heroic narrative
that connects with these subconscious ancient sort of almost biological truths about humanity and this is where it gets into the reactionary part is because all these truths that peterson thinks is unchanging absolutely true and any attempt to alter or
go outside of them will lead to disaster are all things like you know just hierarchy is natural rather than traditional family is natural and like these are like we need to hew to these things that are all true because they've been true throughout all of human civilization this is something that actually like he viewed with sam harris about because
same us fans all like requested that he get jordan peterson on his pod gas you know like when my two dads to talk about his allah forbid dad might transfer dead and so he went on and he just said a bunch of gibberish about archetypes and the collective unconscious and sam harris was like what the fuck are you talking about
that doesn't make any sense and everyone was this point in the email exchange where peterson was like talking about slaying dragons and shit yeah he really loves the he loves the slain the dragon well that's the thing is it and i even eyes like the paris fans like you peterson how many i want to know what percentage of these peterson fans are guys who until peterson
showed up would have consider themselves
guys like were loved logic and reason and thought those were the ways that you figure out the world and then this guy shows up with the dragons and the fucking subconscious and this you miss others have either like fuck me up buddy
what it shows is that what they really though they don't really care about logic or reason they're just a totem because they want to justify traditional hierarchies because they think they belong on the top of them they think they aren't on the top because evil cultural marxists of interceded with with the truth change
the culture undermine the rightful place and they want to get back on the rightful place the same way that like the shah's regime before the french revolution was with had a natural order they feel the same way but the the enlightenment came along cut all those heads off and we don't think in terms of divine raw anymore so we need something to replace the
divine right with and can only be in a modern context so it's gotta be reason and logic but if another guy comes along and he has the same hierarchy to defend and but he does a more a more sparkling job of it and he's talking about dragons and archetypes i'll take that whatever it is whatever can justify the higher
turkey is what matters
you know who else had a natural order lobsters
okay
oh i get into this now because like the book is called twelve rules for life and ever since it came out it's like all i want to know what are the twelve rules
actually found someone who just has done all twelve i forgot all them okay i'm hoping your life was fuck fucked up since you've really have a burning down your house would still be on our the
never got her one never finish a bottle of water
if you have water out of your home if there's a fire you could pull it out quick this is this is a real quote from peterson's first book of maps of meaning chaos my favorite halo
another voice were chaos is what extent eternally in without limit beyond the boundaries of all states all ideas and all disciplines it's the forerunner the stranger the member of another girl for russell in the bushes the hidden anger of your mother
okay
order cause chaos is symbolic the associated with the feminine order by contrast is explored territory that's the hundreds of millions of years or hierarchy of place position and authority that's the structure of society and this again all this dragon well so i'm just going to say here chaos is the fire that
birds don't choose house
her is the pork converge and the water
listen here's the way he puts that in the new book which which is full of like that that type of stuff about you know the the balance of order and chaos in the world
he says order and chaos are the yang and of the famous dallas symbol to serpents head to tail
order is the white masculine serpent chaos it's black feminine counterpart
now what
what
i don't i don't think you gotta be a friday to white masculine serpent and draw some kind of conclusion
most logical unreasonable i don't know write about this logic the reason by the way check out my new website why did
collaboration not jordan years and
real logical men look at black wednesday jazz
the this look at the fucking diagrams or in his first book it's like literally henry the fuck yeah henry
henry darn sure this is like the diary of a madman
it's like you're just like linking all these things this circle represents the kingdom of order this circle represents the dragon of chaos between it is masculine and female truth belief energies
that's
i don't fucking love logic and reason is that these are the like but these are like those hotel means where it's like sex sex spirituality energy and
like you people fucking but they're writing books and other claims that he is defending the enlightenment tradition with this shit he keeps saying that the cultural marxists are undermining the enlightenment and this is what this is what he is calling the enlightenment is this insane gibberish from his ed about
about the chaotic female i don't know if he does a good argument a he has no idea what these philosophical schools and he's constantly referring to you actually are who was part of them what they what they represent of the enlightenment ways i've never studied modern european history you only watch youtube the enlightenment
a time when all of the guise of europe are old friends george washington
francis epic bacon all them got together and they said why don't we have in a exchange of free speech and logic called you to which has been around for three hundred years well what it was what the enlightenment was worth people using logic and reason and an observable reality to challenge an unjust hierarchy
the society of order and saying that this does this shouldn't exist and been answered by know it's always been and god has ordained it and now this guy under the guise of that enlightenment because it is such a penetrating and powerful idea that has persisted in the west for the since its inception he's going to use that term to
defend that same fucking hierarchy is just replaced hobbes is divine constituency to god king with a surfeit sucking its own dick
i just for our own
this part sheriff to nathan robinson who did a great take down peterson recently and this week and current affairs this is amazing though in in pearson's first book he includes an epic graph that is a letter to his father and a risk going to read this year
i don't know dad but i think i have discovered something that no one else has any idea about it i'm not sure i can do it justice it's scope is so broad okay you know how often you jerk off with your right here and what if you put it
brown
sap i sat on my end and it was like i didn't know it it was like he was a stranger
it was chaos
because it's scope is so broad that i can see only parts of it clearly at one time and it is an exceedingly difficult to sit down comprehensively in writing
anyways i'm glad you and mom are doing well thank you for doing my income tax return
cut taxes are easy you professor bitch
i didn't used to give a shit about this guy now i'm now going to the rules for you you have to keep you don't do online baking it's easier than any time in human history to keep track of your expenses poco feelings
i was ever i would i read his letter to his dad like a struck me as sort of like a miniaturized version of the eight thousand pages now scarred novel or it's just a letter to my father such a poor man's now sky
it's gerd know is gerd his book about cleaning his room that's just one book in a fifty fifty volume entry about his first twelve years on that letter honestly sounded like an excerpt from confederacy of dance
riley shit i'm on the edge of something mother and father have on the edge of something i can't even comprehend it
i keep talking about the roles i want to still a do i want to go through these that
euro okay these are these are these are german peterson's twelve new rules to fight the chaos fight fight the cast which he has said his female he is telling his legion of it so dark fans that women are terrifying other the must be tamed
that's a good reason home boy it's not a fucking graph that he made with human shit on the side of a wall you can tell from lipstick
so i you need to put your finger on of the g spot play the legacy
in chaos a triple digit order then you say that that like he's he's representing the feminine represents like the dark bottomless abyss of chaos and men represent the light and reason and order and you would say well that's a fairly misogynist like pseudo philosophical drivel and then i think he would say he would point out that know
you misunderstand me i'm saying we need order
the valley the thoughts about the synthesis of either
these that say synthesize the cow fight the cat sometimes the hardest fight that fucking marcus lapan guy he know how to fight the chaos i keep delaying this here the twelve rules rule number one stand up straight with your shoulders back okay choose you could you can you do you remember this and can you explain this one okay for one thing
the role model he wants you to emulate when you stand up straight with your shoulders back is literally lobsters yeah
this is the famous his famous that they don't have they don't all paul bunyan or don't
but they don't stand out your though you're being pedantic they don't have any would man and i actually book marked a
an excerpt and my dog eared copy of the book here
where he talks about the lobsters and i can just read to you what he said yes please share okay lobsters have more in common with you than you might think particularly when you are feeling crabby ha ha
now though
hi matt
the light and of all love
lobsters live on the ocean floor so england you they need a home base down there arrange within which they hung for pray and scavenge around for straight edible bits and pieces and whatever rains down from the continual chaos of carnage and death far above hurdles apartment ago
if they want they want someone to secure where the hunting and gathering is good they want to home so this this this is the basement when iran was fucking be heard
to play video games and the carnage of mom and dad upstairs stuff order and chaos and biting into hey when ordering last fight each other
what we going on and spend weekends with order
i'm a genius because you know what they call lobster cages
bedrooms
why do they will listen this can present a problem since there are many lobsters what if two of them occupy the same territory at the bottom of the ocean at the same time and both want to live there what if there are hundreds of lobsters all trying to make a living and raise a family live in the snow on crowded path
spite of
cartoons
sponge bob bob goes to work every day
in clocks out other creatures have this problem too when songbirds come north in the spring for example they engage in ferocious territorial disputes the songs they sing so peaceful and beautiful the human ears are siren calls and cries of domination a brilliantly music i burn is a small warrior proclaiming his
sovereignty i'm so sick of these birds that only thing about bitches and whoa
so listen what happens next in the book is that he tells this story about how what he was a kid he got a tape recorder and he made a recording of the songbird and then he played it back to the sod bird the cyber attacks

okay
so that he that he brings it back around now runs in lobsters are very different lobsters do not fly sing or person trees long occasional added mother
has a seizure we we have to censor the sky
dangerous
more important than the first amendment we've got to stop this book from the era and friends have feathers not hard shells rans can't breathe underwater and or sell
and they are seldom served with butter however they are also similar in important ways both are obsessed with status position for example like a great many creatures the norwegians zoologist and comparative psychologist and i can't say this guy's name this and ask guard yeah
now is got to every man man or is now had already on this girl can else guard said back in nineteen twenty one even common barnyard chickens establish a pecking order listen the determination of who is who the chicken world has important implications for each individual birds survival particularly in times of scarcity the birds that always have prior
you to access to whatever food is sprinkled out in the yard in the morning are the celebrity chickens after them come the second stringers the eggers on and the wannabes than the third rate chickens have their turn and so on down to the bedraggled partially feathered and badly packed riches who occupy the lowest untouchable stratum of the
chicken hierarchy those guys are such man i was the lobsters go what the fuck okay what he's doing here is he's implying he's having a stroke he isn't hair
i'll never forget when chaos on mother stopped me from testing runs breathing underwater this is this is postmodern yeah ok what he's doing here with with all the lobster and chicken shit is what he's doing is he saying in nature there are these fairly ruthless hierarchies
govern who passes on their genes and is sorted out largely through violence and domination and things like that and he's extrapolating from that that essentially that is the natural way of things and a human society
you should be like the victorious lobster because he the lobster gets physically bigger and struts about when he is clear it is that all lobster warren for this kind of a downer have a point but like is low stratum of chicken society he literally calls untouchables yeah which are like literally a cast yeah people in india who severely
oh they have coming mcgarry they got out packed i traveled and partially either
even if you want to pick fucking birds there is just a new study out about how ravens survive through a very complicated system of cooperation rewards base reward system based of cooperating with one of his man we shouldn't even have to talk about the fucking birds really you know yeah
because heard you have been his age because are social animals that fucking give the power of speech and a creative civilization but again like this works because it's true and a very banal sense that you know all animal species homo sapiens are you know they they are governed by these like nasty and irrational darker him
impulses and we sort ourselves into these packing orders and human nature however the fallacy is that like that that's because it exists that it's good and human human civilization or society is in ultra ball is that its own habitable an inevitable
and again of course you could do the opposite and pick out any number of animal behavior is that are completely alien from human beings and be like oh we should emulate that as well yeah we should be like bonobos and just stick our dicks and each other hastens whatever we have a commitment
okay so that's basically the point he's making about lobsters is that as you gotta talk about it off
to have alpha pile of presented on and say your space on the ocean floor and is somebody please back a recording and face attack that the locker and but he was when he's saying stand up straight with your shoulders back he means like you know as a young man like that
more defeated you are psychologically you will reflect that physically and sort of like closure your body language up and sort of hunched over and if you just sort of projected more physical confident she would feel more confident just the other thing see that's true yeah and that's a perfect example of his whole deal he hasn't actually useful if kind of obvious piece of advice
vice for you know your slumped over basement dweller that might not even thought about posture before this and the he smuggled into it a bunch of insane social darwinism
at the same time with the form
you do like a version of the virgin in chad be like a bunch of been seen circles
rather have a mother chaos
okay the chat is order rule number two
treat yourself like you would someone you are responsible for helping okay i mean that's just nice
you know a good attitude to have now the health care
this is like the guys who like who like they turned thirty five and they're like oh my god i did thirty two hits of acid
when you're nice to people don't be nice to you
i got it was like god was talking to me i mean the thing is he's he is a psychologist so he doesn't do therapy with people so you know half of what he says it's just really basic ways for people not to hate themselves and hate their lives and he's just like let me just
he smiled racism in the rule number three make friends with people who want the best for you
literally your friends that kind of is a defining care yeah
i will only befriend people who want to see me die
you know my toes keeps me ready whenever he owns a friend if a person i keep my circle small your only with a few laugh with men
thought for jack i wanna see the peterson versus a mere in america
i don't make friends with any yards or for my friends my wife fit enough friends with myself
there's a there's an anecdote he tells in here
that part about it how he like
childhood friend of his came over to his house and he brought a friend of his i heard of yeah
he says it was his friend i really remember he was spaced he was bait he was stoned out of his gourd his head and are nice hot me up on goof balls
did not easily occupy the same universe
and then he just goes on about how pissed off he was this guy was in his apartment and then he takes his friend aside and says you need to leave and take this useless bastard with your something like that so this is his attitude towards friendship no no starters in my house
okay remember for compare yourself with who you were yesterday not with someone else is today that sort of like he he's getting into this eat pray love it will know i mean i think i'm honestly that's fine i mean it's fine to see like don't beat yourself up by comparing yourself to others but he he is he's spins that
out into this extreme individualism right the not only should do not compare yourself to others you should cut yourself off from others you should you know
elevate yourself a bow others like the first chow eyes on i can why would young white men who have been conditioned to think that because they know a lot of things about star wars and are good at video games are the natural rulers of the earth why will they would appreciate someone telling them that they should cultivate a delusional sense of superiority
that doesn't have to come an unseemly contact with other humans that might this abuse them have it again this rule here is just like very basic like boring
you know race advice however i can imagine where he's going to go with this is extrapolating it to the political sphere which is like i think i've read him say things like you know socialism is not about loving the poor it's about hating the rich and that like it's this idea that it's envy it makes people advocate for a more just society or
or more adequate distribution of resources yeah he's constantly saying like don't blame capitalism don't blame society all the you know what should you even blame frozen away
he has yeah and of blades
it's like okay capitalism isn't the problem to then fill the space of wall okay how come everything sucks so bad with well a bunch of a bunch of french postmodern us got together and change the content of disney movie
yeah reflection of like the most kind of foundational neo conservative neoliberal idea that there is no society as margaret thatcher put it like he's calling on you not to even consider yourself as belonging to a community where you're a lobster on the bottom i think i think you made
the absolute correct observation here is that he's critiquing sort of activists in people who want to change the world gets into rule number six i'm going to skip ahead once i want to talk about it he says set your house in perfect order before you criticize the world
the point you get exactly right he's like
don't criticize capitalism and don't criticize injustice criticize on cartoons that aren't as good as they used to be like that really is when he's enters the new or across tits or so that the say your house in perfect order before you criticize of the world again there's like a half truth there that i think is applicable or even a okay criticism of the left
maybe start your own shit out for each i take all the problems of the world but when he says set your house in perfect order and then when he will say that of course people are always in perfect so the never try yeah so this is constantly receding horizon of things that you can't or shouldn't do and he says something about him where he said like the sixty
these a really bad because they just gave everyone the idea that like if he carried a placard like you should have something to say even though you've never been financially independent and you're only a student or whatever
that is like you know how much small business experience should i have to have before i can say the vietnam war was an atrocity earn it segregation is bad and should be confronted criticizing someone else is house isn't the only thing you can you can also help people set their house and or some people don't have the house
the only way he can think about it is we're in these autonomous fears and we can be critical of each other yeah that's all we can do we have built solidarity doesn't exist
okay i'm going back one rule now remember five is do not let your children do anything that makes you dislike them
this is actually my favorite rule yeah you remember what that was about
i'm not a parent so i don't have a personal relationship to this ideal but how did lake
raise your kids
chapter where he fantasizes about beating up a small child at a playground oh yeah he has a story about how he was at a playground and there was that of adoption child who was causing his shenanigans and he had a fantasy of kicking the shit out of the kid and then thought i wish i could do that
and since i can't grow it
yeah i have the excerpt rate air he says i remember taking my daughter to the playground once when she was about to he was playing on the monkey bars hanging in midair a particularly provocative little monster of about the same age was standing above her on the theaters are she was a result i watched him move towards her our eyes locked
he slowly and deliberately step thought her hands with increasing force over and over as he stared me down
damn that's awful
an awesome what's wrong with that is she's in the space that he's supposed to art of the ocean floor that's it for he's been lobster you should i find this
they locked eyes and he's been staring down by a two year old
and he goes
he know exactly what he was doing up your his daddy dad oh that was his philosophy
blasphemy
also have a say what is it with his is like rockabilly flag this is a good two year old out have philosophy
only hit a ball control he had already concluded that adults were contemptible and that he could safely defy them again he isn't included anything you don't have thoughts
a three word
only two year old has done the calculation and like i think it's pretty safe that i could defy these adults around a very literal happen to me that's all i've weighed the consequences of his stepmother peterson have a discussion about the nature of myth
figures that looks at it because you're witnessing a great i because
he does
he already concluded that adults or contempt of on that he could safely defy that too bad that he was destined to become one that was the hopeless future yeah their children
that was the hopeless few sure his parents had saddled him with what to grow up into
give our give my childhood
you aged two zero old three there
she was great and salutary shock i picked him bodily off the playground structure and threw him thirty feet down the field
he just pointed this guess is fantasy which is totally normal court
no i didn't i know i didn't i just took my daughter somewhere else but it would have been better for him if i had
yeah
i was alone piece of shit who had no al contempt for humans until a stranger in a public park across a playground
then my life was great after that how many life stories include a violent inner interaction with an adult when you're a small child and then things just getting great a two year old was the dragon and peterson was similar korea and
a baby was also disrespectful and peter just uses
the press down on the soft spot
like a fucking
like a video game he was also conquering chaos he was about the size of a cooper just jumped out at the koreans of honor of discipline him out of his body
i had a playground remember about this chapters is a section called discipline and punish which is literally the name of yeah because that is better ah which i think he doesn't he probably doesn't even know that or he hates yeah he hates photo in derry to who he says are marxists and who he was essentially controlled the
the the we the whole world
proceeded after the nineteenth yeah that makes sense that makes sense
cabal of fresh postmodern theorists with a combined income of like a club sixty five thousand francs a year who wrote books most undergraduates don't even read when they get assigned just like you want to fuck it taught well as had a reason
what does a more plausible explanation for the course of matches through a screwdriver
the last thirty years the vagaries of global capitalism
the forces that control the production of everything that we consume and interact with or a handful of french ass holes going to some colleges that most people don't go to changing the content of disney films and turning us all into these horrible
made us this theory either like it comes from like these neo conservative think tanks
who blamed cultural marxists this is like the frank for a friend was very er and they said cultural marxists they meant jews but you know they had this whole conspiracy theory about how marxism got turned into identity politics which then took over the world jonathan chait believes this yes yeah among other people and peterson just add as this thing where he
turns marxism into post modernism even though most marxist will tell you they hate post modernism and people who i don't know a single person who calls himself a post modernist yeah but people who are into contemporary theory or often very antagonistic towards marxism yeah village on to reconcile them you might have been out of the academy thirty fucking years
get a marxist interpretation of anything
but the reason that this is even surface level plausible the people is because the neoliberal turn happen simultaneously with the liberation of minorities and women in the west and those two things one of them of coke the other one and so people can point to the problem and say well look what happened once
we got rid of these hierarchies as opposed to look what happened when you know
western capitals and one in to prolong crisis and it was restructured in a way that radically destroyed labour power and analyzed communities and the industrialized and and scattered everybody to the fuck and four wins and turned them into eternally precarious subjects who who's had no real economic security no ability to class on
long term security to their children
that is masked by the fact that well yeah but now there's more women and in movies and black people and will allow this is coming from people in the center the democratic party hillary clinton rewriting that history to the point that like you know that the black panther party was a think tank
they're turning the is very radical movements against racism for feminism for sexual liberation into just kind of
poor policy driven
democratic credit goals the black panther party is not think tank is a movie studio putting out some amazing films that were all very proud of right now
henry henry i want all this and every fucking june it works at pixar
all the carnivals argues they changed her name when they got ellis island
i would actually like now
the i'm sure the malaria and i sure it was really money really aids is frozen throes of is it is anyone seen frozen i am not seen frozen chris seen frozen okay what do you know of propaganda what what he hates about posts structural is
but he he hates it because it's sort of like a revisionist fairytale in that like the message the movies that like the princess doesn't need a prince
save her or become self actual eyes there something yeah there's no fucking song about how there is nothing outside the text and gender is constructed
that's a funny thing is that he's like yeah this is this is a departure from the classic tradition of these ancient folk tales but it's er hans christian andersen thing as much money
he knows this he gets so much shit just plain wrong yeah store cool facts sources citations i mean academically the guys it is a total charlatan yeah ok
sue rule number seven and rule number eight i was going to go through these pretty quickly i remember seven pursue what is meaningful not with his expedient what good luck out i rule number eight we've all we've all wrapped up that finding meaning thing that that out her rule number eight tell the truth or at least don't
lie
and again like i again these are just incredibly pompous ways of restating like incredibly bland boring yeah true isms okay number nine assume that the person you are listening to might know something you don't that is something he does not exist
something i've never seen him do for contempt for anybody who has not same on board with this and as fuck and fans now in this thing where they think he's such a goddamn genius and i'm honestly convinced that's mostly because we don't teach humanities the kids anymore this is the first time that are encountering this stuff like i think that they i think a large percentage of his fans
i think he came up with others archetypes shit like they don't know the carl young is they don't even know joseph campbell so they think that he is just like i got i went my room for a while and when i came out i had these charts like that proud add capacity that have gotten idea
they don't realize that he's just for courage attaining this
this relatively
well trod the territory of frankly discredited psychological concept
rule never ten be precise in your speech now this is the role that mr peterson probably could use to bone on this is that like he has this will be precise in your speech but every time you're critical of anything he says his fans are like well you gotta watch you know
ten thousand and right there on a situation where you can legitimately that such a fucking genius that anybody who has a critique that they can't answer they assume well it's in there
one of the things he said because he has the whole corpus of knowledge so it's your responsibility if you're going to criticize him to engage all of it you're not you're not you're not qualified to talk about him unless you have absorbed his entire and you know what i'm sorry if it's transparent gibberish what kind of what of violence am i doing to myself to to to
subject myself to this video that was making the rounds the other day online of him summarizing a scene from pinocchio yeah and the scene was literally one minute long and you haven't two minutes some arousing well that's what i love about what did the mythic art type stuff because at the end of the day i think really what he's interested in his cartoons that said he loves talking about opportunity
he had reading mean these are his maps of meaning he's headed yeah that's all he is he has an idea of what a fairytale is that he thinks is is eternal and truthful
a logical unreasonable stock and he thinks anything that comport stewart is good and anything that goes away from it is bad and even that goes away from it is doing so because there's a political agenda that is not truly artistic the only way we truly artistic is to replicate the same fucking troops that have existed for thousands there's another video or he's just listing disney movies and it goes
brilliant a beast great they really nailed it
little mermaid mailed it lion king some problems but nailed it and one of them like the problem is he's grading them basically out how they conform to his idea of the fanatical fairytale motif so he's just the fuckin he's just a cannon yeah i can lose an awful
child who i would a head start with no second thought i'd had i agree on what leaders link
yeah he's like greg turkish origins character or onset of
he loves you
hercules surprisingly an underrated our bags of popcorn
chirac lots of great things in there for a here
okay this is greg speaking of cartoons he has he has to take on the simpsons
we've been added fine but i see here
there is a serious she was like
isn't as i as an eighth i care about the fucking simpson nathan robinson pick this corn colonel out of the ship pile so us to him again this is his take on the simpsons without interruption king of the bullies the
what
had i never really given it was voted the guy now i'm mad nelson is clearly a seventy runs below off kearney it afternoon jumbo are the israelis are all ships really lifted the nation out around me and parents now and socks or peterson there is only one reactionary respect his name is josh schwartz welder you will stop butchering his work okay here goes
without nelson king of the bullies the scored be overrun by the resentful touchy new houses the nurse assistant intellectual merchant princes soft chocolate garage german children
an infant io raf whigham months is a corrective so it's point there is a bullying the week is like that's like another k i wasn't getting a new works out white masculine serpent
so that's i think that all have those people was key children all have bad things about them
but the bad thing as being a sadist is nothing compared to being chocolate gorge
oh yeah oh how it is during barriers and feel about the real life real life child gorge in german child came dot com
the last two rolls hear these are these are actually to me the ones i'm most interested and i can't figure out what they mean remember eleven
do not bother children when they are skateboarding now this is a role that taken at face value our one hundred percent agree with
i think kids should be allowed to escape or whatever the fuck a white perform citizens arrest
on i
this isn't really rambling incoherent china and i lived for a while i lived in an apartment building and there was a fountain in front and kids would do grinds are was really annoying
my old man christmas
this is the chapter where he goes in all in on post modernism and i completely agree with i can remember where he was skateboarding at all sorry okay
so kids should be our area i think kids in more a little bit more freedom a little less supervision little bit more danger in everyday american life that's what i believe rule twelve is the final role and again one that on face value i agree with entirely pet a cat when you encounter one on the street get powerful i got allergies man
can't do what does he saying with this is he literally mean pet every cat
you know it's just stop and smell the roses cliches it's now can stop and smell the cat
know a sniff the cats ass
you see your friends you know take another issue to take some time start their toes
enjoy life
so those are the twelve roles and i guess just the to wrap it up here
i think you know i want to restate
the majority of the most salient fact about jordan peterson is how unbearably tedious years as a writer and a thinker however the reason for his success and the fact that like this again pseudo philosophical drivel is having such moments in our culture right now
because as you stated like the sort of i'm on a cultural and political liberalism has largely failed and for the young men that he's talking to
nobody in the over of like romano culture is talking to them or addressing them the only people who were talking to them is youtube yeah and he's talking to them through youtube and he's telling them a story that that makes sense or acknowledges some some truth that aren't being addressed or disk
aug elsewhere that they're not getting and i'm not saying that he's right but like he's like there's enough half truths and all of these things to lord the rest of it
rest of it ended and flattered prejudices that they already have it doesn't it challenges them and a superficial way in in that they should clean the room or do so in some push ups and start naming every four hours someone's paying attention right somebody wants to make sure that they're doing okay but but the deeper sense they're absolutely there he's absolutely flat
every lazy prejudice that they just got for like i want to go over there because it's not just liberalism that his failed but i think quite frankly the left has not done a good job or has failed in this regard for the most part telling a story that connects with the lives or make sense to most
people yeah and i think the stories being told it just doesn't have the cultural spotlight it doesn't have the outlet that there's really nobody doing it in a way that is accessible to people right
a cabin yeah i love tag producer gross topic by the way to yeah
so i was watching queer eye for the street the other night the new season which is a very good i'm loving it finally if people are loving it it's connecting with a lot of people and it occurred to me that the story that it's telling is what people take away from it is basically the same thing is what jordan peterson is offering is that you have these young men who either men of all ages reader ground too far into are somehow
i've jumped the track of like the society you suppose added dads were working three jobs and when we sleep three nights and because of the religious upbringing married the first person they met and have five kids and they have no sense of self identity or somebody who graduated wasn't able to find work or place and is like unable to struggle in their work life and you have
these people come in and crack open the door and show them away out of this like prison of they are constructed may illness in society
that's libertarian this way that that cast some kind of story about taking control of your life
having some kind of self respect and putting shape on this chaotic off off and literally like messy world cleaning their rooms and in this case it's these game and who are like showing their form of order in the chaos and it's a more liberal tory order again it's a cracking the open this door and showing them a way out of these prisons
and i just thought that it's such a positive mirror vs this kind of looking backwards
as you said like reactionary of embracing hierarchies thing instead of saying clean your room so that you may embrace the order of classic systems it's like living is cracking open the door and saying like the become a prince an ancient monitor that are like crack open the door and bow down to your agent
yeah yeah it out down there
yeah i just thought that it's funny that these two things are resonating at the same time because they're very much the same thing of like order and chaos and there is a place for like finding order because modern life is extra incredibly chaotic and can you can spiral out of control for no reason of your own doing in feel totally out of control your own life but
i would you say you know get a facial scrub and clean yourself up better and then maybe feel better instead of like embracing reactionary mindset of up your pinocchio and also there should be a sixth fab five who is the socialist bad vibe
the other thing is that you still is that as at the self help thing is good to give you a sense that you're in charge of your life but then you also need to have an understanding of why things are the way they are and how they could change and that is where socialism comes yeah and that's that's the only thing that's on examined in the show why said there should be a six
the part of it is helicopter ring in one hundred thousand dollar homemaker
that business with the help us need find these people's lives and it's it's really affecting like the other thing is that peterson does talk about he has a thing about like hug your dad or something save your desk save your dad saved every your i homeless that every one of these queer eye episodes has a moment where one of the guys turns to the subject was like
so i noticed you have a dad and the guy just starts balling
because they'd either they have not let anybody talk to them about how they relate to their parents or nobody has tried to just that like breaking connection there that there's like a paper thin wall of emotion between them and their even the concept of having a father is another point of resonance i thought so yeah i like there's a reason why these things you know resonate
with people or you know an emotional level and that's why i think i was thinking about what you're seeing that and i felt like you know when i was in my twenties or earlier like i felt like sort of an earlier more embarrassing stage in my life like christopher hitchens filled that role like guy who i love watching video clips of because i thought he was so smart and like i love seeing him
own paraphrase and own people and mice controlling his channel yeah he that he like someone who has a systemic critique even if he doesn't play right
i love is the idea of being so impressed by how smart and call it like this guy was and i think that's the way a lot of pearson's fans respond him because he's this like well bearer of like i mean kids room the sounds like he some is caught his dick
i can't i mean he is to me that's i have the hardest part getting is how he became a youtube celebrity sounding like that and crying all the time if you see me other you tube celebrities
yeah
it's weird or somebody else like just know those of good radio
they have them out there us
but not have shown are really good of us
oh and were were weeping muppets i just wanted as mario molina
fucked up that's the real me want to come back to the intellectual dark well
because i'm just thinking about buddy of mine who orders pharmaceutical drugs on the dark web and they come from just like guys who somehow get their hands on these chemicals and have fake moves of the actual pharmaceutical pills and just pack them in there and then manufacture their own bills sent
to you in the mail
and
