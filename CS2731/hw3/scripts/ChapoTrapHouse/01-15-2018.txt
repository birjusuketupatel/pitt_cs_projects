
my check one to one two guys hello
will unfortunately has been kind of paused by his care today that's right will made out with his cat marty i warned them and why people do you still hear he's just out of commission but we're going to go ahead as as promised with alex premier hello
and we're going to talk about him a gruff the crime dog can get it
i'm still here i'm still alive
a little a little bit low energy is will start off the other search this has already introduced i guess for the week it's returning champion alex marine of splinter whoa whoa whoa what's going on
well our ip to hawaii
prayers up to hawaii add to the fan of ours
pray not funny
it was in their defense are trying to do one of those positive social experiments were it would be an amber alert alert your beautiful smile
and they were like oh no i didn't take off the new template all thought and everyone's mad at me once again shatter to our fan tommy lee jones from the film undersea
and the best part of this is that you get to pick over what this is false flag to cover for pizza gates and russia
an impending a crack a north korea any any flavor of paranoia can be sated by the actions so congratulations well donald trump's planned to introduce loot creates the us military
yeah hawaii still here will still we're still here i'm still here most importantly of all after a nasty stomach virus but
this week up until you know it's it's hard to play any shows in hyper hyper normalize world because i thought this week was going to be shit whole week and i guess that was the pee wee herman word of the week
when we when you hear shit hole everyone just go
everybody on cnn who like acted like kids in school when the teacher goes out of the room going insane like we could swear know this fuckin reps
yeah they all didn't notice were there mr trump pass the damn executive orders i don't want any damn immigration quotas rod where did you learn that don lemon where did you hear that
yeah i guess if the president curses than that is you know our institutions like the grey lady the new york times which is usually very sneaky now they have an excuse to say north korea is a bitch ass motherfucker now we're already in my favorite part of the news cycle when it's people
or like guess what my great great grandparents came here from ireland
in a nineteen o two will i'll a shit hole american
i am a proud resident of shit hole there is to there are two equally stupid responses in one of them is like attention for do you know that your grandparents came from a shit hole enemy
other one is actually a scientist once came from
i swear it's like i like the ones where it shows like troops and it's like yeah i guess what this guy died in one of our dom war he says he went from a shit hole i do like that now the people on twitter whose name was there like deplorable merle now have an exact mirror image in my shit hole maria
steve shit hole it's this one this one's interesting because i remember right after the election like the one of the big lines of liberals was being mad at the media big they they were like you were to unfair to hillary and you also covered every like minutiae you
covered over every micro controversy and allowed him to turn it into a culture war which galvanized his base for people got fatigue of it gave them free airtime i guess is their argument like he wasn't running for president but there is an argument to be had at like covering every single thing he says is like a bad way to cover him that you should mostly government's policy it's because they're wildly and
popular but then also once he got inaugurated they're like resisting is this has been subscribed to the two biggest newspapers and know if the a one stories all time
are those washington post new york times articles are like look what a stupid thing this asshole and it's like yeah they're stupid and fucked up all the time but it's like also i like nixon said the n word like way out what what president and they just like completely adjusted their minds to obama era and nature
can't live on well that's the thing is like obama when he was in there like this he also said the end when he's all the time he had a mark mail and to tell him to stop mark earners with them they were doing like an eight year long have you
i have heard from credible sources that he did during one budget negotiations mitch mcconnell a honky
but it's like okay so what is this job with chief executive is the commander given the armed forces he can make life and death choices with the stroke of a bad most of the time he fucking picks death because that's what you'd use the head of an empire and you end up even if your a c
smart law professor thoughtful guy like obama you say things like good to killing people and if you're a fucking idiot like trump you go i don't want people from the shit hole countries but it's largely the same policy like if you remember obama resume deportations of haitians in september of twenty six dane late before the election so
so there are two things going out with us you have the liberals gas lighting themselves by saying we shouldn't gover trump this way but then only reading coverage of him this way and only talking about the dumbest things the dumbest man alive says and and buying into these like twenty four hour news cycles the ultimately mean nothing for him
and also excusing and making it so he's the first bad president and ignoring the imperial power yeah the president's a attempt that's the worst enemy of the cable news press and some of the dumber people in the printing presses like he's the first president you feel with the should whole thing
again it could have come out of a mix and tape it could have come out of a johnson tape mulligan
well good idea when turning it into turning it into
discussion about vulgarity
actually does distract from the sort of
if you want to talk about here is everyone covers these trump outburst like they're sort of individual distinct things i think the criticism as well you're not tying it into a narrative of who he is and who the country is so yeah that you can easily fit that into a coherent and more damning narrative about about his world view
and how it succeeded in two thousand and sixteen
but instead you get
the half giggling i can't believe i can't believe he he used it all
shit i think i think that is right about also like the libby no delights that a lot of these people are experiencing for the first time because it and sell our press and now paul krugman is walking around with a bad ass motherfucker wall
it's like trumps president you can swear and i'll just go for it yeah
right as he's ruining the world by swearing and we're saving it by swearing and it's like al yeah fuck it i'll get there's a whole political life going on outside of this sound in theory you know culture war bullshit
what could a dude your brain to hang on the every word of the dumbest man on earth i mean if that's your life
who could who would imagine that there would be good for your mental acuity he for your sanity
to do that might try that you know my fight the stupidest person you know and invest your entire emotional well being in every word that comes out of their mouth and see how i have a baby
oh yeah
maybe not
terrible terrible
it's like you you become him you what it what does the resistance last big thing before this it was screaming at vanity fair i think you got that from somebody an
think about it like i find myself in parenthood like like like speaking to inanimate objects like their babies now because my mind of in their yeah i'm like like are elected okay
no myself losing vocabulary yes
but where i want to go in this is along this line of like we began two thousand and eighteen with are sort of thesis statement for the year or like of where we're going and twenty eighteen is that the hash tag resistance has become the hash tag t caught of a few years ago i'm sorry if bernard this already but i see
it will be a theme will be returning to him by that that's just like a way of saying that like the trump has shifted the overton window so far to the right that like what is traditionally thought like the democrats are just moving right along there with them and i want to touch on something alex that you wrote this week for splinter about the actual meeting that the shit hole comments came out of
so this was a mean it and then dick durbin came out of the media and he never never heard of russia
that awful said by our president and then you have paul ryan saying like it was very unhelpful very unhealthy very unprofessional but alex you talk a little bit about like what were the actual contours of what was being negotiated in this immigration deal that the democrats were were there to talk to trump about so the the reason
trump even had
was even debating should or countries that a group of lawmakers was sitting there talking about the deal they were trying to cut to to save dhaka
and and
the dreamers like help them stay in the country
but the the dealers been negotiated was that basically congress was going to restrict legal immigration so they were they were going to
i think that the deal as constituted it was basically give up the diversity of a lottery or at least severely restricted and then they were talking about the countries with temporary protected status who like the salvadorans who just got that removed there are people who because we fuck
up there are countries were like we won't support you back there because we fucked up your country
that said is the also that el salvador think yeah and now that's been rescinded news about two hundred thousand salvadorans in america who are now of dubious legal status yeah exactly so anyway but so what was being negotiated was which countries will we restrict immigration from how will we restrict legal immigration in order to get dhaka dot and true
with being like oh you guys you know he was like oh like why can't we restrict restricted to norway like white like you want to lungs
the country why would they don't want
now their job
is a burning shukla cheese why would you go
last our they're like big bears trying to catch the salmon swimming upstream the salmon or job
as that back but what does what has been under remarked upon is that this is a massive that will be a massive giveaway that will be an astounding if you had told any political observer a year ago that as a male senate democrat
would be negotiating to restrict legal immigration in order to get some version of the dream act through they would be like what are you talking about it makes no sense
and that that is because of these negotiations were happening quickly and largely under the radar but no one really noticed how much of the farm democrats were preparing to give away well this is the idea to forty plus year precedent yeah says the immigration active eighteen nineteen sixty five i think yeah that would be reversed so i just want to read for your piece stroke
you say here democratic leadership has completely conceded rhetorically and politically that this is now the middle ground the fact that hardliners you prefer an even more extreme policy is all the justification they need this is the rationale you're calling for political here
it's cleared key democrats are sympathetic to the you're from their left flank but aware that something needs to pass congress they can win trumps signature scent negotiators believe there are emerging agreement which they say they're getting close to finalizing will lose votes from the right and left representing true concessions from both
i love both tom cotton and the congressional black caucus will oppose are deal so it is by definition bipartisan this is how far right policy become centrists and less than a year and this is that democrats are negotiating with the historically unpopular president in a midterm election year on an issue with they held immense amount of leverage
a month ago so they are negotiating they are get the position that the democrats are negotiating from his the position and steven miller wanted to know i know what's crazy about it be one thing if you had a united republican party that wanted that would agree with steven steven miller up until trump steven miller's position
was an outlier in his own party led the republicans were not in favor of restricting legal immigration except for the hard right
this is why the bush tried comprehensive immigration reform only for it to fail because of the hard right
but again like they're they are negotiating from a lake against republicans who don't even want to be voting to restrict immigration because there are rich business republican who like cheap labor
so it's astounding
that that the overton window shifted that quickly with barely anyone noticing i mean this is how democrats negotiate to democrats
and their argument against anything that people actually want be socialized medicine or you know leaving afghanistan is like that will never pass so we're going to are expressed position that we even run on his the compromise
it's a compromise that before you even get to the table get exactly what you came for like they don't they fundamentally don't understand negotiation it's like you
come in roll over on your belly say please please please and then hope that they go take even more and not only that like and then they come out of this meeting and go president
the horrible things like you know like and of course likely up
like he wanted and he still said bad as it is grotesque particularly as far as like haiti goes to call haiti a shit hole span
all means he's a yeah stupid person that oh my god will you stop freaking out every time trump is trumped well here's the thing it's become another random like of what i've noticed is that people like the resistance people this becomes another whole round of like demanding that cable news anchors call the president has yeah i was just like okay if you're over
the fine invest yourself and with him
he says or doesn't say for anyone other than that i don't know why you're i love and then the corollary to that his website so that only liberals read like congratulating themselves were calling trump racist and a headline like all you did all those drivers or read daily beast or sure going to make and and not be a president
oh i will say like trump got the democrats out of the shitty deal they were correct like again like just by saying shit had he blew it up like i don't bring it was already because
i tried to be fair when i was writing that for once i try to be fair
a lot of fit better i like a lot of senate democrats were already like furious at the deal as it was emerging it was sort of dick durbin seem to be to sort of going out on his own and hoping that people would fall mine
kemal harris was against it was sorry it was durbin and lindsey graham turn you into this me again angry and a game and then they showed up to find that is a tom cotton bob good lad were there weren't expecting to be in the meeting that steven miller had invited than there just to make sure to make sure that encourage
exactly know that he would have preferred to then then we're proposing graham in durban we're proposing cutting of these a lottery program by fifty percent and prioritizing countries that are already in the system how are they allowing him to negotiate about the a lottery system while he is going around thinking that the visa lottery system is where other countries hold a fake lottery
they're in their homeland as and then send people over he doesn't know how it works though
honestly like it's one thing like oh you learn he has an idea of his head that is insane fantasy where they're like holding of like the like there's a massive added a bunch of ping pong ball right
there's a bunch of playing golf balls on kurdistan he television
i it around because they're in charge of it there like pulling out only the balls they want and so all the murder that are worth how do i now
what a fucking the the lottery is by the state department no one has told him this that he's in the room
yeah yeah definitely think it's very possible that someone has told him this multiple times
yeah and he's still he's in his mind palace where he's in a casino in kurdistan
at the isn't making everyone play the big bang theory slot machine and he's like they don't know i'm only let the nines and tens when the art of the whole
thing about this like broader like the failure of the democrats are particularly or even negotiate what should be a popular winning position for yeah i'm or just not cut a deal with the president i mean it's insane that they have to put something on his desk while they like the first of all what they had they had the leverage and they theoretically might still
have it too
to basically threaten of shut down until a clean version of dac of past no oh yeah
the
but the like the the justification i got a twitter argument this afternoon because i was bored mostly because the guy who always wanting to was like an elected official when i was like you are too dumb but he was like if you don't want any deal because you want to sacrifice dreamers at the altar of purity politics
yes
i want to i want to dress them all and why i'm going to add up
i've got a light from any i'm gonna wear a score guess that is what i thought it was weird i what at bernie's positions was to bring back as far our wars yeah yeah we have nazi quartile quarrel over three
but i don't think it's an argument about it's an argument about about tactics and strategy here and if you want to get like a clean dhaka or some version of the dream act passed well first of all like the question of what trump simes is answered by anything you put on in front of
quake
miller have some influence over him but if the republicans put it on has to have kill it like he's shown that time and time again
putting like a know geez on likely making it more appealing to him i mean they someone probably have found but miller the white house's i like the little smiling a white house is like a door slamming stage farce so it's like every time they try to get like like one policy in front of him miller miller's like a failed
like kneeling behind someone open for someone to push them over i mean like it so on the one hand you have the steven miller view of immigration which is that if it's not from a white country we're not interested or we should try basically and legal all immigration to america from any country other than you know first world western white countries right
the democratic you on the other hand i feel like
like i said early they can't articulate a competing visions of this because whether it's people in countries that maybe are so nice to use a better word than shit hole or even parts of this country are people in america right now who live in places that are impoverished misery rated or maybe not so nice to live it democrats still believe in this like men
craddock vision of like you have to earn your way out of these hell holes basically you have to demonstrate some kind of usefulness regardless of why those places are exact which may or may not have something to do with the president of american foreign policy yeah i mean their favorite thing to do is to post like army veterans from hate
the yeah gathered absolute favorite thing to do because there's no interrogation of like so we should have this imperial executive branch where trump orders and sky to die in like whatever african republic and lie about it because he found like a navy seal seals only money just because we're we're invading all these countries you're not interrogating the fact that he
he has to earn his humanity to you by killing and dying for you it's just like no you didn't go to vietnam drop you pussy you are too busy being gay with vladimir
to kill a bunch of farmers slot i do you think that there's like a danger in reducing
entire countries to the sort of pain and misery and exploitation experience but also let's acknowledge that these thing that these many of these places are miserable for many of their inhabitants specifically because of us
this idea of being like i've seen a lot of people would be like look at all the beautiful music and food and eighty and it's like okay but also you should be able to say there's a lot of a whole era not going to go to the american south
i mean that but the that's perfect because before this new than the liberals centrists and even like rubio cocker argument for immigration was like don't you like foreign food that it's like when these are human beings you fucking well doesn't usually only way they understand universal islam or some kind
egalitarianism is through bourgeois cosmopolitan islam right
they have amazing beaches yeah it's yelp world or
going going for the young this path of both the democrats both like having having this to step up being like trump is the most vulgar unfit for office like authoritarian dictator america has ever had but then still largely a seating too
everything he's doing are we being really willing to play along with it and this idea of the imperial presidency i want to talk a little bit about the extension of essay surveillance that pass this week with big win big win
actually if it passed the house have passed the house but it past with votes from nancy pelosi and the democratic chair of the house intelligence committee and this is an extension of the pfizer act just run down here this is from the nfl dot org
the house bill today endorses all warrantless searches of databases containing americans communications provides a narrow and seemingly useless weren't requirement that applies only if researchers in some later stage criminal investigations allows for the restarting of quote about collection invasive type of surveillance that the nfc ended last year
after being criticized by the pfizer court for privacy violations and sunsets and six years which the congress is best opportunity to debate the limits of an essay surveillance are they also voted down an amendment to the bill that was offered by just an amish of michigan a republican who sort of like a libertarian republican which would have required law enforcement agents to go
a warrant before searching and save data for information on americans
let's see here
pelosi said respect for the debate on this issue i myself will be voting to support my ranking members of the intelligence committee referring to the bills roots and a template from the intelligence committee weighing the equities that's the path i will take house speaker paul ryan also spoken for support of the bill and against and amendment from remember his own party speaking of the amish amish amendment
he says i want to say pelosi for coming up and speaking against the amish amendment and in favor of the underlying bipartisan bill so again there's this massive cognitive dissonance between believing that trunk is a reckless white nationalist racists authoritarian but still voting to re up the essentially limitless surveillance
powers that we've given the imbued the office of the presidency with no you don't get it like the nfc is going to use it to prove that didn't rush is no no i'm not i'm not even kidding i looked into resistance or about this and a lot of people were saying it's a big win because with the surveillance powers the is going to take down trump oh my god they're going to take down to
robin this it's going to blow all the russia collusion classics work for the tsar you should know that phrase book and eighty of the thing that's amazing to me is like if you're saying that the russia good spirits he happened to the extent that it did even if you're not unlike the eric garland end of the spectrum if you're more of like a six than and ten
oh she didn't have the he should have the
that isn't that exactly why they're there
sorry i don't either you're all you're all missing the fact that our continued security as a country is dependent on donald trump's ability to remotely activated suzanne somers web cam
hello is is candice bergen
new being very unfair to me
thank god we gave him this power greater garner i see you you look like shit frankly i'm in your alexa
so this is just a quick bit from the the intercept right up with this a devon different nunes circulated a flyer opposing the amish amendment with pictures of the boston marathon bomber or so concerned i have yeah that they also remember when they prevented that
i was all can and will get forget when they stop that happening
but actually it was the picture of that would
like this has nothing to do the with the amendment but like he's innocent
yeah to say oh my fridge or har people troy i love you
an annoying one i mean because democrats actually had i mean there were enough republican the amendment the warrant amendment had democratic cosponsors having zoe lofgren was one of them
so does actually could have passed the house like fairly easily and and if it had like like an actual meaningful reform one of them had a chance of the senate made a date was pasted away because policy like can't be bothered to
like actually take a stand on it and what what is what does that calculus for pelosi here like what would be like why what does she see like the negative in like what's the last year in not opposing this i i honestly think that official washington
they believe their own bullshit on this and they are
they have intel agencies with bring in the rear of the have to be allowed to do anything they won that's a big part of it and the other part of it as deeply ingrained belief by democrats that if anything bad ever happens they'll be blamed for being soft on terror polio which i think
interesting to contrast this era now with the late seventies in which the last and there really was an effort by congress to rein in the imperial presidency i mean there was a lot of push back against it but there were democrats and liberal republicans of that era that did sought to bring reforms to the and
televisions are vast
at that that time then it was vast now it's even more expansive but there was an effort to rein it in the late seventies and now it's been completely abandon you go back and look at the church commission and the reforms that happened in the seventies and it it actually unimaginable to think of that happening today after fairly similar
scandals frank
and
the overarching theory that nine eleven
broke the the country's brain and made everything measurably stupid or that might be the reason why but
you know like i i find it very worrying about of that like there's not a constituency or voters who were like like please
retain the patriot act and expand surveillance and so their they live they live in a hypothetical fear of being punished by voted for terror happening and them being blamed i think there's something to that the nine eleven argument but there were mass protests and there was still an anti war movement it died under obama oh yeah because
everyone was like our lives
yeah pack up and go home i think though one of the most effective acts of propaganda was america after nine i love it was the troops thing because it was it was fluid it was just troops were troops anymore the s troops i mean you did you see i meet you i'm really
i was a real show
i don't do the tweet but they were like i was just watching cnn or something and they were what did they say it was like someone or other farmers are protecting our crops
i think you to found her to look like
just like that's that's precisely what i mean by like nine eleven made america stupid or in that sense like sally has ever yeah i think this average is producing anything you're always protecting yeah
so even if you're like even if you're supposed to be sort of than the laughter that issue like the other day someone found a tweet from nicholas kristof to those and fourteen goes
people are people talking about those guys who were crying while they were torturing people that shows humanity
like they were literally do they were literally torturing her buddy but that pain really bad also trying of the people they were torturing i sort of thing about the movies zero dark thirty and how they are all these little cultural little cultural snippets you're put in there like that it's a cool bad as woman doing it
that one of the first scenes as her like torturing that guy with jason isaacs or that the one counterterrorism guy takes out a prayer rug and i think that propaganda of all right we've got you in the position of you have to say that you have the troops and also we're going to expand troops to anyone who defends anything which
like you said it could be farmers it could be ball security could be moderators on a message board
that they're bree the brave men and women phrase i've heard so much in reference to trump in reference to trump being mean
the f b i the idea that they're sacrificing for us everyday these people who go into a h back the perfectly seventy degree office everyday eight salads from cozy and like go into exile and decide which fourteen year olds they're going to murder like that they're risking their life somehow
oh i just so like this all started with george w bush in two thousand and eight and then it was of course expanded throughout the entire obama administration and there's a certain logic in that like all these people who love the obama were like well it's okay because the good guy now has his hand on the till and we're going to win the presidency for out ass surveillance
hey and yeah and they expected that it would have happened forever but now that trunk literally their worst nightmare the probably the most irresponsible like least qualified person ever is in the oval office
are still largely okay with it and i'll tell you why because now they've put their face entirely in the deep stay or like i'm i'm using that in quotation marks but they've put their faith entirely in the these gigantic federal law enforcement and intelligence apparatus to use as a check on trump and then also they did
roddick party does not exist to produce policy they exist to reproduce the democratic party at this point and they can definitely keep doing that and or champ i mean they one needs to the other one other thing about this
this is the thing of the voting the bill
reading from the intercept this again it's as the vote followed him morning of confusion as president donald trump treated in opposition to the you referencing a conspiracy theory about then president barack obama spying on the trunk campaign he walks himself back few hours later treating we need to get smart with actually in the morning
fantastic story for our age because of what happened that morning is entered depaul town on fox news literally turn to the camera and said don't do five a president trump trump treated weeks left not do pfizer
and then john kelly and paul ryan had of on the phone for an hour and told him they live basically they lied to him and they told him notifies is only for foreigners it won't ever effect americans and then he treated we gotta do pfizer and but in that our republicans were like are we against it now we will be no no that's why they ultimately gave him the power
because he showed he had a nuanced exactly jags and he could listen to people
oh i've done a lot of learning this morning it turns out i can use is to have conversations with anna wintour
mr
looks like a great resistance response to wear like the law fair blog guys and senator mark warner room
they looked at trumps to eat and there were like what a hugely dangerous misunderstanding of the issue this is like oh my god and this is why we must renew his authority to oversee these programs like that was their argument
i knew a they think that the president's he isn't like a montessori school
mr president in light of recent concerns about this bill we're giving you a city cop will you sign it
we're getting a call over and were given a city cup and i got it
they don't make as a map i think like that is that you have to keep in mind is that ultimately this is a cruel stupid man and like they seem to both understand that he's stupid yet panic at some at that
at the idea that he's like kind of pure evil incarnate like he's a movie evil is what they think we're like he just exists to do bad things and that it to the point where it's not even about self preservation or he lacks any motivation besides hurting other people because he is cruel but also like clearly it's it's easy to him
influence his person because he is deeply stupid
yeah he's like just do anything at all ever
last the last guy who's going to have words with him is always going to be kelly or one of those gate keeping monsters i don't think you're ever and you enlighten me if she ever sept showed suppose she looks like that puppet madam
well that might be and it is only never him and actually is true that when you look at when the for the white house he did the immigration merchant negotiation on camera at approve of the terms brain works
i learned about what happened on camera was day and find it was like art for clean dhaka in trouble like yeah i'll have to clean dhaka and kevin mccarthy the house be whipped like leaned over it was like that's not our position mr president will but it's like the present like the policy is being set by john kelly and these got well you can't blame them for that because lake
when a powerhouse of charisma like daniel
i sat in a room with her once ended up naked don't even remember
she could talk me into doing anything you want to talk about the hilarious scandal that in any other time line would have been like that
deleting this
get their forget they're going to have a little vegetables for we get to our desert here i do you want to bring up one last thing that is
you know i think more monstrous now and like any been trump calling other countries shit like are certainly more consequential i'm talking about this in where they've they're now allowing states to him require medicaid beneficiaries to work or lose access to healthcare
yeah and i just want to kentucky is already gone through this and i want to read a couple things from the new program there is literally there is actually literally illiteracy provision that says here this is from the whole innovative moves at him herself and her health literacy or financial literary literacy course beneficiaries who are
an eligibility suspension for failure to meet the requirement on their read determination day will have their enrollment terminated and will be required to submit a new application kentucky by kentucky will provide good cause exemptions in certain circumstances were beneficiaries who cannot meet requirements so you don't get chemo until you bring back a book report
treasure island
this is no it's smith simpsons summer
stupid babies me the most attention but they do actually there a marine
andy slav it i'm reading from sort of like compile the the rundown of this horror show there's a six month lockout provision which means that you can apply again for six months if you removed from not registering annually or if you have a kid or get married and don't report it and it says that this is for quote certain populations
language is it says decent walnut and six month non eligibility period for certain populations for failure to report a change in circumstances that would affect medicaid eligibility
see their death by thousand cuts so it's just making the process so arduous and anyone who's ever had to do this knows how miserable it is anyone who's ever had to go through any of these systems actually it was great in indiana i have to say getting getting food stamps in indiana it was great he just showed up they filled out
shit for you getting at here it is impossible now they've cut like that
number of people they have at the offices if you ever
for example like have to get unemployment in the month of december
you will literally blow your brains out waiting on hold and
you bring it up but it says in the bill here it says in addition were an individual experiences a period of non eligibility kentucky is providing opportunities to return eligibility several commentators noted that the state's medicaid offices were many beneficiaries go to report those changes and the phone lines used to call to get or changes are already busy and the calls and visits are time consuming
so it's like overtaxed and already overtaxed like nightmarish well and i think it's all intentional that sounds paranoid but i know i think i think building up bureaucrat like i literally spending more money on more bureaucracy to keep people out as a means to shut it down and looks like is an hour
testing regime is for welfare recipients that costs vast know my husband but yeah they stop fraud with but you know what this is the price we pay because as we all know there's louis brandeis said the states or the meth labs of democracy and we have to let them just cook up whatever freak monster baby is that the put together in the urban meyer flaws
if it's totally intentional it's the welfare reform model
you make it more of a pain in the ass to sign up you make it easier to throw someone off and then when the number of people and rolled goes down you pointed that number and say it just sucks yeah yeah our fixing the problem fixed it the early anybody who wants to talk about how health care reform bill how whatever form it takes needs to be dynamic and to allow for experiment
station and then a for states to find out the best way to deliver quality care fuck you
one universal standard for everybody it is genuinely psychotic that someone kid die no bearing on end and you lose it and then and last money making on low barrier to entry savagery of their state government
you don't know i know housing crisis and like i said before the housing crisis in indiana you just for like i don't have any money i got fired and they like here is two hundred dollars a month for food and that was it and you saw slowly change it started with you is it getting cards that said not bank of america but at major bank on the back and that was you new snap card
like he had already with them facilitating it and then and then it got harder and harder and it became there were fewer and fewer people working at the office there are longer and longer hold times and then you move to new york
it basically bombed out the entire fucking office impossible to get that shit yeah and even if you do have health insurance like i know somebody who recently had a health scare and her when she had to go to get a spinal tap and she had to go through like seven phone banks to figure out if her insurance covered it and how much and charge you would need to get
and witch doctor to go to and the phone lines are busy that's even if you get in and you're part of the part of this is by design it's as everyone said making things more complicated so you have to go through three rat masons to get one piece of cheese they want to exhaust and punish poor people for trying to get
food health care unemployment housing aid anything right and that's the on the right ways out of it it just literally is eugenics so i did on the on the democratic side it's it's this meritocracy that they love believing it right and idea
a little fucking nerds and they're like oh here's a new system we're going to improve it by added in our town yeah like once we have everyone everyone will and won't enjoy filling out their forms of making choices what if it's like a fun puzzle to get your food and it but it's like they don't realize it like for people for people who have to get assistance before
or for anyone who doesn't have a top flight plan where they can just kind of go wherever and network and it's fine they're already doing that they're already scrolling through menus maybe they don't look as pretty as the obama care website but it can't the only two choices can't be means testing and means tested
with eugenics behind it because it makes no difference to the average person was to access them to it has to
it has to be different it doesn't matter if one is just out of sheer cruelty and one is because i don't know a bunch of roller backpack kids thought it was cool to match point about the salaries of these a local governments experimenting just a comment from the governor of kentucky bevan absolute piece of shit and they say iran he
hannah on election on the promise of taking away the medicaid expansion in kentucky all together which he wasn't able to do once he took power
experts they this is what he said about these new work requirements he said
low income people in kentucky will now learned dignity and self respect
i also think we can't underestimate the fact that a lot of these people really do have lake anti humanistic contempt yeah
oh you meant by their
doesn't matter doesn't matter i mean it's like looking at the only other is don't really yeah someone was telling me they went on some and when i'm like a safari trip
aw lion eat a
the liver out of a buffalo and as like how do you know it's delivered and like they always eat the liver first and that raised his really weird question to me where i was like holy shit and i look it up and it's true and it is it more nutritious it is more nutritious and so i'm like okay that lion doesn't eat it
because it knows that it's more nutritious on some level where does it taste better is this like delight is this cuisine or is it home economics and the answer it doesn't fucking matter because he ate the fucking live over burglaries as a mess with the water buffalo yeah sure after say don't waste too much time i really think trying to figure out what balance of of
malice slash ignorance these people have the point is it's dangerous
so moving on from a serious topic to just based instinct and desire
talk about how how does to how do you really got shit hole
last laugh at the ladies i can we talk about stormy daniels
is something that you're just them player with a tri pi i can think i've never heard of this person oil all of us have been sitting in my apartment
going through the stormy getting those catalog like bob korean and john carpenter and auto focus just just pros jewelry
together particular guys regular guys being friends watching movies together i mean look i can think the donald trump is reprehensible person and also think that it's cool that he's eskimo brothers of johnny sins
i can think that that's an important moment for me to see here's the thing is my big shock with the thing came out was okay wait a minute are you telling me that he paid this woman to keep quiet about the fact that they had sex because i'm very much team in the cell drop
ansel trump a lot of a sexual yeah like what i am i'm mike my because i honestly think okay a month for the election he's in the middle of the pussy grabber thing his bases and deserted him how many people really would have had their minds shaped by hearing he banged the porn star that's actually kind of cool fall so he as hell ivana to like
speak very explicitly about their sex life yeah he love that stuff like do these tall tale exactly you know what he was really paying her for was what want
have look these up though because it is almost childish yeah because i think he had her say we're like yeah his dick was his biggest table
i thought i'd gladly somebody is never had said it comes out it's no big deal but a stormy daniels and says okay you took me into into this hotel suite he he had me rolling around in flower
they need his excess torso flesh out like pizza
even the mega people would be like dude that's a valid
i did all the things you do you do during sex and more frankly
sorry about the search or procedure which was truly excellent
with her penultimate active first you have to find the that's a lot of trauma with that the i can find it but it's right on the front of the pelvis and to a penis world's
and then you know i go hey can i can i can we put these things put my thing in your thing okay great i go i do my thing you know go rocking back and forth like you do during sex and i'm paying
i know what he said he won one hundred percent paid her to get balls of gauze and clean the magma out of his gun
real sex we did not that we certainly didn't wear matching planet hollywood commode ozawa
i don't have bed sores
know and the best part of sex is right after when you are our on the back and say i actually work
superb what are is what what i like about this is in any other reality
been like like we crack story of the century and i borrow i guarantee you this will be ever more forgotten this by the time this up imagine obama fuck kendra
is like i was at the arabian for someone
shit hole will be done in two weeks this will definitely be done by the time this errors but as long as we're talking about this we had alex your alex your your own a media critic a journalist there's someone in this the interesting to to this story is that jacob weisberg sleep on that sylvester cat sounding motherfucker
had this story he had stormy daniels on the record he october two thousand and sixteen saying trumps fucking psycho lawyer michael cohen another absolute winner that guy paid her this hundred and thirty grand hush money to cover cover this up or whatever he had this record in october two thousand
sixteen then she started turning his phone calls obviously assuming because she was paid off by our know they shut her up in some way yeah and she just release some fucking letter that sounds like you know forget she might as well be holding up today's copy the new york times
so wise very says i have this on record but i didn't publish it because i didn't have her consent to do it which and this was like a week after the pussy grabbing thing we can debate whether or not anyone would have given a shit about this but it does like it would have been a huge story young election and a huge story coming on the heels of the pussy grabbing
tape and it's like well weisberg is now saying this to the new york times presumably without his daniels consent of sunlight builders why the fuck with the only release it when he had cancer would have made a fucking and if at all it's an incredible fuck up and my colleague thomas go with just was just saying this
okay first of all
we're on the record saying this to you than you had her consent to publish because that's what on the record me
for the second of all she's not a victim of of any sort of attacks by all accounts it with a consensual sexual act and shake yeah exactly
so could like the idea of needing your consent to publish what she voluntarily told you on the record
we're not talking about and assault or rape or anything else here we're talking about fucking blake porn star having sex with a celebrity
people
exactly the since he you'd have all the beautiful people in the prime of their life
the doing i would totally now comes natural yeah not at all like can make it roll more at rolling or
probably just wasn't that good or confirmable or anything i just that it was bullshit nothing story because i because trump is never fact i
we did vodka and they destroyed the tape i paid to destroy the tape because if people saw how good i was there be no more porn industry but everyone within a month they said too insecure to every people
well is called me the white lightning that steel name i came up with but it's really a grey really interesting stuff people are hidden and more and more or hearing and more and more people who say anywhere people are saying and look this boy can be thick is incredible
i mean thicker than him
i didn't even set out to try to do that
a very good genes my dad was a thick man
his buddies the wrong side of yes
another interested in got some done another interesting
sort of connection to the story daniels affair is we talked about it a few episodes ago the queue and non conspiracy that has consumed so much of the right wing or just online right now even people were offline the big catch phrase of the queue and non conspiracy is a storm is come
and by that they mean that like all the celebs sick goes in the democratic party are going to be arrested or like like something a story something's coming and then now the stormy daniels revelations which seem very interesting to me that in all lines up but however as twitter friend on earth spirit pointed out
all these same people will be like no not this this is just a coincidence
good deep state
that's he's being the opposite of a pedophile
he's like it's proved that he does the opposite of pedophilia by sleeping with an adult woman an adult film star yeah that far as an adult films like him or her and been
donating one hundred and eventually would be like oh she than phantom a thread
you know you're saying been bad for me that came out during the election but also hillary fucked peter north
either out of it like man there really isn't a choice for a candidate that hasn't been fox by opponents know gary johnson know
heyman riley reid
the dig by the deep state
well again you mean it's fun to talk about but it'll all be a lot of
although his best thought
thing that they don't lose all your fucking marbles over everything that happens it's just all experiencing a lot of over stimulation at the moment
navy suit yourself with
the guys
centrifugal simulator and massa with your face off
exactly and yet but
try and take care of yourself you know that you have like a capacity for this stuff and you don't you don't want your brain to pop it on and also have you know have a laugh
it's fun watching stormy danny's villiers with your boys if you're if you're of a week mind you can't follow all that stuff you can follow every micro controversy you can follow every awful thing he says you can't follow every little culture war thing you can't fall everyone he's
pretended to have sex with that's where people strong braids that's us we're doing our job more troops were troops in our job to think about the president sweat only rubbing up against florida which is why all of us voted for you to lie about as you know what i will it doesn't feel like it
no
best the day it feels like a job as a day i get out
like are like our cousins in the army say
job i ever you think of my job of keeping the post safe
i don't want to go to keep the post
wondering what the fuck jacob weisberg was thinking what sitting on the roof or and has is how you to was that he wanted to make sure that they could keep doing the trump cast
also not have
stupid fuck truck as if actually actually proves trump right when he claimed that the media would fall in line and twenty two thousand and because they need him
said
any other president this will be the biggest thing yeah presidency would probably result in resignation and now it has suddenly there will be gone for the end of the
it's quit
the that will sort of this stuff i don't have an acceleration is like will they are celebrating yeah holy shit
if you will find space
it slowed down after the line it go faster and faster
as ten
you
any any
the angels
so close things out for this week we got we got alex preen on the scene i wanted you're really serious now as a tip of the cap to the the dearly departed for report i want to read now with alex david brooks is cone cone me which is very germane to everything we've just
talked about because david wrote this on tuesday all is proving that he's just way ahead of the curb these they always look good in retrospect yeah especially this week
so this is david brooks reading up and the new york times this week the headline have a lot of the piece is the decline of anti trump ism
david rights let me start with three inconvenient observations based on dozens of conversations your own washington over the past year we don't tar floated you inhale helium are notorious hail helium and then we ran out of helium and we will we realized that we could actually kill ourselves
particularly i'm so then we switched to a drinking game okay
if you if he bemoans the younger generation the kids today
if he does thinly veiled autobiography
if he brings up humility virtue humility virtue
her character and and name drops of the writer name dropping is a big one yeah so every name drops if he named drops other writers and then it's two drinks if that figure from antiquity
and then yeah then if he if he references the decline of democracy got to give your home massage
some makers mark left there a right about asian paying book
the components of china it's an important book okay so brooks goes let me start with three inconvenient observations based on dozens of conversations around washington over the past year first people who go into the white house have a meeting with president trump usually leave pleasantly surprised
because their expectations were so astronaut is so fucking low to begin with but because they find that trump is not the raving mad men the expected from these tweets storms or the media coverage they generally say that he is affable if repetitive
he runs your door
he said and downing he runs a normal good meeting and seems well informed enough to get nor all white house
one of for to get by right
standard for the price of the united states are go walk up to him and i say how are you doing and he says i'm having a regular one and good
second people who work in the trunk administration how wildly divergent views about their boss
some think he is it deranged child my goal for four days i'll put some think he is merely a distraction they can work or
distraction
yes he could kill everybody on earth if he presses the wrong button but you can you know it's like it's like when your kid makes as the thing is you just gives all riled you got jingle your car keys in front of him but anyway
he'll forget that he has the power of life and death over every being on earth any new say that but again what has been proven time and time again is that it is very easy to put him on the complete opposite track of what he was twenty minutes ago
so may have keys work some think he is strange but not impossible some genuinely admire trump many filter out his crazy stuff and pretend it doesn't exist
a really good literally just sharing some people are living in fantasia
some people think he's the best father in law he
my impression is that the trump administration is an unhappy place to work because there was a lot of because there is a lot of hate your internet
a lot of infighting and often no direction from the top but this is not an administration full of people itching to invoke the twenty fifth amendment yeah because that i'll be out of work
third the white house is getting more professional
tuesday or the last two this is entirely an office management
that's exactly what is three think they now have a chore board
stays
doing the dishes and he's taking out the most retarded using slack and they have their channels organized yeah
a machine that way when doesn't leave out coffee for it was it gets a young man named virgil texas
about have told them about the food choices channel on slack post all meal decisions for affirmation or denial i love imagining david brooks reading this about our office where
there are far less outbursts
now under three hours to decide about one the
they no longer get distracted watching old ron fournier videos on c
the amount of garbage humiliated around felix experiment has sure kind dramatic
so the trade houses getting more professional imagine if trump didn't
badgers trouble wasn't raised seventy years old
the craziness of the past weeks to be out of the way
the whole thing is like it's just twitter that twitter
new guy you imagine the president away the white house suddenly seems much more i yeah i know charlie weis builder
i'm going to
the studs or but recently replaced i know you guys think the strong things are ridges bitches
thought experiment imagine he is about thirty years younger he went to harvard law as black his name is veronica
now do you hate him
check the majors at all
and says if he wasn't cheating we'd see a white house it is briskly pursuing its goal
a shift in our pakistan and policy shift in our off shore drilling policy shifts that's a lovely yeah the coming the next four or five deepwater horizon incidence of briskly changing the makeup of the gulf of mexico oh i like this the fruition of our isis policy
the nomination for judgeships ships in the formation of policies on infrastructure dhaka north korea and trade so so he thinks the worst case scenario is that trump gets in there and he's just like he gets lost in the bathroom and they don't do any the
the idea of doing anything well here's a like brooks sort of has a point year because like yes trump is an idiotic sorry shows like you know paying porn stars hotshot money or whatever but the white house is actually pursuing a policy agenda it's just that policy agenda is a fucking night many also just laid out like the people they're nominating
the federal courts are unhappy with us until i'm dead problem we are like you know cow jocular fred flintstone the john birch junior society
he a beauty pie is going on the ninth circuit court
he's wrong even my own standards though because this isn't use describing this as professionalism as if this was a sort of normal republican policy policy shop normal republican policy is happening but there's no coherent agenda because it's a bunch of individual actors jockeying to accomplish whatever their goal is like the judges like there are there again
one of them through but the like even people that chuck grassley early aren't disguise a little too odd qualified for me like you know yeah but buddy nice my lionel i really only the one guy who was just thinks that like taking away his twitter would make every he thinks that they should be taking away his twitter at the way that
people hate r's polio
good of their lives
this is this is informative though because i think that david burke speaks for not that big slice of the country but a definite population were yeah
it's not really the policy is that they have to pay attention to his twitter
imagine the johnson administration without his comically large penis
so he goes it's almost if there are two white house's there's the potemkin white house which we tend to focus on trump berserk in front of the tv the lawyers working the russian investigation in the press operation then there is the invisible white house that you never hear about which is getting more effective at managing around the distracted the boss i sold was
an unaccountable invisible state
i sometimes wonder if the invisible white house has learn to use the potemkin white house to discuss while it changes the country okay with brooks is describing here is that if you cover your eyes from thinks you've gone away
can see him and he says i mention these inconvenient oxford observations because the anti troop movement of which i'm a proud member seems to be getting dumber it seems to be settling into a smug fairytale version of reality that filters out discord information a fairytale version where we believe that if we
just struck down the evil twitter mission
more anti trump or it seems to be telling themselves a madness of king george narrative i think that's the same oh and
king george okay fictional character king george
trump be careful though already
the madness of king george narrative that trump is a semi literate madman surrounded by sick of fans who are morally intellectually early
trump is a semi literate madman surrounded by sick of fans who are morally intellectually and psychologically inferior to people like us that's what brooks says is the fairytale nerd
oh okay i think is going to fairy tale because i see nothing in david brooks that's better than like don't ski or whatever they're just as shitty they all live in the same neighborhood and chevy chase maryland
goes i'd like to think it's possible to be fervently anti trolling for also not reducing everything to a fairytale the anti trunk movement suffers from insularity most of the people who detest true i mean i agree with him on that they aren't around us
nerds but you are the kings a nerd yeah this is millhouse
getting mad i look like a nerd
how is writing a column get smart prince
it into most of the people who detest don't know anybody who works with him or support so i mean know this is this idiotic idea that you have to fucking be friends with these their father also absolute shit head route from supporters to understand generally the trump isn't an awful president is it was a terrible thing
if just factually false and it shows his insular and it just broke to them as hilarity because like you know who fucking detest trump like you know my aunt who lives in the midwest and know the a shit ton of trump voter year later she'd detest him i would if i knew him if i was actually in
social circles with more trumps supporters i would probably he'll probably joke less about trump oh hate him
and have him so much now i'm very lived in ironic and i'm like isn't it funny we have a crazy president folks porn stars you know if i was like living in a community where like i had to deal with these people in a day to day basis people who were like he's my president daniels the not this is fake news footing
would the honestly i would be like buying a mill or you know you'd be you'd be that woman in texas to fuck that boss woman in texas with the pickup truck the said fuck drop on them
twitter a jail and then she broke her back out of it she added to it fucked up and fuck the share like the sheriff well i've i've been dating hope picks so this is my perspective this is actually a common
you know i want to unpack as a little bit because this is the this is like when conservatives make fun of the old pauline kael line i don't know anybody who voted for mick jagger pauline kael she wasn't being ignorant it wasn't me how to mix and when she was stating a fact in her bubble she didn't know any mix and voters the conservatives who took that as like all they all have in a bubble are like manhattan
conservatives who used to write for the national review or whatever and who professionally interact with a lot of liberals had john podhoretz is a bubble yeah but do you know who actually lives and in fewer bubbles are people in white enclaves all across the country who universally voted for trump like they're the ones who don't know like they intentionally live and encore
use of like minded people and then people like brooks are like you dummy liberals don't know anyone who thinks different than you and a half of us fucking come from families of people who voted for trump
those trump people in the enclaves know any
hillary voters but they know jimmy kimmel
iris realize they are they're more like the even larger like number of people like the people in my accent family you just don't oh oh yeah of course yeah so he has the movement also suffers from low brow isn't fox news pioneered modern low brow ism
the modern low brow think sean hannity your dinner de souza ignore his normal journalistic or intellectual sean hannity literally has a low
hello hairline
he creates a style of communications wasn't me who make more it makes you think and noticed less the ultimate test of low brow is not whether it is not whether challenges you teaches you or captures the contours of reality it's whether you feel an urge to share it on social media i'd say we're very low over
the in every war nations come to resemble their enemies
so i suppose your hogs
so i suppose it's normal that the an anti trunk movement would come to resemble the pro troop movement but it's not good on my god i've noticed
a statement what does the talking about both sides do it is blowing my mind that is like an accent is of great than as i actually if you if you killed the bourgeoisie do you not then also become the bush was in
you throw your old phone and lose your new government
so he says is not good i have noticed a lot of young people look at the monotonous daily hysteria of we anti jumpers and they find it's still out as a drink
because not only of the event when i whenever he said i've noticed something young people do it what setters i've noticed my why i thought about it
this isn't just a struggle over a president it's a struggle over what rules were going to play by after trump are we all going to descend permanently into the trump standard of acceptable behavior yeah oh yes
yo yo had before can porn star center
or are we going to restore the distinction between excellence in mediocrity truth and lie are we going to insist on the difference between a genuine expert in an informed blow hard or we going to restore the distinction between those institutions like the congressional budget office that operate by professional standards and speak with legitimate of
authority and propaganda mills that don't know it's so hard to salvage their credibility i've got a link election and it's like now we're never going to your expertise again i what i like about using this is like a contrast a fox news is that a big big project of really respectable conservative specifically our vic roy and a lot of the heritage foundation guys
is completely change have a go
does that work california so that they can do more things like be like show that they're insane tax bill will increase growth and revenue so yeah don't know who the fuck you saw me about your ego closing out final sentences there's a hierarchy of excellence in every sphere
there's a huge difference between william buckley in sean hannity no no they're blocking is why
only one of the threat to beat someone up on national television and sean hannity actually could because we know he studies and million street style
william buckley and sean hannity is sean hannity is a more successful television
i think
so shut he would never write a bitch ass sailboat
our boats all started
jet ski guy on high anything weird with yeah well i mean instead of the skinny dipping in the long island channel
dude touch ball the judge football shirts and skins every day so no someone plays shirts and gives booze ball that on what the fuck you know nothing below the way just shirts and guys be dude okay the closing out part of the struggle is to maintain those distinctions not contribute to their eviscerate mission
oh god i'm haven drugs and no content there was nothing
says oh you think the trouble is just a stupid tweets but he also has a government well yeah because government has like a continuity it's bureaucracy
of its own okay what does that what does and sean hannity is an open and you need to be less like him what he doesn't even have an example of what he's talking about and that's actually one of the killer things that makes like a killer brooks as he doesn't even name and example of that he's talking about it isn't always talking now as he made else generalizations it's like they they always become
their enemies and it's like when when he just keeps going that he just his wife was watching the daily show and she laughed at a joke that he thought was too simplistic
silently judge turn just like gritting his teeth and ploughed out a call or well then he is right because the daily show sucks and i stand with david
we stand with david yeah well today which lifestyle watch watching the daily show
looks as aiding ladder on shop
yes yeah really
your head as high as ever and it's really depressing last year
and not an acceleration in terms of entertainment this is not this is not a comedian's funny
no i have i have a theory i have a theory i have the theory
boss a body what would you have written
now but he's close to a machine and i will tell you why if you had a relative that was other son downing are dying what something you could put on that wouldn't excite them that much
it is like is it is i mean all of those political comedy shows are dreadful but there is something just own meal ass about the daily show now where it has any been run through cuisinart five thousand times and to just total paste it's like the soil and of entertaining today donald trump tried to say
a barrel through bogged and had a raid quit
australia and whatever how was like okay
difficult
louisiana is like
it was rather
donald trump drug to wrap up either hey hey hey hey
said why don't we wrap up the alternative fox and folk
mexico pay for it what's bring back obama
the daily show
and i buy his diaries
i mean after all that bad
we're talking about peace my
very bright a record for south africa
actually
i really really good stein
