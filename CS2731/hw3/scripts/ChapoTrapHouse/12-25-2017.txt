jha posts here and we're here because the special day
we decided to give you something special a christmas treat for you under your tree and if you don't have a christmas will no presence for you because we don't care about you but we're gonna give you some a special today on the show finally we're going to let felix do a whole episode about syria are it's thirds familiar with the story of christmas
but imagine that wasn't a carpenter was so fucking optometrists it's the money lenders later i a hundred years
but out to take out here is felix
i was i was actually wondering if we could do something else to do something a while or in keeping with the season one who defends more christians and i always say
chris
you know new guy knew produce her new fish pretty pretty pretty bold going through here the direction of work our christmas show now what i would presume to even suggest a but i just thought this will go off on christmas day and i thought we might do something you know of a little more elaborate in
a tale of seasonal mirth to brighten their spirits and this time of little really deep miserly greed and revisit the true meaning of the holidays
peace on earth and good will towards all men
no it's gaming
go on
what do you have in mind
actually syrian professional
i mean like i said feel free to pitch us but you know i mean a better be good and we better get something out of this brand new never pull that should what's funny you bring him up because the thing is you see
ladies and gentlemen for your own listening pleasure radio shadow is pleased to percent a christmas carol

brendan was dead to begin with there is no doubt whatsoever about that the register of his own edge was signed by the clergyman the clerk the undertaker and the chief mourner matt signed it
and man's name was considered a good for any piece of business or roasting he choose to put his hand to render was fucking roasted nude mad and dead from the shame of it all now i don't know what it is particularly about being nude and mad i would think that being mad wouldn't lead to being nude but far be it for me to change
expression or the country's done for so permit me to repeat once again emphatically that brendan got so nude mad and read online that he died and was fucking dead
man knew he was dead of course he did how could it be otherwise
man and he had been pod cast partners for i don't know how many years
that was the sole executor his so administrator is so friend and the only man who mourn him if mac can be said to have mourned at all
and the mention of britain's funeral brings me back to the point i started from there is no doubt that brendan was dead
this must be distinctly understood or nothing wonderful can come of the story i am going to relate matt never painted out old bend his name their it stood years afterward above the racism factory door mat and brendan the from was known as chop own associates
it was bitterly cold and the fog was because come on that christmas eve of two thousand and seventeen when that sat busy and is racism factory with his cloak virgil nearby trying to warm himself at an i phone but since he didn't have much of an imagination
failed that is until that's french helix arrived
many games missed and on the sure of that what
mary games with game save you the gaming on chris this a bug
yeah thought i was getting our christmas
oh why talking like that i don't i try and so indifferent trance and an urban i don't know to do that what i'm trying to say is there no hard feelings between us
at the factory to become a famous pro gamer and hezbollah's keyboard that a wing
in fact i'm inviting you to my christmas land party games bus
the game is this what's gaming to you but of tab for paying bills without money a time for finding yourself a year older than our richer
i could work by will every idiot who goes about with mary games and is on his lips should be boiled of his own mountain dew gave a fuel at buried with a joystick through his art is short
there are many things from which i have benefited they don't show a profit i dare say things like friendship and eye coordination a new racial slurs i learned on international servers
gaming is that attire binds but a chain that links together all the children of the world who did not want to go into the dining room on christmas and here their wretched ants ask if we have girlfriends yeah for we're you it alone
but together we can cap points a be before getting anti vehicle pick and totally asked about the other teams vehicle spawns in the choke points with i profited judges at the end of the match shall i win and fuck you shot gun pussy if i lose hear hair another sod out of you and you all keep your games this by losing your opposition them
same with us man also this festive season of the year
usually desirable
make some slight provision for the poor and needy that's why i'm raising bitcoins and twitched by p s v is for holes korean children who were orphaned by fan death p as faith as for the office
oh no work houses no prisons many gamers can't go there
honorable and the things that few high and they'd rather die than leave their targets that much even if they're playing with with hit scan oh well if they'd rather die or perhaps they should go ahead and do it and decrease the surplus gave our population
i'm sorry to find you so resolute
we've never had a coral you and i except for when my new work friend took your dog hostage
i came all the way to give you greetings of the season

oh man was a tight fisted hand the grindstone he was a squeezing wrenching grasping scraping snacking clutching covered his poop touching old poster secret self contained in solitary is an oyster he carried his own low temperature with him everywhere he went he ice
his office and the dog days and it didn't fall one degree christmas man always took his melancholy microwave meal for one in this night was no different
he read all the want boggs is only amusement in life a solitary bro it's quip were a new york times op ed by frank bruni he lives in chambers was once belonged to his deceased life partner brendan
they were a gloomy sweet of rooms it was old and dreary for nobody lived in in but matt the other rooms being all that out his offices
the fog and frost so hung about the black old gateway of the house that it seemed as if the genius of whether sat and mournful meditation on the threshold
driving and chambers matt took off his crops and outdoor t shirt and put on his house crux and indoor t shirt along with his night cap before he sat down before a fire to take his cruel for yeah to hold in his head it was a very low fire indeed nothing on such a bitter night he was obliged to sit close to it and
brood over it before he could extract the lease sensation of warmth from the handful of fuel
