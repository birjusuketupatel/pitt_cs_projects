
some people and he'll be bush in this interview
hey saying that the sound like a great guy that also see you in moscow
being very complementary about it may appear to me and many americans believe fixed the us election which wide donald trump became president for anyone to think lead
new food to had
anything to do with fixing the elections or even that the russians have that kind of knowledge is stupid




priests news softball fat cows and grief
the new routine
best leaders in the world
according to the trend for the show
repeat
steven seagal
i didn't see it
in the previous with these coming out against the kneeling protests in the nfl and
he he knows the months ago he is claim to have been a operative for like three decades now so easily as someone who is the top of the sniper program in the past assassin this insults me now and he said he actually said
risk my life countless times for that bag
insane that he just nobody challenges him i mean if you really care about about the flag people stealing valerie in disrespectful let's talk about this
fucking potato with the goatee lying about being anomaly
he he sacrificed his twin brothers life in a perfect weapon for that that his his his website claims that he is the only civilian ever dismantle an atomic bomb
all is so
if you're going to have a story about
kneeling is breaking the flag stealing valor and steven seagal you know we're going to lead with steven seagal never sit or neil when you should stand one thing i've learned from his movies yeah he definitely has always stand it
no my ah guy very agile very mobile he definitely would be able to get on one knee and then get back up again
that's the real and imagined the clicking here
like a washing machine it sounds like this
others me it sounds like getting a laundry bag full chick lit caught in a door
trying to send it over and over again
i like that he switched countries because he's like oh you can sometimes be prosecuted for sex crimes in america
but that is the that is that if anything about steven seagal putting these pampered athletes and their place for disrespecting america which i'm all for i don't i don't want
yeah like to be all right to disrespect the flag and our troops but food
i just i don't think steven seagal like i said someone who literally has renounced his us citizenship so you can do more sex runs in russia
is really you really know about that atomic bomb that he this man right and he wants to be respected for that for all and on any he he was
he was a blue life for a while yet that sharon not on there was a blue life and he mattered he would yeah already mattered more than a else he had an orange life he had already colony sit like cop or something that he hadn't caught on television and he's like i can send certain things and he thinks he has some sort of premonition of cry
and it's just racial profiling i it
it's guy over here looks suspicious just a black sense

matt was aware of this but this was from when as ago had to end his ill fated a nice series law man because of allegations of sexual harassment and sex trafficking
this came out in open you don't do those unless you've been elected chair on the reading from the the news account here it says the lawsuit says the lawsuit says when told seagal that she had to leave to me with family members who would be suspicious if she didn't show up nonetheless he told her not to leave the house and followed her with a gun equipped with
the flashlight i mean he's an operator if you're god flashlight you need a gun to go with it
lost loved guns and flashlights the zodiac killer also trail would also splinter cell so she says he says
followed her with a gonna cope with a flashlight as she went out to a waiting cab which bit away as she jumped in the front seat wins lawsuit said she could identify quote a unique physiological reaction that seagal had sexual arousal which could be corroborated by the other attendance
it's not a boehner the suit did not specify what that reaction sometimes while begin real randy my boat spins for mama mama fucking tongue rules out months and that was back in like a motherfucker when she thing is when you study in the east you know be run in a normal person your legs
personal finance they reasonable wheels on a car but it takes about three seconds for them to move in on the ground that little thing called duchy through fog and operators when they get they get they blurred up there hot jumps out of their chest in the perfect shape

just talking to an local phone here having a great time
i've been a regular done with my friends normal more time i listened to a liberal pod cast the other day the humorous we were just saw here about that
ask you about that
are you sick data on going without it's funny as hell i have it
i mean i i only wish to name them because i don't want to just be beating up someone us is horrible plaid as that isn't that high
maybe one of the worst things i've ever seen
the mail host the milk a host who spoke only when spoken to
spent about forty seconds trying to get the word clip out of his mouth he was like and the burning brothers were harassing her and they said they were thinking with they're gonna want to say it
and the host was like whoa whoa whoa whoa where they say i don't know what it is ass which i thought was that was again a good know she didn't get what he was going to say next to you
well begins with the c just it's the it
little pleasure but
split that could add to your mouth
i mean that i understand not wanting to say like the slur i understand and records
isn't the slightly yeah you know that it i don't a gash share anything i some really that that was the best part he was he was too timid to say quit and i thought oh man he doesn't like he was to say the same idiots way the ticket if he was going to be like a good ally you shouldn't be intimidated by any part of female anatomy as well as you use
the corrects you know government always a steven seagal and be praising that we're not want
milan argue with the team found it
bumble cloud hyde amendment doesn't matter
steven seagal new song where he's for improving medic obama care of the bipartisan solutions so market solutions i want to get to where i can recall what will get some boy and the hyde amendment and the most humorless broadcast in history in a second i think first
you guys want to talk about being on the call yesterday introduce that you do want to introduce it
okay you can
talk about it
right so tim and amber
you guys were just a call a secret call yeah i was so secret one hundred people on how many it was broad
and recorded and publicly available yeah i'm really good op's there is five hundred people and one phone call yeah well they said it at aware
some kind of software where you can have like a million observers wow chatter
yeah yeah we used chatter that's like
al qaeda conference call shadow of a lie
excellent scoop actually recorded exile it
but seriously though
like i say like strategy color what planning session about health care right right
it is about medicare for all campaign it's you know in in the early stages but it's moving along really quickly
dino stella set it up and i've been working with add detail and mullahs and ash shack on sort of creating a campaign in a box
and spearheaded by can sing campaign so i've been reaching out to bernie and corbin canvassers who are often times the same people corbin actually brought in a lot of burning canvassers to work on the campaign and we've been sort of
trying to develop
or at least you know fit the canvassing model that they've used to a more campaign
healthcare campaign rather than canada campaign based canvassing model and were also sort of we want to include events it as well which would be essential for people living in rural areas where canvassing may not be as you know as viable but said that you could reach out and
to the national and they could hook you up with a speaker and you know you can set up an event for the community and like a church or whatever new sludge or whatever and they can send someone from maybe physicians for national healthcare labour campaign for single pair and right now we're sort of in beta testing for the canvassing model and philly any spare
trying out different wraps and seeing what works in the actual wraps like when you knock on some was dog
chair sanity and i'll share and then we flip the chair
and then you sit in at the wrong way little know you're serious you know i had around to flip the had around and no kids you know really whip screwed
the idea is that
you know when we get this data back and see what works will have like official the a campaign materials so that any chapter you can call in and say hey i want to canvas and we can send you someone probably from initially the the bernie or and or the club and campaign to train room the people i had a knock on doors
can send you all the official materials
and you know we could just hit the ground running and i will talk about this later when i ran our part on this but i just got back from u k again and honestly like you forget that they're living under a right wing government right now
because they're so on the move and they're so ready and they could be a right wing government for quite some time and it's shitty and their attacks on there in a chair send education and it's a it's a terrible austerity government but they're so optimistic and they're so just working on these projects and i think
and the clients that are really well last week it's not just enough to fight trump we have to actually be working on projects trump is not going to be president forever when she said that i'm sure that our show first not at the waiver can't
yeah he's got the gig of headlining labour conference after they saw that you did our sure yeah
had someone is also on call and yeah and it went really well people were really excited and people are really excited to canvas and stuff and actually find them in can but if you want to one you need to canvass if you know what a kansas or don't want you just know it's farm you know but i prefer to berlin up
by the way i prefer mew slim just the just a little bit though for going to be like training people had a knock on doors you know a little too for all the cameras result there has also my do
oh and you're golden report a ball or move was going to take about two weeks of my men occur intensive knocking on doors
comp canvassing conference strategy session four hundred dollars a day right to a woman monitor care of words on productions are new p o box
i'll be teaching as a nonprofit now we have a new non profit when i you know her personally but i'll be teaching people how to knock on doors like i said to week course four hundred dollars a session
attendance is required if you know you're a member of if you want to keep such drove into the show the disappeared episode or three episode rule and you gotta get a bleep out will you just heard glue years giving away of like that was of
i owe you one hundred correct started with
research going off what you said you just came back from the u k they are still under an austerity government but you're seeing an incredible amount of enthusiasm and optimism about the people who are fighting back i mean they're working so i mean how can we bring that to this cunt
tree
did you find the same level of excitement around this issue of medicare for all i mean there is now the thing is you just literally have to give people something to do will get him there yeah yeah and and people as soon as they hung up all the comments they did a survey after the call and then again we want a canvas so awfully that should be wrong
pretty soon i mean the fight for universal healthcare contains within an all the other parole fights of the big thing that we know was bad that it's fucking everything over but it's hard to maim right like a big structures of things that focus over here is a tangible way to organize your neighborhood and and fight back and not just fight back and the point of resistance but push forward like new
klein said to create something better create something bigger instituting like i am absolutely convinced that american help like america has all the ingredients to have like to be best healthcare program in the entire world full stop
oh and i think refusing to i think calling for anything shorter than that is is is on an ambitious
i'm excited by it so what i'll be doing this i'm going around i'm doing and twenty five talks in the next two months hoo boy
trying to get folks one like talk about what a single pair what is a single payer health care model what does that universal healthcare why do we need these things what do they mean like whoa what are all the concepts kind of bottled than the idea of health justice and and to how do we why should we how do we together
achieve it and i think the canvas model that we talked about medea say call is absolutely the way to cut that because the reason people are like people are often afraid to knock on doors which is wrong like the reason you're afraid to knock on doors is because you are told to be afraid of your neighbor and we have all these artificial divide between austin the people that live literally been next to us most affected
by the same things were affected by yeah i have not been killed by my neighbors once right so why should i feel i've got one hundred percent zero killed rock or yeah total my case
and she got women i'm normal make come in and tell you about healthcare
i'm only canvassing women
because they are most affected by lack of health care and by not knowing that i'm normal
i feel really good about it right
ember talked a lot about what you're seeing the u k which made me really really happy i saw a piece couple days ago in some kinzer our front of the show i think i'd wilkinson posted a piece that she saw about some super right wing rag in the u k all with them while yeah as just as glad man
lad land and wasn't lab that lad
it was rude and no actually you guys are both her it was actually a council fan is
the ruddy gentle but
it was about how jazz is going to be and does
towards it just letting them because they're scared even mother in power they think they're on their heels
and that was pretty cool reading if i ever read up has like that in the u s
that will be a reason to fuck and have a beer
well be really exciting but the i think that worked like there's a lot of divisions that have been working on this for decades and their work is really important and i think we're building off of that in a way that's really energizing and really compelling
yeah we've had represented his
from labour and from the physicians like we really do have a really solid grounding in the people that have already been working on this for a long time all they need is the canvassing army right
we're building a broad coalition armed with both popular support and a moral imperative how know how how tide is this canvassing effort to the bill that is currently being proposed by bernie sanders is it
the template that you guys are going off of when you knock on doors actually we thought about this pretty heavily because we do like the bernie though especially after some pressure from the physicians he expanded and included
a few notes about coverage for all residents but the truth than the matter is and i don't want to suck on the air the room
but that bill might fail
like any number of bills might fail and so we need to have a campaign that is actually based on principles rather than a single bell especially right now under donald trump
so we had like a five point principal base campaign that could be plugged done to any bill as it goes first one was as single program not a patchwork second when it's comprehensive coverage impatient outpatient dental reproductive you know everything
free at the point of service fees no co pays nothing for universal coverage that means like non citizens means residents to and five jobs replacement program for the transition
but anyone knew one of the health insurance who loses their job you're going to retrain you know
while the ceo of a while be on dragged to the theater
it's a relatively small number of people rightly brooding put together his estimate of how do people are actually affected by if insurance companies disappeared tomorrow what what does an industry look like because often go
opponents of a single payer there was an article that was written the other week that was like proponents of single payer healthcare might be interested to learn that the healthcare industry employs a lot of low income women yeah think pisses me off so fucking he will on their shitty terribly the thing pisses me off so fucking much because the implication
one is the insurance industry is just given them jobs because they're black
and it's like they're going to automate those jobs as soon as they can you are pc shit
i'm leading to fuck you over yeah yeah and anyone who likes studies any kind of feminist economics knows that expanding the public sector is the best feminists jobs program there is and that is what this will have to do you realize that the pig or tunes employee the lowest of the irish
i heard one that adds redundant
got booted posits that there's a couple hundred thousand people tops that are affected by by this change over and so there's two things one the american economy terms like churns about a million people per month people that are either laid off or quit their job or retire so like both of those parameters and to bernie is bill
i think it is very strongly allocates up to one percent of the transition period the budget into building programs to retrain people take care of them is called fares called just transition it's good like obviously we're all workers watch watch watch it but his back but it's not like the and white it's not like this always secretly we gotcha here's the achilles heel of the program
come on what i read the thing with does concern me though is bernie his proposal that would require federal mandate for all three these smile
yeah i mean like i'm very pro the sort of expansion of of reproductive health but i'm anti having to show the feeding
amber so embers point about like we bought a push not for individual bill but for a broader movement is spot on this is this is not a one year canvas is not for a single canada had the same time like this bill i think is pretty good one of the things i'm doing when i worked talking a local organizations are like everybody should organize
on this like principles based framework talk to somebody ask him what's the deal with your health care people love to talk about how they're being fucked over by their insurer by the hospital by their employer you can talk to people and like you can build community with people around you
once you have my board for like here's this vision of this thing that they want like the actual ask itself
can change based on where you are one of the things that the new york city chapter dia say socialists feminist working together was the idea of and rolling folks in the at the door on medicaid if they're eligible there's millions of folks that are eligible but not and world and medicaid like there's like medicaid isn't the answer but like in rolling your neighbor who is eligible for medicaid is
great way to like help somebody out if you're in a state where you've got one senator that endorsed bernie's bill or one rep that endorsed connors bill but others haven't you can lobby them to endorse the movement or sound like a norquist like pledge saying they will back a a federal single pair you can tailor the individual ask based upon your context i'm actually a really really want to learn
oh what those contacts are across the us because the situation is fighting for health care in kansas city and iowa city and minneapolis and western connecticut are all very very very different moments or that looks like a building the community and building a relationship and building that unilateral demand for universal single payer healthcare is what will get
us through the next six years i were going to talk about it a little bit with the
chip
expiring but it's kind of interesting i mean amber brought up how in the u k like they're and are brutally austere in terrible right wing government but there's all this energy and there have been sustained a on the n h s from both parties there for meant for many years
but it is kind of interesting how they're able to rally defense for a program that is universal is directly visible in their lives compared to you know how ridiculous is that we have chip this thing that millions of kids health insurance is probably save tons of lives but it has an expiration date
that we have the solutions that are sort of sticking their fingers and the dams a market that can never work because the problem is is the market that have all these timetables that have all these expiration dates that are international yeah heads might stop getting sick that's true that's true we have said the problems are going to stop
i'm becca ready for that will know you're right like one of the so what is chip and what would you like it's going to be it's going to buy their don't allow it to expire first of all but could you explain what it is right so chip as a supplementary health insurance program for low income kids low income kids means under two hundred percent of the federal federal poverty level not seen a lot of winners there
this video is on or not
i think it should be allowed low low energy good yeah
it covers right now i think nine million kids back in nineteen ninety seven two thousand and three percent of low income kids were without health insurance entirely and one really pernicious then i actually have peace coming out and jack been i think tomorrow that i mention this on is that like america as a specific perversity a specific disease where we can inflate the idea of insurance and the idea of healthcare
we kind of use those things unilaterally because in america your access to getting help is dependent upon your ability to pay and so like
there's like a chip provides health insurance for kids but she also provides a lot of models for prenatal care it as a strong start program
where women that are are people that are pregnant that are marginalized and like are in trouble can go to weigh it offers like a social work model of prenatal care will just super fucking good like there's one of the biggest successes i think of of of chip is this prenatal care model there just there was a myth for a law
long time the idea of the crack baby
that poor woman worst most of woman of color were smoking crack and therefore their kids were being born with deformities were born being born early wrong like smoking crack is probably not great for a fetus but it's less bad as buying cigarettes the problem was lead paint the walls people are being people are like being pregnant and people are being born in substandard housing and that
with bad nutrition and that's fucking them up right away said there are still tons of apartments in new york full of lead paint i'm pretty sure i live in one of them added
what don't get pregnant trying my best
we will give us idea and america have like finding separating the where the from unworthy pour the idea that somewhere out there someone's getting a free ride and because this person might exist and if they do i don't give a shit fuck it but because this person might exist we need to like build this super complicated patrick of programs which creates gap through which people like pork
fall through chip was created to try to like it was like staple a canvas over our
one of those gaps one of the while one of those biggest gaps
it is a discretionary fund bill which means it's it's funding as up is up for debate every couple of years it was reauthorize in two thousand nine two thousand and thirteen two thousand and fifteen what does not like up the funding it for like a long term plan it's been it's been a little up a little volleyball and the most recent reconciliation period ended without a chippy author
relations so under the current funding proposal funding will run out
by the end of the year and because this has a program that said it split a block grant oh it's a different kind of block grant might a gram cassidy shit this is a block grant that the feds have often put more money into when that was running a deficit is because taking care of people that are poor people that are sick isn't profitable
because it has a block grant states are on the hook for that part for a large part of the funding and because of that a lot of states are now i utah was the first one out at the gates are now filing to scale back there are moments create more in positions for receiving care or ultimately withdraw entirely from the program and truly fucked up and i was born i was talking to my partner this morning
felt like was a problem of of malevolent or a problem of incompetence and fundamentally i think the answer is it doesn't matter
it's to like to sew naked lady value the lives of nine million kids made fun of this is an act of class war and an act of race war right this is explicitly hurting poor kids and mostly poor kids of color poor families of color
this is explicitly an act of of of
a race and class war and so whether it latest couldn't get it in in time because they were too busy jerking off but cassidy gram or
they actively plan that to do this although orrin hatch who wrote the bill with ted kennedy
and some assistance
hillary clinton
renovation part of the show hillary clinton
my mother
or and hatch so ago there's that there's a deal coming through they're going to pass it can be a five year extension or whatever but like i don't fucking care where as well
now like it's enough to like it reminds me of the and like dhaka rollback right now you got a bunch of kids they're like living in fear of being deported having their families harmed and i've got a bunch of kids loving and fear of like not be able to get health care and people pay for healthcare you've got parents that are fuckin be afraid for their kids' lives you even have kids do get insurance with the which is one of the proposals to
solid an interim they're going to get higher risk of of preventable disease lower standard of living and there are still vulnerable to a publisher that happens around them all these social determinants that that that make health worse and are pregnant woman parents are you pregnant people are gonna fuckin suffer worst of all it's it's abominable and
i i i don't know why it didn't pass this is a fucking this is a gimme everyone looks good when you pass chip is passed without us in support of retirements come up so i don't know why this happened
in a year of naked betrayals of government responsibility to people this is another one of them i don't know if it's the most naked because a lot of well out a badge it's happen in puerto rico's happening at the same time
but there is no there is no mitigation of this if they pass another bill tomorrow to fund it with the fact that it took that long as still an abomination
i'm pretty mad she said
that they're all part of the same thing this is the field testing the new model whereby they're rolling back the number of people who are going to count as full citizens
who are owed anything because they see something coming on the horizon in terms of
catastrophic climate change and
lack of resources and they know it's going to get to be lifeboat time and they want to be they want to keep that boat as small as possible
my center from my former state my home state of wisconsin around johnson was speaking to a group of students amazing
the idea for that yeah
has shortened brutal
oh okay
there's primordial watch
do you consider food or right
consider calling i consider shelter right
what we have his rage
life liberty and shoot happiness
hash that point we have the right to freedom
half said point everything else is is a limited resource
we have to use our opportunity given to us when we can for those things look health care housing food these are not rights and privileges and they're there they are scarce resources and they go to the people who deserve them
that is basically taught a logically defined as the people who can already afford them brad johnson inherited a fucking used car dealership if i recall correctly right now now now he married into a rich family for all and even in college and got money to start construction business from his in laws anton sugar voice
later earlier the in the family joke
okay so that that's the healthcare update health scare update for this week but up for move onto our reading series to out the show tim
plug a way yes we are first off
bernice bill is a thing that exists wars auto discussion of a piece coming out and jakob and tomorrow or go through it thoroughly also have a new pod cast that me and my partner collegial put together she's a healthcare lawyer and she's much all the smart things that i say it is things that she texts week before as a them we've a pod cast called have a medical where we go through a white pay
paper on health care policy a current issue health care policy and the metal album that we both like and so off in the past week we went through futile protection laws which are extremely heinous there are ways to for example if if it turns doctors and the cops they will they might drug test a woman if she
apartment person if they show signs of having a drug and system that person then goes to jail and shackled what they give birth
for attempted genocide
you have cases of of of people trying to kill them
china get an abortion not being able to get one than being indicted for tempted photos side trying to kill themselves being locked up forced to give birth and then dying after all the individual problems of patriarchal capitalism misogyny racism trans phobia and basically when you don't have a robust health care est be carswell state fills the gaps those all live with
philip protection laws kid he has written a lot of research on with that we talk about that and we go through our bernie's bill really really a thoroughly both the good parts the parts of need improvement and then really what comes next so it's called having met a call that was the metal album the metal album us because of older locks not suffered which is a we have no nazis know rapists policy which is surprisingly difficult
for metal music
but this will others weeks as collateral ox not suffered which is a norwegian kind of grungy our garage metal band i think a fucking it kicks ass the very friendly and let us use him an album facebook before that it was sacrilege which is like a female fronted slayer from the eighties
same time as a slayer i think a lot better before that was a serious on goal which is extreme nurtured music about wizards and fire and bullshit and it was good to sell also i've got that it's good
recently beat out politicos nerd pardon pod pod cast of the fuck it's called and their guest most and the higher dealer pod cast for kingdoms number ninety eight mother fuckers compared to the one or two so where their bosses now
and my only goal is to grind them into dust
and can snort lines of their broken bodies so i've got that going on and then also i'm hitting the road as said before if you live anywhere between new york city lexington kentucky minneapolis or boston kind of in that promise i might be in your city in the next three months so come talked about half the with it it'll be fun
just tell if you're looking for music done by you know
the black metal done by like a good good regular guy there was this guy leg of org versions
check
you criteria yeah in a normal guy good good habits

logging new guys the last time we talked to a man chooses lifeguards last thing she was on the show we did a reading series from i think it was definitely her most evil column today are your number that is the one in which he said use the grinned fell tower fire incident to say basically
you can never blame landlords or lax regulations for it easily preventable disaster like this because if things were different the people might have died another way
that's not an exaggeration know is he's not even that building fires because they might kill baby hitler that is the article that nearly got be taste by campus
that the libertarian butterfly and maybe i don't know like this one for some reason for this
get mad because it's that evil it's just so with all the last owners are most evil column she's ever in this one is the most pointless column ever written
not just her not the most pointless shing she's over written it may be the most pointless thing ever written by a name is being to write this we need the clear blue third a medium post this is the facebook wall thing she got right this let's let's dive into this now because this column is extraordinary this is an opinion section
bloomberg view again
the the title of the article by megan mcardle is why is italian food so
oh yeah
know allies
a crush it on
well as the cod
we talked a while to have a little girl
a burning to death is is a necessity for a free society and also let's talk nash
the sub head here is new yorkers know the rest of the us deserves a taste of what the italian diaspora brings with it by megan mcardle and before i even begin you know
i'm from new york the shows based out of brooklyn there's a lot of good italian food here listeners of the show elsewhere in the country
is there anywhere broadly speaking in america that italian food has penetrated it now
italian food size making it
every everywhere has like fine italian cuisine you get your dominoes you going to papa john's old guard
i commas live as alina really a tiny little town and the town outside of the had a small italian restaurant and been like their yeah that was an indiana video to
a smattering of people are just like if you're listening to this now as a listener you're not in new york or you're from another place in america that's maybe doesn't have as many italians historically just think to yourself like is there an italian restaurant near me is there an italian food
okay
already has one of the five basic kinds of foods that and sandwiches
let let's dive and i'm going to read the whole thing because i i don't want anything to you go to waste here
okay
meghan begins a down new york city my birthplace seventeen somebody said
new york city my birthplace is ring to by italian neighborhoods go to staten island to the bronx to long island or to new jersey it doesn't matter where you go as long as it's within fifty miles of the empire state building with that within that fortunate circle you will find that you are always reasonably close to
a neighborhood or at least the street from a little stores and restaurants of unprepared posing appearance and fantastic cohen achievement tragically such neighborhoods are a blessing of erratic and patently unfair geographic distribution so she's she sighed you about stalin style population transfers of a town
that you'll get over that
what news
do tell them more rob
those you keep them in all black
a chef
spicy meatball you you can build the boots and go in and help you
the first thing we can sort of were kind of see what's coming if you're familiar with mcardle but the one sentence i want to highlight and the first paragraph that she says it doesn't matter where you go as long as you within a fifty miles the empire state building
i don't know there's just something about that phrase or i can't quite describe her raiding it's so weird what does she and i mean that's not even true
we called the pizza but i think was it extends way up farther and farther north of used to see i were i'm i'm putting myself in the mcardle mindset and i think when she wrote that said and she was imagining what are those cold war era diagrams of what would happen if a hydrogen bomb exploded over manhattan and she was like toyota the chef and
pizza box
anger is radiating at it it immediately style guess what do you get the central new jersey and again
there's no time to spare we have to do this whole thing in the rest of the country the quality of the presumed seems to be directly proportional to the number of hand crafted keep display cases and also to the elevation of your heart way when you view the price posted inside those case what sense of what's censored
what that's right in writing
writing style but his so she's saying that the pursuit oh is proportionally to as good as nervous as you give because it
it's expensive odessa in italian neighborhoods by contrast he older and more scuffed linoleum the bearer that badly plaster walls the more tattered the appearance of the single nineteen fifty six mass card taped into the cash register by way of decoration the more likely you are to discover the single best piece of shark eatery you have ever
you know what that was one sentence that was one she likes to talk about metrics
appears as of i don't think that that is an empirical club know making the things you one again adopting the mcardle mine said she was thinking of one one establishment in her head that she goes to she just whatever double fish cheap person
it's like every time she presses her space key like a little bit of ether blue
oh eyes
you know why period but he go
unlike some enclaves that develop good restaurants in markets as they gentrified italians do not need to seek outbid food as a way of expressing with they have arrived financially and socially italians are already there
not socially
being a cheerful and kind people are willing to it
i
going again she's thinking of the pizza
the had finally be guy
well it started about a good officer bed of its that's already caves that your guys were going to be some very very broadly sketched ethnic stereotypes coming up an eye and check it out
i wish we had ever on
bizarre that is and you can be we with e g you done one seed with the police are scum
consider your score
the
you see how you scum i appreciated this a new well on vacation
having spent years in a food desert in washington dc that's fucking and true and
i had boss burger
that said she got this world view is by going to dc were like everyone just mumbles and you never get where you ordered and people as confusing questions like do you want brown sugar on your burger
will make you a libertarian
she goes i was practically weeping over the ease with which one could secure a decent pizza
am not the only americans who have noticed that everything tastes really and know that's not just because you're on vacation and surrounded by charming ancient buildings you may notice the few accounts of vacations in reykjavik or dublin begin with the food was amazing quality of produce in italy is in fact much better because italians the man
better and haven't gotten their hands on better ingredients they prepare them with the care of their treasure were reserve so you're saying better better
you say that she's getting paid thousands of dollars to the right one hundreds of words the boiled out better ingredients to say papa johns i have to say i don't ever will be accused of defending d c but there is good food and dc it is like ethiopian or yemeni yeah they have good ethiopian food pretty well
also didn't have that when megan was growing up
bush's from new york
like any accepted this why people
she went this is just a noxious kid who came back from a study abroad and they'll only like it
they are just then
can i can i do and i always got later with a huge dad zach well as he continues it's not clear why italians have such an amazing array of exquisite regional dishes nora why they have held out so fanatically against the bland defying forces of modern commercial food processing week which i support wholeheartedly there's a libertarian we can guess that the room
an empire probably had something to do with the empires facilitate trade in exotic food stuffs enrich imperial barons absolutely chefs who dedicate considerable ingenuity to finding the best possible
he should have been there are they didn't have tomatoes or past
fucking talking about everyone want to go in empire drink like fucking a wine and barry and not slurry for every meal and as abraham thing as of grain best condom it was fermented fish guts and they fucking they had the duluth or wine with water up they were savages
the end of an empire encourages culinary genius yeah that's why we have the famous english cuisine
classics such as you know sunday boil
eat swan the only the queen was allowed to eat swan and now it's legal and like the races thing they say it's all the polls and irish travellers are sneaking in eating the swamp
that's so far but i looked up like oh what a swan actually taste like and like by all accounts just absolutely because it tasted like ship
most consistent description i found was fishy money delicious that sounds so good i had beatles someone want a highway
get they didn't get the defining things i wanted to highlight the highlights anymore they didn't get the defining elements of italian cuisine tomatoes or pastor to hundreds of years after the roman empire fell and again he is such a just a also read the jack of in peace
for commentary modernism everything we invented delicious like eighty years ago that they know everything before that he knows nothing of this is what's funny about the first half of this paragraph for she says like we can guess that the roman empire late know you can
she's she's guessing at this but like there hasn't been like a probably thousand book sorry and know like the history of italian food she shows arguably the oldest cookbook in the world dates to the roman empire and it is reasonable to suppose that after the empire collapsed it's canary influence lingered around the citizenry and here are literally mesopotamia cocoa
note on the i remembered fish guts that as the roman empire point and mcardle she says in parentheses at the end of this paragraph though it's worth noting that italian cuisine as we know it today evolve with the arrival of new world foods
what why make a paragraph before that and if you get a critically did not destroy your diaphragm it's moving along with next next next that is going to shit his pants it alone
yeah i was said
they said about italian food but her her just fender a idiocy is so if a guy's a child has wandered into demands enclosure
run a dependent
just again
like every paragraph it just which is gear another thought goes into your head she's like you know it's reasonable for me to write this is sort of what she said she's an mean so she goes along growing season also homes without vegetables are abundant herbs there are only so many possible variations on hunk of me piece of fish
egg or things you can make for milk again this is another parent that a gold she goes it's not an accident that the northern reaches of europe are little fame for coronary excellent assessment
interesting and appealing local specialties tend to be either cheeses or some kind of alcohol those things are gay
she's booth rule yeah cheeseburgers and brad are fantastic i was like fuck fucking watch and any more dana any were once in awhile go to like denmark and like this is the best and current never had the colonel kind of digests ideas
it's jack in the box or just in and they come out sort of fully formed but unlike a soupy shit that fills your toilet and leaves a permanent stain and it's like she starts up by going well you know we can guess that julius caesar was known to eat spaghetti and meatballs
throw a pizza pie in the air because empire is implicitly good and then supported the iraq war
it
actually that he didn't have those but you get my point
to what i it's already get a little forget that ten minutes bruges leave the stain or brown ring around in my mind forever
fresh again your brain toilet flushing again the brains are moving onto the next paragraph again ironically the tenacity and abundance of italian food culture may also be a trip in an the tenacity
you've got to failed to succeed
the as and all the haters all these haters try to put keep italian food down it may also be attributable in part to the intense reasonable strafe that followed the roman empire and the poverty of italy's long decline of reddit go away
period of money and the opposite of that's okay good
as my colleague as my hobby tyler
cowan
that was another a complete know nothing shithead as my colleague tyler cowen at the george mason school for orphans study
and experimentation in studies as noted in his a marvelous book an economist gets lunch
readings next up on our readings
economists a very thought of reading that book
i'd rather have it every day off the
the i'm clicking through the hyper link to the books paid
kill myself if you do a leading your car
kill myself
to tourniquet this fucking living room with the been why i was told by that and black
no getting away with this
tyler cowen notices that in places that industrialized early mask commercial canning and television proceeded to technological and logistical innovations that made it easy for us to get decent produce your in those places hungry and relatively poor people developed a taste or at least tolerance for bland process food made power
well by lashings of sugar and fat then came television which favorite meals that can be eaten one handed in front of a screen that's her that's why she thinks food became this you summarize with him
he sit on the that's when she thinks food got bad so if your culture
a pre exit preexisting pretty existed and came before television and mess agriculture you still have good food was and if you had it afterwards then you're just used to shit and it was watching tv and either way why did one hand for to watch him to you because you're jerking off and the price is right
she also says and women moving into the workforce which favorite anything that can he can quickly
thanks to its relative poverty italy came to these things late and at a time when global food supply chains are improving so italians held onto a food culture the price care and taste over efficiency and ability to withstand a hardship and process all these things are probably part of the explanation but they cannot be all of it because why
almost a century after the great wave of italian immigration ended or italian american still noticeably better fed than say they're irish american parents are
i'm already fat boy ah fuck it made jokes about leg irish food but that's just because we don't like the people if you go there and they have great brad they're fantastic lamb i mean they have like five meals but like a good five hate the man british talking about watch these on
the all these are the most on the provable assertions and the history of the problem is her ray science is inaccurate right that's right it's not like now like us accuracy
on the ground or is as the anthropologist are fond of telling us culture is a mystery is now an anthropologist
opposite of
just tell us i quit
just like megan did two things wall just mainline can mean and writing this article she watched the godfather so she sees the same were clemens is like a fork in pussy
look over to the meat sauce your fucking ivy league pussy and then was like oh italians have a great food culture and then she watch the third indiana jones movie and music while he was an archaeologist all that
anthropologists same thing just didn't know there was a holy grail
you through those two ideas work together
and here's a call and get paid three hundred and fifty thousand to who knows of the votes going on in the world and the pelicans be evans
anthropologists tell us that culture is the emergence of millions of individual decisions so we cannot replicate italian food culture we can only try to figure out how to lead as many people as possible free ride on their cultural labour
here's here's how it gets really at this is where this is where she begins also think
it at home and the other thing is that she's complaining italian american immigrants with italians the throws a whole thing off and destroys their entire yeah okay new york yeah she like eating like squinting a fuckin pasta and she is literally paulie walnuts when he goes the naval as i can i get them
because new york has more than his fair share of italian cuisine
perhaps some denizens of a town or neighborhood of a certify of the italian american character will take pity on more bearing holiday or he climbs again mcardle grew up in new york
little italy is now two blocks down and you know what i'm sorry i i like the chinese food is just chinatown i don't like their i mean are there real like an alien never really not really an airline
i will take you to a pork store that i but they're not a crowd gardens and someplace and yeah right
the best fucking an italian place in new york and martin and his is in i guess it's and clinton hill like things matter
there's a ton of like actual of l a n shit like upstate to
in may and and
boston which has east them
in rhode island which is like night and lap
a great italian restaurant on the pacific garbage barge
continuing but has there been a fantastic
today it's a restaurant operating out of chris christie's neck for
oh my god the bread
wow while you just said
i mean his folds created natural use it
of course he continues of course without a critical mass the food culture will dissipate into a sea of oreo o's and taker taught rules so we need it
we fight we need at least a few thousand i don't like either
least a few thousand to move en masse this is where it gets really interesting which reminds me if only we could spread french cuisine the same way but since america has pitifully few recent french immigrants this may require some sort of special visa program
towns
just okay
get a rest is these the last three graphs their short but this is rick it's truly special because megan is proposing in her mind a solution don't think i have a be to which have made a problem of the not being enough italian
these us three hair grabs i just want to say if you're easily offended or shark don't look at what i'm about to do myself
excuse me
here we go towns could even entice italian food related businesses
tax abatements and special grants enabling to relocate their linoleum their mass cars and their battered still display cases it's a new homes of in the great american food desert no know you put it a cube of hair gel and a wife beater underneath a box with a stick on ace way to they were
wander in and then he said surroundings and the world
dying of opiate
going to fucking catastrophic climate change in misery and people are killing themselves the time it just all these small towns like indiana jones the rose bowl a larger gonna be like is so we're going three billion dollars into debt to get some pursued
here we we began the episode talking about the terrible problem of health care and like the lack of health care in this in this country and megan i'm sure she's written about health care before about how that's not actually a problem she's written dozens of color columns about how why like it's the lack of everyone can just go to emergency room
in her mind it's a lack of italian deli in the great american food desert there's a problem that the government through tax abatements what's she what's stalin did to the nation of chechnya
the war two she wants to do with italian neighborhoods in the east coast and just put them on fucking cattle cars out to the great american food desert as she describes it in bed but no she wants to lure the greed has to learn them with tax abatements because she's a libertarian keep includes by saying this may seem a little extreme to you must thousands of our fellow
citizens of earth themselves simply to improve the food culture elsewhere to even ask such a question demonstrates how dire the problem is if you cared about food properly which is to say as much as italians you already be recruited in and around new york but it just her whole part before that was the political culture is
this yes syria not be able a million things and how what
there are the result of like when you're a mass culture interacts with like agricultural innovations and canning and television i think you're on charitably reading her interpretation of culture i think she's saying it's it's that when the moon it's your on
that's where you have to start if you want to start to study or spread but it's like does it doesn't the government already have a program where they relocate strong very close to culinary really gifted italian families to the midwest under new name
i guess it doesn't work me
okay so that's meghan ricardo literally the most pointless thing ever and i'm going to kill you
in say however however i was there is like a nugget of something interesting their the first layer is that this is what people like megan mcardle think are actual problems in america
like i said we began this by introducing wish she doesn't think is a problem is like a few hundred people dying in a deregulated fire trap or let's say that millions of people don't have health care can't afford it that's not a problem to her and what is the fact that not enough people get excellent shark eatery in places with cracked linoleum and mass cards on all
tiny registered that's just fetish just fetish icing i want a place that she however what's also interesting we've talked before about how conservatives had this idea about like unemployment and shit and problems is economically depressed areas in america is that people should just move but they also like blacks on constantly about the important
like community and like being rooted in the ice and how important that is so i mean like i've been the last one who's to say what you should do displacement is good for poor people down yeah so again megan just sort of like was like boy i like italian food
write a column on it
again it's just like the grinding pain reality of her prose and the just sheer idiocy of her thought process us really i think makes or one of a kind and
every show now will just be reading or all the miners should learn to throw pizza
to be then because i'm going to fucking die
i will die if you're doing this sort of food
felix is oh he's hung himself
oh well
