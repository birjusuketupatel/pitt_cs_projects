java it's go we're back that's your toronto earth
for would date world you'd probably listening to this
was just dive right into it obviously
we're here now
probably like
the big thing this week that we have to talk about profligate to spend most of the shows are going about his the this tax bill that's winding its way through the halls of government headed to the president's desk
and is surely going to basically i know just performed the final queue to draw whatever is left of i don't know
america our civil society
i wish i had something funny to say or something more uplifting but like this is just this is all bad and the thing that i said earlier this week when it looked like it was going to pass is
just to me like just the hallmark of just like a defeated culture and society they just seem like pretty much worn out by this and like the class war is over and i feel like the bad guys one and as tax bill is the culmination of probably thirty to forty years of the right when movement in this
it is thoroughly chip away at the welfare state
just transfer more and more of society's wealth and to fewer and fewer hands and they've pretty much done it yeah
i mean like look this thing was always going to pass it was always going to pass because you know the five respected resistance republicans they suck out of the same teeth as senator fuck in ceremony sam from texas so those donors told them they had the passes because what does
even the point of a republican president or congress if you can't pass this piece of shit it's their last ditch effort and wealth transfer so last ditch effort in beating down people so much they can't even stand up said oh you know what rightfully so they said the democrats could have done more they could have always done more but the thing is the only birth of that
stop this fucking thing is steven paddock had a season ticket pass the congressional softball i'm serious that's the only way because
no man nomad no level of congeniality your phone calls or anything means as much to susan collards as donor money nothing means as much as a post retirement speaking gig or fuckin no work book or whatever the fuck you flake is going to do those to him
yeah and that's so sobering to see because the the thought oh this was the of as the was well yeah they want to work for their donors obviously because they need to be able to fund their campaigns but at the same time there are certain things they can't do at the risk of inciting popular opposition that would overcome even a while
funded campaign but these these just fuckin took a fire hose piss on the third rail of politics here cutting medicare medicaid go on go on whole hog the saying yes we're transferring wealth from port the poorest people the fucking contrary to the richest people on earth in the history of earth that we're going to give them even more than they've ever had and you would think
why wouldn't they be afraid of the reaction of that but clearly they have made the calculation that having their donors
at their back and giving them money is more important to securing and maintaining power than actual voters
because they've clearly done the work and are continuing to do the work of gerrymandering and voter suppression and democracy demoralizing people that that competitive elections are sort of going away and as such the only thing that's going to matters whether you have the money to sort of outgun whatever yahoo honda dealer with a fuck
confederate flag tattoo on his forehead who runs against you in the primary because that's the only thing you have to worry about i'm in we'll see i feel like when a is coming in i kind of looked at the world around me during to those sixteen and a year i take a very on scientific method and i look at you know how much money but
spending on this or how much how much money net flicks is going in debt and you look around and you see this bubble fake cheap credit rolling around the same thing that we saw from two thousand three to two thousand and eight and you know that's the kind of green economy we had we had a jobless recovery for the two thousand and eight recession and we
we solve the bleeding by just shooting a thirty wrote not of fake money on everything where there's nothing actually created values just declared and things are willed into existence by ten figures debt that mean nothing to private enterprise and it's totally unsustainable
and i thought that maybe one of the silver linings with tromp was that the crash was always going to come and if it came under hillary we would get like a wave of competent horrible blood and soil fascists very quickly two years and but now with the tags taxable i feel like they've sort of took an happy pad or a test
oster earn an adrenaline shot and just jammed into this on the economy so we'll see maybe the crash comes a year later than it does maybe it comes in two thousand and twenty i don't know what happens when that does but while we're on borrowed the belief structured that the tax hikes are you know people making under like one hundred grand a year or whatever going to kick in
in two or three years so if the democrats do get the ways as twenty twenty altar of shithead supporters raise my taxes yeah it was it got advantages raise taxes
oh it's like i like these
then and the people who love this and they're like
do feel like you the government's money so much why don't you just give them more than what you pay in taxes or whatever like a more money in my pocket they're talking about four hundred dollars right
and i worked like four hundred dollars on one side weighed against like the entire infrastructure of like american civil society that's just being
did any just trash also what the fuck do you think the government is going to spend that on they'll instantly buy a new punisher de gaulle for it
then are going to give four hundred dollars for the poorest person you fucking moron and here's here's the thing going gonna use it to air brush rex tiller since fucking pussy that lives in is now
jared a new high chair
oh and anything that's actually good with the shit heads in charge and it was obama they would have would have been like a new gift machine for the white queen
all our a lot of people last cheese so this is crazy how know there's never really been any meaningful congressional action on climate change even though the evidence for its is serious impending threat is pretty clear and i think that this bill is really the biggest piece of climate change legislation or
going to see this is the way for the wealthiest among us to get enough fucking money that they can create the private infrastructures to survive whatever catastrophes coming the fucking bio dome is with laser dogs guarding the doorways and fucking moon basis for were fucking on musk it jack off it
outer space and watch the not get into a gravitational fucking field around the moon or whatever and that's what the money is going to go towards it's going to go to their nice private army is fucking helicopters because they're not going be roads anymore it's going to be like fuck it rio de janeiro
and they need as much money as they can before it all all the fucking wheels come off and this is where how they can get it but the newspaper that just business will publish inside leads him it's to be really good
oops on the baron trump administrative democracy dies within the earth's atmosphere
a slow on ilan mosque and rick and morty your brain waves at each other it's going to be fucking epic well here's the thing like you know it's not it's it's like this is a tax bill but it's so much more than that
is
as i said like a thirty to forty your combination of what the right wing
the their their donors and the billionaires in this country like the the coax for the murders or whatever have been working for which is a fundamentally like restructuring of american society that just leaves the vast majority of people just almost completely naked and vulnerable and and like i said this is why feels like we're living in
we lost a war or something like this is a lake well we did yeah yeah and they did it in like two weeks which is frankly i'm president that's impressive hazy but they got mike flynn for making a phone call too early
did it or dumbest man in america is going to be mildly inconvenienced or three months we did it i mean the the example that someone brought up that i think is a good one is what this is now like the country writ large what sam brownback that to kansas so he became governor a couple of years ago when you know arthur laffer advised him
how to like you know this is the old trickle down like just tax cuts will create revenue or pay for themselves and what he did was just blow a fucking the whole of the state budget and it was a disaster and there's something wrong or is doing and own or here they're going to now they're blowing a hole through our entire country's budget and like but the thing is like that's it's intended to do
yeah and it's intended to do that because as met said
right after the going past is tax bill next on the chopping block social security and medicare they were privatized both of those are going to cut him to the bone why because there's no money we don't have any money
it really helps to graze a we just put a trillion dollars money just a literal transfer a trillion dollars to the wealthiest people in this country and there's all the sudden worth the money go we can't do anything oh my god there's also many many provisions in his tax bill that are directly attack education both public and higher i mean
there's another orrin hatch orrin hatch put in a tax credit for if you send your kid to religious school so if you're looking to start a new taliban don't worry the government is looking out for you now i believe
exactly but i believe like this bill
deductions for like all higher education except for hillsdale college in michigan which is like that guy he's in a school that literally let's kevin d williamson be an honorary professor well they're the only one that invite him in
ecologists should be
they've got taken out but it was so funny it's like okay i'm the equivalent of that is in hyde park the neighborhood i grew up in barack obama
he is i'm in
there is the hotel health food store called monsanto and it's a terrific story it has all types of juices and amino acids and there's like a painting of jesus christ within a half row with the background is the milky way to juices the cosmos is
during that the stimulus bill
this village it's like we're is in the marginal tax rate on all income and bone half a million dollars to seventy five percent and we're giving tax credit to bomb santa fe i'm fifty third street and hyde park that so brazen it is but they don't give a shit and what's great is you know that sake mall harris does when or fucking curse can ran her you know
al franken john conyers super ticket wins and two thousand and twenty they will immediately work with the shit heads on fixing the budget deficit is will take them at their word about being the deficit hawks again at all only all i did grand bargain what was so amazing is that i honestly don't think that the republicans even understood how much things have changed in terms of accountable
to be totally destroyed but by the fracturing of the electorate by people tuning out or becoming hyper partisan and not caring about details because remember the beginning of the year it was paul ryan who convinced trump we got repeal obamacare before we do the tax cut because we're gonna need to have a justification for we're going to be able to say that we're paying for the tax cut with the savings
from getting rid of obama care that was his argument and then they tried it and they couldn't they couldn't get it to go and then there there were just like oh we can just do it anyway
and no one actually gives a shit about the trillion dollars that we're adding to the holy fuck like they didn't even fucking realize how far things have gone and now they do that are fucking kick him through the door the realizing the wood is completely rot
the only thing that bears
underlining about all of this is like i feel like right after the election like when we recorded are right after the election year zero show it was like in the pit of my stomach like you knew this was coming because like the right has power in this country
what they're going to do because they understand power and power is about maintaining power and taking away the power of your enemies the democrats do not do that when they're in charge and i think it bears
contrasting what the republicans are doing with their house and senate and white house versus what the democrats did in two thousand and eight and two thousand and these fucking pussies had a provision in obama care that people did sign up to vote when they went to changes and they fucking took it out because they're afraid it would look to fucking partisan
he met with a fucking head of all the big five bags and will the say with something like you know
what could do
take or your free lunch
i'm not looking to take where the dog gyro
i mean to amazing but it's like it's not that they're naive
they don't give a hit
that's why that they don't want the things that they say they want they don't want the things that their voters want their job is basically managing the expectations of people who they have no interest in actually seeing a having their lives may better and that was what obama years proved yes they do have a congenital sorkin
ass fetish for comedy and procedure and that is built into the liberal world view and a way that isn't the conservatives and that does stop them because they are do genuinely believe that they have internalized lot of the area but part of the reason they have internalized that is because that is part of the mechanism that keeps them from ever actually fuck
accomplish i have irreconcilable with actual actual ideology that you believe in to the extent that you going to do whatever it takes to pass legislation that fills that now
we're talking about like when people want to talk about the limited successes of the first two years of the obama presidency people will say well hey they had sixty votes but to those guys like max baucus lieberman they were basically they were being held hostage by these conservative democrats but that's because they they they all agreed that they are
we're going to go by the rules were they're gonna need sixty for everything but if you have fifty one people in the senate and the neighbor talked about certainly never talked about when democrats in power if you have fifty one people in the senate you can basically do anything you want read did that at one point and mcconnell famously did in order to get course i've gotten the supreme court right yeah but they won't do it
they'll do it now with legislation yeah they'll they won't do it with legislation even though they could yeah they could have passed with fifty one votes they had the votes for a public option they are the votes for car check which would have doubled union membership in the private sector in a country and they had the votes for the dream
two thousand and ten would have happened how did you think that to the sixteen would have happened if card check went through know but they you know what they don't want to hold on the house really really want oh god no the responsibility of actually holding power is so fucking bad because it threatens all of the members of leadership because then the expectations are made that they can't they have
no interest in actually fucking following through on and that is that's attention that has to be resolved some way and the best way is to lose one of those who we don't have to worry about it anymore but you don't to have to say though yes if they've done that if they'd random everything through they would have been called a crazy radicals who didn't care about democracy and rammed things through it
undemocratic fashion and as we know because they were so careful with the obama care stuff they didn't get called that by republicans for eight years
not worth doing it
i gained a lot of good will in good faith from their opponents by being that responsible the party elected a guy who got into politics by saying that he was born in kenya they don't give a shit they don't these fucking cock suckers even after the past the past this insane bill
bill on par with the to mayor government any authoritarian vote democratic government this scene wealth transfer to beat down everyone there were like yeah about obama care was passed kind of late at night they don't give a shit because they know what even the fucking national review cox they know what politics is about well i think i just want to read here from leader
or of the senate democrats chuck schumer his his reply
it's anti semitic present are generally speaking when he goes up there it is like the biggest tragedy of this bill is that are below good friends with battle thrall for him
i like it in order to retire from chechnya
he said about the tax bill he says he treated tonight i feel mostly regret what could have been tax rock you tax reform is an issue that is ripe for bipartisan compromise there is sincere desire on this side of the i also work with the g o p particularly on tax reform
but we have been rebuffed time and time again
he's right about that because their last wants this fucking fail to have their daughters want less taxes on their ill gotten game as much as republican donors do so there is bipartisan support for it it's just they want they want a couch it make it make it more middle class friendly but at the end they both have a vested interest in
seeing a massive wealth transfer to the to the upper percentages but the republicans have the numbers and why bother with these arsenals when we can just get everything and then get all the fucking build money because we could actually get things done
also in the democrats response to the tax bill
i'm not kidding
the senate democrats social media arm their social know put out the use any videos of ronald reagan passing more they also
this it you fucking as yields of bipartisanship and it's like partisanship is why the republicans controlled visually branches again there is no more bipartisanship they're going to elect a fucking pedophile you don't know what what were the means i i just like ronald reagan
you're here comes that boy and he's spilling arms all over all over a bunch of nicaraguan controls not forget the fact that reagan's fat tax cuts that they're lauding because there were bipartisan set the stage for thirty years of wealth redistribution upward am fucking stagnation of wages for actual working people that lets hundred
all started reading about fucking chart that was the first starving of the beast that's where the kansas blueprint came from you fucking moron where do you think arthur laffer made his bones one more thing
has party leader nancy pelosi queen
distract the tax word with a crying emerge face
you are born in the middle of world war one shut the fuck off
your friends with the lindbergh baby
iraq
so tell us how this tax bill makes you feel three of oh geez or less as karl bear had a blog posts i thought it was very important where he pointed out that this whole incident prove conclusively that incremental case for incremental reform that we keep hearing over and over again from establishment damage
rats
is completely bogus and meaningless because the virtue of incremental reform that were told over and over again as while yeah it's not classy and it's not what you want but you make things slowly better for everybody as opposed to if you're too radical then you don't get anything accomplished but look what happened everything all those little slow
fucking incremental things that they did in those first two years of obama obama care which by the repeal of the obama care magnet is in this bill and slightly higher taxes on higher earners and all that stuff that stuff is all gone now it's gone it might as well have never happened if they shot for the moon in two thousand and nine
and not gotten anywhere we would be in the same position but you know it might be different people might have seen them standing up for big bold progress of changes and maybe the rape alter is president heard it said that you know
lose in two thousand and eighteen when democratic the white house don't worry they're going to repeal this bill but you know how people say once you once you make an entitlement it's it's pretty damn near impossible to get rid of that entitlement the same goes for tax cuts in two thousand and twelve
obama and the democratic senate they made permanent most of the bush tax cuts
i have the same and the same we're going to get in the democratic don't require soon we're going to get into hyams the barn and the permits where he gave year
but
no talk about entitlements okay entitlements are tough to take away from people but like normal people who have entitlements that they actually need that are human rights he away from them because he just beat them down over generations and just yank it from their weekend hands but rich people they ever pathology where there is a little bug in their brain that tells them they're going to be happier with six
a million dollars and fifty even though they're just they live in a complete moral rod and their lives or allen they're fucking monsters because that is legitimate addiction to want a horde money like that you think they're going to give it up they've already gone to this point
i actually have fucking money to make sure that whatever happens in the future is not going to let them they were more if they wanted all they want it all the rest of us will have to bow and scrape for them to had the privilege of working for them unless we go a
talk about like in with regards like the democrats utterly weak response that's because here's the thing they couldn't stop this from happening
the problem is they could have done things like years ago they could have just chosen to be like or a party that represents the interests of their voters they made that choice a long time ago we're we're here now at the very presence or they couldn't probably couldn't stop this bill
their response to it is just so weak and selling because it just like i want you to think about contrast to the democrats response
above a nation of a tax bill that like i said is just indescribable be bad for everyone in so many ways contrast their response of the charts of chuck schumer or nancy pelosi you just like we're very disappointed we tried to be too late and we were rebuffed at every turn
compare that to that video know a lotta you saw online this week of jeremy corbett doing a video for labour where he said the bakers at morgan stanley described labour under under us as a threat guess what they're right
we are a threat to you then guess what they're a threat to your alive so you're goddamn right magic amazingly who who is the democrats enemy
if
enemy run from and rudeness
russia
i know chuck schumer could make a video but it's about to make night out will blunts in his car when you going to fund raisers it's a big video where he's lake i saw a blunt wrapping at the bottom of that that that matter my car was a gift for my daughter's wedding
who are they identifying as the enemies in our society and until we have a politics is so what there's a political movement in this country it says we can either have a democracy in the richest nation in the world that provides a decent quality of life for everyone or we can have billionaires but we can't have both
the i that is i like good value
battle is good billionaires a bad
i please and liberal institutions that underwrite them alex per he made this point i think is exactly right until they realize that they will be the target of a relentless rat fucking campaign by these people who have no regard for the decor of and decency that so believe in so lovingly until they realize that they're going to be the time
targets of this shit until they just take away the money for the fucking robert mercer of the world take away their fucking money machine is going to keep happening yet i mean look the other party is i cannot reiterate this enough they're voting for a guy this month and they're going to go all of them are going to say he did that pedophilia in this
nice it's okay
yeah that's they're all making their conscious choice you can't be they've made up their mind because they hate you and the like the people that hate you
and they will and as long as as well as long as they have the money they're going to pay james o'keeffe to dress up like pepe le pew and tried to seduce your house cat for something isn't really video it does it matter how fucking dub in ham fisted and obviously stupid and fake all this shit is it will work big got the democrats to fucking defined
a chord because of that that fucking could yeah an organization that actually helped register out register to vote and was one of the leading lights who understood that the housing crisis was coming and they got got they got you got a ludicrously any video and then they fired a theory sure the share out another and another
edited video because as soon as it happened they panicked they shut up bunch of squeak out of their ass holes and they fucking realize all is going to look bad oh man people they're going to be matter of no shit they're going to be mad at you they're going email to you no matter what you fucking do you moron whereas what they have that they have the pedophile senator gorman up and remember remember
mitch mcconnell when the first accusations came out and the first poll said that he was looking like he might not when they were like were selected we're gonna rock and kick him out of the it now now that he isn't lead now and pulls mcconnell said a lot of people alabama to know
shit like that was ever not on the agenda
because these people like the liberals exist and this continuum where they think that like the other side will be embarrassed when they see them at cocktail parties and they're not you you don't give a shit they're not you
it's instructive to contrast the resistance to this bill to the mobilization against the obama care appeal which was successful with the margin of one vote and the messaging against your care appeal which was all call your senators called the senators and that sort of thing it was straightforward it was going to increase the number of uninsured in the cunt
three
it's going to take away this entitlement and this time around the messaging i saw the mobilization against the tax bill it was not as potent and the message it was it was it was scattershot right i saw
planned parenthood talk about fetal person who had language in the bill i saw a lot of people talk about the drilling and anwar provision and it occurred to me that
the democrats no longer have a language that is useful to describe what is literally class warfare they don't have a political discourse that like you say identifies actual enemies who you should hate at home you should fight
feet as to his name but they very clearly pointed out that it will actually increase the deficit that's it that's all they had yeah as they have fundamentally bought that conservative right wing frame they are still so scared of reagan and all of this shit and the laffer curve that that's all they can talk about the deficit let us read the bill please before
for pass the anyway yeah part of it is like okay one reason the obama care repeal mobilization asia successful was because there was a precedent there was least her a few years there is president of this the tangible thing that they were going to take away because they actually as lacking is it was and how easily it's going to die
soon obama care with something they gave people one was the last time democrats gave people like a sheer just unambiguous then unambiguous economic program an unambiguous piece of fiscal policy that normal people could look at in their wives and say oh that time was better for me they can't because of the state
was this massive public private partnerships and loans for small businesses and fucking you can't figure it out it was intentionally designed to hide the government's role it was written the language of that of the stimulus was that it was supposed to be invisible right because they've spent thirty years
thirty years hiding their role because they're afraid reagan's going to come back from the dead
and there are afraid that people will notice that maybe one sometimes they want to spend more than the other party so when the time actually common game and it's like later dicks on the table is our vision world what's your vision the world their vision of the world is
this is like did you see an article about compromise is bullshit fundraiser were working on operated by the way he had a sore throat is what the fuck
is there a provision in the democratic party leadership they all have to be dying and have been
ages got up their dog about procedure what the fuck you know when you and it's not even working even like even their hollywood donor base of like bryan singer is donating while he has he has health problems the
when you hear these call it too much beer civility listening to both sides being friends across the aisle you've implicitly accepted a right wing reactionary frame that says that politics is just about these petty grievances because a conservative frame who are the conservatives enemies it's liberals pointy headed
college professors starbucks cops it's trivial shit so of course they could be lecture to reach across the aisle they could even do it because their grievances or asinine it has absolutely nothing to do with a day to day lives but whore that democrats enemies is it wall street which hedges it's beds between both parties is an energy seals every democrat elected in west virginia owns a wreck
dirty coal mine is it big pharma like joe mansions daughter is it recipients of big unearned inheritance is like all of their kids and all of their donors kids you can't have this frankenstein democratic party where we say okay we're we're we're going to have a huge like a powerful donor base but also left wing politics
it's impossible it's not going to exist it's just basically power through chicanery
why honestly there's good reason for despair because it's just like will who the fuck else is there yeah
i mean are likely at a point where like we're trying to do something here
to get our way out of this but like
said this sinking feeling that was suddenly right after the election it's like you do something like this they're exposed to become like i said that is the covert issued said over and over again of a long drive to basically do away with whatever little threadbare pieces of the new deal and civil society or a public sector is left over this country
and just to make america more the lives of people were more precarious more stupid more cruel and the lives of the greedy as nasty as people even more greedy and you know dave weigel several others pointed out you know okay know why why are people attacking the democrats who none of them voted for this bill
i'm sorry that's just the baseline behavior i expect is not showing up in signing on to it but you have within the caucus bernie sanders proposed amendment
that would
prevent any automatic cuts that will be caused by this bill and the deficit spending the social security medicare and medicaid and to democrats mark warner and tom carper showed up and voted no on it and mark warner said afterwards the you know listen i've i was a member of the gang of six or gang of aid or whatever
i'm big on entitlement reform mark warner was almost obama as vice president
paterson were beating with kendra lust and riley reid and were calling them to not do any more hardcore scenes until we take care of the of we don't want our kids pain and saw where the night
i love you where the fuck with like a pete peter said it is fucking deficit reduction rap squad
he was sucking this themselves out of an infant where one is fucking have a car and his his no
only able saw about lasting effects of this fucking tax bill my the way
deploy the capital
the capitol steps that of thing in during the voting and you saw every yes sir and you know i just like we are all acceleration
i don't know what else to say i i i i i hate that idea what do you want to despair you want to get even real or than this like i said after this tax well what's next so security and medicare by mistake about of those oh what's that have memorize it what say that there is some like big political backlash at how horribly popular nasty the oldest
shit is oh who's that it's like pump hail and tom cat and running our foreign policy will do everything in their power over the next couple of years to start of another massive are
i just say if there is one guy will just
spontaneous combustion to save the world were dead zone and som gotten it's gotta be that kind of god
had a guy who basically yeah
maybe you saw this i saw a piece about him interviewed him of the times as we were they asked him what is your guilty pleasure and have gotten said i rode every morning and i rode to every morning i get up early and go jogging every morning so i can reward myself by eating birthday cake everywhere with you running from
crawl space
not going to be really go going to be lit when the cia director tom cat in the sense ted nugent to kill the ayatollah with a fucking bow and arrow that's you know that that person is it humid i mean though the kinds of ads that that you should be running they should be specific personal attacks on this individual and his family and say this is not a normal human being who knew him
you might see he is a las colas op ed i'd psychopath whose only thing that really gets them out about of the morning other than fucking birthday cake is the thought of starting another massive us or in the middle east this time against iran and boy oh boy if you big fucking twenty seventh he was a dumpster fires
wait till two thousand and eighteen and twenty nine with till we lose and wait till iran starts hitting targets in america that fucking make make nine eleven look like a like a jade home rehearsal drill
it's going to be bad i mean like look if you are tom card and sexual partner if you like jack off with a man can you anything i don't know what can even take anyone down in america anymore if tom gotten leg he plays console games when he hooks up with to that mixer that allows you to use a mouse and keyboard to cheat that might work
just anything please
you have have of town cotton he live streams ebay on twitch and pretends that he's using his he only a lot
what they did not have gotten her
copyright authorities or yeah yeah
yeah just will acceleration
why you don't have to worry about the morality of oh should i root for are the worst to happen
i hope that it will accelerate the mobilization needed to stop it you don't have to worry about that were on that were in that time why it is what do you mean we will see you when we are now in the show in iran
with the new tokyo row saying that felix we went on
that okay well you're going to be a been acceleration and so it goes to show why you can't resist
this rightly in class warfare without in in in effective and monolithic working class party because the democratic party members of the democratic party elected officials who are just the same running birthday cake eating creeps as tom con are just always going to be widely reviled
and bad as you pointed out of course these poor slobs who won't benefit from this bill whatsoever they're just going to get fucked by of course they should vote republican because republicans will still give them something they want they're going to trigger the lives looking at the polling in this bill the messaging against it was totally ineffective you had
a massive number of people undecided they don't know anything about this bill there was no coherent opposition message so people just who had an opinion about it just relied on their preexisting affiliations in grievances and as we saw online
the child's are all holding and winking for this bill because it it will trigger that lives
i mean usually associated with you
had like a tweet that be viewer social media big declare your to tweet that did mad these and five figures is guided very easily it's no big deal for me i do one every day but all the replies do it from normal republicans are like looks like you got a dose of vitamin stupid and give you your life is
going to get worse and
not even that much time like you just fuck yourself to give boot booklet and to tax credit to buy his own pedophile
you fucking but i will say i like i can't really hate the child's that much any more than i could hate or raccoon for scurrying around my trial yeah but those really i do i hate the most are the sensible conservatives who wrote all of these are bad saying that oh we're
this is bad for the deficit where it seems like the republican party doesn't actually care about of fiscal prudence anymore and then the people who came out and said well you need to be nice to john mccain he's a hero we talking about john mccain it his the family
one of the arguably the mccain families taken more from the world than the term family we age is over time it's one of the wars families in the fucking world we should do one segment every episode for every single senator in the run we shouldn't we should do the walter we should do like stephen colbert segment where you like profiles and you'd better know it is it wrecks but we should do it
for a cancer cell and mccain
one of the worth living americans he wasn't even thirty years old he already had a fucking he already had a fucking basement volvo little vietnamese skeletons absolute fucking monster through and through and then in his entire public life all he did because dc journalist liked him personally i don't know why because he remind
your grandfather who had pulled him aside and told him a racist joke i don't know why add up to protect american though protect negative we had begun begun by the way you
sorry shadow
feinberg gotten a little bit of a around this week when she treated like responding to a john mccain support for this awful tax bill
congratulations to john mccain his wife and children or their upcoming tax free inherited a viable got mad because they're like were kids dying how dare you beg and became like demanded that she apologized to her mother and shit but actually believe that she did respond but she responded no way that i thought was very funny
and clever and was still basically twisting the knife so jealous and it megan again game out with african crocodile tears you owe my mom and you all my ball
i thought
can try trier tears with the giant wads of cash isa going to get is nothing were awful husband who i guarantee you she ate because we know domino have that he is a complete piece of shit to hallway where there's all these stories about him screaming at her and publicly humiliating or each she does otters probably cheated on her every day of his fucking life she hates and she's waiting for him to fucking die
and then she gets to utter fucking million dollars to swim around it like scrooge bit dark when it's over she's going to be fi hang on in cindy mccain defense she's also will fail daughter heiress know there is a comprehensive that is the falcon family because yeah that yeah and grandfather were admirals and john couldn't even fly a plane for ten minutes on the detour
ariel mode without fucking crashing in cindy fell daughter meghan one of the biggest male daughter's who's constantly shoved in her face when her dad fucking keels over we're talking about this the show she's going to start hot soup two point oh but it's going to be called like the steam after this game on a latte and meghan mccain just got engaged to that fucking
domino of bend domino from the federalist and like people found after their engagement all these articles that bed domino wrote about meghan mccain fucking just insulting area
typically could
oh that is alpha game
mind in the federal i wonder what kind of relationship she might have had with her father where a guy who was just being a mean creepy were all the time
it's interesting well you know what if there is i don't think ashley owes into your big an apology but usually she owes me an apology for deleting that tweet mainly can we talk about another political fail daughter which one talking about chelsea clinton and i want to talk about a piece courtesy of bill sure
our bill sure is the brain warm king bill sure it's like we've different argument in the show before but you know how like or make fun of articles that are like you know is the original rosa parks hillary clinton were like other stupid bill sure is like he's operating he's living in thirty seventeen like all these articles are like you know it
actually bill clinton is a black woman
why not yeah bills are rules he's galactic brain bill here will tell will tell you straight your face that fucking bob rubin should run for president
so as we were talking about tom continent is going to go to see yeah he's a currently a senator from arkansas and bill sure writes an article for politico titled clinton should run for senate caught in the senate seat and it's like clinton which was and he goes sure and he's like well you know hillary clinton she says would have to over
have a lot of impediments to because only the like or there's
she goes hilarious that his bag baggage bill
he's got too much baggage to in today's sort of like post heart thing when i think rape is bad
so he says that leaves us with what clinton shell smiley have to a
because the people of arkansas still love the clinton family
luckily she has thought she has the hillary what arkansas as we remember
when she won arkansas six sixty people at fly people at arkansas have fond memories of the bin laden family because she has a clear today but little of the kids at baggage
she wouldn't hurt for day recognition
cash
she's a place chair of the controversy bag that known as the clinton foundation but he builds really sort of the presidential can't by wiki leaks this the state department so chelsea caught getting doing good seats or root out corruption by foundation officials and warding of problems with the haiti earthquake relief she's an arkansas native even though she hasn't lived there since you
twelve sure she was it but now it lacks a southern accent but her bought her first house in new york two boats before she wants her said it bit where it started about this earlier the example of new york is like a whole right here in new york state people don't give a fuck at all if you live there new york state politicians like the yankees street
just big babies
here they had represented as a kennedy exactly we just want to play that said we were the big dogs they're like we feel gratified that they the us to represent us do you think they feel that way at all fucking the ozarks
like i said it was like chelsea clinton is going to be campaigning with
campaigning to the women who show jennifer lawrence where her father's body is it with their bones get to be wearing a camel jack it was hats with a broken brim i want to see your tried shaw
that would roll chelsea clinton campaign announcement it's going to be her and her fucking moron hedge fund manager fell husband and i love
she is of shrubs she literally mary jarrett
oh and married a less attractive
he very good without the powerhouse jewish summer camp counselor essential charisma
their campaign ad is going to be them were in overalls and playing a banjo and washboard but then she goes let's talk better start better pay as you go measures dramatically
she goes no sorry i just got to be would bore paragraph here were bullshit are you fucking of you bill
can you do bill brad stevens will share he says we all go she's gearing up to road for something someday she sharpened her political presence on twitter
now
she's release two books this year the popular children's history books she persisted and the less noticed but wait a year governing global health who runs the world and why in which he had a global public health professor explore how effective international organizations have been in combat infectious diseases by chelsea clinton featuring professor frink
that book is this health professor just describing all the new diseases that were discovered on her mother
this article fuck
added bill sure
never and kids is obvious that they're we started earlier the biggest you
back back and there's a lot of despair in the first half but guys let's just have now
cell phone to talk about
can we too we just talk about that chuck grassley tweet
either you know chuck grassley the only person older than the the things mentioned about that is because it's about this tweet is about the the estate tax which was repealed completely i believe with the house bill yes and will probably make it and the committee because they really want to get rid of it some of this not controversy as long as i usa
that's what's it saying about it that's the easy for me the fact that you fuck up messaging and something like that tax is the biggest indictment possible because everyone hates rich kid yes thank you
as you get asshole never lifted a finger and then you get a bunch of money when your parent dies it's it is repulsive it doesn't even it doesn't like even a libertarian so fixated on a desert theory of wealth and things like that well you know people those seals work hard what their shitty ass kids sure as fuck don't we all hate the who's the bad guy and all the john
whit movies it's not a mafia boss it's the mafia boss is shitty fucking okay
that's true of every mafia will be every angle with that guy is always the shitty asshole kid who had everything handed to him never lifted a finger for himself and that is every rich ass holes kid in america there would be so easy to point them out and say these people do not deserve this money and yet we are fundamentally incapable of talk
talking about it that way part of that reason by the way is you have people like bill shoe and an entire journalism class of people gormley and totally take in the idea that these these dynasties are to meet you just expect of course these people's kids are going to be brought into the journals let's bring him meghan mccain let's bring in fuck
road in pharaoh oh is that abby huntsman at the door and come on it's a party you a bunch of fucking witless dip shit who spent your entire lives like doing coke a fuck it private school and an instagram it and now you're going to talk to us on the national media of course there's no fucking vocabulary to point out that these tickets
nothing to deserve their status and the money that they're going to get would be vastly better spent actually making people's lives better except there and defend baron different but like if david if there was a house fire david athens compound in like a fuckin
a plane crash your on wall street a more ambitious one and the entire donor class of the democratic party got wiped out and it became like a and party you would win every seat in the house if you did something like you found every descendant of like the johnson and johnson fortune and went to push week and went to their like performance art shows
this is what we're going to get if we don't need air and it's all about that's exactly why i don't give a shit children are not off limits to these ruling class sick goes we should be attacking meghan mccain we should be running ads showing that the fucking psychopath trump sons not bear and me in that old meghan mccain
chelsea clinton the castle beach boys girls people who are widely reviled no matter who you are or where you stand society a list or just an extreme partisan moron and just say the these are the people who benefit at your expense in society they're getting hundreds of millions of dollars that they never fuck it weren't for whatever but
we basically have decided to pretend that you're taxing that's why they i mean that was the frank that's right i am sachs you're being taxed at beth but you're dead the money is you're no longer yours it is going to a new person and that new person is a spoiled piece of shit he was going to use the money to buy a fucking low
loft in fucking dumbo just have a bath tub full of cocaine and it and another bathtub with acid to dissolve the make a dose on the cocaine and accidentally and that's the problem is democrats will never ever have the moral grounding to be able to make that argument when you have people like joe mansion in your caucus yeah
pippen pimp and job yo mansion pimp
let me let me just put and true threat here people
chuck grassley this is when he said this wasn't a tweet but this is a comment he made but the estate tax he says this was just today he goes i think not having the estate tax recognizes the people that are investing as opposed to those that are spending every darn penny they have whether it's odd booze or with it or movie
oh okay
i'm going to alone
oh
ever heard
odd movie millennium
somebody had phosphates
wait till the circus is a tattoo next season
mr graham cracker
excuse me i to go way you know what actually he is right movies are super expensive now and another thing brain tonic his back and the for a new tropics were super gilded age only rocks dude my dad is john d rockefeller i'm in a ride my little fucking will fucking diary that i tried
smoking cigarettes and it wasn't for me and my wife during the temperance movement give a shit anymore
it was as a fourfold
work on it it's talk about
sort of a jared again
king
finally a man the bond do the ceremony jeered steiner to hand the torah
it's annoying
jared spoke again it is finally i think this is partly because it gets back exactly what you're saying about like if if only there were some democrats could do it just like well they had all these choices and the what they made was to have a fucking hyped somebody beat hillary could probably biggest booster an owner of that's been
a shithead who just hosted jared the sabbath sub it now
it literally think tip for what his baby a violation of the logan egg which was reaching for russia to intervene to a vote about israel old on hold on i quote ricky from trailer park boys among the sort of person says a toda so fucking a total
remember when died of a rush again we're like israel does this shit all the time whoa whoa whoa look is violating the logan act on be has to israel
what truck wasn't actually president when he made this overture to russia which is funny but it doesn't matter who cares are give a shit but like
i would just again i would love to see jerry go to jail obviously that's the only that's the only enjoyment we can even vaguely hope so this is the sub bonds the support forum
brought to you
the purple and from that yeah
i'm settlements
is a second
so you can
jerry talked about it because you know he is our special middle east envoy special his official title was special little perfect board
chapel middle east
it was going to little friend to feel so you to resolve the israel palestine issue and he said it's like a real estate issue
dude it aspect oh is just a bad zoning thing you just gotta pay a fad italian what are your favorite things it's a real estate issue because jared is going to just go to china and begs a billionaire to buy the west bank let's suppose sub bond like starts up by going this is endlessly impressive thirty six year old boy who think
gave up his interest in real estate to help us all and it's like the only thing jared is actually don't like use like i'm going to go to china to work on a deal and he just spent his entire their time their per diem five thousand dollar watches with like the on and chinese party officials and going please please buy a please buy it
this your know that offering green cards and exchange for fucking buying his shitty building which is just breathtaking something that is kind of astounding that we just kind of forgot that our forgot company take and how trump to deliver quote the ultimate deal of solving the israel palestine
yeah chris their said our goal is sick opie beyond citing a piece of paper into creating an environment that builds jobs and opportunities like never before said jared get to bring over palestine
is the real your of dallas nigerians going to get appear fell people vintage one of jared i mean how do you that led him to fix the middle east the guy who's two jobs were borrowing two billion dollars to buy a shitty building and turning the new york observer into a coloring book i know you said a as a joke
will china buying the occupied territories actually makes the most sense that seems like the most feasible thing that's probably what's going to have down
china is just take this whole thing over i don't care anymore present and a fine man
got some room for pod cow family man a g by como started really hard move into iran but i will accept china in one belt one road one pod cast present a g i respect you i love you
you're a pimp
you're a gangster
take play a big deal because he has ready for some more people
ergo were out for now
the washington post just came out with a hilarious account of corey lead drought skis lukas rescue and downscale fuck
that i grew up in chicago which is just the most polish people
this is corey your words a recording of them
they have like a highlight reel of is suzy be released campaign tell all book oh man oh man there are some funny shit and here i was going to be had here says the article starts elton john blair is so loudly or donald trump's campaign play that the staffers can't hear themselves think that's good press secretary
hope picks uses a steeper to press shrubs pairs while he still wearing them awesome trump screams at his top aides who are subjected to expletive filled tirades in which they get their face ripped off color and trumps appetite seems to know no bounds
with a dinner order consisting of to piggyback is to fillet of fish and chocolate bolted seems as if he didn't or
donald sandwiches for dinner every oh right
he'll be over there
hello world how is he still alive
rich the honor is dead and donald trump
he's still a lot how is this a tire intestinal tract just not like anal beads put their tumors
this everything inside of his body he is a piece when a single item of non processed food out in probably sixty as he does not eat fruit peters not eat vegetables the only reason he does the scurry is because of all the fucking catch up that eats all
this episode nine nine hundred of more presidential by the fucking day so bright early at six am right now we're watching fox and friends i'd go to walk over the t v and thank them for great
okay pause the gritty work i love you guys don't know how you get the fuck on t v all right
right now i'm about to have about eight by cubic doubles these are morning mixed doubles they don't have keys on them he uses for later in the day after jared tells you about for gold the chinese guy he had to don't appear to have right now i'm going to summon jeff sessions to the office and make him stand on
a ruler we have to have them admit that he's five foot six everyday life
i thought he can only keep doing racism if i had humiliate him
again
you can't you can't laugh at this is what the fuck are you better where nothing else to do to your bow and trump dog his first flight on air force one and there was this press cowgirl around him he says grinning like an eighty year old wow tv
larry
just like new york one or something and you have daytime news ads and you just hear one eight hundred am
so fucking loud and just only here
what about one of the bad children is fairly in a child
dogs are bad santa he is lauren graham
i am not used to
she's but mermaid
for the advent calendar
oh
myself kill themselves trying to to whittle or wouldn't
i'm very i don't get it if it's not edible why would would out with on the detail about flaring and elton john it's like fucking almost famous they're also a tiny dancer on the other day this is an extra really for a bit about
about men for it where it says in a section of the book written by lewinsky trouble is described as flying on his helicopter when he learns that metaphor has said trove shouldn't be on television anymore that's the cardinal said that he should it be on the sunday shows that metaphor it should appear instead trump was angrier lewinsky he had ever seen him
ordering the pilot to lower the altitude so he could make a cell phone call this is now did you see i shouldn't be on tv so day ago a tv any goddamn fucking time i want and you won't see it or their focus worried about me truck yielded metaphor tone it down i want to turn it up
political bro you they are pro life
i've been around a timer to i know guys like you with your hair the skid gonna god
guys like you with your hair and skin those weird
guys like you have weird
with your epidermal layer of protection to keep you from being damaged by whether you weird bitch
i just have a thin layer of slime fifty years of eat the chicken
you're all fire i'm hiring a car choir of dancing skeleton sort of a nineteen thirties
says
how about why would he said i know guys like with your hair is already said other pro life louis and ascii called the quote one of the greatest take downs in the history of the world
you should lose does video of like a feral hogs screaming at another over an apple you'd be like destroyed what does the opposite so there's always a joke somebody was cursed like you know they ran over row or you know are they fucking kick the leopard
yeah what does the opposite of that like if he accidentally give a leprechaun an orgasm are in scotland and about it because he is the most charmed off in the history of the world he eats nothing but but charred grizzle and grade f meat
seventy years has no cancers he is nothing but fails and fucks up and loses billions of dollars and he just keeps getting it back when it comes fucking who
not this not know either loon goes thing is perfect because he is not even like just on his service he is not like a clever charming person in any way budget any of the insane stupid things he says like thirty percent of the country including korea who does he is like he's yeah he's a wizard with words you so cool
gets up there and he's like you know
i'm just gonna say right now her although we've had a turbulent relationship and people are like fucking die for you
cool what's so amazing though that america america is awful
atavistic capitalism is propped up by this ideology of have deserved wealth and and the self made man is is this fantasy figure that basically justifies all manner of of grotesque inequality even if he doesn't exist the idea of the self made man exists because we don't
want to stop that from happening that glorious miracle of someone rising from nothing and through their own guile and grit becoming rewarded with massive success because we want to make that possible were willing to overlook devastating horrifying and equality and injustice and then the our president is the anti
horatio alger he is the guy who just fucks up repeatedly is manifestly incompetent and corrupt and never pays for his entire existence repudiates the entire fantasy behind american capitalism and yet people just can't process that i guess so they just turn into
i'm like know he is he he wouldn't have the money if he wasn't smart good at his job
this is country
it's it's transparently is sham but fortunately i think more and more people are realizing what a sham meritocracy is and what you need is an actual political movement or structure that takes advantage of that allowed have yeah we had a lot of despair we i think we need to have a little bit are fucking sunshine and a little bit of
of of optimism politically and else going on sunshine and it is the fact that we've clearly are seeing a change in the way people think about yeah we're clearly seeing like we were talking about after the off year elections how you're seeing the beginning of sort of bush era post two thousand and six souring and ah
on national republicans and a willingness of people to come out to vote against them but this time there were so many people who are getting brought in on that wave who are out socialists who are genuinely purporting forth that class first vision that we've said has been missing so it's coming back yeah we need we need you
come over here
that's very true mad and know obviously a lot of people are going to be swept in his wave and it's also going to be a lot of you know d c d trip favorite candidates like stuttering veterans who talk about means testing medicare and things like that so if you think that
i hear people talking about this like if you if you maintain this fantasy that that this rift in the democratic party is is anytime soon going to be bridge
in time for two thousand and eighteen or beyond that's just not going to happen one side has to win and that's it this country is unseemly who and probably do but let's just be time back into this article because it's really fucking funny okay
this is
and another episode do and douse he describes house staffer sam nunn berg was purposely left behind at a mcdonalds because don't berg special order burger was taking too long lead him to said let's go
my getting us troops fast food diet is a theme on trump force one there were four major food groups mcdonalds kentucky fried chicken pizza a diet coke the planes cupboards were stacked with vienna fingers potato chips pretzels and many packages and orioles because trove are now geographer
would not eat from a previously opened package the book notes that orchestrating the orchestrating and tiny being of mr trump's beals was as important as any other aspect of his watch to the presidency and it describes the elaborate of efforts that little douse he and other top aides went through to carefully tired their delivery of hot fast food trucks played
as he was the party his rallies wet point hot
others food must be highway
that's i to think that our fires what's going to take of down is probably a salmonella outbreak and eight after people that the fucking crusty the clown uncharted the
yeah i know fell by the us the yards amazing is that the other campaigns and is the greatest collection of hyper ambitious goes and they had over a billion dollars
you to live would just a bunch of guys who were taking chinese off brand see alice in giving big bags to an infant
i am one
people twelve years old were thinking about their entrances days to harvard versus just all these dumb asses and the big
yeah baby
with luck
one
i wish i wish i could have been there to see the looks on their
what did the only regret i have about our election show is that we were wasn't it had avid enter it
i'm about i'm seeing just chewing psychopath he thought he was going to be like a state department under secretary when they like
the donald's guy one
the team of guys who can't go under pep boys because they said a racial slur wrong racial slur to i shudder
you know fair and square they did but they were helped along the way because the g o p s oh nice chewing psychopaths had made had plowed the field for them by doing voter suppression
the states
and decreasing turn out by by increasing voter id laws and making it harder to vote shutting voting voting places and they were doing that with that clear they were doing that with a clear eyed psycho intensity of any of these professional political operatives and then it all went to the benefit of the fat orange idiot rolling down a hill
in a giant barrel
diane minds the
there can i get up in obstruction of justice
i haven't had a really bad is this criminal gene
walter white
a day where he treated what many lawyers it basically said it is it admission of obstruction of justice and then drugs for oil
just came out and said i did that which is why
all the dumbest most selfish revenue folks over everyone who believes in him as a lawyer named ty cobb that it is bad and four hundred
but it's like but they didn't he would fire that guy which if oh yeah i treated something under my client's name that is an admission of of just say you should probably be fired but he's still there will makes me think he was just like i said it i wrote with iran
i did the ag
out that amazing thing about trump trump folks over everyone needs clothes and stuff like you forked over christie to her
giuliani now this lawyer guy and it's like there's no reason to like ride with him unless you need to sell a shitty building but is it just keeps people are still like now i want to be with this guy this untrustworthy petulant fat in it will be going that that lawyers as that under a host benches kids
part of the still wins the as drugs later told you he was a fucking
you fail at the hundred gets of they made that deal he does it hold up into the bargain i am going to happen so
we're almost over here i mean as a show and to society
i actually i do you are equals one one just serious thought that we've been hitting out like obviously
if you're feeling a lot of despair like i i share it with you
it's getting harder it's hard to imagine a way out of this in the near future however i i do believe that the majority of people in this country
if someone were to articulate a vision like you know if we had a figure like corbin who
he said you know rise like lions we are many they are fewer could articulate a vision that is contra to this like nightmare that we're living in i think people like i think more people than ever in this country
that is like the broad base of support for that it just doesn't exude like that the political infrastructure for that doesn't exist and then are there are people going to be gotta try to create it from scratch or just do so there are people i'm optimistic about specifically carlos rosa in chicago running for onerous fourth district vote for carlos when the time comes boat yeah
you know like i could come out of nowhere people really can yeah
in the absence of a leader you need a movement mass movement
and they need like a more
same as as a as an arrow is pointing out like the people that all the answers know this and that's why they're trying as hard as possible to take you know make people's lives more precarious through their awful judges that are going to be judged in infest our entire federal judiciary for probably as long as i'm
fucking alive
make it to our democracy even more of a sham than it already is going to have they're going to empower the game facts a message board moderators and disbarred
auditions had truck has dominated the judiciary you john mccain rubber stamped every i cannot wait for the viral videos about the trunk justices yeah street magician destroys pro choice to most elegant you talking about i think that logan and jake paul are going to federal judges
so we we we destroyed all this horrible shit that they're doing and that they're getting away with but like they're doing it because they know how fucking like that
in a functioning democracy they couldn't do this yeah right and they're doing it
to hold on just clamp down even more of the fucking power and money that they have because they know it can get taken away from the and we have to that's that's the only thing to deal with there and they're going to use the law and government money to make it harder and harder to do that but like
again just there are more of us are there are them about our i don't know what else to say
what i will see as a start at least it's a start
i want to leave you guys now
with something that i think
like i said just really sums up
just america
our culture honestly if you ever get it and i did if if somebody there was somebody who isn't a two year coma who woke up and looked at what was around us and spent a good for five hours and sputtering incoherent
rage and terror and confusion and then said what the fuck happened i think he could sit them down and show them this commercial and it would really tell them everything they needed it out so
that's it for us to this week
we'll talk to you soon but until then i give you trump be bear the wind whispered through the forest a storm is coming you cannot defeat to store from the trees rooms a resounding voice i fear nothing i comb when the trumpet sounds
