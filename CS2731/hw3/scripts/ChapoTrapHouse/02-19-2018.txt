it's me met an ember and joining us this week is professor richard wolff are you doing
good to be repressed or wolf how did you what was your road to damascus moment
coming to marks you're sol paul moment
well i think it was partly my family and my father and mother were refugees from europe came here united states the run away from world war two
and
when i was born my father was pushing a wheelbarrow in the youngstown ohio sheet and tube steel company he had been a lawyer in europe but when he came here that counted for nothing
he was lucky to get any job and you got a job as a steel worker
and
the rest of his life
was the denial of being able to do what he had wanted to do and i think in one honest way that shaped me to understand that the world can treat you really badly and you have to try to understand that
if if you can think about it when i used to talk with my father and ask him you know what do you think about what's going on
he kind of tutored me and understanding that if the world had been organized differently that wouldn't have been nazis and that wouldn't have been war and that wouldn't have been refugees and there wouldn't have been and
i could see i couldn't put into words of them but i could see that the way he got through the trial most of his life
was by understanding telling a story to explain why it happened was almost a kind of therapy for almost a way of coping did he talk about these and explicitly political sir yes yeah she did and i think he came to politics because he needed to explain this
for example his sister died in auschwitz okay
it's a problem you've got to cope with wild pandas i mean picked up off of street of paris and wish the off and never saw her again he had to come to terms and the way he did that i mean to deal with that horror i mean how do you do that he used his head he told the story he made an explanation
i think i'm a teacher in part because making an explanation
i could see in my father was his way of coping with life so part of my coming to marx was i began to ask the question why is the society work the way it does i did it in high school i began i continued in college i certainly wasn't a marxist like it
the study economics and and call and all i want her as a freshman i took one course and economic i thought this was the dominant
i'd ever heard i couldn't believe the teachers i thought it was a joke and it was waiting for the punchline when it never came it was all these lines and graphs i had been the mathematics student i wasn't intimidated by the lines in the graphs but this was childish what was being said it made no sense at all so i never took another course in college and economics are kept away from it
like it was a disease i didn't want anyone near there i majored in history because i'd i could study and biggest reasonable histories of story that's right the story that's right and history is economic history and political and cultural history you can really want that was exactly what i wanted to study but the more i studied the more i understood
if you don't understand what's going on the economy you're missing a major part of this story and my teachers didn't didn't deal with it they didn't handle it so i'm a little bit also shaped my damascus
by the kid who can't get the cookies out of the jar become very attractive get the so if the teachers are avoiding the economic story they are avoiding the conflict between employers and employees master slaves lord serves if all of that is kind of swept under the rug which it was when i was going to school
then it became even more interesting for me why am i being kept from this why am i not been told about this and i had enough people i could ask who gave me a book to read or an article to read and i began to figure out toward the end to college that we were not being taught what was the most important and interesting stuff and once you're into
a that you find marks or relating to find marks and then once you walk through that door and like that in your mind the missing part of that story falls into place like what was it like what what was missing and what was articulated by coming to marks that i'm excited you're interested in a basic thing was a
a that what goes on in the economy how people make a living
is a crucial part of who they are what they think about how they relate to other people
and within that there is a crucial part which has to do with conflict between the employer and the employee ear
and all of that and i wasn't being told anything i was actually being told that is a wonderful
perfect arrangement in which the interests of the worker in the interests of the employer other same and they are working together and they're all getting a fair cut of what they do together it's a happy happy store is made no sense to me at all
as you're reading history of this array of calm violent conflict here well what are they fighting over this if it's all so wonderfully worked out why did all of this conflict that one of the old stupid they didn't get it usually make no sense to me it really at a certain point i realized i had to do this on
i had to go read this stuff and find it which i did i wasn't the only one i had other students who did it with me but i went to i'm a poster boy for elite education in this country but college i went to where i didn't get what i should have is called harvard
and when i finished my phd at yale and he's like a joke
yeah know i am the product of all of that so i went to the schools at claim to give me the best possible bad adapt and they were terrible in this regard they were frightened
know it was the cold war i went to school in the sixties seventies eighties
to time when americans were scared shiftless about the evil empire of the soviet union that was associated with marxism and the american response really was
to make believe it wasn't there at least in the schools it was so evil that you wouldn't get near it wouldn't talk about it wouldn't teach it so i'm part of a generation
the has no idea what all of that's about it so evil that you never ever get anybody to teach you anything other than how and why to dismiss it on why did say it's silly or it's warm words bad it's really childish more than more than bad politics it's childish
fearful education
afraid to talk to the students you know i used to say to my teachers you know even if you don't like it
the biggest country in the world by population is china and the biggest country in the world by geography is russia those two countries take this stuff seriously that's enough of a reason for you to teach it
people going to have to deal with those folks so why don't we understand how they see the kemal this isn't rocket science is ought to be part of the curriculum they had no answer for me and i could read in their faces they would just scared later i discovered i was right they were scared it was hard to figure out your career
is over if you expressed even in my earlier career you expressed interest in marxism in a critique of capitalism
people looked at you as if you had an s t d
day though devoted important to people who distance so he had the flu or something really bad team will and don't hire you don't give you a job
academic and professional a prophylactic as well to keep it from exactly the keep the whole thing from getting out of hand we don't want one of those the i've always had jobs as an academic have been a professor all my life but that's because of another quality of the united states which is deference to things like harvard and yale
i get a job despite my politics because i got a pedigree and that pedigree in academia counts for a lot so that's the only use a handful i didn't get a very good education but very useful to wave them pedigree whenever i get myself into difficulty it has served me nicely and i i appreciated for that reason but
the education know we've been talking you a little bit about how you sort of came to understand marks and
missing piece of your education that was filled in by marxism and an understanding of the world that was different from what you've been taught but i want to i want to go back now to where it where this all began at least as regards you coming on our show
repressed or off what does the film boss baby tell us about contemporary capitalists ideology
it tells me many thing
the that underneath the pretense that everything is working out really pretty well
there's a pretty good understanding as in that movie
that there's a lot of bitterness a lot of nastiness a lot of struggle a lot of weird kinds of belief that are widely shared for me the best moment in that film comes early when the bad new baby
having arrived explains to the older sibling who is not quite understanding what's going on
he leans across and he says there's just not enough love both of us remember that he actually has a theory
if it's gotta be a fight to the death between the two little ones because there's not enough that's what american working people of is not enough money to give you a decent life so you have to have debts up the was due to send your kid to college you have to do without you have to you after because it's just not enough
it's bullshit in the movie and everyone sees it and it's bullshit in the economics too although people don't see it yet
that's my job is hot and when people see that there's no problem with amount of money and none of that never was it's only a question of how you go about using it in dividing it and making it work if you don't want to give it all too few people and everybody else is in trouble but there's no necessity that's not necessary that's not
built into anything it's a political struggle a new he to fight it and when are you live with resignation and that's been the lot of people for all on on for me the movie was interesting because it it captured the crazy ideology and showed how of shape the lives of those two little ones
because of the fury of the older one being displaced and the fury of the younger one wanting to be the displaced or and needing an ideological story to tell to make it all sound reasonable and necessary when it wasn't
also interesting that the boss may be voiced by alec baldwin and famously give voice to i think one of the greatest expressions of capitalists domination and sadism glengarry glen ross
is referenced and yeah baby what he says what the cookie down cookies
it was a huge hit with have a eight year olds
but is like predicated on like the anxieties around scarcity and competition it is kind of interesting that they like okay will at the end he does not defeat the baby unified with the baby
solidarity with him that big of a throw the the boss baby bureaucracy a few yeah
the thing that sticks with me as how presents capitalism is like generative it's like apples of inextricable you can't get away from it and it exist before you're born there was a very born into yeah there's a factory with with machinery and and bosses in the place where babies are made
and then even the way that it imagines like reproduction like the conflict between the babies and the puppies because in the world boss baby you only have a kid if you want one and then like the factory makes a baby for you so that are literally creating need it like that
saying that they're not satisfy needs for children or anything they're creating though you need to go down to earth to make people want to have the kids so everything is just in this web of of of production for its own sake and the need to create demand for things that aren't necessarily necessary and that sort of the
the the generative structure of over the years you need people to consume and you need if there isn't enough if they don't need enough than you make them want something and provide that for the i would use it to teach an economics of advertising because that's what that is the company to make money has to dump the stuff it's produce
it has to have buyers if the buyers don't want it don't need it don't like it you've got to fix that and the way you fix it if you can is by inundating them with the advertising playing on their psychological problems to get them to part with their money and buy the damn thing you've produced that's why eco
comics it is so crazy when we teach in conventional economics that production happens in response to consumption
the craziness is to assume that consumption is a given this comes out of your soul and it has nothing to do with what with what you see every day on every billboard every
i came here on the subway to get through the subway turnstile i had to read the advertisements on the subways turnstile every minute we all know that we're inundated with people spending fortunes of money to shape our desires but in economics textbook of the class or production is a wonderful arrangement because it meet our needs
as if we need to pretend that the producers are not spending big bucks to shape our needs and every catholic it yet
to go and i like the more in this contrast between the world that exists in economics textbook in an economics classroom and the world that actually exists where we see the movie boss baby and even though we can't quite put our finger on it we identify with the figure of a tyrannical infant
but how does like just generally speaking like how does the broadly understood like when people talk about economics or the economy how does your understanding of that differ from what is overwhelmingly taught in schools and for what like most people when they think of it
the idea of it's in their head econ one on one eternal on one okay there's a number of ways to get at this i guess the biggest one from me was and still is that if you look around this society with more or less reasonable
open mindedness you must see some things for example you know that there are some people that are very rich and some people than a very poor every community has them most americans know exactly what part of the community they don't go in the evening because you don't go there is
in the evening their parents when they were young explain that to them one way or another we know inequality and if here in new york city as i live so overwhelmingly obvious every day that you really have to have cultivated blindness not to see it
give you another example the instability and me we're now living in the tenth year after a crash two thousand and eight kind of everybody knows that the headlines this week are full of stories that we might be about to have a another crash
seventy five years ago we had the greatest crash the system over at the nineteen thirties i mean crashes are part of it
i used to make a joke in my class that would help students understand if your roommate was as stable as in this economic system you would have moved out long ago
what you accept this you kind of think it's necessary it somehow like the rain you don't like it when we few days
water but an economic system isn't nature it something human beings organize so for me i would want economics to talk to me about the great difference between rich and poor adam smith is the founder of this science he wrote a famous book the wealth of nations he was interested why some nations are rich and why
a poor that's me i like that question i would like to be answered and i would like to be answered honestly we have a system that produces enormous inequality it always as what about that one about why why does it happen and then the logical question could you have an economic system that didn't do that
another was let's see let's talk about it because that's not only interesting as a human being but it's also very practical if could be an alternative it didn't do it oh well why don't we go via her why don't we do that these kinds of questions literally would never dealt with in my education the fancy schools i went to
they didn't do that in fact most of the education and economics department where i got my education and economics
really had very little to do with understanding how an economy actually works let alone what an alternative might be they were mostly celebrations we learned to be cheerleaders
that this capitalist system is the greatest thing since sliced bread
and here's the wonderful way it works and then everybody stands up at the end and applauds and those of us to go on to be college teachers are to the post to teach all that junk again
it's so bad this sort of rationalization or cheerleading for the system
that even the business community in america understands it let me explain
economics is one of the very few feels in american universities were almost every university has to economics department up one the one that's called economics is all about celebrating a wonderful the system is but over the years the business community got angry complained
it's very nice with glad that you think capitalism as great or do we but this now useful to a young man or a young woman comes out a year million how wonderful of is with well how it works because you don't teach that so we're going to set up another track another economics department which will be different it won't be there to celebrate our wonderful of his you do a good job
we didn't have another department that teaches people how it actually works that's called a business school
and they're usually kept on opposite sides of the gillingham as such i have a nice long walk they barely talk to each other
it's we have you don't have to history to bomb you you'll have don't up to english department you want to french department of to biology to palm but you all have to economics the but it's so silly that in some universities where they got budget problems they just collapse the do together to avoid the need for double space and double faculty but it's an admission that economics has been
for a long time in this country
a cheerleading section in which you cheat teach cheerleading to future cheerleaders who will go around tell you all of this that's why by the way i mean among the many costs of this arrangement is a generation of people who win this system does work well
don't know what to do look at it now they don't know they can explain what has gone on the stock market the explanations are ad hoc in a weird and you kind of wonder if they understand it so well on tuesday are committed to think about it last tuesday you know what bizarre but that's not really their fault it's not that arm or anything like that has been no edge
education in what's wrong with capitalism one of the flaws of this system what alternatives good because that the cold war made taboo
we're living in the country that is still just beginning to crawl out from under that taboo
i think one of the most effective things about that econ one or one understanding which is really like the best example of a little bit of knowledge can hit dangerous then really talking earlier it gives you just enough information to remains
but it is very successful because it presents these things i think like you said a little bit earlier as natural that like that these are just law like supply of these are laws like gravity or evolution or things like that
our economy is a natural expression of human nature whenever there was and this is going backward that
there was a hiring of a few that even what do you would consider like far less left economists but like laughter economists than the norm at indiana university and as a result the business school started to create it's own classes economics for business majors certainly even if you wanted to
learn about economics you could completely completely circumvent economics department completely yeah the ideology in this country has been very very strong and the naturalization the way you put it is exactly right to teach people
the way the human nature works anything any effort to make it better
goes against human nature when my students raise that which they always do i try to tell them stories i said you know when there was slavery in many parts of the world people were told that it's just natural some people are master type people and other people are sleeve type people he all slaves and less
sort of like children and you wouldn't let the children run the chicken coop and so their children then wait till they grow up the problem with slaves his children always and and that was thought to be human nature and people justified what they were doing on the grounds that we have to take care of these push lanes because they're not
really fully human but it was always natural in the middle ages it was natural to be a serf or a lord in our days it's natural to be an employer and employee or anyone one the other colonies you want people always who don't want change you either are afraid of change or can imagine it make them
cells feel better by saying well this is the end of the process of change because we're finally in tune with nature but you can only believe that if you don't know that every prior system however different from yours also thought it was in tune with nature which once you get it makes it disappear as a rationale
i wonder if he could talk a little bit about fukuyama in the end of history seems like a nice sag there yeah
was one of several comments it most of those erupted after nineteen eighty nine because of you know for most of the twentieth century from nineteen seventeen nineteen eighty nine you had the soviet union which held itself out as the alternative the not capitalist the the new the socialist or whatever
and it was amazing to everybody including the honest ones over there
that it was kind of surprising that they were able to make a revolution and even to sustain it for the seventy years that they kept it going yeah with a largely agrarian country yes very very backward all of the problems they add isolated in the world and all of that
but nonetheless they were there and but you know if you're there you're a fact and it becomes important when they collapsed nineteen eighty nine when they literally imploded
union and eastern europe with them
it was not so surprising if you think about it that people who had always hoped that they would disappear now said with the typical exaggeration not only did the soviet union disappear but all of that is no longer relevant in other words here is proof that capitalism will be here forever because this
great challenge faded or dissolved or went away and fukuyama was one that were many people who wrote in glowing enthusiasm that the history in the sense of a contest station between systems is over
and we are now in the endless realm of capitalism which has persevered
the poor guy writes the book and unless literally less than twenty years later capitalism has collapsed in two thousand and eight which is why books like that aren't written in the last ten years because capitalism doesn't look so secure so clear so wonderful etc etc
the stock is fact i would start with is that oxfam in england you know the institution that does all this research on poverty and then everybody uses the one percent richest people in the world together
oh more than the other ninety nine percent together on me you have to go back to ancient egypt and theory rose to get this level of of of inequality this two thousand billion years in the world that or just two thousand last year two thousand and seventeen their wealth went up
by seven hundred and fifty billion dollars just the stock market and saw that's roughly seven times the amount of money it people say would be needed to get rid of extreme poverty in the world we didn't get rid of extreme poverty because people who are already the two thousand and richest people on earth got even richer what kind of an economic
system
no student that i know of none been presented with this kind of information wouldn't that least admit it's important question to to raise is this the way we want and economy to work is this consistent with our family values or morals or ethics all religions or whatever it is most students will
have some trouble with that question would admit at least we ought to be discussing this this was never discussed in my education just was never the deemed relevant what's what's so amazing as is that one of the foundational what are those like exxon want to want ideas supposed to subvert her refute marxism is
marginal utility road
and if how do you not apply that to people having that much money like what is the marginal utility to these people have like the next one hundred billion dollars like it means nothing to them it could mean literally the difference between life and death for billions of people and even by your own analysis of economic value
you that money is not doing anything for these people that are literally just putting into the pile
there is no connection between well okay if he isn't doing them any good like you basically said that your commitment to models or whatever has totally superseded and he sort of ethics and morality and therefore them keeping it in this pile is worth more just because to change that distribution would be interrupt
doing these you're talking natural flows natural economic market
reality to fit the theory when in reality doesn't fit the theory well you know technically when you teach it you teach marginal utility and then you have you add a at which a text book has written down always you cannot compare the marginal utility a one person to another in other words you and
not allowed to buy the logic of the model to say that taking a dollar from rockefeller and giving it to a poor person on the corner moves it from a low marginal utility what does the rockefeller care for another dollar to a person for whom it means a meal or not today you can't do that you have to
admit that each person has he has her own evaluations and you cannot interfere with that that would be violating the person's in it livable in order to preserve this respect for the individual you'll let the guy star v it's not that you've superseded it
it is the morality that's why when you encounter students who have been in these courses enough time they become little moral monsters because they believe it it has become the lesson that they been like a like a young person goes and gets their lessons at church or their catechism class or whatever it is they
learn in school the fish
sure it's good it's it's the way and economy should work and short step from there to believing that the c e o gets three hundred million dollars a year really is worth it he does such wonderful things he deserves it whereas the guy who picks up the garbage in front of your house me he deserves a team
dollars a week
and then you become your on the road to what eventually becomes a kind of fascism in which you assign people to different gradations in a society and that's bad enough but you rationalize it as if it were necessary because the end result is that you know this is one of those things where your your common sense would tell you that human
created an economy to serve people's interests and the other way around and that
ideological process leads you to the point where we exist to serve the market
therefore morality can't enter and opens the morality as you say is maintaining these markets look it's very painful with my students to be real honest with you my students come to the shit in the office of because i still teach at a new school university here in new york
and they sit in my office and they asked my advice should i take this course or that one should i major over here or should i major they're trying to fit themselves like a round peg in the square all they're trying to figure out how to make it in society for them they don't even ask the question wait a minute
i should be doing what i love what what means something to me and i should have a society that gives me the chance to do that
they've lost all of that they made no demands on this system that trying to fit in trying to make sure they can find a place in this existing system because the idea that this system on his serve them as long ago been lost like said people who can't get the idea that the local politics supposed to serve you
you're not supposed to suck up to them that's not the way this was supposed to work and you encounter those people you feel bad for them
what's what to me though is that there is that sense that people have you know
so easily tie any university setting that this person deserves this and this person deserves acts but when you're like say try and organize a wage campaign or something it's so easy for you to say your boss makes this much and you make this much do you really think that he works harder than you know no one will ever say yes
no one will ever said yes so there's this weird disconnect between those kind of intellectual culture around and how we view work and wage and all of these very fundamental ideas and what we know to be true from being at work
i agree with you but let me to push back a little this way
it's scary
because if you follow the logic of just what you said then you're going to have to say is your next step this is outrageous that he gets twenty million dollars and i have to borrow money put my kids through college
and then you're confronted with a very bad injustice of which you are the victim unless you are than a mouse you want to do something you are now taking a step that makes it harder and harder for you to justify not being active and you are scared for good reason about being a that's an uncanny
double place for people to be and then i think a good number of them retreat into the acceptance not because they really believe that you're right but because where you are taking them if you ask them to see what you pointed out scares them well and rightfully so it was punished
i was at speaking it easily
and in subtle ways their parents when they were very little and didn't leave and understand it
taught them you know stand in line when the teacher says it do what you're told that's how your go along to get a law all of that that we've all learned as children most were very unusual all of that plays a role here to make it harder and harder i think if the universities and colleges
has had a commitment to diversity of of perspective
the way they now at least say they have with diversity of gender and race and all that then we will have had people like me teaching and lots more of them than i am many like me teaching and then we would have at least confronted a generation of students with the alternatives that they could have them thought about made up their own minds but
this country has never in my lifetime have the confidence in its own people to give them real freedom of choice in learning they've they've given them a very restricted diet and we live with the consequence what we find ourselves now adequate particularly for young people people you know i if you're like a millennial
we've we've basically as i've ever been alive we've lived in a society and government in which the classical the girl and i guess now neo liberal view of economics is they have the no auto manufacturers that we've been living in this no alternative world and this end of history world but then if you're young
young one of the formative moments in your young adulthood was the economic crash so it's sort of like the in the nineteenth century marks and they created these ideas and and like an easy history goes than the twentieth century discredited many of them but lo and behold here we are in the twenty first century
and it seems you're making a big comeback in terms of the interest that young people have in an alternate but how do we take like you know what is the next that for taking that the general feeling of disillusionment with
the way our society has organized and particularly the economy and how it is disadvantage in you and winnowing down your hopes of a better future
how to your from there to a coherent political ideology and movement in this country i mean that's a big question but what do you start well i don't want to beat a dead horse but i want to say again because it has to be said
that it's very sad for the generation of the millennium who are smart enough to engage this crash not to pretend it didn't happen are facing the job futures they have or better yet don't have that they will lead to expect they would get been are now being told really isn't there for them it's really sad that they were never presented with what the op
alternatives are now that they badly need to figure out where the goal instead of simply resigning themselves to a kind of bleak situation unfolding
having said that i think we have to learn from history look the twentieth century much of the critique of what was done in the name of socialism and communism is perfectly reasonable lot of mistakes were made a lot of bed directions were taken we have to learn and we shouldn't be ashamed those of us other critical of capitalism about
that i'd like to remind people the transition from feudalism to capitalism didn't happen in some smooth way where everybody figured out of wounded him up feudalism lots so good what to do this or that there were all kinds of experiments some of them less than a few weeks some less than a few months some of them last of a few years before they were undone either by collapsing in on themselves
well being destroyed by the feudal who didn't want this new change capitalism came into the world after lots of fits and starts and trials and errors why do we imagine that there will be any different going from capitalism socialism russia and china cuba places like that our efforts and they went in some ways they discovered good things in some ways they went off the rails
sales in ways we don't wanna we have to learn from that just like our forebears did so what do i mean the big thing in the twentieth century of the alternative was the idea of the government the private capital as system left to itself would produce in the quality and stability and then we would get the government you see to come in and kind of fix it off
the instability ease and counteract in the twentieth century the for metal evasion of that idea john maynard keynes with his economic analysis is how the government can step in this way that way and the next wave make it all kind of work out and the soviet union was the ultimate sort of step of that where the government doesn't just regular
eight and the government takes over and make sure everything goes right what really discover well we discovered some things were achieved in that way that couldn't have been any other i like to remind folks that the fastest economic growth in the twentieth century of any country was the soviet union they went from a very poor as
pointed out earlier very poor back with the poorest country in europe nineteen seventeen they have a revolution they have a civil war they lose world war one few years later they go through a horrible world war two and yet in nineteen seventy five the number two super power after the united states us the credible achievement they were able to go from poor to rich
the best example of
ended rationing before the u k did
the americans don't even know that we had rationing the fastest growing country in the twenty first century is the people's republic of china there's nothing comparable to it so if you want a society to go from poor to rich they did fat
our least they did it better than anybody else has ever done it on the other hand by giving all that power to the government to fix the economy you created the risk that they would take that power and do all kinds of things you don't want which they did and we have to learn those lessons i think to make a long story short that the problem of the first efforts in the twentieth century to go
beyond capitalism were to overdo the role of the government to make a tool and
word in the needs of the mass of people and therefore you got real bad stuff along side whatever you did achieve okay so than the twenty first century now having learned from that i think we need to go on a different direction and understand that we can go from capitalism to socialism in ways that have nothing to do with the government that
why are the government to step in that don't create the opportunity for the government but that make the change at a different level namely at the level that we mostly live our lives in our homes and workplaces so you may know we are advocates for work or co ops for changing the organization of businesses though they stop being
top down hierarchical arrangements or a tiny number of people the major shareholders and the boards of directors a elect make all the decisions what to produce how to produce were to produce what to do with the profits and to change all that and say no let's make the workplace it would go while he was the idea democratic the worked
one person one vote we make the decisions together we got rid of monarchies because we didn't want a political decision for be made by a tiny number of people sitting far away in the palace and we created something else why do we permit a tiny number of people sitting in a fancy office that looks like a palace to make those decision for the workplace if we believe in them
aqua she likes democratize the enterprise for me that's what socialism and the twenty first century is going to be all about isn't it hard to do that without the state though like at some point
the state is what they create the laws the framework in which business is conducted at some point the state has to innovate right
right but again i'm gonna borrow from history we had a estate in feudal europe we had a stay with louis the fourteenth
any of the others
but the change from feudalism to capitalism really didn't happen at the level of the state it happened first in a thousand little businesses when the serfs ran away from the lord and settled in the town and hooked up in a new way with employ years who are also x run away and you had a development from below
oh which eventually confronted the old feudal state by saying you've got to go it's histories over and when they resisted they did things like the french revolution and they were not nice and they separated so many people from their and all the rest of that i'm not advocating that of course but you get the
picture i think yes you will need the state but you'll only get the state to do what is necessary for a new system if that new system as some routes has established itself as some power there is socialism is not going to come through legal is am i think it's the only yeah and that
what we've seen as any positive movement in even a progressive direction is always a case where the government is coming in the rear and ratifying change sad that someone around anyway that's right or worse be used by the powers that be the old system to prevent the new to block the new you know when you when you walk remember
those heroic for me those who young people into cloudy square met so far from here
they had during the occupy and they had those milk cartons the old plastic milk caught and set up around the perimeter of the park and everybody who had books brought the books and they created a free library they put the books in the milk cartons and everybody was on their honor you
calm if you want to get a book you take a book out they can only read it and then you bring it back no clerks no rig them a role of free library it was very poignant because it was just at the time that the mayor bloomberg at that time here in new york was cutting funding for public library so it was a beautiful moment of say
we're in favor of libraries and then the same bloomberg
gets on the television and says i have to shut this whole down and when the reporters say why he says because they're not clean the people here
and the reporters to their credit looked at him and said you are the mayor of the filthy filthy a subway on this planet and you're telling us your shutting down these folks who aren't hurting anybody because they aren't clean you can do better than that three
days later the bulldozers came in and plowed under those milk crate and cartons with the books i mean that's the government coming in and holding on to an old system and being the obstacle and i don't think you overcome that until you have built the institutional basis that people can see what an alternative
look like can can get excited about going in that direction and demanding the government help them rather than seeing a government that is forever under the rubric of law and order and on at basically holding back a society that now needs to be changed
remember he backseat to bloomberg and the occupy wall street is my favorite comment from our former mayor was he said i don't understand why these people are protesting people who work at banks
they're good people that make forty grand a year is tellers
like the people there were like blue waiting in lines hey this checking account
why are the pans on those little change any of was the pad
i mean how stupid do you think he must have thought the rest of the people on this is a billion they're telling us to be happy with forty grand a year
bank to in hand
is something so many about i did you realize how disconnected from the universe
a couple of weeks ago paul ryan the republican got himself into trouble because he was congratulating a lady in pennsylvania who got an a dollar fifty increase in her salary per week because of the tax cut and he was explaining how happy she is she did something how happy she has asked coma she could get hurt
last comment to this is a guy who got five hundred million dollars or something from from the koch brothers for his political future congratulating and say how happy with a lady is what her dollar fifty a week
it's not it's not even horrible just that he thinks that way that's bad enough but he's comfortable saying it publicly it takes your breath away
the level of not understanding the world in which he lives is frightening and he's just all it just shows how little left pressure they're just not afraid but don't feel like there's any repercussions because they feel like they have the field of themselves yet and then he was surprised that the twitter universe
him away by making fun of what he had just said well then he deleted it replaced it with an even more offensive of whiteness that i'm yeah i've always do well apparently it was it was from the day earlier but he didn't believe this one and it was a quote that he highlighted from an article about people responding to their pay raises going up because of less withholding
due to the tax bill
a guy said
over two hundred dollar more a month and my paycheck which will help offset the three hundred dollars that my insurance premiums went up so it's still negative one hundred is this going to offset any said quote they say that the middle class is just getting crumbs but i'll take it
and he gets left that up there as proof of it theory
yeah you will you
every quarter report longer oh
but see it
better yet they pull rank and see these things in public he doesn't really hear about it and for the most part even if for gas by we all kind of accepted and i want to get back to this idea is because of this econ one or one these these ideas that had built up our culture that are ridiculous but we just accept them and you ever the old
mad magazine bit snappy answer the stupid questions we we came up here with our own if you could maybe response you some of these sort of these nostrums these canard the econ one to one understanding of the economy and economics so starting with something you on all the time
i'm
you can't raise the minimum wage because it'll cost jobs and going to raise the minimum wage
less money so they're not going to hire people to begin with albert that one just while it's wonderful i love that one i get it my classes all along
it comes out of the basic supply and demand analysis
young people are taught in economics places and as far as that goes it is absolutely correct if you raise the price of anything they'll be less purchases of it because some people will be priced out if the the ice cream cone in the corner doubled in price will be some people a neighborhood we're not gonna buy ice cream can't at least not as often as it used to cause it's more money than
they can afford if you raise the price of a worker they'll be less employers buying their labor than they did before if nothing else changes that's true they will be a few less people now you would have to then way if you raise the minimum wage the damage to the people who lose their job as a result
as against the benefit to the people whose wages are going up as a result of this most of the republican and conservative forget that second part they said it will be fewer jobs okay there might be a now we have to ask what about the people who have minimum has gone up with at rising minimum wage what about
them first of all an old they're going to be better off cause they have more money to spend than they used the for their job that they do but then we have to follow the little bouncing ball if the people who have more spend that more they'll be greater demand for goods and services and that will mean employers have higher
more people now we have to answer the question how many more people will they hire to meet the higher purchasing compared to the people they won't tire because the cost of labor is are we have to work all that out bottom line when you do the actual you actually look at what happens when wages go up you discover that sometimes they go up
are fewer unemployed other times as a more it varies but there is no automatic situation that dictates if it goes up you shouldn't if you raise the minimum wage you shouldn't do it because some people lose their job that's just childish les mis understanding how you do an analysis of this
cut and a good teacher would teach that to their students the teacher leaves it at the level of gee if the wage goes up some employers won't hire you therefore you shouldn't do it that's a leap for which neither logic know economics provide any justification and you don't have to be a left winger to do that anybody who understands the theory
would teach the students that here's another one this is this
when you hear a lot and it's one of my favorites
how about the idea that the government should run its budget like a family
by the government should run its budget like a family like we shouldn't overspent you know we have an x amount of money for the month and we can't go above that and we have we have to get the money we have to divide up if we go over that are checking accounts going to be overdrawn so like i said there's there's a certain logic there that seems to make sense but why is this folly let's falling for so many reasons
takes your breath away let's start
anybody who's in a family in the united states to they are almost anybody understands that there are very important things that a family needs to do which require them to spend more money than they have let me give you a couple of examples most american families understand that their children will have a
better future if they have a college education than if they don't
but they don't have the money to spend the roughly two hundred thousand dollars more or less than it now cause to send your kid to get four years of college so guess what they do they spend more than they have how do they do it by borrowing and they do it because of the confidence that even though it's bird
some to have a dead that's less of a lost to you then for going a college education for your children so they do it
the government is exactly the same the things the government needs to do that it doesn't have the money for it will sometimes borrow because it's more important to have that result with a debt than to avoid a debt and not have that result so the notion of an equation doesn't break down when you say gee
it ought to behave like a family because families are going into debt all the time
average american family now is more than one hundred thousand dollars and then if you add up the mortgage that they carry the automobile that that they carry the credit card debt that they carry and the college student those before major crimes of credit in our society
than the average american family is borrowing like there's no tomorrow we couldn't have people in their own homes if they didn't borrow do we believe in a home ownership society every president for the last fifty has said we believe in it while the only way americans can afford a house is if they borrow so if you believe that it's valuable that
people in their own home then they have to spend more than they earn the same logic applies to the government should be understood in those terms the difference with the government is that the money it gets is not by and large from the production it carries out for a working class family right if you go to work you do a job
get paid the government does some of that those some production but most of its income comes by taxing so the real issue is that the government goes into debt because it doesn't raise enough in taxes if it did it wouldn't have to go into debt so my response to people who say the gov
men shouldn't borrow in excess of funny i agree it should tax the money and who should attacks it from you can guess where i would call it should tax from the people who have the most money to pay the rich and the corporations should be taxed and use the punchline if you allow
ow me
when you cut the taxes of corporations and the rich the way we did in december of two thousand and seventeen
you create of course the need for the government to borrow unless the government is prepared to cut spending on everything
schools hospitals roads and everything else how is it going to get by having cut taxes on corporations and the rich as much as they did and still be able to spend what they have to spend the answer is they have to borrow and here comes the punchline who does the government borrow for from in order to keep going after cutting the tag
says the only people who can lend the money to the government or the corporations and the rich will lend to the government the money that they used to paying taxes that's why it's the biggest hustle since sliced bread
because by cutting the taxes that government has basically said instead of taxing it from you were gonna borrow it from you with this hey you back and pay interest while we wait this is a system designed by the devil to solve problems of the government by making the rich even richer
it's the real issue
perfect segue into my the last of these canard this is the last one here is moving out of econ one or one ideology and the harder stuff
yet now into the real free base of libertarian ideology and that is this is a great phrase of seeing more and more these days taxation is theft
got the government is stealing money all these people that you want it to tax the rich people corporations the government is using their implicit monopoly on force to threaten the most productive people did literally rob from them to take their money
out of their pocket at gunpoint every effort of a private capitalist society for the last three hundred odd years that we've had capitalism as a system has given to the government an enormous role in doing all kinds of things that they the capitalists either
can't or don't want to do themselves
defense
a judicial system where they can resolve their disputes without shooting at each other and a whole host of other activities
unless you allow the government to organize itself as an enterprise selling goods and services which capitalists have not wanted them to do for fear of the competition that would come from them than there is no alternative but to tax the people somehow to raise the money to have a defense to have a judicial system
they have a public works program roads at all the rest of it so you can call in any name you want you can call it that just means you don't like it but unless you have some alternative way to get these collective goods doesn't all the public part in the highway and the defense and all the rest of it unless you have some of the
or alternative that you've never told us about than calling the taxation is theft is neither here nor there you're playing with the words and i can play with those words to give you an example i can show you that the cost of producing an automobile is somewhere in the neighborhood of twelve or thirteen thousand dollars well then why are we
charge twenty five thousand it's theft i could call
why should i am i can do this i can do the same silly game that company that and afford a general motors are any of the others
isn't satisfied with getting the amount of money
back for selling the car that it costs to produce it
they want to pay for the advertising to get you to buy it they want to expand their production they want to cry robots then lots of other expenses solid jack up the price in order to cover the rest of what they do but that's no different from what the government does is raise the money in taxes to do what they are called upon to do calling it theft just means you don't want to
pay the same people who say that about the government would be shocked if they heard me explain that a third of the price of everything you buy his fat schmuck
i've got an outcome you're not complaining about being ripped off every day in a supermarket where that americans would buy that most americans feel ripped off in its obamacare if you hooked up but i think it would say that like well no one's forcing you to buy the car you just live in a society where you have to have a card you have enjoy how hard i don't think all with the force of go a super mario
yeah good unless you grow up in your back yard
you are by your life forced do is just like the only broadly now we're sitting here
in brooklyn and twenty first century america
what he think what does it mean to consider yourself
a marxist in twenty first century in america and is it different than if we had been in nineteenth century europe
yeah it is different i mean let me answer the first part
i'm a critic of capital the all for me marxism means is i've lived in capitalism all my life i was born united states have lived all my life united states i'm a citizen i think i understand this system both in terms of living in it and studying at all my life and i think that basically we can do better than capitalism just like the world
better than slavery and feudalism we can do better than capitalism and i have no reason in my life to shut my brain down or shut my critical capacities down capitalism as if it didn't deserve the same criticism that i would give to a school system i thought we could do better then or transportation system or and enter
gee system
i feel kind of proud of americans i really do that were critical of even having a debate these days about what his marriage what is gender of good those things should be questioned why don't we question capital is what is it about capitalism that it gets a pass and my judgment is you'll get a pass to an institution in your society for fifty
we've done it rots it doesn't work real well because criticism is how you identified flaws and mistakes maybe even think some maybe even figure out how to do better we should have been doing that for fifty years we haven't so for me i'm a marxist because i'm a critic of capitalism and if you are a critic of capitalism
and you take it seriously which i do then you find your way back to marks and marxists because it's the most developed school of criticism of capitalism we have mock starts in the middle the nineteenth century and he's basically saying i thought capitalism was going to be the wonderful thing everybody
thomas to call marks and there's a film by the way you can see these days the young call circular circulating around it's actually i've seen it now it's actually pretty good you know all things considered
so marxist grows up in the wake in the german wake of the french revolution the slogans their liberty equality fraternity he believed all of that he welcome this new world where we would have liberty equality and fraternity you could add democracy but he's a little later
fifty years after the french revolution he looks around germany which is way he comes from and he says we got capitalism which promised liberty equality fraternity we got to capitalism
but the liberty the fraternity not even close and equality
make me laugh it's is the anyone so he he says what what happened what went wrong it's almost as though you could say he felt that the revolution had been betrayed in some way not by some people but they didn't achieve what it set out and he said
i'm my contribution i'm going to figure out why that was make a long story short his conclusion was capitalism is not the vehicle that brings liberty equality fraternity capitalism is the obstacle capitalism thought it was different but it isn't in the past we had master slave lord surf employer employee
he isn't the end of that is just another form of that and that's the problem and we have to break out of that that's why i advocate for work or caught it's no more them and us it's the workers themselves running their own enterprise they are their own bosses it's a different kind of universe and for me
the marks i answer the question or your my says yes because i want to kind of push back against people who think that i should disassociate myself i don't does everything mark say make sense no does he make mistakes you betcha
he's not
a mythical figure body is the guy who started this whole thing and i read him with the same respect that i use when i read adam smith a david ricardo because they also understood a lot of things i need to to grass it's just they were partisans of this system and mark was a critic of that system and that's why i'm a marks
and that's all it means that he can teach me for example that the break we need is to get rid of the top and the bottom to get rid of the hierarchy and the the structure of a capitalist enterprise by a collective democratic way of organizing production for the same logic that made us get rid of mana
thirties and dictatorships in the political sphere we should have done it long ago but to this question of what it means in the twenty first century if mars destroy capitalism to class based system of power
obviously the circumstances have changed a lot of maybe lot as mean the same but like i'm just weren't interested in marxist classical understanding of what a worker in working class was who like who fits that definition in twenty first century america because obviously the workplace has changed dramatically
from the times in which marks as reading i guess i would argue with you here i don't think it's changed the technology has changed of caution that particular ways we do our work in the machines and computers and robots and all the rest of and have changed but that was true across marxists lifetime the technological
changes from the beginning of the nineteenth century to the end struck those people as unprecedented i mean they had steam engines at the end they didn't really mm at the beginning they etc etc etc so i'm not so impressed oh yes that's the best way to put it by the technological changes because they didn't alter the basic
human relations and that's what marx was always interested in it wasn't interested in the details he was interested in how human beings interacted with one another in production
and the notion that some people give all the orders and some people are in charge and everybody else comes to work does what they're told and goes on and watches tv this relationship between people is for him the problem out of which the conflicts come out of which the contradictions of this system and its flaws
com which is why he wants to change it so the answer your question simply most americans right now in the united states are perfect examples of the working class of people as marks the find it and let me just explain it in the way that i think might work
if you're looking for a job and you shut down you go to find a private employer most americans or from private employers you sit down you have a conversation with this person human relations person though the human resources that we we call it these days the boss
and you talk about all the different things about the job and you get to the the tough part how much am i gonna get paid and the employer says for example the well i'm gonna pay you i offer you twenty dollars an hour
and let's say you agree a while work for twenty dollars an hour
you know something now but you repress it does marches argument here's what you know the only reason that employer will ever give you twenty dollars every hour that you come is if what you help him to produce what you make the good
service
is worth more than twenty dollars for every hour that you work why because of what you produced was twenty dollars worth of extra stuff in this know he'd sell it get to twenty dollars pay you what he get he didn't get squat nothing sip so the only way you'll get a job in capitalism
i'm in a private employment
is if you produce more during each hour of your labor than you are paid which means what you have to face which is so hard for americans
is it the notion that you would never work for anybody who doesn't pay you what you're worth means you don't understand the system in which you are trapped you always are ripped off that's why those days when you walk home from the job and stop at the happy hour on the way to make yourself feel better you're right you don't just feel
doth you've been ripped off the work will always produces more because that's the only basis on which the employer will give him or a job this situation is the situation of the american working class and it either except sit as inevitable natural law any other excuse it wants
or it sets itself as like me a critic of a system why in the world does it work like this
why aren't we collectively producing more than we pay ourselves but we as owners operators of the collective worker cola we decide what's done with that extra rather than passing it off to another person who enriches himself that way and thereby guarantees that next week next month or next year we will be in the
same situation i don't get enough to get his drop he makes the surplus as marx would put it which keeps him in that position and that's how capitalism reproduces itself so i would argue that's while marks is relevant because he teaches this lesson and from that much understanding of the system flaws
net that's the great lakes
like just good
there's like a future way forward it's people just
confronting that sense of being ripped off because putting it in the negatively yeah pretty good and putting it in terms of people can relate to because we are and i think this i think we all we're all so obsessed with getting ripped off and we think that like welfare queens are ripping us off and on we think that the guy the used car lot
bring us all and it's all like we're celebrating our sense that we're getting ripped off it worth the alienation that happens with worden and we can't confront it because it's too dangerous that's so we celebrate it and were so they're still getting ripped off everywhere else but the place where our fundamental rip off and without happening by and if there was a few questions miserable at their job comes home and kicks
the door like the dog had nothing to do with the dog is innocent but you can't confirm how miserable you are the job because that scary you need the job so the dog was going to come up in love you anyway which is why you got that door
you get yes it it it creates of course this is marches point a lot of time it creates a very unhappy society and a lot of unhappy people because they can't confront what really bothers them then they behave in a way which some they know is irrational and crazy to write that confronted they get angry at the welfare queen and then
next week someone tells him about a person on welfare what their lives are really like and they kind of have a moment where they realized gee i didn't quite square with one eye for myself as a
it's a society that is messed up by its inability to confront what marks calls exploitation this business where you produces surplus for somebody else rather than for yourself trying to imagine the marxist image here it's christmas it's a party a christmas party for all the workers the
it's been a rickety table and because he sat around their neck and i use your apartment devon of hurt right
get these wrong
he thinks everybody all the people have gathered for their christmas party so i want to thank you all you worked so hard you made this a very successful you are profits were or whatever
in that moment this drunken employer recognizes that everybody contributed to the profits of that company he doesn't ask himself the question if they all help to produce it
why are they all excluded from decided what happens to what
how is it that high and three other people will make the decision what to do with the profits that they that they helped to produce know how come there that may hit me and the answers
a point they feel ripped off from something and they may not be able to say at the em malin be able to say it to themselves
but it doesn't go away
less than a psychology teaches you that that sits there and festered and it messes up much of the rest of the society's life and into relationships very hard
not to be overly dramatic how do you formulate a loving relationship with another person
if you're constantly either in the position of ripping off or being ripped off
you really think you can separate yourself into airtight compartments what you do with your boyfriend or your girlfriend is not affected by the bitterness is and the unresolved tensions of the rest of your life don't be crazy that's why so many people can't have emotionally equalized relationships with other
people know what that is never encountered it they live in a world which doesn't work like that and they know that somewhere but they can apply it if we taught them if we allowed the marxism
the insights to be taught so that people could think about whether they were relevant whether they help understand life for not then i think we would have been much much further ahead the loser in this country from closing us off the marxism has been this country
in many many ways it wasn't smart it was a fearful and fear driven reaction childish one you to overcome an idea by pretending it isn't there
three year olds three year old children when they're confronted by a scary dog put their fingers in front of their eyes because they imagine that if i can't see the old isn't there it takes a while to mature to get to the point the realize that dog is still there even if i go like this
american colleges
progress that they thought if they put their fingers in front of it and the joke is we now have a new movie about karl marx which by the way portrays him thoroughly sympathies that year old the movie he's very sympathetic you'd be on the thought as the hallmarks young he's hot
so i think we can just say it's twenty first century america
the dog is still there is a little scary
