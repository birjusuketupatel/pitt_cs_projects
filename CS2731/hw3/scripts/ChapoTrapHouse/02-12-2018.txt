the bill kristol those not by toes all your neighbors it's like right now is we're all the whole me that makes each other bus
my least favorite thing about those pods seven america guys like their names are just jon lovitz and jon favreau commandos your
me you should have yeah and because all you're doing is you're setting everyone up for disappointment when you're not those
if there is a power guess the jon lovitz oh wow
yeah he would have a they really have something to get mad about complaining about trans a steak
on one end victoria jackson
rip funny like that whole generation of us and people early nineties
first post eighties renaissance go to go people they're all reactionary psychopath our nighter rob schneider generals rocket would have changed his name charles martel
to discover that was actually slightly earlier
they're all reactionary to talk to a one handler said
always was a it definitely in either smile
miller victoria jackson
i'm glad we don't get to know what chris farley his politics he was a right winger at the time you did he did fund raisers with newt gingrich oh really
that's just like fat guy solidarity
who's actually like whoa beard is out after that
we'll be talking more about the the pod save america guys a little bit later
but just to begin with
well first of all sitting in this week let me introduce their guess it's a star of the same medicare for all campaign dino welcome thank you thanks for them
also from philadelphia
three from philadelphia mean the guy that eat the shit greatest
it's the greatest city in the world goes i don't know if he goes watch sports photo they won the superbowl recently which makes on the world champions of all sports i don't understand why is this oh so good
the superbowl what makes it a rest in peace tree bro
really
so yeah how how how did that shit taste oh solicits i mean it was it was all the better when there were literally three million philadelphians in the streets
you sort of it was there a lot of left us who are like you know it's too bad we couldn't get people to do this sort of thing for a political thing but i felt the opposite i was like this in in seemingly it shows how fragile like the city government and the state is this the city was totally overwhelmed with just insane people and
all we needed to do was win a super bowl like we could we could definitely do that again i don't know i mean i don't honestly i don't think the cops are just going to do the same they're not going to treat people who were like writing or and super bowl the same way they're going to treat like a popular uprising now been a popular as praising would include the people like we're eating shit oh can you imagine
provisional government we are
the the lead in his late don't doc guys and all those cops and in philadelphia the reason they're not going to crack heads there is because they all have on the on one arm they've got the eagles had two and then the the nazi eagle was just one tattoo
now that either wearing out
eagle where he riot or skeeter as yeah man oh man day the regular races in the patriots are the fascists are aces and obviously the correct position is to root for philly
russ folks ever frost supporting risk business model yeah
eagle like he defected to america before hitler committed suicide and as part of operation paper clip your like we have a job for you you're dealing with ads in the parking lot know you're good of the football
old logo we're going to give you cosmetics or
i did that was one of the best
right up
because beautiful
i'm in philadelphia people are amazing i was watching local broadcast the year to ago and the interview this woman the parking lot and they're like so tell us what you're here for and she's like i had my baby girl just and so we're doing jello shots and park and lie for gimme a
the resilience if it is
the funny really joke but it is like that's incredibly resilient like that and it's like stalingrad that's a
for free it into the less serious topics than sports philly philadelphia is now world champions but for some reason the world is continuing this charade of another sporting event that's going on right now where they compete for some reason even know the outcome is already were determined and philadelphia one
just cook as
net she looks you guys watch the olympic opening ceremony the winter olympics ceremony the parade of nations
what were your thoughts my thoughts were was just another piece of evidence that china will destroy us all because the beijing opening ceremony has proved it was a show of force it was a show of social solidarity and power and know people have come close to matching it since then
when they tried to do you will the human grouping thing that they did in beijing but with a fraction of the number of people a fraction of the choreography it was it was a virgin
olympic opening ceremonies to the chat opening ceremonies of beijing china china's opening ceremony other year
incorporated thirteen point eight billion
meanwhile it was just yeah it was like watching a community theater production frankly heard to china but
the walkouts i guess
no one really no one really to me
anything that tongue and guy the guy was pretty wet
valid reason he was very least he was getting you're very attractive but like you would be like a slippery fish there's nothing i could deal with that
well he is presumably not wearing the oil in his day to day life and i you think yeah but you're trying to conceptual allies this thing and it's just like it's very it's very graphs
mostly whenever i watch so opening ceremony as i just watched the micro nations and i just get annoyed micro nation around and i'm like
why are you where you why do you exist and get over your fuck itself
should just be absorbed you should all be absorbed your precious little little boutique it's basically like oh we're like colonial williamsburg but we're going to have a passports fuck you you should just be part of the surrounding gunter i actually disagree i think the big countries have to get over themselves and we should have three hundred dollars
small countries
i think the entire world should be like the break up the austro hungarian empire i don't care figure it out
the future offend is nice and so is the future of nation states
for me it just the results are with is almost always the case is it's somebody with dual citizenship who live somewhere else and it's from there but sell and can't make the olympic team there so they go oh i'm also from monaco or whatever so that they can walk other bermuda shorts in the thing and then get hosed
the he should be was just so you can wave a flag
there's an entire industry and that was leveling passports
it's very big with gymnasts
so that they can compete at the olympic level yeah because they're not good enough that it has learned about this country naval matt was the only person who didn't clap at the end of cool runnings
key air is pathetic
yeah i mean we went through the entire ceremony and
no we saw a lot of those former eastern european states where they love being nazis the pm is a room
they seemed happy to be there and it's obviously late whatever you guys get up to over there whatever whatever keys is about coming together yeah and when it keeps them from for grooming everyone
this winter olympics too and that's like there's are you telling us like al rocha that said it knows bryant gumbel travel a lot of doctor saying correctly that it's reverse affirmative action for white one
if you look at the summer olympics it's all like amazing sports that require supreme coordination and ability it's the judo weightlifting boxing gymnasts i like curling but it is bowling for fat and orestes yeah
yeah all it's all okay what do i don't know what are the winter olympic events it's like playing janko
marilyn think of it they all
everyone but curling requires incredible out hard hardliners hockey
visitors and he's alive
i business guy he children do it all
i like figure skating is an ultra gay homo but it's not a sport no incredible athletic again
it was out as you you lads who a bunch of ass holes to determine whether you did a good enough yes
i believe in creating a competitive
basis for something that is essentially a fancy art form yeah exactly you're trying to report to put the number on something that is on quantifiable so it's not really i just found out the speaking about affirmative exploit rule
only two countries in history from below the equator have won a medal
at the winter olympics
he guess what they are australia yes
yes
the way what to say wait a white settlers colonies are the only ones that have won olympic medals the they will literally settler colonialism a laser for hours
but just broken let's go around what's everyone's favorite winter olympic event
by avalon
store so my under right on rules is that the one with the gun shooting skiing
simulating the winter war basically between finland and run anymore
it's entering just lurking is the white death and having injuries and snake yeah
scandinavian gang
that's so you do
yeah
oh i was going to say it by off along because it crosses shooting and cross country skiing i mean that's nice but i love it
assume by arthur on i'm gonna go to man
where it's just you're literally on a tiny sled and it's just lying down as an another them lying on top
yo gives you get and like
i honestly think that the guy on top stays anchored just by having a big perfect
the socket yeah and roddick spawning at high speed
going like one hundred and ten miles an hour yeah like it's extreme spinning india
yes the best way to have sex
you know what soaking is outside the mormons do or the will like oh man will leave his dick in the one policy for like two hours this is a learning
like tensions sex those and not even that or even moving honestly scotland
what says she can
her her
whatever mormon faith in his can in fact his penis or something there's a lot of weird science behind it it's cool
this but i mean that's obviously my favorite winter
my second favorite mormons a better grade winter i left back oh my god that's all they do all they do is gone skiing vacations and should and make like little interactive photo albums on facebook with a song you can turn off
my favorite i would have to say probably snow boarding or skiing for the same reasons and that all the competitors those boards are just like fucking happy little working dogs
such a vacant there are so happy
they have no internal monologue or anxieties are fears just like when they're walking out you saw them this year in every year they're just looking up at the root of like he wrote all around
they're so dumb and beautiful and happy it's really nice i think it's nice that we have better then for those people yeah it's nice and a chance to shine
i would say figure skating but again not a sport but i like watch it is the premier events of i don't deny that
not a sport it's an art
so i think it said i will actually go with curling because i like any sport you can hold a beer while doing yeah i don't i also like patchy horseshoe this bowling ah great the stopped mid western heroes of curling are always from create an entirely new olympics just for things that are like kind of not really sports like curling shuffle board
curling game he looks like you in fact damon had a baby matt
oh yeah that's what's his name peter peterson has the brothers the mixed the mix curling team the us weeks curling team his brother sister and they look like extra from fargo it's pretty cool i will to say if fears games that allow them to say ice dancing and take the going to go gayer than ice dancing is unbelievable
yeah they do all yeah and
judging of it i don't know somebody was mad about the fact that they're judge but the judging was insane the judge was like well you see they came around the corner there and the one blade was four inches too close to their partners played as they did a triple axel so they're going to get docked points for that which is just like i don't know that's impressive it is impressive i just don't think
it's a sport
see out just best of what's all the countries
everyone play hard and croatia
fuck to the crow it
serbia will rise ahead
i can't wait for probably we're going to be limited to the world deserves four years where every the entire world is greater serbia and different districts have greater serbia competing against each other
serbia serbia middle east serbia antarctica just all the serbia franchises entire world covered in serbia
so yeah that's the that's the sports report for the day
let's move on
some less serious issues of life death and politics in the united states
so do you guys saw about this week goes where are my favorite things the the inauguration of a new a new group movement a new movement yeah new grassroots movement to change the way healthcare exists in america and ensure that all americans have access to quality health care
quality affordable healthcare i'm talking of course about the united states of care lords yes there once we were going to save us from the twin horrors of republican austerity and democratic and austerity no
the republican as thirty and though
the overly political horror of single payer it's to political right people get all riled up and political about and then
you don't want lotta you want a non political solution to healthcare that's what they're going to give us with the help of the fucking richter soil so i bumble bee men and i'm john tune and i'm current united states attorney general jeb so sure they're all part of the united states
i started this because john fade star of pod save america
absolute chump and room of the highest or who you know someone who claims know on his show and in public that he has it been not even being the coolest jon favreau he says he's he's if he supports medicare for all and he wants that but he has also lends his name and platform to this united states of care
her again grassroots activists legitimate which has which says it has no policy yet
it's got is blue sky and it whatever it was so are not criticizing ideas
heather with with andy richter and the pods america as hall and bill frist and a bunch of healthcare insurance executives going to cook at ourselves than one or whatever
three highly specific principles united the united states of care that hit us with a star are one of my headphones
affordable source of care every american should have an affordable regular source of care for themselves and their families left order to lord of all yeah diplomacy as affordable i am yeah like every to for like a portable doesn't radically differ depending on a person's income is this is my grandmother make the
very of your term is affordable than you're already talking means testing because you'd have to you because some people can afford more than others yeah you're already opening a can of shit worms that got us the which has already been gutted and was highly unpopular and helped lead to the destruction of the democratic majority of this thousand
you're right we're currently beginning did they have some focus group with people who lake
it got lost in the lobby of the land and gordon
a few years ago because affordable care yeah it's literally in the name of their signature bill in and just the jury
my friend saying actually diane von furstenberg has really good sales amber when you're trying to give me to blow money on a dress
affordable case in your mouth like tap water you left in your room for three days
a little bubbles it's like up
a lot of something going to be on i grow grass right after my tap water consumption
you think i keep it suddenly started to talk you into coming into a restaurant and animal it's a little far away it's affordable that's that and enticements will know that a focus group was probably like do you guys like affordable healthcare do you like taxes
because if those are your options
you know it's not a tax paying three hundred dollars a month to jared kushner his brother for insurance you can only get covered if you literally have to buy for sticking out of your forehead you can only go to hospitals where your wrapped up with all your home is and your leg is elevated in year and a full body cast with
one i peaking and you said
pay five grab in deductibles yeah yeah it covers pellagra and miners lawn and
like damage shit affordable
technically bankrupt
lord principal number two
protection from financial devastation
all americans should be protected from financial devastation because of illness or injury how does that differ from the for that is the best part is that they're assuming that even you can achieve number one number two is a separate be possible the as if we have affordable care we might still financial devastation so right right
the brain trust the pr people were sitting around there are like okay so what do we stand for and then they say with a really good they're like can we had this out to three
two thousand and three have a rule of threes
as a big internal debate between count jocular and trent lott over whether they should should say it's good or bad if people get wiped out
i also like again the the word devastation it's just like people are getting cranston lag horrible ways and you can say they're not technically devastated there's a lot of wiggle room with that station and so i'll just say i not not destitute and homeless the last one leg you got the other one though they hop around
and i guess minor medical bankruptcy was okay under principle to yeah if you can
final chapter seven right it's fine if you can get yourself out of minor medical bankruptcy but utter devastation it's like as long as two law firm a shitty repo man movie doesn't literally come to take the oregon with a transplant and a new than you're fine no repossess your organs that semtex for that i've already wet
we've we've in this magic trick
you've now seen the pledge
turn here is the prestige age group
third principle political and economic viability
hawk and home policies to achieve these aims must be fiscally responsible and when the political support needed to ensure long that terms with buddy
but a you already have of my boy pussy with politically viable
financially financially as are fiscally responsible my go about it
as a koreans because the other thing that they say over and over again on that page is that the real goal is to take politics out of our take politics out of healthcare to make it not political to put people not politics
very first thing in their mission statement says the mission of united states of care is to ensure that every single america has access to all of our and he goes in new non partisan nonprofit we are building and mobilizing a movement to achieve long lasting solutions that make health care better for everyone
to care will make that happen by working with americans from across the country policy makers physicians and other clinicians caregivers and business and he goes we must change the conversation and create a new narrative that puts health care over politics by redefining the goal in human not political turn politics is is is conceived carried out by of
series of robots that we've built in supporting a positive practical and lasting approach there is also a frequently asked question section that i also checked out i just want to say that anybody who reads that and signs up i can excuse a dollar like andy richter when a rather more on celebrities they got on this thing yeah i'm a new wipes his ass with a live rabbit
all i want to make it through the opponent but anybody who works in politics or claims to know anything about it like favour oh they should be fucking driven into the sea for that kind of malpractice he can say that anything that involves the distribution of scarce resources can be taken away for the political you literally
don't understand what those words mean because they underestimate people they know what it means they're just it's entirely cynical it's one hundred percent that's true i don't like people don't like politics are they like a human's politics bad
like the boilerplate thing of like yeah let's get those washington fat cats out of here yeah it's like it's like the populism you would have on like a children's cartoon it's very service level and lane but i think the most telling thing about is that it's sort of stuck in the mid nineties
like something that would be in the in some sort of like reform party campaign ad you know let's get let's get politics out of all of this stuff politics is is rotten zoo at islands x in these pilots that is such like gender
your intergenerational warfare is reactionary but that is such generous and boomer mindset when you're like oh politics is but hey that means many and kicks means
he's
it's the opposite of congress
progress and that sort of like limp dick
apathy but it's still moralizing it's a loss of faith in an actual like populism and it's honestly display such like a contempt for people like to believe that they're stupid enough to swallow this and you have to like wrap this turn in sugar and then lead and now i was following this and i was falling save stars are reactions
this because a lot of people who are pod save america fans were actually
upset by this and they were like hey like if you want to support an actual medicare for all campaign there are many grassroots groups right now organize around this very issue like why you signing on to what is obviously like an astro turf an astroturf attempt by the health insurance industry to claw back their profits from a potential because there are also very him
now let me just finish would favour said is he saying look it's going to be it until at least twenty twenty until we can have any kind of positive move it like at the very least twenty twenty and to have any kind of positive change in regards to health care enough people to actually support make medicare for all reality so i he says i see
port that but until then i'm going to do everything possible seemed like help people and make everyone's life better and this group is just one way to do that like we're open to all things and all solutions and halo get this i heard something that's in direct competition with a far more popular and far more progress act well i mean he would say like why
i can't work with people who i don't agree with to do something positive but they never actually see what that something positive is
see the list that's one thing i want to just three hundred things one more thing here from the frequently asked question section why do you support principles and says naming policies the guy is oh i love that leading as question
or do you believe in it
stupid policies but he goes their response here is we launched with the focus on principles to keep open the largest range of potential solutions by remaining focused on the outcome vs getting attached to a single policy ideas from the outset we believe we can better find a path forward we will evaluate policy i
vs on their merits and alignment with our principles and their ability to make health care more accessible and affordable to everyone part of our work in evaluating and creating policies will be done in partnership with pen el di this week we published a paper evaluating several recent state level attempts to provide healthcare coverage to more people including single payer by in and
expansion policies this review is the first step and or partnership and we will do additional studies on multiple approaches including examining costs were really just in a fact finding phase right now
however the principal based system is not inherently wrong
right include the principles have to be actual principles and actually dino if you want to talk about it was going to say i i think it's kind of funny because we did the same thing if you go to medicare for all the yeah i like it is actually kind of funny because it sounds like they they they copied and they copied but we have five
oh yeah
five zero five three and then we spent the entire diaz a budget on those last two birds
worth it
but but our principles are actually like they help explain what medicare for all system means and it's important program magically in education wise to do something like this but we actually say we want a single health program that everybody is covered with comprehensive coverage for everybody we want it free at the point of service we want universal coverage and we won
a jobs program to have a just transition but all of those things unfortunately are are very political and they require political models
and as as you can't get a bunch of stakeholders together to hash it out behind closed doors you know look i think that politics is really best when you get a bunch of elite harvard educated folks to talk on on a nice slick website to try to convince people of their of their policies so that's what we're actually going to do we were invited john favour and he's going to now
in our camp and he's going to do a gas next we talking about why medicare for all is better than us of care so we think that a work
the larger issue here is i think we should i mean the the united states a care lords is laughable and any effort that has on its director douglas holds he can and bill frist is not going to produce any even cosmetic only positive result for how any any person who needs health care in this country
now how do you know that bill frist has a huge ideological shift over the years
you don't know if you could he could have rosa image in his display name on a secret twitter right now those cats that he tortured to death as a child came back to him like marley
that oh he had a revelation
the broader point though is i think we should look at the fact that the united states of care exists as a very positive sign in the fact that they are that they're clearly and this is why people are rightly even his fans are angry at favour oh is because this is obviously an attempts to forestall
if medicare for all not even a public option and healthcare this is a transparent attempt by the health insurance industry to forestall a the growing popularity and political reality of something that would call back their profit because the only this is a classic example of what sort of reaction kind of shooting itself in the foot by just
not taking yes for an answer obama care was the only viable free market reform and to healthcare the could plausibly be said to increase access and affordability and stuff and it was hated by half of the population for ideological and mature and reasons and hey
goodbye and then he was destroyed aided by anyone who had to use that plan also hated by people in disillusion anyone who is supposed to help because it was shitty and it left a bunch of people on a shirt and other people forced to get coverage that they couldn't afford but it's the only way the oh so now that it's collapsing now that i mean the mandates gone no one thinks it's viable
we're in a situation and republicans say this and the right like lindsey graham wattles out and says i'm afraid now that the only alternative is single but yes it is and so these guys are basically good just going to try to frankenstein obama arrogant
because all the things they're talking about anything you're going to talk about in terms of it's all just going to be subsidies or if i had no more committed to half measures than they are any politics but so it's going to be rabbits season and duck season forever
to be blue way they'll get in there and they'll be some new hair brained shit that will still help a lot of people because the current system is so fucking bad by default any marginal improvement help a fair amount of people but just not nearly enough people still go bankrupt and that change will always be something and if we're gonna we're going to license to be
software for for arc and ambulances were going to for we're going to force you know going to force you to keep a savings account to pay your kobe's and shit and then it's going to be duck season again the republicans are going to get in there and do the running man
speaking of over though thank you for bringing this up
true though
i am always bring going i showed up
user at liking online who did a deep dive a the main force behind this guy andy slavic who out it slave it yeah that slap slap slap who is like was a point man in in fighting against a repeal and cause some good will on the left save several as oh you have saved health care doctor
yeah
love that websites and he is the got yes he saved though he saved the website
and that he's the guy that sort of love it is pointing out to like this is you know this is a real friend and he's involved and and i'm happy to support anything he and this
guy is also an investor and one of the things he is investing in as a new fund that put money into health care start ups that are built on underserved communities this is sort of like micro lies for healthcare which as we all know led to thousands of and now in a internet farmers jump
wells when they couldn't pay back their micro hi i'm montel williams so i'm andy slab this is from an article or new project at the news that like your mind found
talked to slap it about his investments one of them wasn't a company called circulation health which is a non emergency transportation company to get patients to medical appointments
and slab of pointed out that the common theme these companies as that they provide much needed services behind their technology is quote there is room for cool innovation
what is air be and be doing what are all those companies doing they logistically give people more opportunities these companies that are about improving people's lives is uber a tech company is air be and be a tech company in a manner of speaking yes but they are but it's really about identifying services to make people's lives better say over and every and be for healthcare i know
what i want in a healthcare experience is that it is cool innovative yeah not that you could just go into a hospital and get fucking fixed speak for yourself i want to revolutionize health care in the way that a full cycle changed cycling clauses it's i want to like location of healthcare china direct i want a nightclub called
the music
i want to who i want to cool environment of other young professionals when the doctor comes in with his little one piece headset is like all of you have to stop eating golden brown food that are gonna die but don't mix
the love it says well we can't do anything positive to two thousand and twenty so you have to do something in the meantime well nothing creating this shit is not going to change the dynamics in a white house and in the funding in the congress what it's going to do is maybe provide something for people running in two thousand and twenty two point two and say medicare for all is a good guy
goal but we're not there yet and this is a good alternative that's what this exists to provide yeah i think it's really important to realize that i don't think that united states care i mean they've got hammered since since they came out and rightfully so from the left which i think is excellent but i don't think they really care about about winning any sort of popular support their aim is elite
politicians their aim is to say to to point to democrats and arguably republicans as a website claims and say hey here's a triangulation point we know you can't support medicare for all but you can support our three vague principles and that's a triangulation point for you to say i'm thinking about i'm researching it but i'm really on board with
mr mr what's his name slightest
yes it was a great very thick yeah
i know that you know i think that's a great point that i mean this is aimed at convincing democratic politicians and it's into creating to give them some kind of cover to like say to their base which is increasingly more and more in favor of something like medicare for or even single payer or even about nationalized healthcare
you know like to see only mode and rebuild the healthcare in rural areas where the national national should be the goal of is the absolute best yellow of course but like medicare for all right now is becoming increasingly popular like a realistic thing that could happen would you a lot of good in the short term yes however it's the biggest
little reform and the littlest thing extra for yeah
yes
running up against that die i want to highlight an article that was in vox this week the headline is spike guillen scott and the headline is why donald trump makes democratic voters uneasy about medicare for all and i think this is an interesting piece to highlight because it's interesting to sort of sauce out what's going on
here it's about a poll that was let me just start reading here
rick a fifty four year old school teacher who lives in washington dc area believes in american institutions he voted for hillary clinton he supports obama care and he believes healthcare is a universal right
democrats believe in healthcare barack obama he they quote rick is saying anyone here in this focus your with me like i would help you just like out how my own family because i think that supposed to be representative of what our nation is about and his belief in healthcare as a universal right is indicative of that
a single a single payer healthcare gains currency and democratic circles opinion research or michael perry gathered to focus groups of eight clinton voters last fall to interrogate six seen people sixteen clinton voted for on the cutting edge of the parting yeah and had a lady who said they will never ever happen
to interrogate what ordinary rank and file democrats think about single pair and other proposals to expand the medicare program to americans but surprisingly some of these democrats do not fully buy into a medicare for all plant blame donald trump
rick said he's seen president trumps administration chip away at the affordable care act after seizing power his faith in the government's ability to deliver dependable healthcare has been shaken before this particular administration i had a lot more trust in the government whether i agreed with what they had are not uncomfortable with the system that has run by the government and i would have said
that without equivocating rick told us but right now i'm a little iffy about it he wasn't alone i was going to say the same thing said ken sixty six year old consultant which government the rational american government in the past three decades i felt pretty good about but can wasn't so sure about donald trump's government trumps selection has left
lot of liberals on board they don't have quite the same faith and democratic norms are institutions that they use to the fact that from could be elected at all and dispenser the parts of obama care he disagrees with has shown them the frame seems of our political system you can get a sixty six year old consult on board
yeah were black pill they added really
ah submission
yes who can forget the logical reasonable government that went to war in iraq because fuck him calling paul hold a flashlight under his chin and story you know what though we shouldn't go to dracula lives and beg the i'm glad though were these guys are on board for abolishing the military
is it stayed well here's what you know they also the government also can be transferred that right what did the can't be trusted with healthcare when we stay with any of them are getting a year that like trump and largely hand in hand with the leadership of the democratic party has led quote liberal voters so far to the raid but there now like i no longer have to
trust in a national health care what the the institutions that they do have trusted are the fucking f b i and essay and they love those now more than anything but there are a bit iffy about
any government that could have donald trump was later i don't trust them
a you know what everyone laughed when people can gradually marco rubio on those third place wins and primary
we didn't even know it you're getting the by he is automatically one the democratic primary that's all those motherfuckers now they're all marco rubio yeah know this is such a reactionary talking point because it's just like the obama care what were those depth
that's exactly what this is like if we have medicare for all under trump the government will just like i don't know just have death panels that they would have had under obama but obama was a good guy so he didn't do that he wouldn't have killed your grandma or he would he would have killed up poor white folks we would have to because the deal said nugent
you want to execute man
it's fine it's fine for him to do signature drone strikes in the morning but then he's going to turn and he's going to signal
right on a piece of paper that you can't get an m r i also like i like the idea that this is indicative that anyone and our and the phrase that really jumped out at me was rank and file damage yes but there are now rank and file democrats we do not have a party system where people are members of a party
like there's literally no such thing as a rank it it's like rank and file a localized are incorrect yes yes exactly that's exactly what it is it's consumer choice yeah it's not even a political commitment you might register as a democrat you can unplug anytime you want you can vote for her however like there's no such thing we have no we have such an undemocratic party
system that the phrase rank and file democrats is almost insulting to use it means nothing also only talking taxes sixteen people and weather was a sixty six year old consultant the peace goes on said
to lay out the increase in popularity of something like a single payer bow of the talk about bernie sanders has made this more and more of like a non thing to talk about and then i guess to the end of the peace and and says democratic voters are receptive to an expanded medicare program one available
on the obama care marketplaces they could be receptive to a single pair program but they will still need some more convincing trumps selection has started to unravel their belief that the government could actually run such a system again i don't even think this is true or not but i have what we're seeing here with these efforts at polling and consulting in the console
putting rocket which is what the democratic party really exist those are the real rank and file democrats as he says and this fun it can be used as a consultant is that they are deal as you said they're looking for ways out of this fix because there is nothing that they you her more than a voting that really wants something that really wants them to know
with they want that knows that they want and that are would respond with scarf thing and skepticism about a group that just says our goal is to make health care better and will take any anything available as long as enough people agree to it when things that we're hearing back from like that canvassing campaign for medicare for all is that has
shockingly easy easiest yeah oh it's wildly popular i mean like the polling also is it's one of these pulling tricks where if you say they have it right here in this article they say a single government program and if you if you phrase it like that a lot more people are like mature but when you say medicare for all it's wildly popular because people know and trust medicare
they think that it's a good program that they have somebody they know that's on medicare that they feel like you know some sort of relationship with the actual institution of the state and a relationship with an institution and state that does something good for you rather than ice in the f b i and the police force and so it's just remarkable that that
among democrats we know it's wildly popular except for among those democrats who are like the mysteriously only upper middle class people that were polled here or not have been polled self selected for a focus group except among them which they don't really care about medicare for all because they have pretty good health insurance if you're in the upper middle class and you live in where these people from
dc you're probably a console for some major go and have a decent health package but if you're a worker and you're a regular person or a young person even if you're not a particularly liberal young person you want medicare for all you want free health care at the point of service and the only reason to not advocate for it is because you're in the pocket of big pharma you're in the pocket of the me
major industries
the backs of this favour a line that like hey look nothing's doing until we elect enough people to pass the legislation that we all want and that's not happening till at least twenty twenty this idea that well there's little while i guess we can't do anything until then that he's like what you should be doing remarkably entry and favour really supports medicare for all you should be putting his name
an effort to medicare for all program activists were actual grassroots groups that are organizing around this issue not this transparently fraudulent or she's like not sure that like like workers movements in this country have historically made a lot of games under right wing administration's not lately but
it it fucking happens this idea that we have to wait for the right time to do something like build a campaign especially when you're working in a grass roots situation where you just i mean in in philly and east bay in that people i've talked to you who have canvas even in small places they're just scoop him up
like you just they thought it was going to have to be a much more involved conversation canvassing and people are just like actually it's in really easy you get good door as you get bad during most of people like oh yeah definitely will and sanders name helps a tremendous milk so many people you know i don't i haven't seen the recent polling that as far as i know he's still the most popular politician in the country
three and his name
has so much credibility among folks when you're canvassing for medicare for all that you just mentioned it and they're like oh bernice plan of course i support bernice plan like he seems like he's got the right ideas
but no instead we should i mean i think part of this comes from the fact that the way these people conceive of politics is that it happens behind closed doors with policy wonks yep and until we can get all the policy wonks to run the right numbers we won't agree and they don't even think of the mass of voters as like a potential obstacle or someone to be
one over they think that at all is going to happen in some machine that happens but also as love it's big checkmate to anyone who was yelling at him the other day was do you have a planes in love it or favour
awesome position
one master blaster piece it's like lotto
are fused together a bit
yeah i consider them like me goes
cannibal
lot of excess access so whatever whatever one of the slugs is being all oh pretentious and very condescending to everyone who's so naive not to understand what it takes to get things done this is what's your oh you want this to happen what's your plan for for achieving it electing the critter
number of people who support it and then they pass it that's how it's always been done
you for that little wiggle room than you think are during during the campaign years because once you have enough broad support for things you can lay out a fucking red line and just be like you do not meet the standards and until you meet these standards you will not get the votes you can bully politicians you create i mean that's happened with other issue
choose you create list litmus tests and you can't possibly run to these people in this without gay rights warning that in yeah i don't worship to yeah people were just like know where we're drawing a fucking line in the sand and it push people like hillary clinton
but you fucking what elections
the the liberal the liberal legacy that these guys are so proud of her the twentieth century was passed basically because of two elections nineteen thirty two and nineteen sixty four and what happened was that some guy and the scenes machinations there's some complicated
interest group of balancing the one overwhelming majority is house and senate and past things that's it that's how you do it you crush them you defeat the forces who oppose the thing that you get enough americans to support that's it i mean i think speaking to that same idea seems like they think that
the best solution
is this like if everyone if it both sides are angry that like it must be good and they have this fundamental allergy in this united states of careful look this idea that you can remove political issues in the realm of politics it's also this idea they have like a complete allergy to ever identifying who the enemy is equation there's no more of the actual
malefactors that have made health care in this town
vaccine bad an amorphous concept of politics let's not like i had people come together and have learned how of their had an immunity politics happens and that makes it bad people had good and will know you scientists who have their health care is extremely complicated and yeah
anytime there's a failure it's because it's so complicated and we don't have enough smart people to think about how to make it better yeah that's true it comes down to the thing is is that when you do that thing where you say we'll both sides are mad we're creating a compromise what they're really does is make people disillusioned and makes people check out which is fine for the reactionary party
smaller electorates help them but your shedding people who you need your putting yourself on the back that you guys got a good compromise through like
oh wait a minute we got clobbered of the midterms nobody showed up to support this what the hell's no one gives a shit yeah so either you move or we will replace you will you will not replace the and drop shot several this activity torch
it would be like an elite the door
that is greener
they're doing a shield the wall in front of the aetna headquarters
the they're standing in front of the fearless girls that you there
well another thing about these liberal politics though
the big myth that they want one liberals to believe a liberal voters is that there is something of an even playing field as if the chamber of commerce and the the the industries are not on one side of this deck so when they act like we have to bring both sides together which side is more powerful which side actually has the ability to get shit done
it's not the liberal walks it's going to be the chamber of commerce and whatever they decide is the best way forward and it's like yeah like the these people they exist to prevent anything even remotely like universal healthcare from happening yeah well i cannot see angle of it it's just like absolutely shocking like my pure
anti european chauvinism really leg rears its head with this is like you really think this is an issue we can't haven't figured it out you really think the french are smarter than us
excuse me
oh god universal healthcare by somebody doing occur to you
someone to him a hard at it until they had universe is less some of you
muhammad thermometer for a dick
and have you had like
damage around his head of use like the melody do this love and
was originally like a french socialism earth single payer vs
public pro mix stupid system and they did have a united states of care
pepe le pew fulfill old
the andy richter
the idea of like an obstacle of intellect or ideas it's just like so offensive to me
you talk to people especially after bernie they all know it's it's absurd it's completely absurd check well there's not going to be popular support we won't get the politicians on board like there's more of us than than and people are completely aware that this is a bullshit system and we are dragging behind the
world in turn has of healthier than hearing here's mine like like incredibly like barely developed countries but have lower literacy roots the most yeah although we have a pretty low literacy
let's keep up with
they just said
low concept of people's imaginations they seem to think of the average voter as this year would sometimes and noble savage and other times sort of like a medieval person who only knows about the lanes they till and
you couldn't if you told them about like a drastically better existence that good what's next pal you got a bridge to sell a yeah it's like know that tell people talk about all the time is of no one had to worry about those like maybe people's taxes were a bit higher but like everyone was no one had to think about it in this way that something that like
increasing amounts of just normal people talk about it fits in there but we don't need normal feel it people feel x we need raytheon democrat damn thing is about those guys is that they do run whatever means our democratic party they running and and their existence in it is predicated
on politics being
i guess the metaphor i would use is like retail vs wholesale so like they have a vision of politics where it's well we need to get everybody together to create a policy that only wants really understand that we get we have to pay a bunch of other people to figure out how to sell it to the two words
the fifty percent plus one of the population whereas you have another promote wholesale politics were what if you get a thing that's easy to understand very big it will drastically improve people's lives you don't need those middleman those guys are basically like any itself justification or likes only singletary already sales and their little ones that guy in between the wholesale and you and they're just taking
the fucking the profit meaning like this these phony baloney jobs that allow them to become rock star fucking pod cast kings like the fan of road love it and all those terms they're just they're literally parasites on the political process and it has to stay obscure and it has to stalinists guaranteed is as has a
they incremental otherwise it's too easy part of why they don't have a job yes well and you have to paint the people who are for the simple ideas is insane radicals so this is from an interview and sienna slavic says when needled on the question of single payer in the past you'd support a single payer needled on this question what i believe is that there are a number of ideas
including including new ideas
that's not necessary to get to where we want to get i believe that's going to take a number of years from where we are today so for someone who believes in single payer medicare for all i hope that you can also be for other things that are good for people and those things might even build the ability to get their drivel
man who hails here that madelyn that was nothing now it's just like oatmeal how it is just a little sense solutions
you you gotta give solutions to get
to have solutions yes it's not a solution than yourself
they hadn't cut him off you would have started talking about the respect you literally is the ideas are of
yeah i do acknowledge that he he rightfully acknowledges that there are indeed ideas
any energy without even new ones you gonna lie without a drone strike in nursing homes is this isn't like that to be a very full weight of healthcare this innovative this sort of like word salad it's leg has been fucking up and on the big enough oil
millions in divorce but like you know and he he commented on
twenty six year old girls and stupid
he was like hey trouble
and his leg this is the word salad of and in trouble man
you know sometimes certain solutions have priorities that are on top of ideas but when those priorities face other ideas on the horizon we want to bring ideas that horizon at the moment and when i said you're so tiny it in for occasions that communication
it's all about communication it's about it's about respect respect mutual respect that's a big thing you know separate bathrooms mutual respect
his of ideas and managed to save a marriage the marriage you have to sort of bringing to the brig
to be married their new ways to be married
i hope that if you're for marriage you will also be for other things
alternatively if folks are not interested in years of care lords would suggest that they involved with the essays medicare for all campaign and you know right now we have over seventy vs say locals four of which were just kept canvassing yesterday and a sizable portion of what is a now nearly thirty six thousand strong membership in the organization so if you want
involved go to medicare for all da da se usa dot org and tear got our five principles we've got two more than us of care and none of them overlap
so you also if your essay locals already endorse the campaign you can sign up there if you're not the same number you can also sign up and we can we can bring you in to socialism so please check out the website and i also just want to recognize meghan swab and been phone who are on the organizing sub committee and i've been doing a fantastic job getting out are organizing kits which include every
that you need for your local chapter to get started so if you want in organizing can't please go to the website and soon we will be doing a matching campaign so if your local as does not have the money to afford and organizing kid we will be hopefully raising money for matching kids to send to smaller locals and especially college chapters around the country we had shirts
what's in the kit yes are way more about the kit in the kit everybody loves kids inside the kit you get a medicare for all organizing guard which was written by the campaign committee at five of those you get one hundred and twenty beautiful glossy pamphlets which will help explain to people this extremely complicated idea of free health care at the point of service
five t shirts you get twenty stickers for for canvassing forty pens and a bunch petitions to go out and start collecting signatures because actually the way to change politics is to get people to know about a program get them on your side because turns out most workers are pretty progressive and i actually want medicare for all so it's not too hard to do so please do get involved and yet
none of that is going to end imperialism so don't do it
i wanted to address this this is something that i've seen coming up people are saying i don't know about this matter here for all movement people you're just leaving imperialism there you're going to going to have an imperial hell state with universal healthcare than where are you and i think people need to realize people who are not extremely online people who do not make politics there
lives who do not who do not interact with politics as a way to create a sense of self worth and a sense of purpose enormous that best idea the best definition for enormous is people who don't make their politics into an identity and those people have heard that we should kill them
all those people respond the politics through the lens of self interest and they vote on self interest or they don't vote because they perceive correctly usually that it doesn't matter to their self interest of the vote or not they need to be engaged in turned on and nothing is a better way to start that conversation nothing is a better enter
three point two getting somebody politically engaged and saying we can this this
the healthcare system that is crushing you like it crushes everyone can be different we can make it so that you have the benefit the tangible benefit of living in a place where you can get free at the point of service healthcare and how much that can help you and your family's lives and that starts a conversation and then maybe you wonder what might have in a white haven't we had this before then you can start talking about how we have more people incarcerated in this country than
the rest of the world we have military bases that one hundred and seventy fucking countries then you can tell them the truth about syria
actually start somewhere
the fetus sort of the cynical criticism
healthcare canvassing that it doesn't take these things and new account if you start with those things you're not starting on the basis that normal people really to politics which is self interest but if you start and a thing that people understand that will benefit them it opens up a conversation that maybe not maybe maybe we'll be nazi germany with healthcare
maybe we won't and the only way for were the only way possible for that to happen is if we start these conversations with normal people re energize them make them realize politics can benefit them and then from there build solidarity that is broader and it moves beyond the horizons of what we think is possible
and get someone's car out of the ditch just by given him more gas and buy gas i mean about imperialism
i don't know yeah i am sympathetic to the idea that we don't talk about imperialism nearly enough i mean one of the most brutal effective propaganda campaigns last generation was the post nine eleven propaganda campaign because it was shit like twenty four booze also shit like homeland zero dark thirty that imparted and
serial mindset and just sort of the nor me to npr tote bad crowd but mats completely right you're not just going to you're not going to deprogram them all the norm is just by telling them the thing that they avoid thinking about the most on purpose
is bad they know it's bad that's why they don't think about it but they're beaten down there not engaged so
twenty nineteen we're going to fix all the problems i know it's only eighteen
but more real she a back a little bit we're getting we're getting a jackson around twenty thousand team is all that ducks twenty and healthcare we're going to get healthier tone twenty nineteen imperialism absolutely gone two thousand and twenty somebody twenty twitter weekend shaven out here two thousand and twenty ross is going to make a song me too
i don't know that
he's he's a rapper
to close things outside i saw a lot of about health care day but i want to have some a switch gears slightly and just talk about my other favorite thing other than the united states care or that happened this week folks i'm feeling like jesse
my
nevermind for are now when john mccain in two thousand and eight said we are all georgians this week we are all for ours we are all just lot of a lot of jesse come lately is this yeah
of just come lately
if you've been if you've been a farrar for our fanatic views you seen the silly farrar
in jersey for our piss off everybody you seen him anger you know microbreweries
assume anger mom bloggers just anyone anyone the democrat rank and five hours but he thought to myself boys they're from anyone has given over self tough possibly not even learned this this this week or just keep a bronze hammer app runs and reply to a charlie kirk tweet about turning point you essays
campus conservatism and he said college republicans you know their head tells heads held under water until they
charlie corrupt was like wow this is terrible i can't believe this is funny and then he disappeared again i am not joking
came like the cause of the week for like bullshit campus culture war shit so much that they were talking about it on fox and friends and i think now the perfect denouement to weird twitter is that we are now one thousand percent certain that donald trump was angry at a bronze him between during this week's morning executor
yeah kelly had to read a little with fifteen track darts to stop a pretty sloppy jesse
nobody go off kings is garbage stream no one watches it just he's not even good at those games that while the interesting thing to me is that from what i observed these weren't am kind of disingenuous reactions he's weren't people being cynical thing like look what he said
they thought that he meant it yeah well that's that's jesse's talent is is that you can't really it's never people really do fake outrage to jesse usually can really does push he gets people man because there's nothing you can do to
really do shit him while they tried to it's so funny he has in the past written for dead
i think that's why it all started because he's got the blue check mark in there that we can shame the liberal media for their hypocrisy and he hasn't written beds been for a while but they still contacted a fucking editor at that's very much as could eat at a very because the instinct at both sides the instinct of scumbags from both sides both sides do it in terms of mainstream politics is getting people fired at low eight
meaningful do that by the way you are a class enemy absolutely unless you see like the bus driver shooting up before he drives don't fucking be and now even even then
let him double cop all these drive
yeah children will be fine the hell the hell rhetoric
it's the cycle that cannot be broken of people claiming that the other side is being hypocritical and like the real think kirk was trying to get that is worth a republican had done this there or to the hell the pay and it's like okay you created this hysteria also clearly like this already happened i know now i seem to
think that there was
a very anti politically correct
university professor who said that really wished that his students would i'll get triggered committed suicide and and there was there was no hell to pay he kept his job and cleanly know he did between we did osha the answer lies the professor on a
are on a twitter that identified him as an n y u professor and there was no hell to pay so i mean the the other i read either way i'm still being sued the other already of course doesn't leave it literally like a go to any the comments to any article it i r
or got news or any of the daily or hall or daily wire daily caller and he decides to tried to make a out of this any article just any at all and you will immediately see dozens of jokes
just openly fantasizing about murdering liberals are throwing the amount of helicopters yeah again i'm not bitching about backs i don't give a fuck
another with call and not get it's not politics has guy and it's the hell world of online it is online rhetoric it a communication
people getting mad at each other and turning it is nothing that ish it's like being in the hell raiser it's like we all open the fucking lament configuration and ron that in a digital realm of having our flesh strip of our bodies an exquisite agony don't get mad get eaten don't get man on get even and then to see charlie kirk going on fox and friends
his disgusting dolphin teeth
hell he has the center by the anti
i you don't shank mr chatter and see me calling the coax and be like saying them pictures of charlie kurt grinning and saying how can you support the
and he was er
his own it to pull look at his gums
and he goes normally i'm not one it and i don't like playing the victim wrong it's like shut off all their whole jog your entire job is to play the victim
college republicans to play the victim on campus which leads us in
before before before before i want to say we talk to talked about how much we love jersey please watch stephen jesse and rub was been stream go off kings it's the best route stream even if you don't play video games it's hilarious and listen to jazz vodkas with michael hell though boehner
your kickstarter sucks also great support jersey stand but don't just everyone loves posting your out rare jesse's everyone loves being like our jesse's really don't know but support jesse because he's he's excellent and does great work charlie kirk and his organization turning point usa which is a diaper fetish group yeah
and the tending to people exist to fight campus culture war bullshit and get college republicans to play the victim because they're mean fellow student because basically nobody likes them because the lowest form of life imaginable is a college republicans
so this week
a fellow t p usa you know comrade or folk her member of your toilet paper usa
charged to do this thing where to gin up outrage and get a professor of fired or harass forgiving comments on a personal essay she wrote that seem to correct not her writing but her point of view to say that people kneeling for the national anthem and nfl games are in fact cracked and you would have got
and a if you had agreed with my liberal point because this comes on the heel of them making a big push about how there's there is systematic discrimination against conservative ideas in college classes by professors that was the claim and of course that lead people to say is there any evidence for this and this was the attempt
this has proved it was conserve of students are being are being discriminated against because of their ideas i'm not going to say it was an essay it's about two and a half pages doubles pay
christians are like yeah
it's like a new in korea is right down the post screenshots of these professors comments which of course everyone could see was just very basic suggestions on how to write something that sound like the person
the lamb is a t p usa person and before i get into this like i had some brief paying people were like hey maybe don't make fun of the the show she's just a dumb college cambridge is true but she's also a fucking op one thousand your sanity
he leaves you the app fetish i eat the because some of these some of these apple cheat children are fucking the youth boon seasons either movie the white ribbon okay we should have drag those kids learn and i have learnt you mean the op as an operative or op as like chief keeps are both okay cool
both i mean op and both senses of the word okay so this is a i'm just going to read now her essay called standing up for freedom her essay which was wrongly docked points because of wrong think that's why because because those double plus and good wrong think by a car right for you jump into this
this is this is t p usa can stay famous for you remember the famous diaper god it's the kansas it's and cancer that's not to be as a kid stay that's just the most famous brain okay but she took place in the diaper protests the woman who wrote this article was blowing bubbles in the next to the adult they heard that a woman who who put it out
okay okay she really wasn't it wasn't the student she has a t p as a person but she sent it to the kids stately and then she put it out that okay now read from again this is corrected but i'm only going to read as it was originally written the original mass us standing up for freedom
ever since i was young i always stood for the national anthem and so did everyone around me
when entering high school i found myself frustrated at the friday night football games when someone would talk or were a ball cap during the national anthem
i never i never thought i never thought by the time i entered college people would be taking a knee during the national anthem for me and my family it felt like a punch in the gut not just the punch where you can punch right back but one that you aren't expecting and it knocks the wind
this perused so evocative just the regular punch but what of those approaches where this been there are rooted that
you and you go through the ceiling
you're in the other floor and there's a big lump on your head
birds flying i honestly if this lady just talking drew a picture of thomas the tank engine running over call and kept running families dealing she wouldn't have been done they wouldn't have done nineteen eighty for the animal farm do or what
i'm going to be more concise than this bullshit i believe everyone who is a united states citizen should stand for the national anthem out of respect for the men and women who risk their lives daily for the freedoms of the united states that
well this is a very interesting lake uniquely american thing to that i've heard other people saying they like you've turned your national anthem into the dead troops and them like we're just like with like baghdad
you know we like it's a much it's more like the porta rican flag where they just have it because they like it well in every other country
i mean americans favorite thing to do is to get pissed and the thing you can get the most pissed off about is managing people disrespecting soldiers we have
i'm not saying like economically or and ugly but culturally we have the most psychotic only found the politically and it wasn't so we get culturally care lord right right and we have we have this same militaristic culture but it's sort of filtered through this like weird outraged i'll thing i mean every voters
weapon icing for agility and i think one of the worthless
saw that mainstream culture was people just extrapolating things to to mean that they were offensive the soldiers and offensive to be the attic reverse that's definitely like that i think i mean that's definitely the post iraq like biggest phenomena that talk about it
like enforcing confines around people you know
the first link they did with iraq was like what do you think about the war but you have to support the troops which is perfect completely nebulous canada nothing it doesn't mean shit
what it means support the war that fighting and that's a good support the troops is affordable care for conservatives you know it's a meaningless term that they can just blanket over any well you say it's meaningless but let's see this young lady has to say about what it means to her see what on see we're talking points knows guard coming to college i never
pictured a conversation topic being if people should be standing kneeling or sitting
now that's three this sense again
it's easy run that that
coming to college i never pictured a conversation topic being if people should be standing kneeling sitting or any other form of a lot of sharing one of the national average
my
that's the journey toxicity rucker
my first semester i saw your pet out i thought this yeah
i got an end up being this is blink one eighty two small things watching saturday
anyway eight so i will not go stand on the field
so how
my first semester i saw multiple protests over this very subject in the first month of classes i got an email from a classmate that stated join the student power coalition and woke which stands for here world of colored empowerment colored spelled with a k i just like i say that already this
i hope
honest if if that does exist
i
debbie's of can't you find that that's a hair
this is terrible act that it's not as shit others that's like kappa donna that's a fucking ninety's rapper
that type of misspelling purposeful not allowing this felt like such a battle for something that seems like a simple courtesy surely take the scenic route
i stand for the national anthem and the flag is my country oh shit because i was brought up in a home that is rooted in a military background i was raised by my grandfather who is a veteran of the united states army she goes on to list all the people she knows who served in the military know nothing about how there's anything stupid fucking ass
them in the first both the flag and and this is it's just the anthem has become the dead true and them the flag means many things to so many people but to me it is something more the united states mag
is a symbol of freedom commitment on her bravery sacrificial love and dedication the flag though it has been changed many times over the year
still encompasses these bases that they're headed why don't
i've got i've got it
you guys ready for this next sentence don't go for it
when the founding fathers came to america to form a more perfect union
this is for an english class
i can think of one thing wrong with that while they are know but see that's that's from the gettysburg address so it's actually very literary let's call called an illusion
they inspire when the founding fathers came to america to form a more perfect union they inspired generations to come to stand for the causes the believed in they inspired the flight from the man that is obviously still on go on the may
i a cop
black people on in this graded paper the phrase that she puts includes the man is just circled the question is to it
so the flag was designed to showing the strength of the thirteen original colonies in the stripes and the fifty states in the stars
it's no no no the original thirteen colonies fuck it rises
does she have cited saying she already acknowledge that the flag is changed so now she's well
it hurt no she says in the stars showing the unity in progress of them i stand for a flag of freedom hell yeah
i believe that everyone should stand for the national anthem to honor those who paid the ultimate sacrifice of their lives i would think this statement alone would be enough to convince people to stand but unfortunately it is not i believe everyone should stand because everyone knows someone who has risked it all three
are so privileged as the have the option yeah we've all known somebody who went up to the girl with reading at the bar
the girl who he just knows she's never had a man really who could satisfy fire yeah i am very i'm to that to dissipate and a break dancing competition risk at all
we are so privileged as to have the option to stand and honor or protest option
i think that out
a year ago
get through this whole sense because men it is a car wreck we are so privileged as to have the option to stand and honor or protest in disrespect unlike other countries
a we have the privilege to show pride in who we are as americans in what we say do or where other countries like north korea have no have no access to a public internet or any way to show their pride for a country of censorship wrong wrong
had a ride with the archive the sand and you should have career you have to stand for the eighth of what we started to say you didn't have to have the hell off for their national and you know like the yeah we started this i was talking about really impressive national display as the solidarity
by the way in the winter olympics the breakout star of this year's winter olympics are the north korean cheering sections who have these really cool like coordinated chance and cheers for their country and their flag
really love that that's a privilege and do that instead of things and dour song about rockets they're out there there is a funny article that was like
the dastardly north korean propaganda they pick cheerleaders based on attractive
jones's cards and our country
they just america reading that i would never do that i think it is wrong to protest the national anthem for the sole fact that people died believing in the flag that we stand for
they believed that the flag exist
koreans died for the fuck north korea
a lot like a way to you i believe it is wrong for people to protest the anthem because because it is disrespecting a symbol of our country's pride america is the best country in the world with the most freedoms to protest and disrespected ever do is absurd ever do it people believed so much in the united states
the flag that they literally gave and risk their lives for and if someone believes anything means more than their freedom they are wrong to their lives to the institution of chattel slavery what we should respect that flag
why that's why you never note
grand ole opry people risk their lives to secure layman's wrong for the german people we have the duty to at minimum stand for an anthem that people literally gave everything for us
oh my i will continue to stand that encourage all to stand for the united states national anthem to honor the one person they know that served or serves i will encourage and remain standing for the anthem of my great nation as it is the right thing to do i will stand for my friends and family who believes in my freedom so highly they were willing
to die for me to have my privileges and freedoms i believe everyone should stay of the united states national anthem because someone believe so highly in this country that they will die for a stranger to be free because life is precious
the bible and us americans that as an equation of going end of cottage that's not really any worse than most freshman fuck him writing because kids suck it right that would actually writing how would you grade this over while i wouldn't because i teach freshmen writing and like basically i give them out
a lot of time to revise and a lot of what i do is say read this out loud
that is how you learn whether you are making you know the language words for the ears and the eyes or whether you're just vomiting up weird sounds good
this is like if i would say this requires revision i just want to read here the teachers comments at the owner this awful live professor clara you make the same point repeatedly and do not take into account why some people are kneeling i am also concerned about the contradiction decent right in but look at my notes
sentence
while that's an incredibly impolite that's marriage and that snow any argument you have has to like that that is like the the most obvious criticism any argument you have has to actually address the thing you're arguing with which she affect us once and that and also it sounds insane
it's horrible is humorous but the thing is that is that the main loop
the chief sort of conservative critique of the academy you like the last couple of generations was will turn universities with these self esteem factories for these kids we don't leave make any requirements of them will we don't want to disabuse them of the false notion that they think well i'm smart enough to be because you have to know that you're not good in order to become better but
and we're just creating this culture of permissiveness and and no intellectual rigor and now people usa is basically created a rubric for a conservative students to go to college and say walk around thinking you're already a genius because you're a conservative and any criticism and a bad grade you get is the result of liberal bias
how the fuck is that going doing good anything other than absolute soft brain idiocy like this woman is never going to get any better her brain
as important as it and it's not and gets a trophy yeah if it is participation trophies and they want him for being pulled literally politically correct
so in conclusion
i'm going out and i'm who are flag
you that i am doing me i am man standing for fly
do you know thanks for joining us we will have all that information about the medicare for all campaign in the show description if you are interested or want to get involved or further involved but just continue to stand for us americans chop pose and the fact that we willing
q die for your rights and privileges to not stand for us so consider that but stand them
from i just think it's wrong for people not to hear the d j smokey song for them to think of all the people that they know or didn't know who didn't make it to the premium feed
couldn't afford it but they did anyway and they died doing that so when you listen to the premium for you you have a right to exercise your for use but you listen to it
five guys well
