a lotta at off
go off go off well i mean i don't want to
gamble too heavy drinking bourbon material
we don't want to sell we don't want to give this been away for the retard the studios about drinking bird so pay wall this yeah they the drinking bird stuff not even by in the five dollar mind that the special one thousand dollar wall so we mention okay man ember are furloughed right now because the federal government is officially shut down it is too
totally unprecedented except that happened in two thousand and three thirteen for roughly the same reasons
i have not been paying very close attention to this essentially this is all over the proposed democrats want something to cover the dreamers right they want the dreamers and trump took away the protections against deportation from the dreamers that old
obama put in through executive order and these are people who came to the country as minors and they are the good immigrants in popular culture they're the ones who work hard and serve in the military and go to college and things are like those other immigrants who are just human beings
it was other immigrants are not dying in wars they're not starting a new fusion cuisine place you go didn't feel good about yourself whatever happened to them so that deadline is march for a legislative fix that's going to give citizenship a path to citizenship or just permanent legal status for the dreamers that's mine
stats and bows by the president and democrats have no real leverage here except the budget where republicans need their votes in the senate in order to fund the federal government and oh a little bit about this process so congress has to appropriate money to keep a government running
right and
they will do this by passing and appropriations bill but in recent years it's been harder and harder to pass that appropriations bill especially because of these you know hard liners on the right wing who are freedom caucus right or people like rand paul who say we need to reduce spending in the deficit and destroy social security and all that shit obviously that's apocryphal because all these people voted for the taxpayer
so just total rank hypocrisy
so what congress will do is pass what's called a continuing resolution which is it could it could cover the entire fiscal year could just be a stop gap measure they will just keep things humming along based on whatever the last budget said and we passed i think two or three of these in at the end of last year
just which was imposes a it's just a self imposed deadline the final deadline ran out this weekend on the friday at midnight yeah the most of the most of the coverage of this seen from like the political meat is like who's going to get the blame for it
and
i
one of my predictions are unprepared for to be wrong i picked the main event of the last night you see when i was on go off kingdom of course i cursed being wrong i'm wrong about everything but also i'm right about this
the there's like a lot of hey being made over like oh well it's the republican republicans control both legislative houses and the presidency the shut down happen under them they'll be blamed her or the not enough democrats voted for this will be bland and i have to say i don't think shut down and register with people like they used to
because are rooted did sort of absurdity of a down is rooted in your belief in norms like your belief that way the government should never stopped working everyone should come together to just make sure at least the basic organs upstate work but now after donald trump has been president everything is incredibly stupid roy more the root beer
yes pedophile almost became a senator i don't think these violations of norms work any more people are to analyze to for enough like undecided voters to actually care about is in effect it's like it's only non essential things i mean it's just like the only thing is really being affected by sugar is probably some
actually as time goes on it gets worse
right now it's like you know you can't visit the lincoln memorial or something
they're keeping the parks open but they're just not having trash collection something like that
his i don't a fan of littering now is the time to go hog while but it's also things like a lot of the department of education which provides funding and especially for a special needs students across the country and a lot of the judiciary could shut down in i think a couple of weeks and right know everything just
running on fumes in addition to like things that are mandatory like you know homeland defense the military like these will keep bombing but and as well
the tens of thousands of government employees who are just getting fucked by this or either they have to come into work and will not receive a check or they've been furloughed so i mean it's a shitty situation all around and it's obviously a failure of governance i do think you know your average person this is a byzantine process your average person who doesn't really follow this process isn't really
i have a big table take away except that oh shoot guess those republicans fucked up again how about that because that's really just been the story from the past year everyone who is like following this process to a certain extent has already made up their minds about who's to blame and who's not to blame and most of that is falling on to congressional republicans and the president can you explain
to me
get some one of the lines of heard or saw this week from like the sort of mega trumps of people that i don't know what they're referring to you they keep saying release the memo
they're talking about kind of yeah there's this memo that supposedly shows that the f b i
deleted or what's the word abuse the face a court system vice accords are what they all just voted to renew which are these secret star circle corny talking about this the other week this is the the extension of like the ongoing warrantless and as a surveillance yeah i mean the whole thing is fucking fraudulent out
course the f b i abuse it and they abuse it to terrorize muslims basically and so this is all just like this is just all total invented bullshit because your average mag a pig thinks that oh this is the memo that shows obama ordered the by to surveil donald trump in order to make hillary president
and it also contains evidence that south retro was murdered or whatever that's what they think it okay dumb shit
yeah regarding the shut down while this is happening while while the other trying to pass a continuing resolution or a budget in the background
republicans are negotiating with democrats in order to pass some kind of dhaka deal and i w just been released but the rough outline of it is democrats are going to see more money for border security and for the wall right or they they want to like at least thick allocate money
or make it seems to the trump has the money to build his wall even though nobody thinks is was actually going to get yeah basically some money and they also are going to tinker with the
legal immigration process which is neither here nor there really and in exchange they get a legal status for the dreamers and dreamers get potentially some kind of like ten year pathway to citizenship something like that that's the rough outline of it this is being negotiated by the gang of six which is lindsay graham
flake and four games i'm against gang gang get it and the signals was good for a while and they seem close to a deal until the president said no that's terrible because he saw something on tv or more more precisely because of stephen miller who's an hour now white nationalist
and makes it impossible to deal with
either figure that ever reading has been like the one who's actually negotiating this stuff was like running point is john kelly right he is that he the staff and he's the general he's one of these like you know he's the grown up in the room that i think it's interpreted as like he's the kind of ruthlessly efficient military
a man who's there to provide order and just make sure that the executive bridge run so here's what what is weird about that is that p i think people either forget or allied the fact that john kelly is actually a highly ideological immigration hot as well where he is more in the steven miller camp then you know
lindsey graham other people he's negotiating what happened was at a meeting the schumer right and the fear there was that trump would strike a deal with the democrats and then force congressional republicans to go along with it so kelly dropped a dime to john core nine in the senate and said hey this is going on but we want to assure you there's not going to be a deal that comes out
this so he helps got all the process miller scuttling the process and it's kind of that
it's kind of had a logjam here and the funding deadline came about right the house passed a stop gap measure into the middle of february that would have also fully funded chip the children's health insurance program for something like five or six years that's the sweetener and they expected democrats to just go along with that however
democrats are now
for more or less united in the demand to get legal status for the dreamers they do not want to do what they did at the end of december which is just pass another stop gap because they're activists are getting more and more pissed off about this and it makes sense that they should go to the math for the dreamers because one it's politically pop
mueller like the vast majority of people in the country say oh yeah that's reasonable if anything the conservative position should be to legalize the dreamers or give them a path to citizenship the liberal position or the left position should be full amnesty frank right so they're already negotiating for what is essentially what something like a fifth of the undock
demented population in this country and as well you know even when they get a deal i mean i think a deal would be good but then what do you do with that other four fifths what do you do with the dreamers parents were you're going to say if you're going to give them a deal that says hey you can stay in this country legally but we're going to give more money to enforcement and ice who are going to go to your parents
well the dreamers your favor that because that it just like know parents party
open house silica beastie boys
i would like to be mad matters not here i would like to viewed stream pessimists position
so the polling in favor of dreams that we've seen is very positive but it makes me it makes me wonder that pulling the people who know what the dream act is i hesitate to say that most voters know what a fucked is know about any of this and forever positive dhaka pole
and for our positive goes polls breed dreamers as i don't know that it's i don't know that undecideds are either knowledgeable volt is or that there anything beyond like immigration agnostic and that this won't just this won't it won't be the masses
of the massive shot in the arm to the democrats they think this is i mean
hope that i'm wrong but it just it it seems like one of those things where it's like you have fifty thousand screaming mega shit heads he wrote amnesty and posting pictures from like on barack and saying that their eyes
becoming into do karate the home depot
yeah i saw a really good conservative mean today where is a picture chuck schumer and i think they'd had better than their usual photoshop skills it's chuck schumer but his whole face is covered in those like m s thirteen style tattoos
yeah that's that's pretty cool actual and is what it looks like bond
at age fifty thousand
people like on twitter and lay on all the concern of website and then he have like on hundred thousand resist people who i didn't really seem to give a shit about immigration until tromp until it became like this point that they would argue in response the trump and i wonder if this isn't just one of those cases of
kind of like shutdown of like the same people through the same things about each other getting pulled it pulls in a certain direction but for the majority of voters they're totally ignorant of the issue and it's not going to move anything i have three responses of that one is they should do it for moral reasons oh no no i agree every wants this and they need the basic come out and know
i totally agree or not
they're not getting hoodwink like they've always been getting old when the other is the people who are hardliners on immigration the essentially white nationalists are very very small minority and it's frankly the democrats need to stop keeping to these people and being afraid of them because they're always going to vote republican they should tell them this this reactionary white minority to go fuck themselves and the other is that
in these polls normally it is about framing and perception because in these polls normally they'll read like two statements right and they'll say one should people who are legally immigrated the country as children and you know they work jobs are they go to college or something should they be offered the chance to stay in a country legally and the numbers for that are like seventy seventy five percent
that's an overwhelmingly reasonable proposition for most people i mean will it be framed like that is the question because trumps like cramps polling was famously like completely tank like the lowest ever been for anyone at that point on the presidency and every generic poll that showed like generic democrat vs generic republican was approaching double digits like of
slaughter now we see that that house polls narrative five points and it's because like because enough people not the majority of people it's enough people have seen like have seen the dow is up and they pass this tax bill they don't know how any of this shit works they literally just think oh donald trump the jobs but
the stock market this thing that i don't have any money and because i have a negative net worth oh that means that the economy is doing well their their lives of the same maybe getting a little bit worse is is anyone who's like below middle class but just the way they process information is so a to be they don't
have an understanding of these like highly unlikely issues but it still affects their perception of these issues you'll absolutely here's the thing so obviously republicans are trying to frame it right now as oh democrat shut down the government they refuse to let children have health care for the scary illegal him
grants for the m s thirteen guys and i don't think that is a message that will break through or that anyone will remember come november
honestly like ultimately you can look at the shut down to two thousand and thirteen it what followed that was republicans winning a massive historical victory in the midterm election i i generally think it's a wash but ultimately the only thing that comes out in people's minds because it again this is a very byzantine process people aren't going to hear weight democrats did that for
or they sold out children for illegal immigrants like that means anything or make sense unless they're already a maggot child i think at the end of the day your average like kind of out of touch person going to look at this and say oh wow this is still a shit show this is still pretty fucking incompetent because like you want to sit down and explain the budget process and reconciliation
these things to people nobody's going to do that to
from like the
this alleged deal and the negotiations about dhaka and the wall or whatever like going off or something felix said about how people take by you know i keep hearing all the time the stock markets are unemployment is low and trumpeted their jobs but when he got back in the white house there was like it was comforting glass and obama was like oh
although are not going to touch that not going to break glass
first and only jobs i'm doing or the going to do in the back of
i did you guys get a chance to look at the thing that the new york times did last week where they were lake
no is this week they were like you know instead of lieu of running our go ah bed section on thursday we're only just going to reprint letters from trump supporters yeah the yes i saw the letter that i got bubbling times my family resume
proud of the writer it now
yes i saw the crayon drawing
there are no these are the new york times reading trump supporters who are consider themselves you know educated successful not like the king hogs
we usually i thought about even i regard them as exactly the same yes
i was struck by how basically all the reasons for why they like trump and support for all identical and it all came down to something like yes they declined his boorish behavior and then like i wish he wouldn't tweet but they're like hey the bright side is the economy is back it's better than ever
unemployment is low and they rattled off where he's getting things done like the tax bill which is good he's getting rid of regulations which are bad and the other like the wild card with the thing almost everyone cited as like would net positive like why they still support trunk despite some of the bad things was moving the us embassy to jury
and these are all not like you know orthodox jews reading and these are all just like you know these are the suburban boat dealership type of people who are like i did read are really happy about moving the embassy to jerusalem young i remember seeing that drove over and over again in the letters it's like hey guess what i'm not one of the shoe is room yeah i'm a professor
i am rich
have all i own a boat so i i support trump are you shocked by that it's like no i'm not shy yeah there are plenty of shit at your own music i've been a college professor i'm an author i'm an entrepreneur and that guy was really at the end he was like would trump is done is like we used to be so fragile
we'd be like oh i see this
oh global warming and like now trump is back and he's don't have to be afraid any more of the scary things in the world this is just he literally said chaos is just opportunity and the people who love opportunity capitalists
there was little finger that
i think about donald trump someone who has a very like steely eyed look at the dangers of the world takes him on very soberly well those the actually the only thing in addition to move the embassy dangerous and they all said he defeated isis when he finally let the generals do their thing he edited eyes a job is being the chief come out
under the syrian arab army and as hezbollah to them
the gate economy a second job good for donald trump task grab a top answer the task rabbit
as well as detachment and syria i do have two points about that economy thing and this is something that a lot of people have identified as a kind of kind of a weird aberration of the drug administration is that the economy is doing very well but trumps approvals do not reflect that and even his approvals on the economy which are higher than his overall approval
raiding does not reflect that while we should be clear about what the economy doing well evil ways i attacks and the stock market being up is like what percentage of americans own stock
one hundred
thanks a lot of people i would assume have stocks that are tied to the stock market i ever retirement funds that are tied to the stock a lot of people do own style but it's in retirement funds in mutual funds and also like unless you're a day trader the like year to date movement
do they cycles don't actually mean a lot to you i mean it matters where it's going to be when you catch it out which is like
looking at things were definitely heading towards another recession
generally like a day to day like you have a dow being up and unemployment being down is like a good thing right but like
really
does that mean the economy is yeah i don't think so that when we talk about when we talk about unemployment like the jobs if he will have are like worse and worse in that area canada it's contract yeah it's contract work their wages have not kept up with inflation what's more is that that unemployment that employment and unemployment pull it
smaller now because more people just dropped out of the economy after two thousand and eight the up now if you look at the white collar economy any also service positions what happens to those seven two thousand and eight is combine the jobs have like five people to one person who they worked to the knob and they'll pay them more but they save money
you know sort of the salaries are wages and five people and what's more important the benefits of five people save money on and we're in this swirling world diary a whirlpool of cheap money and trading on the margins of things and the economy now sort of being
growing to be centered around these companies that just spent hundreds of billions of dollars of cheap credit to try to take over a marketplace under the understanding that once they achieve monopoly or oligopoly that they will be able to charge whatever they want to the smaller and smaller pool consumers that can either for this like the the alec the
the average voter are like person is does think that like all like unemployment is down with the economy is doing better their jobs or it's like to me like the only thing that would be like a meeting for indication of like an economy being strong is like what is like wages to productivity
successful economy to me you have been americans are on the average being paid more and working less right that to me would be a healthy and their economy but the exact opposite is true just because they have a fucking job lake
necessarily think that that's a good indicator of economic health or social health certainly not that's really the thing i mean are you you can look at the top line unemployment rate
are you content if you're working in a in amazon slave warehouse where you have to wear a diaper because your bathroom breaks are doled out to you
who by alexa you i mean are you are you content with how the economy is going exactly and doesn't matter to you what that top line number is are you familiar with it does matter what the dow is at once
i've noticed that trump or
his trolling tweet for the women's marches that like more and will live in a loving me because unemployment he obviously didn't write that tweet by the were it's just a side note i really love how easy it is to tell which ones he writes and dozen years
people who write like the fake ones they try to get his style they try to like ape it but it never it never quite right it's always a little too you can never predict over it and you will never predict what the real trample put in all caps you'll never guess what he's going to connect the larger issue to whether it's you know authority that he went to and nineteen
eighty four when you found the other day and you're like if he was going to wrote this before he was it was clear who is paying for the tedious smokey the bear
yeah
have already about keith
but the forest fires
i mean that one that what is great if you want to be one of these people who diagnosis tromp psychology
that just proves how senile
that is that was an early two thousand and fifty that is like that is the exact type of thing and old birth deploys about this see this commercial so many times will watching the fifty and helpers of d v i watch every day will years
i support the message of the smokey the bear ads but i don't support using sex appeal
to my are you that this is another thing where you get isolate yourself with tromp where i'm now convinced that like during the early to those and fifteen part of the campaign he had a feud with smokey the bear and was like no one talks about this for forest fires off and control over vegetate
many birds
it's not nice we don't want to say we don't want to say you know go and say oh we love it when the birds burned to death but when something craps on your car and too many invasive species has another situation correct me if i'm wrong i'm thinking of smokey the bear
as sort of animal pitchmen or cartoon characters goes is this a smokey the bear wear pants but no shirt yes yes so he's like he he's he's literally and and it is
he bought obvious set of other cartoon like famously mickey mouse you know no pants donald no mickey mouse pants oh right yeah i know you don't you think a thinking goofy this country wear pants yeah goofy worse by a good hero goofy where's turtleneck of a little ad
address is like gerry adams
as often but a lot of animals do like that no no shirt pants that like how fifty said would be when it came out and if you had a body like smokey the bear with nowhere assure you would look oh god no to look for any opportunity to take your shirt
into like a turns like the thermometer goes to like sixty five and then it's just all get it out
trump the way that trumps he is the world is kind of always sunny or charlie using cartoon
trump legacies like men's fitness magazine he just his brain interprets of smokey the bear is on the cover like get a body like smoking like i don't get it this is ridiculous
you're talking about how eric trump was like my dad who easter is this person is he doesn't see color he just sees green and we were saying that means that he thinks every person he's met and last ten years the grinch
his chair jerry can be working on christmas he never celebrates christmas because his people the grinch
either great okay look there was one bad one but my daughter is a grinch
she converted to be the grinch
and their children will be beautiful pillows okay look you know it's going to be working are for you and maybe if he he makes peace and middle east we will give ms rose beast
but when the economy i think the problems that are happening today are the same problems i been identified towards the end of the obama administration even though unemployment slow the quality of jobs or worse it's over type fuck and jobs and as well the you if your han casting casting and and as well if your health pre
museums are going up and the cost of living is going up you're not getting ahead you are not doing that much better well this is another refrain that you hear from people who are like you know he may be rude and i may not like his character but like you know he's done good and a tax cut like you know you may see you pig pod casting entrepreneur three hundred dollars may not seem like
enough before working fairway an extra three hundred dollars in the old pocket that uncle sam doesn't get a taste of that immediately go to the servicing their dead
didn't like was that you to dollars as like you know weighed against what you're already paying for pocket health insurance
that was that was another thing that i think was under orbit the election if you notice like in the fall of two thousand and sixteen people's premium skyrocketed yeah it up
you know i would rate before the election there is a big spike in the apartment and insurance markets are worse than ever because of little things that trump is done to fuck with them as executive orders and parts of the tax bill
but i do fear maybe the people are so adamant that they may be the people that didn't vote or voted for top in these rust belt states where their premium skyrocketed they think of he's still fixing obama care after obama made my insurance more expensive or
i don't have to do to individual mandate a more exciting at some point like that that breaks at some point you can't compartmentalize these things i think it's bad enough you know what's going on in the cooler areas in the manufacturing belt trumps main problem is he's going to bring back these high paying jobs
right in the manufacturing industries where you don't need an education necessarily the jobs that have been going and getting outsource sort of these trade agreements the boys on routers of the world economic i where are the opposite is happening there are still lay offs there are still the carrier plan is having lay offs and what's replacing them fox con is matt was telling me the other day fox
khan is going to go to wisconsin have a fucking suicide net
going here but you know do these disaffected people
frankly most of them who didn't vote in the first place some of them for chromosome number for clinton's on them didn't vote it depends on where you go
day shift to the left or is it the story of what's happened so much of america thirty realization that people just get so beaten down by their lives by having no solution they just stop or spending all together
i mean i don't know i can't answer that question it really depends on what kind of messages they get and whether or not
there are people who can spread an alternate explanation for what's going on one they've not been exposed to before i well if you if you just leave things in a vacuum it's going to go to the right because that's that's his liver reactionary country because that's the consequence of that's the conclusion you draw base on everything this
country has taught you and your experiences have taught you especially growing up during the cold war and the baseline will always default to the right because even know these same people are getting laid off at their jobs as we talked about before what does offer is tangible if not into material says than certainly in a psychological one as you've taught
before this chin see brand of nationalism been kind of like you have nothing else you know at least some of america and like that like you know america is strong and good right i always hated that thing of oh they're voting against their own self interest and i always thought it was such an improper calculation because he has the democrats offer them like
a marginally better world i don't say marginally as this huge attack on the democrats i say marginal because a lot of the economic solutions they're offered are on the margins and for a lot of things that's fine your life is built around the margins especially in in in the economic sense
you do have a need a big down down the middle not centralism the overall change but offered marginal improvements are marginal stop gaps against the declining life expectancy in wages that have not kept up with the c
they're offered something that is exactly what their self address our which is an internal kingdom of heaven and in america built on blood and soil they can be proud of if you're given the choice of like ears your same shitty life
maybe you'll be able to buy better insurance for some people don't leave english affect them
a little more than others or you you are you are on god's right hand smoking all all the all the fucking isis terrorists and all the european policies and you will be in heaven with god forever because he stood on the side of righteousness
what are you going to pick what do you get to pick are you get a pixel are you going to pick soaring storing language are you gonna pick
frankly with the other party filling other even know what they're like the prospect of like making your life are no two to five percent better if you're willing to fill out like a zillion forms and like you know and then compare rates on like every different individual market like every single day
and given even if you want to if you want to go to these economically depressed places and you want to bring people into your fault you want to get them on your side
you will how you can't just give empty promises biggest democrats have been doing that for decades and they don't buy it any more because you have to actually explain why things can be different or given other another explanation not a conservative explanation for what's going on and the labor movement has been pushing that
explanation that it's nafta and people like bernie sanders push that explanation it's the machinations of wall street that's easy these are easy enemies to identify and i do want to say for anyone who's listening to get mad at us from the liberal arts center aside to say that we are hyper focusing on apple asia we're not
because you seem to say you saw the same low level of engagement in philadelphia in two thousand and sixteen
this is not a win this is a working class problem working class people are on engage that doesn't mean fucking white working class that means everybody they don't vote at the numbers you think they should and i know that because your calculations were hinged on them doing that and they fucking get it
not only that he's doing that then you know
made note of and made fun of numerous times
that what we what did she say for every way working class voters
oh yes so rich republican race what is what does he have an matic oh what a genius pragmatic move are going to bet that country club republicans are going to be against racism without locking that is hilarious though about all the people who sneer at my class politics as being kind of
sir
underhanded way of promoting a kind of heritage evoke white social democracy it's all the people are staring at that were like after recording the votes of rich racist or add and the deal they just tried to make was to give donald trump a symbol of racism the same people that have spent this entire time
you know going at bernie sanders or even further hating anyone who makes a joke they don't lag are defending schumer for trying to give trump the wall
as part of the sea ordeal and they say you know oh
he won't actually affect immigration it's symbolic what the fuck was the point of all of all that are into that sixteen the if it's ok to give donald fucking trump a symbol of racism the thing he ran on
what was your point it's almost like you have no fucking believes in you just want to flanking will allow me as i am i the only one who thinks that chuck schumer is just not as crafty is that a white man drawing
yeah she is going to get fucked in these negotiate oh yeah
a strategy mindset political tactics genius question yeah yes
as it exists now it seems like the democrats to like if they can get something for the dreamers they'll be like okay trump can have his wall on the assumption that like this very kind of maybe not even incorrect technocratic view of things that like the wall
probably won't get built anyway even if they give it the fucking money for aetna there's a certain logic there i don't i mean i wouldn't make that deal here
during which you make a deal if the deal was
she'd be pushing for which is for amnesty for everyone is in america and in exchange for that trunk gets to build this stupid wall is that is that a good deal yeah i consider that a good deal for this reason the here's how that frame has shifted in thousand and thirteen congress the senate passed by sixty eight votes a bipartisan
that would have amnesty for the undocumented immigrants in this country not just dreamers just full amnesty and the house under john boehner who's not who's not a rigid ideological paul ryan is did not even take it up and it was dead now they can they are struggling to pass even a compromise
that would give legal status to a fraction of undocumented people in this country i mean the democrats have ceded so much ground in these past few years and i honestly think that the only way that they could call back and try to win back this narrative is by making that big demand in terms of a wall i mean for god's sakes
you don't congress can appropriate money for something with such a legislative language where it doesn't actually have to be spent people expect that the next president will be a democrat and the next president can say fuck it worse than going to build as fuck and wall anymore and fuck you but they would have to have the political courage to say that and say fuck you to the mega white now was child
we have talks we have a joke before the past perhaps even on the show that like the savviest thing
hooked to do politically we just go to a border state and have as tiny section of the wall built and be photographed her front of it during his folks are wearing a hat and that was basically all you need to do you know you could just say you already built i don't believe it doesn't matter that matter because it doesn't do it doesn't there's already portions of will fucking wall i mean what's more
disgusting frankly is ice and no democrat should be voting to fund ice and i think that the demand that we should have is a democratic caucus that says the fund ice because these people are actual fascist pigs this is like the you saw the video yeah you saw you're against it the most despicable things i've ever seen in my life
these fucking innovators who are all neck folds just head full of neck fold pouring out the water that these
i'm sorry i can't remember the name of the zero there are groups that leave water and supplies in the desert because i keep in mind the us mexico border is one of the deadly as borders in the world in terms of how many he will die every there's yes of people in the past two decades die and all you do is a leave out jugs of water some food
some who is it gets very cold there and night i think i forget the deserts i do get very cold at night
here's bets of facts
right and these these guys they are border guys they go around there and they just pour out the water or kick it over and they filmed themselves doing it like they don't care because they don't care because they will now
never ever be punished for it ice is i mean law enforcement in general is probably maybe the worst slice america has to offer and of that slice i could be the ice is definitely the worse because i firmly believe the people that join eyes were too fucking stupid or flunked the site test to join every other branch
of law enforcement this is the absolute as ragged they tried to the time i joys in high school his own like you know their ambition was just to make life hard on other yeah they have they've wanted to be someone who could it's like the ball and thing i'm going to show use never that here thanks
it's people who couldn't even get into like this special swat team that they have for the department of education
dives anyway here's how i see things going on you know the feeling back to the budget thing the democrats have only one card to play because the need sixty votes overcome a filibuster to pass the budget and when they tried late on friday night to pass the house bill which was just another temporary extension into the middle of february five democrats
voted for it for republicans vote against it
and the democrats are the usual suspects the heidi hide camp and joe mansion and these red staters and our newest red cedar doug jones of course
he he's given out his phone number of a
got builds up on the low by jones about the compromise because the see are about to blow and be that back then hosts didn't want me than roy and more was a pedophile
well i've had back then was it a while but he should have been road more so
now they still don't want
and the republicans were graham and flake who are still passing trying to push the bipartisan deal
and might lead and rand paul who are there from the right wing saying we're spending too much we need to we need to pass a serious budget cuts every by the way who of course voted for the tax by the way it just gave out today finally we we know what the rand paul beating was about it was because he can
he is
is literally piling brush to close this neighbor's yard
that is like summer your suburban mine said i love like the deeper into suburban mindset you go you just become like croats and
his
the micro different oh my god no did you see also this week rand paul are doing some hearing about the crisis rate and as rand paul los to you he was this out that he's a doctor in
but he went to medical school reading i went to hollywood upstairs about a coyote read these letters on the wall
and
no no no edit out and rand paul was testifying about how
over prescribed that he is like as athletic he may now have recently ah know a thing or two about pain and i know bet you she just to have just wouldn't take an aspirin
it hurts every time a breed
we're not worth thin leave that lean should bother two thousand and seven three
are p for it
seriously they don't know i might have hired a vendetta don't do leave
though i mean if you have been i would like to try it i must say i'm going to do it as much as i know i meant the listener
not us
the vulcan analysts yeah so the sorry couldn't pass it the deal that the gang of six is working on they have apparently gotten a promise from mcconnell to bring a dac a deal to the floor on february eighth so what could happen
possibly monday is both houses will just pass another continuing resolution until the eighth and then wrap all of that together that's a possibility but when right now everyone sort of in trench and they're playing the blame game and i say democrats win it because simply because the republican leaders
ship has been one the republicans controlled the entire government to be as probably has just been so fucked up for this past entire year that it's driving these suburban voters whom hillary banked on into the arms of democrats they're the ones interesting you're saying that matters not here i'm going to fill in his role just go
out jar pilot could be president shit world health health skate twenty eight it well i mean what's powering this democratic wave that's building right now it's two things one it's the standard democratic base that's engaged in coming out and to his these educated upscale suburbanites
are actually appalled by the government not necessarily because they disagree with conservative dogma but they just don't like the way it's operating and they're willing to vote for democrats who position themselves as the rational ones i'm not saying that produces a good democratic caucus but if you're short term goal is we have to take control of congress then sure
you can rely on that and the end this shutdown is only going to encourage both of those trends
so the dagger deal i i do just have one final thought on this and
you're seeing the blame game go around and right wing people are very fond of pointing out now that oh republicans can't just pass it alone they need democratic votes therefore it's the democrats fall
you might be wondering why they don't use reconciliation to pass this reconciliation is a legislator procedure where that the certain bills involving the budget spending and deficit can not be filibuster you can pass that with a simple majority in the senate
that's what it's there for the reason why and this is incredibly important not a lot of people are talking about this the reason why you can only use reconciliation once each this school year
and the republicans already used it on the tax bill that's how they pushed it through that's why they have to get democrat votes here and if they had just used reconciliation for the budget as it's supposed to they could pass whatever budget they want well shows their priorities exactly
for air priorities so it's not that the democrats are holding the federal government hostage for dreamers it's republicans already did that for a one point five trillion dollar tax about a wealth transfer to the upper class either way the democrats absolutely should hold the federal government how absolutely dream or not just the dreamers but all illegal and
it's their only honestly it's their only card to play and i honestly scared that schumer is going to fuck it up and he'll play that card too early or hill agreed to will budget deal that doesn't guarantee a dreamer passage but just guarantees consideration of it you need some kind of large bill
because ryan has to get that pass in the house and the present has to sign it i think what schumer should try to do here and i'm just thinking out loud here is get a bipartisan
bill to the floor of the senate
have every democrat vote for it and enough republicans to vote for or just push it through fast enough so that no real filibuster can emerge there that's going to find the government tighter to chip tie that the dreamers and say that's it that's the only vote were doing the house you either pass that or or fuck off because we're not passing anything else and the price
didn't you sign it or not or you'll see you own the shut down and that's it that's the only real way to play hardball here because there is a deadline of early march for the dreamers and the president can at any given time reinstate obama is executive action and from his prior statements he doesn't actually give a shit up
about any of this he doesn't actually despise the dreamers he just believes whatever the last thing he heard was it might be from steven miller and might be from john kelly might be from foreign brands that he lobbied yeah so there is so i mean you can see it in the genuine fear of people in the white house that or republicans in congress
oh fuck if he talks to this genius chuck schumer he might be pretty convinced by this charismatic heavy weights will can't let this happen again
chuck schumer will use nagging and quito to get trip to the giveaway the whole store
chuck schumer in the steam punk
he's wearing goggles and of top out what what do you think it is it an egg drop he's going to get it soon to be something like you've you've like you've lost weight
mind that i work keep in mind though that the only way the democrats in the senate their bargaining position is straw is if those five democratic senators don't vote against the rest of their caucus that's mansion height camp donnelly their of a banana mccaskill mccaskill the i will play haskell jones okay
well that's easy process a tall order
that's really it for lions if you're only card to play if that's your only leverage you have to use it as much as you can maybe i think i've got i think is a practical matter they'll just pass and other see our and then still try to figure out the immigration thing who knows what trumped does honestly and one knows what right does
moving moving on from the machinations of congress the but you have thrown yes the this case of throws the rob they're all playing you win or you cry
your meet you know are we touched a little bit before about this kind of to freeze reviews before the show blood and soil nationalism that i think does some up like a certain kind of nation
or resurgence resurgent fascism in america
i'd like to segue now into a group of people they represent
i would say blood and soil nationalism because i don't think it's quite accurate i'm going to
i would say more like kermit and belly button linz nationalism
and i'm referring of course to the
but events a gala event held here in new york city last night perhaps you are familiar with it we were in attendance
i mean we were really i'd be honored guest speakers i'm talking of course about likes of which in his name of freedom in new york city just one night because i think every night night a free unlimited freedom and so few of the this
and as you guys catch any that i did i did there is one thing that a know we will be talking about though when it was at the chelsea manning thing so the after story to this apparently was that chelsea manning showed up to the event
as to cub reporters from buzz feed well reported on a incredibly nuanced and correct ways well what are what do we make of this like chelsea do better chelsea doesn't matter you don't see come on shopper so like the entire thing with it is murky i mean chelsea
post of the choose protesting there were people there who are protesting that save a chelsea came up talk to them but then there's also that picture of chelsea with jack prowess
cassandra
whatever and it's it's like there was a of her giving the thumbs down so you have to weigh that against i mean i think you gotta say it's yet bad up but i also think like the response to it which you know from a lot of the left is either like know this is perfect she did the perfect thing or know about optics here
or i told you she fucking saw a piece of shit and the response from liberal quarter's which is like they probably went there to do russia stuff together because they all like russia
all ironic because i i don't know i've been thinking about this vaguely about chelsea and i think that
chelsea sort of burst onto the consciousness of the very online left ourselves included because she did something very heroic it very selfless and was yes nearly tortured to death for seven years for it and because of the stupid way that we process people we like we've decided
after that
it's not just a person that we admire who does things that a person would do that they are living icon of everything that we believe in so if they do something that on first glance is like it leads bad optics
that it's actually correct or on the other hand if you put somebody up that much if you put them on that much of a pedestal if you make them so inhuman dehumanization walks and both ways both and making someone subhuman or angelic literally having no human qualities it will crush and disappointment so much that you will come out spitting venom or
worse become totally disengaged
and
i think the thing that no one is saying is that maybe this person who is stuck in solitary for seven years
maybe maybe they're having some trouble
maybe they're having some trouble in the fucking world
i had to say it like kind of annoyed me a lot seeing like near at hand in go interesting this is probably part of are planned to murder been carded and it's like is it is it that is of the cheers a comprehensive plan or is it the of a world view you never know irrigated and mean this person made a mistake
or did something stupid because maybe her engagement with the world is a little off from what you think it may be because your boss
blocked her in solitary for seven fucking years or you were being paid and bends or die as
to that add to that entire quarter who's spouting steam out of their fucking knows about this confirms and you their cree fucking craven mad men writings
joke out of fucking frogs the a bladder but you know i do want to say to everyone in our quarter like
you know this is not to say don't criticize or
if what she says is true is bad optic should certainly certainly that if you take that one picture and you go oh maybe she's like nuke us and riverbank or something
yeah because like i started edge in and all of them are using her appearance there to be like all like you know like hey we were all nice to her like if we were really nazis like we wouldn't have been meaning to chelsea or what i think it's that one is weird because everyone is like everyone is furious add
chelsea for oh you legitimize them like okay but then what do you say about like the new york times
right how many articles have we seen about how what a gene more likely that idiot buzz feed reporter like daily they interpret like you know
whether whether it's sure not like they have no problem going to these events and schmoozing with these people and giving them a platform or whatever my general opinion is that
being photographed with these people in any way or just giving them any kind of oh you shouldn't
about the about the the freedom night
one other thing can we can we listen to a little bit of the musical act of milk and cook yeah i found it so i read his music and we can we just era snippet of it is quite honestly like the worst garbage i've ever heard
it's like
yeah music written for a car


magic of diablo they lose universe and the movie
or had to take a pill that suppressed
milk and good sounds like knocking the actual act seem to be nice lake
twenty one they're like twitter and another like twins assessed hitler youth guys the property brothers his songs
no they're impression blues brothers
chris makes it very i think steve point that
this is there their seamless called joy district that that is where the the nazi assess joy division was held oh okay it was like the community in which you know will be all those wonderful gals big post punk set up yeah
this says
the law sexual excitement of qaeda or craft work fast
jimmy buffet this is the kind of music you put on when you're trying to seduce a serbian
don't
god you think this week with this guy mark stein it was on tucker doing he's a he's the new fourteen eighty eight beat reporter for tucker
petrol every episode of yucca see i'm not a not necessarily tivo this clip got passed around a lot and he is this like sort of canadian muppet who often is the sub co host for a rush limbaugh
he's been around for a long he's been so he's been like a national review guardians russian both pleasure boy yeah he's are easy easy easy easy easy rush pig
so he was on security and use in this clip that didn't pass around a lot where he says that like you know basically says demography his destiny and like in the future of arizona is hispanic and as such that effectively means that the border has been moved north and the he's lamenting the fact that like the south west is
as a lot of spanish speakers on it which is fucking funny because the past was also literally mexico but
i bring this up only because i treated about this learn the week but i really want to make this and want to get the spread is far and wide as possible marks nine cut an entire album called feline groovy
that is his sort of like you know when seth macfarlane like makes people companies parties and do is like lounge blizzard character and mixing crew to them i didn't know that but i would like an invitation to that he does that kind of like pseudo fake lounge lizards jazzy like swimming kind of guy yeah and he does he's call
songs about cats mark sign is an amateur lounge areas sings about as a jazzy songs that are all that house cats can i put one on his or a try yeah listen to
i taught i thought
a couple of vision
think
i thought i'd see
dad and been
you
i thought i still run
i thought i saw pussy
i still am
i saw
i still see
a group in
i did
good as plain as he could be
then proceed
really guys
guys that was overs new concept album
yeah there's there's there's a whole everybody bump that feeling groovy
no it's like i bring this up because you know marks nine has been a guy who was like proto oh all right before i even if thing he wrote a whole book about how europe is being out by muslims and what not and he's very much
know he likes cats as much as
back to the beginning and the pretty tat won't touch the koran is trying to get it
i thought i saw a boy
saying all law
i bring this up because
because it is these are people whether they are the date for freedom people are the slightly more upscale sophisticated version and like this sort of dad version of that represented by marx nine are people who are the self appointed defenders of western civilization and western culture and
they lament that it's being diluted by multiculturalism and diversity and they they hate that but i think it is absolutely bear it isn't obvious point but like it really berries stressing this is the culture they want
the culture that they're actually want in defending is not marble statues or like great works of literature or shakespeare charles dickens it's this it is the most chin see corny bullshit imaginable every this is what they feel safe with this is what all of our culture would be like if they
even announced our you know what it is every single one of these guys is gail better
