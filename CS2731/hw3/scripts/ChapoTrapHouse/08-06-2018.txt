so that's like to any athletes at remembered coach showered friday night lights will lisa he said
every man will have a fight over fight that he loses what's important is that he doesn't lose himself so want to lose this episode but we're not going to lose ourselves now we're gonna go down guns blazing absolutely
noble that a martyr stuff yeah i remember be like slim pickens on the back of the now carriers okay so we because wilson out here we have very well prepared we didn't really think about this at all workers have planner so we just show up
we do have a few subjects to talk about this week
before before we put this out here and and hope that the show still goes afterwards
and today we wanted to wish a few people congratulations i think that maybe the theme for this week's show is just graduated a few her favorite people and institutions in this country for the great job doing three in mind the first being tim cook an apple which this week became the first company in
history to have a market valuation of one trillion dollars i it's it's difficult to overstate how much money that is it's like when you go to see the grand canyon except it's instead of being overwhelmed by by the scope and iberia it's just it's just a giant pile of evil
it's really difficult to fathom one trillion dollars yeah it's like one of those ancient the cigarettes made of human corpses
it's astounding it's two thousand times one billion
that's a little math
that is that shirt way to have another no do that's true how any advanced math that's not but yeah
it's an insane amount of money and amber as you pointed out a hide it all ireland well also who's the company started by the company started by someone who tried to stop the rapidly dividing cells in his body from suicide bombing his life by do shit with
capri sun it's it's completely it's completely baffling that people are constantly talking about how stupid this man it's sort of noble because steve jobs like you imagine that like he was at bohemian grove and they were like we have like seven infant spines we can give you yeah he's
i'll put a cucumber is over my eyes i am i'm yeah that we are always talking about how stupid insane incredibly rich so called visionaries on his i mean i think it's kind of a reflection of our simpler and piety in some ways it's i think it's sort of a throwback i think it's very few
i mean who's the chinese emperor who thought if he took small doses of mercury everyday would make him more and that was something machiavelli
course hero he wrote the book art war
outdoor
now size own ago as i am at this last night with angela and she's like yeah i pay like point zero zero two percent of attacks and ireland because they hide it all and like shell companies in ireland ireland like it skipped industrialization it went from a sheep and bob to silicon v
got nothing in the middle there are no factory and like of their liberal class loves it too they like were modern as they're getting just fucking fucked by attack and the stack and were like a real european country now it's like you fucking loser skill that kill them and take their money and like the last financial crisis just poking holes them
oh yeah only only they turned it into their only big industry like as a tax shelter and like secondary great financial city outside of london and after that they're like well this can literally never happen again yeah just as reliant on and even more they have one of those tax policies that usually only like formally
colonized caribbean island nations with like thirty people on them halfway they out to has ports where they sell passports to like pick up artist said that they can hide their bank accounts i mean i know you know there are easy to make fun of an all white and such but they are colonial they work early oppressed by
they're basically the same as those caribbean nations they were taken over by the british and got it and destroyed and now they're just trying to rob a few bucks together using the financial sectors are kindling it's so it is fascinating it is legitimately fascinating how much liberals are vulnerable to insecure
he's like obviously there's that there's a lot of
you know backlash against like tech and exploitation among among the irish who are actually have i think that our class politics generally and americans but they're liberals are just so obsessed with like being a modern country they've completely internalize i guess what the english lot of them was just like a bunch of like bog people that were like civilized
slightly by the catholic church i blame angela's ashes because if anyone remembers a book it was prepared no one remembers that everyone present but i would hope so it was a huge huge hit while we're not on longer watches like you and and it was not in that particular book in america for a while and it was just about these suits smeared orphans
in limerick
go or whatever and it was i think a lot of the irish people are like now and what had happened we're going to turn this place in tech made a haven
i'm not going to be laughing at us when we all have like
ltd screens in our tank pubs
but now they're find out they have the tax shelters and i also have a red heart real estate market and as we all know that is a ticket to non stop and ever expanding well nothing the fire economy just get any kind of for action whatsoever
obliterate like any kind of protection you might have for your ever expanding service sector it's just all fire economy just real estate you can i mean they're rank crisis is as bad as ours now financial care and you pay that much to live in toppling it's basically a farm financials cannibalism source in
rented global real estate bubble somehow like that's the most amazing shit over and this is fucking incredible they can keep our eyes that he will know i commute from madrid to dublin or something like for a long long time it was absolutely unimpeachable receive was that there was no such thing as even within one can
a single housing market early regional markets and there was you couldn't have an entire country have a bubble or whatever and they're like fuck that will see that and create an entire world
real estate market never done before you think about it so irish to wake up late sleep through industrialization common job financial of the hyper financial as age what i was here
whoa i caught him but i understand that they'll come out a lot of them
right next to and have a very deep complicated relationship and inferiority complex and resentment of of the u k
the center of european finance capital right there in london they got that big pickle you know the big green pickles
the pickle wreck building
when you call yeah
and they look like folk i one one of them what to one of them and totaling i get the stuffy and left me that big spike in the middle which is nice because you can never get lost in the thirty square speed of dublin with that thing random and on we are actually do loved up on literally is literally a city full of the best people at the bar
you walk around it and the you honestly get the impression that all the buildings are made of gingerbread oh it's adorable like you could just start nibbling on them and and legs deeply yeah it's or and we make fun of them for everything but a lovely people
shockingly attractive i mean a h poorly it's like a go to bed silly and murphy and wake up like steve pan and
but very cute very charming always very like it is weird as a new yorker to go to dublin and be like how people just like talk to you with a bar here yeah that's true that was where there was a weird experience say they just genuinely benevolent and friendly and then
it reaches a certain hour of the night they start shoving each other it's a great time and they've been nice enough to help create this unprecedented tech behemoth
there was created as we said by the juice the juice man steve jobs
and i think that the question of how we have to think it's the same thing reason people insist the dunk trump is a good businessman
the juice man had to have been a genius because otherwise
this whole thing is just a push button
exploitation apparatus that any of if they're in the right type time and place can take advantage of someone saying what if we made it smuggler yeah i don't want over there is no buttons on it
well the night he is nice but the real the real whole place where the margins come in is creating the suicide met slave army to build the shit that's where you actually make the money not deciding shouldn't have a fucking partner
but those things have to be the product of like a will have to it is it's futile and it's even deeper than that it's like is like
the original nose
civilizations were with the god emperor were you know no one who had a building that big and and we could command armies and large could be just a mere regular asshole again we don't feel you know admiration for these people we feel like piety for
absolutely and of course of and mosque thing is though is the mayor possible true of that this guy who not only is a genius but according to a lot of his friends literally save civilization they have put all of their hopes for the survival of this species on the pickle rick billionaire like the reddit the
edit mean guy the epic bacon billionaire is in their minds the only thing standing between us and annihilation
i mean how do you even get out of the bed in the morning if you actually thought that you think wow those climate change looks pretty scary
might be a problem and then you look at and musk
treating you know fucking links to big bang theory episodes and he really likes and you know we'll be ok folks were going to do it was the health thing that the deeper we go the more we become a feudal society and this is just this is perfect it's it's perfect
we can actually name anything that you on most kids ever done
though we think is impressive because you actually look ok he made electric car but costs four hundred and eighty nine thousand dollars
constantly recalled and socks up all the time he blew work with smother asshole to like come up with a credit card processing system online basically and then everything else purely theoretical but because he is to be anointed sign epic science guy he's going to sex it same with steve jobs steve jobs is like
he didn't invent watershed you invented the dumbest shit in the world which is being attacked executive who takes lsd it is like
oh my god i saw garden he taught me how to increase efficiency
but he mostly just benefit of the creations of other people and and was like i invented this same thing about this now
like whenever on the geopolitical finance like landscape or whatever is the eel you know that that great
you know advocate is of workers the european union actually intervened and told ireland now you have to make them pay taxes to you and ireland was like no
don't you address that he really loves me it didn't come yeah yeah just a battered wife your country and and i mean there is some popular like opposition to this obviously among the irish but they're not in play and this at all it's just it's just an argument between
the e u and like irish liberal capitalists while everyone else hopes that the lake more sustainable form of capitalism ways or
it's the perfect vehicle for neo feudalism because what has less accountability to any popular well than just completely made up money what can you do began to share it doesn't really matter how many irish people it yeah bitches what are you going to do we move the decimal point along we decided that this does more
pointers and born here we entered a few things on the spreadsheet now you have four trillion dollars park here that is sort of liquid but also sort of totally made up you can borrow against to make these buildings look like they're a background in halo two that are just going to crumble urge
filled with empty units
in an oil had their you can't do anything about it there's no a people's advocated nice there's no institution
now they have the irish working class that has literally any any say in this whatsoever well i mean that's that's all of us i mean we we does not have countervailing institutions
go run and buck wild yeah but it's sad when it happens to us because they're nicer than us
they won't be know yeah
any americans and fifteen yeah i mean
yo thing about it is and the liberals by the way the irish liberal cavernous what here then be like yeah we're going to be and fifteen you enjoy it's going to be great for you earn a little thing called the golden corral yeah look forward to you know no longer having sex or drinking at all and just you know applying highlight are all night
and taking instagram photographs of yourself i will say though that
it will be nice to be able to go there and be able to get free refills on sarah
genuine american innovation that i do appreciate whenever i not have access to the sequel to is usually only thing you're anti nanny say about what now i just i'm not
just you go to a foreign country and us for a soda and they give you like a shot glass with no ice and acosta four euros or whatever and you don't get another on this is just give me give me the big public glass filled with coke and give me another one them
maybe one more when they become american angela's ashes becomes angel cell phones and it is a tale of a bunch of like she'd adolescence be more useful my headphones to you're so fucking day it's still nine hundred thousand pages
up a secondary economy just space and girls doing their eyebrows on youtube do people in the british isles law they oh my god that's because my fallback well yeah
the next financial crisis going to be you to being eyebrow tutorials they have some fucking sheath door
you fucking boomerang what are they doing it's a mate like yeah
it's it's like a racing stripe i don't know what happened in the british i don't know if it's like a ghost of colonialism or something but i have no idea it's
it is fascinating to like walk into like a london pub and see a bunch of girls like just completely joan crawford it out
while drinking like watery warm longer just
it's fucking boomerang is above arrivals i don't know and then just they still didn't fake tan they're like it's two thousand and three it's very weird
europe's always a little behind but they're not fully behind though always pick like a couple things we used to have and then go for ages of gone with
just thinking how weird it would be if you're someone in dublin grow up your born in say like before is or first is this the new fake money world economy is great because it makes the economy just a mystical thing that you cannot fathom or understand just more there has been advantage
get a staff that is amazing force that you don't understand that's i mean that is why so many people are drunk because if the guy just goes up there is like the economy jobs well
this system is so mercurial in fucking weird and you are applying box you are all your life is getting better even though it may tangible ways it is worse than it has been in your lifetime there are enough like outside bullshit indicators maybe a new glasses your abomination going up maybe tag
you are making more money even if you don't pay attention to see
the economy so intangible to you now that if you're resentments align the right way or you're if you're irish your ambitions your lobo ambitions your inferiority complex work the right way this mystical beast has enough benchmarks don't actually mean anything that you can stand by it well that
explains then why the ireland took to finance capitalism so well because what is the traditional irish get rich quick stream it is you follow rainbow and a drunk man
choke him until he gives you a magical pot of gold and and that is the best is steve jobs as it's the best analogy to sort of yeah the mystical nature of modern finance capitalism it is like getting a leprechaun and he just snaps his fingers of the know what we should be highrises now this is amazing
oh that's what she get for creating a nation whatever cut this arena yeah
one hundred nation you're on the ad or
okay so congrats first and foremost through the good folks of ireland who helped the good folks of apple yeah become the world's
most monstrous financial enjoy the new hair world is coming but another don't worry will last forever
another guy that we want to say shower to his big ball or palma before
it was everyone knew and he was originally charged with of his shenanigans and tax avoidance the he was rang and i believe that was in a deposition yeah
a fan of basically laundering money through buying absurd items and just kind of like parking the money there but what we found out this week and his trial is that the ring thing he really loved to buy was ball or as suits he bought over over a million dollars one point three million dollars
i'm custom suits between two thousand and ten and two thousand and fourteen
i mean i just try to imagine what not since isn't injure has there been someone who has figured out how to blow money on clothing aware that was for me specifically this is very hard because i honestly don't think that i have spent more than maybe five hundred dollars on clothing and my entire life so
the app
like find your pants in a garbage can
kroger is going to find clothing paul matter for his pomona for and but just this this is a general type of rich guy though there is very like almost tragic to me i think the guy he just looks like any middle aged guy you've ever seen but he's says he's incredibly vain but knows he can't change
these two old he can't change like is shape or how they'll never see a cool guy what i mean those are now the mark house and buys these insane say i mean you can buy your way or so much you can buy your way out of pretty much every inconvenience you can buy aware of consequences you can buy your way out of almost any feeling but you know if you're
one of these guys really can't buy your way of your own skin but god you they try the buyer way out of your own stupid skin and into a fifteen thousand dollar astrid skin
fifteen thousand dollar asterisk and jacket i mean i don't know how you wear that honestly you when you black career at suit
it's leather no it's just a jacket fifteen thousand of our jacket
i honestly don't know how you dress like that
i mean he's just an impulse buy he probably wore it to like outing
no way or the suits you were to leg work or like an event it's like oh mobutu sese seko kid is being research sized
and even where the jacket like a cool of that era astrid shack it i'm going to say hey we found church church power to check non stuff the palm and forty eight it's like we clone the last row and we're gonna kill it and he would wear to mean by church i mean like whatever you know she
faraway place they all these children right the catholic church
he were to commit ping pong but the other thing that people say about this is that while this is basically a money laundering operation
because he had all of his money and foreign accounts i don't think they understand that laundering is not laundry and
but i mean those it different the fact is that he had all this money and foreign accounts and the thing about their money is you can't use it for most purchases or you can't pay your mortgage you can pay creditors or anything you can only the only thing you can do is find somebody who will take direct wire transfers and luxury goods and so the theory there is literally had too much money
like too much money to even stands right here he had money couldn't spend because it was it was hidden from the united states government
he didn't declare
but it was of the country so he couldn't access it because that is a weird isn't it
but tantalizing money than all of this money but you can only spend it on damn share well that's weird it's like
it's like a curse it's like some sort of sequel the producers millions is like you have all this cash but you can't do anything that anybody else does with money you have to buy weird exotic items
just have them in your house and just like well you know it's a fifteen thousand are jacket but like i guess i could put it on ebay or something i didn't craig's list ad and get somebody smart he will do what all redneck stale which is fine he objects that are high value but appreciate the lease which are guns and guitars
that allow myself at the same amount of money would be cool if he did that but apparently it was all clothing
and like
emerson island with ronnie mine and he's losing money on that you know he's handling the real analysis is the depreciation is high i rather than very sad
nobody else on earth biases shit
while i mean we know it wasn't very good at his job because got own as soon as anyone who looked at him for more than a minute which is really the thing to me the one actual meaningful take away from the entire russia whole shit is just how comically horrific three corrupt everyone involved in washington dc polish
access to the degree that if any of them gets the slightest scrutiny from from an investigative body five million crimes are immediately reveal look at all the people including democrats who are now caught in the backlash of just the man afford investigation like fucking the protesters and own former white house counsel for obama
craig craig craig
first thing manner for it's going to get him for his birth certificate fraud sorry to the site your name was no one's name known as a literary critic but i yeah i feel like now at the point in the
in the more investigation where it's already from casino religious bitching and he had zero three
it is reveals every crime
when ever did
manna for implicates everyone who's ever talk to every lot like i mean i would say that like someone like lanny davis is probably like smarter than manner for to the extent that he hides it a little bit better like manner our dog's name that's true that's true
man of easy as smart as a golden retriever manner for it's money laundering is just like comically incompetent
like i thought to be fair i thought a lot of the suit buying was money laundering but it's like know bitch was
it's the other money laundering is like he would wander through like a rug restore able to payment like legal business
god do know it's ever going to look into those
nonetheless rugs you gotta figure that man afford is more the mean than the external absolutely and and it just shows a businessman and this of course makes you think even more about the obama administration argument about why they couldn't prosecute anybody involved in the mortgage collapse because you know hey
great if we could have found evidence but there just wasn't there wasn't a strong enough case
i'm sorry any of these guys gets one agent spending an absolute denying it not only at all even for a second yeah like the criminality is out the open continues because it is not considered criminality it's not considered it a priority it's considered the lubricant for the how the system works so it will never be any
and if you want to talk about like stopping russian nefarious foreign intervention in politics i don't have this fucking class of absolute drifters that close to the levers of power and the first place
maybe at the very least investigate these kinds of crimes that have have a government like a prioritizing and also of course best of all not having people with this much criminal amount of money in the first place to splash all over the political system
that's the actual fucking like agenda item that we launching the cold war america doesn't want seal
ever be told to get a own house in order and a never well and that's kind of a yeah we rule we always will rule if anything goes wrong it's because someone else and it has nothing to do with their own shortcomings i mean like you realize when you pay too much attention to the democratic party is a laugh
it is you become like a boot straps personal responsibility as you like you fucked this up this is your fault take some responsibility and they never will oh yeah after after two years following this fucking nightmare i just feel like a boomer now if you feeling about it
are all the time yeah
rooney is a problem but me a while now america i mean america is just a reality show contestant
didn't come here to make friends and a sick of everybody else has drama that's that's american general
okay so there's one more guy we want to say congratulations to the and i think this is i think our favorite of the three we've talked about and a guy who we all miss great deal and think
have a tremendous amount of respect for that his former president barack obama who turned the magical number of fifty seven years old and states
today another obama gaffe like you'd think you just skip this year
people with yeah
i'm fifty eight let's not talk about fifty seven
every a can handle his birthday
yeah he's going to have the pie or he's going to have a cake with with fifty seven states on it
a own half and count how many seats
oh i'm in be cooler than we were my birthday suit
older so in honor of barack obama supporters of the president the president who basically didn't exist at this point
the disappearing president i think the least consequential two term president ever maybe when any my in the simpsons yes i'm trying to think of a two term president who had less of a lasting impact on american politics and barack obama easy benjamin franklin
because because he like none of his his accomplishments have stood the test of time his attempt to heal the divide in america's local
dialogue is attempt to rise above partisanship
none of it had none of it has left a mark on any of the political institutions or the political discourse it's it's like he'd never existed
it's it's breathtaking railway
no one is mad at him now i mean i but i mean again we are i any no one is mad at him like they just like are we this year well yeah because all politics is just sort of like mysticism now and the reason you'd miss obama is you miss the feeling
failing of not having to worry which i understand i did feel better than oh my god i'm unquestionably the culture was better i didn't have to respect seth meyers
i didn't have to see fucking five billion asshole from the f b i oh god every day and resubmit like it was better it felt better most of the things that suck or the same but it was you know better but you know the people who were throwing their bodies on the pyre obama come back
avant comeback they just want to feel him back
and obama he can't really showed them i i saw
i thought with the adoration of which i've seen many times where it's like when both you obama please help us it's like he was literally president
what do you think he was doing this
how he thought he was helping yeah
it's a you know what is he going to say what can he say without realizing he's about as i'm an idiot what easier are realizing that he completely failed yeah so he's got to spend the rest of his life
no cloning jellyfish with richard branson
you know just water skiing with naked models on his back but that's true because his the
the crux of his conception of politics that of his role in politics was as the guy who would give a speech i mean there really is true and that is why the right wing was so crazy mask i have a or thing because they thought that well if you can take his rhetorical ability and and reduce it to reading off of a script
when you have reduced him as a figure because everyone understood him as this rhetorical figure he had those like his career was propelled at every point by an amazing speech and a moment the first one of course was the two thousand and four the keynote and then after reverend wright thing remember there was forever right thing during the two thousand and eight campaign and everyone freaked out and oh my god
had this is this white racist was this guy he's crazy by at nationals what are we going to do and he like went into seclusion right and he and he sat in his study and he spent the night writing by hand speech about race the he delivered in philadelphia that he was so west wing
the most west wing thing in recent american political history because we're oh my god he was a liberal poster yeah studies like you know up we're going to fight this year by what post he posted and the thing is it worth i mean you there are you wouldn't matter anyway but in terms of the way if you will remember that campaign he gave that
about race and everyone stopped and thought wow whole lot of merit and they forgave him forever right and he went on to win
like that's how he thinks of it because and
he were to come out and try to do a speech again
like like a third act kind of thing like roy hobbes in the natural it would instead he knows and is however i think because how could he not down from france president that it would not be the movie ending of the natural that everybody remembers where he hits the home run that smashes the light read it will be there being in the book
where worry fucking strikes out and then dies because he would give the speech nothing will happen and then the entire premise of his political career would it would just crumble in front of it yeah it's it's not just the speech thing i think people did like the speeches and eight and feel guide or whatever
any was he was a pretty good orator but you have to realize the standard the power had been set so low you sell and that going to help him in the long run because look at where he is like will at the same with everything has many a comparatively look at the salem witch of presidents that obama is going to be between yeah the murder cowboy
and then trump by how how is he not going to look good and elevated and presidential compared to that right
because yeah i require holy reactive yeah you know it's all just a matter of like this is so much less embarrassing than the previous president but i do like that in his retirement he realizes it's sort of impotence i give him credit for that because for most of his presidency he was he seemed to be genuinely delusional and if you look at
the the memoirs of a lot of people there's there's a new book up by one of his
one of his assistants the talks about how during the showdown for the government for the debt ceiling showdown after that the tea party election in two thousand and ten
they sat out the republicans this is a thing that ended up with all the awful shit like sequestration and all that
talks about how there's this is after the tea party elections after mcconnell said we wanted and i'm a third term after the the two thousand and ten midterms lead up was just a bunch of ring cycle paths with tea bags hanging from their fucking ear lobes holding brown purse markets and pointing them a congressmen who are trying to give them
obama care
they sat down and the as we are going in and negotiations
believing the the best intentions of her her part of our other number like that's what they were saying in two thousand and fucking eleven there are saying we we gotta assume that these guys are operating in good faith so his entire presidency was based on delusion but i think the thing for most like it did for a lot of us kind of woke him up because he has decided
just to spend the rest of his life just easing into global point one percent debauchery
just like go fuck it likes the first thing he did was he went pear sailing with richard branson now he's got a fucking net flicks deal to do a bunch of movies we can hang out in hollywood
she signed to phase
yeah
you're a bitch
spawn campers are you didn't build up i'll give him playing with the epoxy america has just reading them for soccer
i it
john build god dammit
i'm never gonna want to score game with you
just be throwing like glasses on the floor and taking off their clothes and rolling in it
hedge or can was to ham on getting by scott free he got away with it he is now he's doing what do you always want to do it was a to the global we should our is unquestionably the hang out with with the global monsters and and go to davos time he wants to

had grind for this view but the plead the sad bereft liberals who left in his wake and have to have to live not in the global money
clough the heaters but in america governed by donald trump psychotic republican there are a little more upset or a lot more sad a wistful and i wish the trump that obama woods back and they're are expressing that as a lot of weird ways the funniest one in my opinion is a new book
karen up amazon charts
called hope never dies and obama pipe mystery the first of what is promising to be an obama by mystery series i wanted it it's seizure and adventure would have been cool and i would have or coloring book is written by andrew schafer and the description is as such
vice president joe biden and president barack obama team up in as high stakes thriller the combines a mystery worthy of watson and homes with a laugh about romantic chemistry of lethal weapons murder and rigs way this is slash frank basically us with with with you i think you have to pay extra for the sex scenes
vice president joe biden is fresh out of the obama white house and feeling adrift with his favorite railroad conductor dies in a suspicious accident leaving behind a railing wife and a trail of clues to unravel to unravel the mystery amtrak show teams with the only man he's ever fully trusted the forty fourth president of the united states
amtrak jones and the chase for me too
together they will plummet darkest corners of delaware traveling from cheap hotels the poker powers and beyond as they uncover the sinister forces advancing americans epidemic
you oh you mean they're like own party's donors
yeah presumably and all the superdelegates yeah presumably and it pulled the mask off of the monsters face and it's a or something
thriller and part romance second time they mentioned the prominent so yeah they're pushing the slash for i love the word romance it just another word for male male friendship for people who have never experienced that everything has to a special award
the opportunity to i never saw mill ship except for the movie will serve okay
oh
did you will boast or was a poor people do everything as ever que
yeah i have had children now has to be premier one hundred rating like the hardy boys versions of politics yeah the as now we are our children our our interactions and all of our dynamics have to be branded in a specific ways that we can talk from parliament a shorthand that maybe have a t shirt or something or certainly ashtray
partners for and part romance hope never dies it's essentially the first published work of a palmer infection and they are now why first and a canary
i'm a cathartic read for anyone distressed by the current state of affairs all my guy they adjusted admitting they're just like eat the loudest is great yeah yeah here's a pacifier for you you stupid fucking baby
so there is also as others make ever years there is an inner well there are reviews won't talk about but first there's an interview with the author enter schafer and they ask him where the idea for hope never dies come from the first time i saw joe biden in his ray ban aviators i thought that guy's an action hero
the eighty year old man he said as haven't played average finish area is only have like a brain hemorrhage is the sunglasses the suit the dead serious stare you think you'll have a chance
seen anyone wear sunglasses before our fucking dumb people are old person wear sunglasses because they have cataracts because the sun will kill them
like fucking jesus
the top bush should games born to oh my father this is entirely against like the kind of onion manifesting now that's applied see the sky this why this guy is really weird on manifestation there is like a sleazy sex group really
now i mean i'm eighty here that biden is actually like the perfect example of the sort of person who you would like to be your next door neighbor but you don't want in charge of anything ever not even like a block clean up can now he's not he's not like he's not like your wag year anyways of fucking complete scumbag is totally behind
old into delaware
ireland is flat plane of nothing is that is a tax haven for fucking everything
cynical people every fucking architect of the drug war he's a pc shares actually that biden crime dollars yeah unsuitable for i mean a huge amount of incarceration of the best thing that ever happened to him and he's like a ruined crazy uncle notches
chris dodd know but that's have english language
is that that uncle is that guy but it's just like he's nice to you give you twenty bucks
yeah forget it
well
you're saying oh it goes against the onion thing but now he's he's taking a reconsideration it's a synthesis the sunglasses the suit the dead serious or you think you're looking at james bond then he opens his mouth and sticks his foot in it and you realize he's closer to leslie nielsen i toyed with the idea of a solo joe biden novel for years but it never went anywhere for years can you a
with a gargoyle toiling in your like your garrett he's sitting in the dark in front of an old tiny typewriter it's just a pile of cigarette butts his hands are ripping his hair out why wont work it's there but i can't make you work it's just so freaking
epic what what should surely quote should equal whoop there it is or who at the dogs out i can't pick know that that's the thing everyone fucking makes made for mitt romney for the dogs out it's like yeah that's not really different from anything joe biden our government on it as ryan is that all time when the obeid here comes when the obama biden romance
memes began circulating on the internet or in there for a final months on an office
robots i passed it off the idea i have soul i dusted off the idea of doing a job i signed up and tweaked it mainly by add president obama as the sherlock to chose watson
was have a chance that someone who's read this book one hundred percent awesome was a challenge to right action scenes for a protagonist who is seventy five years old
surprisingly not joe biden is in fantastic shape i had the hobble and with a bum knee just the right things competitive between him and the bad guys do you have a particular favorite biden isn't that you wrote pile mode hold the pie
so that's the that's the book
you know nine gag kind of wonder culture or i inherently angrily
everything supposed really walk in progressive and sofa for me yet radical now but it just feels like everything it's just week epic yeah all the time
joe one hundred percent epic when you see about the ways your supposedly the walkways you supposedly allowed to insult people like you realize that like a definitely dominated that scares oh my god yeah just the only non able is rated saw someone like you fucking kidding here awful yeah laos and you know some people have
austin he ranks felix
yeah and there's one of you i wanted to read about this
a verified purchaser i was torn between four and five stars because honestly this isn't the best book ever written or even in my top one hundred as far as the detective
that guy bragging
as far as a technical skills a really serious
but the plot is mine and by the numbers however this may be the best book ever narrated by a fictional joe biden so there's that also given the times we live in i really needed to read this book about to totally decent humans who have each other and our brave and true and get things done
got so much can look as president of a deal
what all of those like british soldiers did after they were all fucked up from world war one and go to asia and get an opium had it you know they can maybe just if you're going to drop out drop out and they dropped out but they never left
still around yeah because now there's the new there's the twenty first century option of dropping out is just going online
just just being extremely online you don't need to go to shanghai and find an opium den you can just log on and never log off know it up
i feel like nothing's ever going to get better and all you individually
seeing really pursue the habit of getting his video games
you ever felt that way and parishes and universal
i've heard that but not video game specifically between he may be so mad mad more traditional games is like i'm going to compete and detector
it's a soft game you can you can get good at will be funny to be like the ninja
jacksonville that jack
hi that requires coordination know we don't know many of the aggressive you can hurt yourself yeah being the top ranked ball player in the world
isn't that just like the tallest person playing admirable yeah you would take a bit
monkey both
so and i wanted to read a little bit for the beginning of the hope never dies and obama by mystery
one the night this all started i was in a black irish mood
that's okay
we have sad is even half is offensive to the irish that line so if you're gonna get mad at us irish listeners fine andrew schafer instead of black irish why
i don't even know what that would immediately peers as you mean it's they in the n word
it means he's thinking about all the times his ancestors were slave
and that was before i learned my friend was dead
i was sitting at my computer and i'd stumbled across one of those so called popper oxy videos yeah this is like while working for crush outskirts crush and outskirts
it opened with a wide shot of cape town fabled table mountain the camera panned down to the white kept waves of the harbor an impossibly wrong speed and or the frame cutting through the surf like a buttered bullet a pair of sailor trailed behind the boat high the sky tethered to the stern by thin rope the camera zoomed in on a daredevils space and i saw that my old friend morocco
obama was having the time of his life my own funny is the first line of dialogue hello barack obama former president i'm your friend joe biden former vice president i will say i will say that the one thing that this book gets right that isn't delusional i think an accurate
insight into the character of the care of pipe is that he might be a lizard puppet of military industrial complex and and of credit card companies but he genuinely his whole life clearly wanted to have a cool black friend and getting to be friends with obama clearly is
like the highlight of you watch lethal weapon movies every night now he wanted he always wanted to go black eye to be friends with them like that's that's the one thing that actually seems genuine about him and the one of the ways you can know that for sure is that obama was the guy you sat him down in two thousand and sixteen when he saw hillary limping through the primaries and thought and
not for me that i could get in here and actually when obama guy who sat him down and said don't rangel and it worked
because he clearly has that puppy dog admiration for obama
so kudos to pay for forgetting justice
eric supplicant part of vitamins relationship of better because he could have one he would have won my absolutely was much as i don't like him he would have one and he would have won because he wouldn't have made all the fucking bone headed too clever by half mistakes now of course you around or american idol nice races guy in delaware
you would have run a boiled meat and potatoes irish campaign good old fashioned award healers go and march walking around on the pox and he would have won it wouldn't it would have been easy
and he i mean i don't know if he could have beat hillary and the primary but
it's possible definitely more likable and hillary million times and obama i mean we want to talk about his his manifest incompetence is crimes like
and we've said this before but clearing the fucking tak for hillary in two thousand and sixteen
the greatest acts of political malpractice in history no one bothers the people that hate in like barack obama is jesus christ
you anything for the people who liked
okay and all that she turned on the other cheek and the back of atlanta yeah over all the all the things they are people did
no a huge it's like now only she can be said
fuck in a may and and actually
yeah that make refer to him reflects well on it means that he yeah he's he's above pettiness and he's a good person everyone you are super racist to me well no hard feelings river or you had a picture of me wearing a turban and the hammer pants and put that out into the press it's okay just it's amazing it's amazing how little memory
yeah we have like hillary did run like pretty much like a boring strasser is take it
i'll show it as as we said she ran the actual search should have just been like
oh yeah she would like go to some steel mill be like i'm not gonna let them make any more rap
just like a ladder is are taking away our jaya eight years later clear the deck like everyone's races but
dude i'm always and the guy ah cleared the deck for her that was the guy ritchie her people race agitated
rules are rules no one's ever get to talk about it no one mentions it it just forty and also it's also you a laugh thing and yeah and of course like the shops
people who think that they have inside inside inside inside will argue with that say no he didn't do it because he's smog and because he wanted to feel like he was you know
he was big harder to wherever he did it because it needed to keep the clintons on his side he didn't want them outside
also the white house like sewing descent and it's like one that didn't even work she was fucking leaking the whole time she was secretary of state and her people were bitching about in the entire time and also how do you not recognise after she loses that gimme race that she's a spent force in american politics and not some here to worry about it's like
oh it's not nearly as bad as in the bankers
we could be done with the clintons forever oh god now
i'm giving you i'm incidentally redoing the series yeah you have to watch the show forever he tried one of those fuck he tried one of peter tools plug boys and in the room and squeezed are full of teenage poor to keep pumping just long enough to eat shit for fucking donald trump
so this is he's he's looking at this paparazzi video his buddy having the family's life unencumbered by the dead weight loser vice president
forty four was on a vacation to end our vacations wind surfing on richard branson is private island kayaking with justin trudeau base jumping in hong kong with bradley cooper brock wasn't simply tempting the fates he was staring them and why not if he could survive a long years is the first black us president he can survive anything not that i was worried about him i was getting all worked
top of barack obama is this book written for readers who don't know who obama is kiss every every every line is like being that he was the forty fifth president of united states
as a former senator from illinois
i forced myself to walk away from the computer i turned to face with our poured on the back all of our office there was an all christmas gift from my daughter i'd kept it in storage for many years but now i finally have some free time on my hands maybe too much free time one call i said to my faithful companion champ that much to ask
yeah
dog the dog glanced up with indifference he'd heard it all before just one phone call i said in a snap of the rest i sent the dirt sailing across the room it here
mark right between bradley cooper's piercing blue eyes
a years
it's from the shredded magazine cover taped to the board and that even a gosh darn postcard prague even have the gall to tell people magazine that we still were golfing to around it and first about biden would not say gosh darn he would say the word also obama would have eaten champ i know
handle to save face i repeated the why the truth was there hadn't been any golf outings no late night texting not even a friendly poke on facebook
i watch the skies for smoke signals i read the new york times dissecting headlines looking for clues he might have left me nothing sometimes late at night after chose to sleep i scroll through the old text messages brock and i had exchanged a lifetime ago it was an exercise in futility if i kept looking at the wound it was never going to heal
in the darkness outside my office window at once the tiny flickering light i turned off
taylor swift so i can't really make any i'm already has clearly like going through something is he's right
he said a real break up and the only way he could process it is by turning it into a tale of
of scorn between former president vice president i turned off my lamp my desk lamp to get a better work and there it was again a pinprick of orange light like a firefighter a cigarette prowler maybe only one way to find out let's go champ the dog's ears perked up i the on the smoke was safe there are two things inside my medal of free
adam and my sig sauer pistol who i slipped the pistol into the waist band at the smoke by back then my polo shirt over it i called out my wife and wearing champ out she didn't answer back i can hear the tv playing in our bedroom law and order i should have been watching with her instead i open the back door
as soon as i did champ race across the lawn and tore off into the woods the motion like over the porch should kick on to propose burnt out all bob's romantic burn out
the one says that mean foreshadowing
a character joe biden will one day die of old age i think he's saying that these conveying the job i was filled with the sense that he he's is past his usefulness is sort of just waiting to die but i feel very shortly meaning will come back and it was like the moon was far enough to wire up the backyard or seven thousand square foot lake house
the four acres of property is as old bragging about his real estate during his own internal monologue
the problem is it only got up and over the every year over the past five late at night it was possible to imagine you were all alone in the world
however i wasn't alone ahead in the woods was this pinprick of white and now i smelled of a tobacco a familiar brand marlboro reds
your hopes up i told myself hope is just a four letter word across the yard walking to the spot where champ it disappeared into the trees at the edge of the clearing i spite of vertically challenged manner dark grey suit matching tie he had short spiky hair like it recently been discharged from the marines it was letting it grow out an earpiece disappeared into his collar secret service
my heart was beating faster than a dog licking a ish
my own security
last year
he had been my own security to help and dismissed earlier seven were weak dismissed several weeks earlier buy presents for granted six months of protection falling their time in office now day more or less they were extenuating circumstances nice night for a walk i said secret service natalie was showing me the way i tucked under a low hanging branch and kept walking but heavy for
overhead the fuse the moonlight i had a tread carefully to avoid the underbrush the smell of burning tobacco grew stronger i called the champ
in response i heard flint striking steal a lighter close by i sold around there to my left by the big oak ten paces away a man crush low scratching champ behind the ears german shepherd still talk to strangers
man was no stranger he rose to his feet a slim figure in his black hand tailored suit is white dress shirt unbuttoned that the mac he took a long drag off a cigarette i exhaled smoke with leisure barack obama was never guess is fifty shades for people who retain like house
the saddest tracking of thing i can really make fun of age ages like managed you hate it
sorry you just have to see it's a god damn shame what happened to this porn am would have to everybody that there's there's seriously huge demand for this book or tons of people

grown ass adult in develop a fucking opie and habit everyone everyone
you know tumor is lives services maoist
us
the my own goals who average
but salted this isn't making things and
isn't doing anything folks were taken the black the day so it's just dragging
how do you go on you read you you you like that's a book that makes you feel good you read words like obama and biden are epic together and then you turn on the news etc
the guy who is president is restarting his feud with her as your oh
as though they're going to do war with iran was going to win a second term
go back to that the oh my god this just grim fucking grim you have no actual like plan for how things are going to get better just like this i just want another president that feels epic what does is
wanting aerial obama know the author oh that's a good question or know
some kind of elaborate prank i'm michelle while back because i wouldn't i mean in terms of describing alienation
