okay job on track agenda action item number one little boys and girls it's your champ up for this week the introduction of the show
we're coming to you from l a where of course out here as the first leg of our west coast tour
and gotta be honest you folks are the top of this one if you were expecting this episode to be informative
or you know
really a good deed to die or insightful or anything like that is full it anyway
you know keep listening
it doesn't matter because we're here to have fun we're here to keep it loose as a goose and it doesn't matter anyway because literally just as i'm recording this i just received confirmation that john bolton is our do
her doesn't need to be confirmed i either how it on advise the wall within that or is probably telling trump as i say this to attack north korea and iran at the same time up they'll never see it coming
oh how are the are the episodes year old did while i was away
but there were a gamer great actually great yeah they to the one we don't really free at lucid have felt better than it has a long time ago it was it was almost like we didn't have a bunch of three quarter for water bottles hanging around her neck
that's really unbelievable
it's a person's home is their castle and you take one rent boy
the sanctity of your castle
you have violated the sake of the stern
well i yeah the last laugh because i reported shoes for doc sing
that's been banned from twitter
finally get him outta here
i can only wonder what he's doing a ganymede right now
i i mean i don't think it's time for us to old like petty resentments
he things like huge and not in the board
we'll see what had been up since we got here to l a
fill you in on the details were we were doing a little this
that's true
loan to clean and area we were having to room as race
okay yesterday i had my first ever i'll walk into a store front the gold drug buying it was so cool now
that's not really illegal drug use if he's just go to bodega and buy heroin from the guy behind the counter and that doesn't make it legal even if he has a cards manner
we'd it over the counter of a bodega like on some like wink wink i'll have the ice tea please
but this was like an actual we'd start this is the fall california weed store oh yeah it was deck
it was glorious
treats and eats through heart's content it was so oddly sterile the stores very professional they take your d when you walk in the marijuana plants are arranged by type and potency
there's a magnifying glasses you can see to observe the crystals on them and the only really you know the weed cultural thing there are these framed posters of like counterculture relics like going to our crumb dropped just on one bear wall yeah it was very well
weird seeing this kind of thing rican texture realized in a commercial setting
like here hello this is the drug store here is the drug culture that goes with it it seemed wrong
oprah it's like a t g i fridays approach run out of bullets every every place gets like a couple of old hippie bullshit to put on the wall i appreciate the novelty of it both practical matter they should just sell it at wall greens absolutely
i do like somebody told me that the thing that has all the magnifying glasses examine the nerves brother lives for tourists because they are so enamored of this experience
go on a store really want to have done is done i went in there was looking through all gone
i've ever seen we get it and
they really should sell a wall greens along with heroin
oh boy it's all weapons that sort of thing we're agora us now
going to the weed store
well this is a is it good news pegged to to our shared experience here apparently jeff sessions or attorney general probably maybe in an attempt to keep his job is now officially said he is considering the find the death penalty to certain drug dealing really
god bless him
that the toddlers bray that our president has where there's all this drug problem
execute the dealers
you have to execute of the way they diabetes movie so you have to throw them off of buildings are fences or something or electrocute them by kicking them into a substation you can do a regular execution they have to be dropped from a helicopter into a volcano
just sort of angry at the plagiarism i mean talks you can pay once a year ago
is the new dennis leary i'm just yeah that's the worst
oh man and the other funny thing that was going on today
you know this i will apologise for again
we did last weekend's episode with the one who showed up in the one who violated virgil home
tim threaded you know
for that is keeping can animal abuser he's been kicked off twitter
fucking jordan peterson is just still at it
even better
i can just put it pretty bad yeah we wouldn't have to talk about what didn't i tell you guys do you were right to keep going even worse off relevant with overs hilarious
he's is such a funny person now it like every time move like that guys like their search and elevator whoever people we've made fun of before i was sort of a crisis of conscience like in talking about giving them the attention they so desperately want even if it's to be made fun of so viciously are we in fact contributing to their sir
raising their quotient
but at the other hand they're just too funny now yeah i'll talk about a very funny and german peterson just weeping openly
you while you file paul trying to vote by the literally the day after the episode came out jordan peterson had like five or meltdown online because of a negative review of him in the new york review of books
in which he was you know you could hear it years as he was taping it and he threatened to slap play the critic
don't want the tears fall you will still dark the out
this is the guy who
his response to being accused of being a fascist is to threaten political violence on somebody is is how do you say i'm a fascist i will beat you up i'll slap you silly i'll gladly good with physical combat and i've basically of fascism is do will go behind the c and i'll fucking work here
your ass bitch
we are not doing your and vigorous dan quinn yeah we got to build
edit that are built our mind palace enough yet we're taking the listeners on a journey
i'm always try to slam it here
clay around peterson
so essentially the import of of this entire meltdown was peterson misreading the phrase romanticizing the noble savage yeah which he took in context to mean you're you're fucking you're indian us because he emerges
he is he claims to be inducted into this indian tribe
he has intimate relationship with indian communities that he basically defines that kind of experience as romancing the noble savage which is a thing of this column a lot of fascist ideology of sort of fetish icing and also other ring
what is perceived to be like a pre civilization pure human like when a brief stalls photos of of the tribe yeah of other side messiahs i
that that's that's what it then continuing continuing on with this again that the clip of him just crying
now my new favorite picture is just the him with the tears welling up in his eyes
at the idea at his idea he is he's just thinking about his conception of the individual and that's what made him cry it is the exact equivalent of when steven seagal was brought to tears by the screenplay he wrote it's the same thing this video like originally wanted to come out it was a blog there was of his blogs oh before it was
or he was his the guy was during his ascent because he started off he got his initial
audience through through flogging through you tubes and this is the stuff that got him his original profile we need more of this weeping
i mean we've been kermit who apparently thinks that the sum total of all male relationships as a result of violence and that you have to be able to like imagine yourself beating up anyone who you meet and you have to be able to resolve to violence offenders enter any like disagreement they can otherwise be solved you have to always been
willing to do violence will and is other thing is if you're dealing with a woman had better that whole equation is out of why i use violence against their
his his fixation files for a guy who's like eighty pounds eighty pound done nods voice quavering nerd a use a geek well manny pack yeah i was pretty small maybe john peterson has a similar explosion of athleticism and the triangle defend he's just a bag of skin what what is intimidating about him and he's always say minds
yes out but he's always claim he is going to be physically he's arguing i oh i will come to you what i will slap you sir he means with logic i mean have you ever seen professor charles xavier lose if i get out
they based peterson and the reason or another bit
today about are putting brained what i mean again and just now consider the fact that this man is being advised by one of the greatest lunatics
one of the most war mad cool
those who is maybe it is our lack pill death worship or so this is this is charlie kirk interviewing donald trump
about the issue of like campus free speech and this is hilarious because charlie kirk's entire existence is based around this idea that conservatives are being persecuted college campuses it's why is turning point usa is given god knows how much money have god knows where so kirk asks him he gets the interview the big boy himself
set this thing up on a t and a knock it out of the and he he says the trump it's harder than ever to espouse support of your presidency in the ideas you're fighting for so thank you for what you're doing to give us the courage of our convictions to fight against political correctness but what advice do you have for young patriots and conservatives on campus that support your agenda
that are being ridiculed and silence because of administrators that are clamping down on free speech
big the beach ball on a key here
is going to just queue up and he's going to a nice he's a big old clothing they be like
fifteen different me he's giving you they step on one quoted to fifteen me he's using trump that puzzle that they give to people whose brains got home by these were just three big pieces
come on you can do it make the train so
burritos response i can you see the fatal flaw
the harley's question here yeah man it sure is hard to be a supporter of you had public a lot of people really don't like you yell at people when they say they like
you might as well be like president trump every time i go on campus people are saying that you couldn't have had cheryl tiegs and eighty one
you've been the fake friend anna wintour
so your ears trumps response
i'm just imagining charlie's like big smile just shrinking as this goes on and on so he says i think the numbers are much different than people think i think we have a lot of support if they have one campus or two campuses and we know what they are in it gets all the publicity we have campuses where you have the vast majority of people that are perhaps like many of the people
all in this room you could call it conservative you call whatever you want but there are people that want free speech if you look at what's going on with free speech with the super left with anti far with all of these characters i'll tell you what they get a lot of publicity but you go to the real campuses you go over the country you've got to the middle west you can even go out to the coast in many
cases we have tremendous support i would say we have majority the words
overalls university the cowboy boots technical college and then it did here he just says i think it's highly overblown highly below
pizza
no offense but the entire burden of your life is complete just from said that charge down your gullet annihilate fucking farm
charlie i actually think there's literally no reason for you to be on you have no purpose in your entire issue is hysterical gibberish and the funny part about this though is that trumps same the issue of free speech on campus and conservatives being persecuted by our of control pc left yeah culture he said it is highly over
blown and been fucking that teeth jonathan chait had an adult down today of being like oh so you agree with donald trump tower
this is an issue is that i agree with it
some obama or he says like all the killer i think girl campus
is for a dog barked all point of view
i know about barack obama actually got mad at overland when they got rid of dog general be inappropriate him
okay
so what you have the strange loving and madman
surely just portland
as part of his interview he should trump he won't start any more wars so okay i'm sure he'll he'll take up about five seconds to get around that one but disappeared you know this would be a good time to check in touch base with
the white house and the trump cabinet
the executive branch because you know there's been some some turn over for some of the jobs
maybe you listen to felix and derek
over the life and career of
living turkey want
i hate seeing regular say oh but i love watch him leave
is a big booty with no sodas and as a fucking huge hug yeah as a legit the caspian sea of oil and that bitch
rex pillars in as a type of ass where you wake up in miami in a guy's air and be where he spent his whole tax refund on it crowded to go up for the joke
go up on twitter
apparently fired on the toilet
and then i think the the ongoing theme here is no matter who you are it's trump fires and embarrasses and humiliates you and you leave your white house job in disgrace you immediately become a good person
and this was the the cancer of the wrecks to listen was i think best summed up by the guy who is like imagine your rex stoner said you were running one of the greatest companies in the world a statesman a businessman respected now fired while taking a shit
a good it's like that's good you will you only spent the majority of your life beating back climate change research bribing corrupt officials being part of the military industrial complex and pipeline occupation complex
ruining the environment making hundreds of millions of dollars
overseeing people from the global south dying on your rig
and
heavy having have deflated clown
punching bowling pin type thing for a knack
that was sam stein right yeah yeah who also had a great one to that was
it's not acceptable to make fun of dawn juniors divorce
that's safe side
that guy is ted way i for i don't even care if i get ratio
i'm using bullshit and crises
seconds and of course we have to have decorum and rules about what's acceptable to talk about at who is acceptable the time i'm sorry but i'm talking about it because he cheated on her with a chick from danny kaye which i was
i mean you've told me before that's your favorite group as their own rail for you as a surprise surprise breaking news here man had to explain to me to the fuck aubrey o'day and cane or i know that you guys don't remember making the band i never watch regular with a little reality show these little pockets of your pop culture knowledge and surprising when we come across as
just some things that good seared nearby there was a show where puff daddy was the host and he recruited a bunch of people together to make a girl bab and what it was a boy bad but once he was a grub
it was basically reality show about turning them into an actual act from just a bunch of people who are edition will lead singer was this woman aubrey o'day who then was part of the bad that the show created called danny became and i believe now she is the solo artist its as a solo artist that she had a song on her album from twenty
fourteen was titled d j t it was all about how i was a little love with you but you keep me a secret and you hired me why is that i like outages everyone in the trump world is just so bad at code
they were doing pizza gate they would just be like do you have any of those not children on the way they even though even even the gamal is just like average is going to put your initial on a whole body
like dogs
who got that email hey would you like to have some russian people over to talk rationally about scolded rush secrets that goes if it's what i think it is i love it
some of the greatest journalism i've seen in my lifetime
steel which found an instagram post all got that woman's feed them around the time they were said she was sleeping with mary downey jr and it was just a picture of of of a couple of feet and the caption with something like he's keeping my feet safe onions
oh and
this author this this would word or time
cross reference those feed the man's feed with a picture of don juniors fee as out irrefutable on i think the same tootsie the guy who wrote that article probably his entire life he's like
have this crippling foot fetish like the only way i can get off that relationships whole part because sexual problems or it i can't control myself and summer like edges i have to run home to jack off when i see women in a row notes and such a curse why can't just be normal and then he these emerge he does the greatest story of all time
you know using his imperfections as a weapon god bless you sir it's amazing if there's ever a journalism or in chrysalis his name
when a lifetime achievement
now are you telling me that vanessa trump i mean again high turnover in the administration had turned over in the trunk family need somebody to vanessa trump did like a karen from goodfellas the shit again she said that she then there's something about some gas of article that says that she called her with her kids on the line
i told her to get your own goddamn
but as a day is this mistake diddy
yeah man
added
danny kaye mr deity
but
we should we should make fun of it because it's hilarious
and that was that was a line proffered by many that
who is that other idiot noah noah scout and at bear know that man from danger room or wherever the fuck he writes for its dangers oh david the taser southern it okay
he was like there's one thing i just think about the children or like years to really revealing of character it's like you to laugh at some has divorce and it's just like what so that their kids are going to have to live in two incredibly big garish houses
did they won't have the full time attentive parenting of donald trump junior it's a true the dom his son of donald trump won't be there all the tide to show it to show them in for wars video die
so much the prospects of their lives read so much better by the less time hang around ah junior i know i do think the kids are off limits so because in a in a just perfect society they would be taken by the state shorn of their last name and educated by bob of aiken
and they don't have that privilege i think we shouldn't work towards a society where that would happen where we brainwash the children of really educate educated not actually educate for the first time the kids there's brainwashed there's nothing funny about a woman from reality t v and odd fucking be extremely
gummy son
dom president now and may writing a song about it that like thirty people listen to spotify didn't this
there's nothing that you think it's funny the donald trump is going to show up in court wearing his keep calm and jive on sure when they say that he can't he can't take them wolf hunting in alaska and we can use it that's funny
jr is going to cry during the during the chives st patrick's day celebration next year yeah oh the funny thing about don jr is you know you look at the trump kids and you think was a dumb when it's gonna be airfare
what the actual like habsburg
oh no eric's the minimally competent one on the dumb one who is who is very transparently desperate for his father's of black hole in he never gets it and i really think that that interview with charlie kirk came about by a don judy her
just pissed trump off at this college glad she just walked out of game is gave a dirty
da junior think his dad for a retreat
think about that
that's usually the people who do that who are like know
tweet like by donald trump tree to tree twelve fifteen like those are usually just the most lonely
the polio vaccine dread whose families don't with this
his first born disorders like oh
to by real daughter that you that you youtube teenager who something acts jeff tutorials yeah the tutorials has been retreated more but a town
yeah like like a the first the fed squad has been returned
a junior get on the real alpha shit guess what my dad asked me for me for this is a happy story though the nasa if you follow her twitter feed she's live in her best line
they're all these mega guys in the thread though there are like you think you're going to get it man that ever get you think you're going to get a gummy guy you are you ever did
that was really funny i think you're ever going to get a guy who gets stuck at a chinese finger trap with his brother at thanksgiving
i don't think she's i think she's going to live with larry david
a hunch
was one of those weird things i mean one thing we all agree we said before the children are off limits
want to be clear like their third just the children are off limits on to play off your are off limits on just going to name them all right now real quick donald trump the third kind madison trove chloe sophia trump trusted me lo stroke
spencer frederick trump like the idea that interested me los and spencer frederick maybe because of this diverse won't get to shoot the last living african white rhino with their father and then take pictures by its carcasses either
it's sad and if you laugh at that i mean it's like you're revealing that you're a bad person yeah how would you dare wish that upon interest in trouble
yeah trinket isabel and all the other kids like it's tough dude in my parents separated and honestly i'm still dealing with it
so that's knowing that there's a tryst and trump in the world has taken something out of me right now i just met you've often compared donald trump to napoleon the third yeah i was a little there is donald trump the thorough
this bruise yeah actually you don't done jr is on like some private thread on the locked sub form of one of his hunting message boards like it's like the the hunters lounge sub form relationships
a bunch of other guys really like she's a gold digger do just i don't or it's like a are fifteen terry is going to happen to me to sometimes i just go fucking crazy
the pattern or we're seeing here like whether we're talking about tiller or don jr is that like everyone in interest orbit who are all equally evil people if not more so
great thing about trapeze he's the only one that can really fuck over and get under the skin around other monsters asshole like the f b i guy mccabe all ethnic fired him right with his pension
my own
and the people who were like worried about hit like every up the guy who gets fired is going to do with all f b i guys do which is write a book called like courage and dignity and my struggle vs muslims in special education classes get like seven figure book deal but
yeah they were doing go find me
that the other like does it going north carolina g o p officer in there are like this brave patriot we have to make sure it gets the
the cave was just let him have left going to seal around the world right after this congressional hearing and now what happened is that in addition to whatever ago fund means going on
oh wisconsin democrat hired him to his security staff for his office for a week so that he would be qualified for his ball with all manner of just any type of teenager holding an unidentified box is within one
and he mccabe is going to maybe accidentally hit three civilians
the i was not pervert no one's perfect but we just or see us gas and their weeks
but like best of luck have fun with that other guy that's a trump st mccabe right now
yes so as soon as like anyone comes into orbit and then
swat it and spins out of it while the in crashes and burns they all become now she said
ritual where they're being inducted into the brotherhood of decent society again and that their sympathetic the other isn't even done one of the most revolting people alive yeah like he's always going through a divorce so we can't it's not funny to laugh at i think i think it's an article of faith that people are made are rendered
sympathetic by following like that because the alternative is that there is no redemption
like there's no hope of recapitulate in society
like the fractures that we have can never be mended if we can't forgive well he reminds me of this reminds me of like the sort of robert e lee rehabilitation and shit the things people do with rommel about you know actually didn't like hitler
great general are like
it's this weird thing where i know it wasn't he sucked yeah that's why he said that's why he was in north africa yeah it's like oh this guy's the greatest baseball player of all time he plays for a double a farm team but it's is i think there is this very good human impulse to want to redeem people and that acknowledges many things are horrible and degrading and pain
we acknowledge of war is the worst thing that can happen but because we're so hierarchical and or mindset we don't go well maybe like for the average soldier it was awful
nazi germany is terrible like with the more is awful and like we we did our own war crimes and dresden in like we should avoid ever having a war but because we're so deeply hierarchical were like actually the head guy was pretty cool
it's the same thing here where it's like you can have is very really impulse words like
modern life is very painful people are barely very alienated everyone is watching all the time everyone sees your your you fall it sucks
deeply admires time but instead of looking at that for like the average person it's just like well not like the head guys there's still people the guy above me he's still still guy because we also this boot liquor thing cooked and i mean the fall of one of course is only part of the story fall of one
rise of another so for instance tillotson out of the state department in make pumping out here my pump hail coming over from the cia if my pump hail
a religious fanatic
lunatic i get another guy who believes that like we're at war with islam yeah like not not countries that are at war with islam the religion good luck with that thing a billion plus adherence for what it wasn't of their greatest that from my compare it doesn't really he's all those guys though is screeches and squats about
about a are you are you condemning this moderate islam whatever there's a tenner
sort of like global sophisticated version of what about black on black crime yeah yeah he's at the state department a john paulson is the national security
oh god or jesus christ and then when he's out at the cia
who will now add she will have to face a confirmation guess is what's your name gina haskell gina haskell
and again sinner haskell sorry for your has seen a hassle
similar to the dungeon your thing or the sympathy that's engender for these rotten people when they flame mountain spectacular ways because of their own hubris and let's be honest voluntary involvement with donald trump an industry it's not even like they quit out of honor literally wanted to serve until donald trump is like sorry you lose goodbye so similar
gina
there are certain a lot of people in thailand but now she is being now held up as the country and you know hey this is the first ever woman cia director yeah
like the line was sort of surprising
the certain quarters he talk about breaking glass ceilings are suspiciously silent now yeah and it's like this person literally was running the cia torture site in thailand where they were like drowning people and doing christ knows what else and again and then of course the
censor that is what it was legal at the time and was she was ordered to do it now they are trotting out there she was following or alison events and they're like you know she did her job with the he served competently and the best thing she good and it's just like
if you did that and continue on in this career like you have no fucking soul knowledge as a husk of a person with like he's been scooped out completely and just hollowed out by yeah bye bye
he redeemable war crimes yeah i will give credit with virgin asshole thing like a lot of cores that we expected to be like well you know while it's the first woman like the lives they were like now
when some women are evil
i'll read this the people were doing that were more like the nuts at boot liquor types will justify anyone doing torture but it is interesting like people who it's the same thing that happened under bush you know when a republican is in there are things like torture things like the murder of civilians or surveillance it suddenly become
it stops being a pragmatic necessity and a you stop congratulating the breaking glass ceilings they do see that it's right and wrong they just happened to excuse it when it's a democrat in there obviously with trumpets worse you know they're killing more civilians
there's probably more or going on but
i think a lot of the reason that was just specific to obama and the decisions that he made when he came into office because bush
supercharged the national security state to a level that we had never ever seen before and obama faced a critical decision am i going to continue with this or am i going to take active measures to draw down and restore some state of normalcy that perhaps would resemble the clinton years when the military budget was actually
falling and he made his choice and the people who were never with him fell in line behind it in the hassle thing also reminded me like the perfect day
representation of this mindset
that nicholas kristof tweet where he references the fact that like the cia agents who worked at this black say they had to water board someone like seventy times in a row were like crying and they were all my guys like you know what he you say that's not a sign of weakness said it's nine hundred and yeah and it just like how they felt bad about what they were doing so a huge years
if they were laughing and being gleeful say this that would that would that would be disturbing but the fact that they're like
do this
well they basically have an idea that yes there should be a taboo against torture and things like that but you also have
philosophical do to our fellow man to if there is a dangerous enough situation and there's something we're the only way to get information about it as torture if we have to be able to choose to do wrong in the greater service of preventing a terror attack so it should be issued feel like us transgression and feeling like it
transgression that means it's being regulated basically by your conscience and it will be brought back in the line if you don't care if you just step out of that line without any kind of concern than you'll just do it over and over again it is the fact that they feel bad about it that's going to keep them and resistant from doing it again unless they really really have to either simpler explanation they were crying
they're week
weak people and cowards crying is toxic masculinity i'm just going to say right now last time i cry about a abuse data
other guy
so yeah i got gina and at the
wonderful institution my palm pay oh the car dealership owner who wears pull over wind breaker and aviators at all time calls waitresses read and smoke show
look like one of those guys look like a suburban like hands the sex
yeah i think i have faced the hand faced
suburban middle class has really taken over the white house
the whole executive so that's that's that's fine policy
you know everything overseas yeah more closer closer to home we've got my main man c n b c's money fucking monster hundred k a week snow fucking
yeah
calvin paid in full larry kudlow few pieces to wait
wasn't economic advisor they're presented his hand of the national national economic council the head economic is why the so in one of the economic equivalent of the at us so is it is advise her in one ear as he said his bolton like attack iran and north korea together will everyone else also be distracted and will be too
total commitment death
all commitment or the other aerial you've got kudlow who is literally thinks the only thing that can help the economy you just cutting taxes
it believes all recessions are caused by not cutting taxes
and breaker
right up until the day the stock market crash out in two thousand and eight it was like never mortgages
folks yeah yeah
among the most adult lunatics like a total fanatic
man who lives in cloud cuckoo land i can't we a total supply side hardest media i can't wait till kudlow puts the white house as a escrow for a credit default swap
just like the president she wins it
my my main man is going to take over this year because larry kudlow like all coke addict sort of gambles it away
kudlow he's good at brigham much you'd like cocaine guy energy to the whole where he's going to just be walking around sniffing talking about how he's going to start a restaurant this year
donald trump's like i just had a great meeting with my economic advisor he said i'm a beautiful person whom he loves and that we could really actually start a record label we're going to start importing denim from japan he has all these wonderful ideas he for some reason pulled bear an aside and told him he's the smartest person who knows
it was great
to for hours talking about the economy and all the movies you've seen recently
it's going to be one of those big stupid meetings a trump as if the cameras there but it's going to be kudlow wearing an open bathrobe playing jesse's girl for everybody
what troubles like no he's right let's do lyrics i thought
he's right about these albums you to want to listen to this is the order they tell you that you can sit up
i like about kudlow is because of his truly heroic cocaine habit he does have that sort of like preserve that kind of yeah yeah that sheen kind of the are no moisture know it is there at all it's just like a his lips any more he's a lap yeah it's a good look i told totally
he is actually i think going to shake things up more than anything because up until now the truman administration
didn't have that that edge will also don't like drinkers you know or t totally was even worse a downers ministry like it's all people who take three be because they think will get give them better sleep and drink like for michelob ultra it's because they're being healthy now and then just like di maria barter romo i want to marry
are you with you so perfect
literally fell asleep on my father was my elbow darling a normal so pleased to meet you good supercharged this with of fucking uppers yes norton
massive rows of go it's like a fucking first baseline worth of yet larry larry
larry kudlow is going to be taking adidas least size rails and he's just get it
the last thirty minutes of good fellow for the rest of the administration the only upper other day
like like larry kudlow mr hutton love that helicopter is marine one of course it is following
we needed those executive orders thought
nothing except that the only the only other uppers user in the administration has probably whole picks picks is probably like every other ambitious yards
like an adder all probably really boring
up your place not like what larry kudlow is into into the real shitty i hope he does it so that you can stay up on like cleaning your house or just entering numbers in a spreadsheet or something away
jesse spanner did yeah
saved by the
coco you need the god like euphoria to go along with the manic energy that that is alec baldwin and malice shit
i can't wait till the next two years of the drug administration they're going to be like it's going to be the boost with james
james woods can actually be there for this one will not only that there is a good chance if he keeps treating james with will end up in the trunk administration oh yeah facet yeah because like now it's like he there's some other there's some other fox news host these bring into department of veterans affairs it's just people he sees on t v that he wants to around killing israel people who he sees on t v
that he likes and who say good things about him and not only that this is funny feeling this
alan fucking dershowitz has been on fox news every night for the fly high know
i didn't break and it's legal illegal illegal children
oh no this is all around
he just his name was on those fight like that's all along with donald trump more
no clue and
guys be a dude so dershowitz has been on fox news like auditioning for the role of like white house legal counsel like the john dean roll by saying that like i just quit
dershowitz has been on tv saying like you know trump has every reason to fryer more any be totally justified in doing it and might i know i'll defend him the mad for it just like i did for oj costs von bulow got down or whatever his name was he just the resigned as had council for the rush this investigation because he can't dishonor hymns is often
i know he's at the way out bring the dish and i love it there
you get off the bench i love oh yeah dershowitz is he was respected his lawyer for a bit now lunches know it was a good lawyer yes
not as
officer of the court thank you
but he now you just like for the past few years he goes and fox news and he's like it's interesting that people accused of racism when actually if you think about it that way moeller is being racist against president
like now the man is now in the position the only person in the world who could make ready player one reality he could just take people off of television and bring them into his room he is literally surrounded himself with other figures of pop culture he likes the master he's laying message from yeah
know box
l that goes in i urge cabinet meeting guys and engineering seventy two this year big big year for me yeah
if that's that's the celery
they're all there's new there are some new faces in class some transfer students but there is a few people that it was just started lake
been been children been doing doing nothing wrong of under the radar no drama nicky nicky haley's the one
the no drama had a slight snag this my personal favorite ben carson who housing and urban development and he's just been sort of like laying low and just hopping of occasionally dismantling the entire just
yeah exactly this basically an apartment he overseas and just servicing occasionally a say things like we don't want public housing to be tonight that we don't want people to like living there
they should be a spy
yeah of the ground everyone's mad enough to kill you
cause pain in the puddle
just enough for you okay
those those are the most hard working reporters people who get the actual quotes about how it out of curse and because they're really thirty one hours of tapes surrounding that were always like a jazz boats percent seven hundred talents of gold mines but you know
always have my doubts and that was probably a hundred six
very difficult to operate a conveyor belt in this time but they had the technology
he popped up this week because a thirty one thousand dollar table whoops that was purchased on on uncle sam's i know a lot of people criticized me with the table but thirty one thousand that's actually the number of for skins day
the stands and if you think it's too much
disagreeing with scripture not
humans
i think
everyone can have a dining table we all have been a big dinner party will all your friends with everyone you never know who died they they can come up and ask you a question and we can take some jewish traditions or we had the and they can find it give them a hundred dollars and that's when it's thirty one thousand dollars and thank you
but what what i do like about carson's i have a good over good singer here
a sixteen thousand dollar dinner table who made it judy chicago
oh
yeah
amazon gift card
a day goes them virgil this
added amazon gift cards
that's really funny
they want you to chicago everybody to for a delightful treat after this episode gets bad at the show
oh that's that's a joke
so are here for
vertical everybody clean comedy consultant
will the punch lines of the ben carson story is that he blamed his wife up
you said shopping as she wet book people of this observation he use the the women be shopping
congressional testimony
there's that but again
who who cares about the table let them let them by the nice table who gives a shit i mean it seems like seems like the real the climax that we're all i know higher mall or hoping for dearly for is him finally just firing robert
all that will be the apotheosis of twitter and the internet we've talked about it before but like at this point why wouldn't he
okay
that asshole jeff fuck yeah i was like on twitter and he was he was like i beg you sir like do not do not fire rubber and create a constitutional crisis like the congress will use remedy known as impeachment rover know they won't serve a gigantic a he he should know he must know by now
pelicans in congress are not going to allow him to be impeach know they're not going to have any that's a used car dealer in their district will beat them in a primary by saying he voted to open the way that big sweaty boy a at the actual nazi he just republican and the illinois
what yup when the entire rest of the country is like this can't get any lower illinois is like on a bat
jay pritzker purse wrong or who almost lost you pants lipinski
liver and you're your at your are your elections in politics want do you think do you think that he would be impeached by the republicans in if he fired me loud yeah
i mean it's safe to say because flake was the only one to come up and make it very explicit like way if he does this yeah i will vote to impeach it right
it's up for reelection right and the real question is paid your bill obvious answer originate in the house and requires two thirds for that are such just a simple majority i think i think it's a simple majority two thirds of a sudden i mean india in what universe does if if paul ryan is a speaker of the house does he allow that to happen
what university do enough fable republicans
allow a discharge motion
this happened before they actually actually patient most i think is a privilege motion so i think the democrats could just you know
their own impeachment which they did earlier this year and they got like eighty democratic votes on that something like that so you would need the entire democratic is plus what forty republicans i don't see that adding are happening it's possible but i don't see that
one thing i think one of two things one is the actually do go through impeachment
and they joined the have you no shame at long last her crowd or we get the final break from of between republicans and the dc consensus beltway reality op ed page bullshit that never actually fucking matters that has absolutely no impact on
people's lives and no reflection of what the majority well in this country think yeah and is that break happens that her hobbies are like we don't need you you've always hated us fuck you fuck everyone who believes we are principles it doesn't fucking matter we have a massive base of of wanting swine always vote there was no our wider
we have we are doing the bidding of the ruling class are way better than the democratic way bigger bang for your both were always going to have so much money to run elections so we don't give a shit
absolute lately i forgot
cannot something but i forgot the other addition he brought in tv fox news letter guy joseph degenerate who's another boat detail like fisher
and other hand
now mr president when you got that pig
to the friendship but the other shit you can pound that shit all day
surrounding himself with the best oh yeah but come on
the other thing is if he fires mueller i think it would actually
move the numbers a little bit in the night of the overly critical i don't think they could do it i don't think you would be decisive is i think it's already been decided but i think it would be recognized that the voters are now
connected to trump more than the republican party here but that's only like thirty thirty four percent of the people who are black people as the people who win primaries period for republican yeah i'm sorry i'm talking about the general election but i would say that what's going to discipline them is the knowledge that they have to get nominated first before they get real
oh sure right
going to kowtow to that feeling oh i'm thinking if there's any practical consequences it's not impeachment it's the democrats winning an even larger majority yeah this election it's true
how many people really are going to change their vote based on a mall or firing don't know i mean i only assume you just in energy fact they're like just come together to how is how he the intensity of likely you to say had a republic i mean already like why something on the level of ten percent or so of
voters are moving over to the democratic column but i don't you know because of mahler shit that's not families and bullshit i didn't follow through on his promises i'm saying that's already happened and that
these aren't the these are the old just take whatever these are the more lightweight suburbia
the tax abortion thai people who just had a reversion to hillary clinton and did not particularly like trump her fall for all the nonsense
i'm wondering if that number becomes twenty percent if mueller as a beach or meal is removed while i think we're going to find out either way
because he's going to have his horseradish stirred up by these guys in his ear kudlow else
fucking gag to the brains of like a
you guys got white chalk hand prints all over his face the speaking in a dead language i mean how does that make it a driving over the edge next week
you know i've done a lot of growing in this administration and i've made up with the noise
with the it is the new hugs
i've i've actually been given a list of names and the dan quinn universe i'm hiring all the jets the water
it was
oh yeah
when we realize bolt was coming in today we just started reading this defunct twitter account by think is a railroad name's it's all the names in the dan quinn universe dan quinn all these are real people by the way i even talks about the quinn in a while so could give a brief a reminder for me bollywood owed very simple dan quinn is a
mid forty's former notre dame college football player who says he was set up and expelled because he made the play the most legendary play in college history
college football history by lou holtz calls lucifer lou the says looks like hitler and conspired to ruin his life and then after years of doing math and fighting amateur boxing matches he discovered that when you take the natural sure and replacement steve yeah and blended in water removes the toxic pollutants soap cancer it can also be used as a cocaine substitute furthermore
if he smokes blunts dusted with stevie a he is both impossible to knock out and has blazing fast hands speed dan quinn asserts that he is a black boy trapped in in his words
he is in tone to for lou holtz lou holtz have you ever seen a white boy advance like this
claims that one time he was just running around a track at a high school and several school children cheer them on in an old man new trucks idea he was the fastest thing he had ever seen he also claims to have invented a pussy
the violin where he can give women triple digit orgasms sometimes because little to be hospitalized it doesn't know i furthermore he has interior said that he would like to be reincarnated as muhammad ali as an honor to them
he's already dead
well this is oh okay
the thing about dan quinn is he makes his videos towards a lot of people who makes them towards like joe rogan or dana white but the supporting characters and dan quinn universe they are very strange names and lives and you think this guy being nuts it's like no one could be named up but he look it up their real guys it just he bends reality to cry
a world of stupid name's it's around and i wonder why we're so obsessed with the sky
yeah these are the same power that we have these are all these are all the supporting characters from the quinn vs
yeah clean universe on the amateur
which has waited since two thousand and fifteen i think you just go mad studying these ancient but rick
sheik
dr craig to sure
billy
sheds the wallet
your calorie version
scott toggle
grumpy grumpy of the northern jordanians
keep in mind that like as felix said these videos are often address to these people who have all in the trade him in somewhere
he made it there is a biker that he was taken in by who good ago i was called crazy job but then they obviously had a falling out and then beta video called crazy jones folly
i kind of an artist right like that's kind of art
if i wrote a novel that was
my for our friend frenzy jay said today
if donald trump reaction to job biden a beat him up is to say crazy jones fall
okay continuing gym or trans
matt josh
christian print up
rip up my cards and his brother keith
dave ernie
tara chow which is actually not a real person there was so incantation dan
jumbo galloway
rick virgo not a great one ronnie lott and mike stone breaker
so for a closed fonzie oh that's a real guy yeah as a defensive coordinator for the vikings have the ninety ross the clifton colony the most beautiful fucking dog in the world
don bunch
dave hobo

sexy hot three sixty nine data five thousand and nancy stake hymns bond look through a tube spawn i'm not
ross perot now murray the liberal blip it got lou holtz red river team by be diego sanchez paul harry go paul rick cheek
wow
for any of you still listening
and i was that was the full dan quinn universe you there are more yeah you mention in the middle of the joke about sieges joke about crazy joe's following that isn't anything today where joe biden said that if he had been in a locker room as a young man and heard another young man in the locker room talking about
i'm in the way down
does he would have had some problems he would have checked him physically uranus caught those hands if joe biden said you know if did donald trump if you went away without doing a check in with me you have to move very careful very carefully indeed
and then trump did the epic clock back or he literally said if joe biden for me now i would lay his ass out like a you've been a fucking nightmare oh my god of her heard it would just get worse and worse for you oh my god
message board five
look like a hundred years old
really the most pathetic thing the warlord people have said donald you have basically black and okay i have always said i'm a black trapped in white skin okay if i could smoke my plants that are laced with steve year i would perform a legal kill on
that's not doing that
perform a legal kill on this other dan quinn is obsessed with the concept of illegal kill and a gauge like if you kill somebody in a fight it's legal and if it's on indian soil
came up with this idea he was like i got an idea for diego sanchez and bad boy which is and emma may apparel company to make a lot of money how about a cool jacket to only fighters can wear
now too expensive but one hundred dollars and if you square up it makes the shape of the bad boy logo so people know that if you're wearing it there's going off the fighter so the judge that you kill the guy is though you were wearing the jacket
yeah i'll by idea that is a trump idea
because like a special murder jacket but
now these are both ancient men donald trump is probably never even like shelled my what it will be like a rake falling i a bag
it's just they have not just one of them as a pony old bag and the other one is this suit sack else yeah he's like hey joe biden he's like i was an athlete i was a star you know division three baseball player black back before they didn't let like anyone but sort of scrawny irish guys pay to play baseball
lol knock you out
joe biden are doing the equivalent of doing serious as eating anything other than potatoes that's not true job by then he went twelve rounds against the notre dame logo
against the i think i be
the bengals the other foot the other really funny thing about the joe biden calling out term for is toxic masculinity is like he did it right after he gave a woman a massage and and yeah you know because like joe biden was a hands
albright went and either press conference and only if you're going to touch a woman let's keep it above the bell joe biden one into that press conference looked at every woman or ordinance like where's my how get any way down to about fucking knocking loud dude well the thing
where's my hunger bug
asked to do that he has because he has decided he's running
and he said that his tactics going to be he's going to be the sensible centrists alternative to this crazy sanders ask left islam is going to be the one who doesn't blame the rich and it's good to the middle class because he thinks that people were grateful i think israel has he doesn't think he's credible on the left which she isn't and i guess he recognizes that but so since he can't offer any robust criticism of the status
well they get excite voters he has to get people who hate trump riled some other way and all that's left is empty bluster and threats of violence just to look like you really hate him even though you don't really have an agenda virgil what was the tweet
one guy oh oh my god okay
this is doctor eugene to empty joe biden saying he would take trump behind the gym and beat the hell out of him is completely inappropriate and encourages violence among males
i just love the ideas of kids play just the choking each other out because they got riot by these grandpa the job by rumble jill parted so fucking cool down are like him
i think that doctor goo a surgeon scientists hoping to cure heart and kidney diseases and babies would know a thing or two about masculine aggression
it was the joke
original air it's like who can forget the uptick in violence after grumpy old men came back
really good and the man that would suck if like you were going in for like an appointment
a heart problem and you're like going to look at my doctor
i thought was
that's the first time goes by the satellite is blocked by real donald trump which is it's an indication of how the internet poisons your rain it's a self inflicted mental oh yeah don't don't be like this guy be like this guy could have cured a heart and kidney diseases and babies by now instead he just post crap like that all day
yep be like i don't even attempt to cure a child
her heart know i could if i wanted to not gonna do
yeah what do you think we'd be doing if we didn't have a line brain poison oak i know so that i would have come up with a cool jacket ideas so we've we've oh no no no i'm curious about this i like to think i would be an archivist oh you work at the internet way back machine the older wouldn't be an internet where he backlog there's no internet
i would be the book away back fishing i think i would have been like a special type of green beret
i believe on the weekends to star in pornographic movies with the sand
what about you man
if you didn't have internet brain poisoning oh god what would your life be
i would obviously be ignatius riley yeah you would be buried and tomes and trying to write my own sort of my own grand thesis
in a basement somewhere as the thing that making of hotdog water that book is so dated because that guy today would have a ten thousand dollar month patchy on a youtube channel or a blogs wearing a clown mask about that
dr psycho
that's what i'm saying is that i would have the same compulsions but i will have a more of worth had a stuffy and awkward way to express of through book rather than me
my brain on the internet oh i'd also be really into miniatures you will get more one saw guy who on call violence all could move i think i would have probably been like a lawyer in finance
not be but now it's really sad
your honor i want to fuck
oh no that's i respond to minor inconveniences that way because of the internet i think i was pretty lake level headed nice child before the internet
my mom can knock on the show and sammy i gotta say if i definitely would have read more than five books in the last two years as for sure
i yeah but yeah but you know who moved my cheese and twelve rules for
those are two important book oh i also would have invented the board game ticket to ride
it's a truism
board games as well as german board games
oh all man you already have something as exciting as board games but it's made by germans to and
oh well what about you
this is called real actuary calm but it's funny because they are like
i mean you know what what
i would have been a successful will get other
so that's a vision of things it could have been and up until now we've been discussing a a rather dark vision politics
i mean we're keeping it real with you folks we're not going to sure
six
however i do you want to talk about a different vision a different vision of politics and if only we could allow our hearts the dream of perhaps these problems wouldn't seem so bad perhaps you could roll our sleeves up and fix the problems bigger problem solvers in this country album solvers caucus activate i'm talking of course about east coast was swamped with
a snowstorm and today
when you know it republican jeff
democrat cory booker spent the afternoon snowballing each other
and i don't mind getting and others malice while they were figuratively

yeah that snowball snowball fight the final i really remember i am my joke in there about them spitting comedy jam
a monster rehab is it for guys in rehab i think so monster he has is called monster yeah because of a special mix of hydration and a localized scenic index sea monster he had only has ten calories per can and means that it has less sugar than a regular monster which can have up to fifty four there's like five hundred chemicals
it also has chemicals the air you breathe
