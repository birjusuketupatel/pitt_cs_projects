okay
british military below you can be crushing military it reads like the marine corps ads with the guy climbing the mountain and killing the dragon or time and album
that they weren't for a serious serious boys it's like the difference between a guy who's pretty good at games on the weekend and a pro gamer everyone in the pressure military was fatally
shitty navy though
we're we're actually waiting for a phone call yeah we have already been for phone calls and moment but while we're waiting on can someone explain to me the latest james o'keeffe news that i saw breaking
god is still a favorite oh
such a sun kissed dollars i've got more offense syndrome and a desire for the truth
themes o'keeffe the conservative provocative your and video artists of project
a fool i guess you'd call yeah just untouched just bungled the world crates nothing with failure and disaster and is totally untouched while though i mean isn't that planned parenthood video he did government taxes and he got a he had a coroner yeah that's it but to be protected
further rebounds to our awfulness that we allowed this absolutely confident dip shit
any success so what does he either know well so james o'keeffe hired some middle age woman from georgia to pretend to be a victim of roy more and in an attempt to deceive the washington post some some fashion so they went with the author of the original roy
more a watching post what was her me stephanie the reporters fanatic from it
look you've sent this woman to pretend to be a victim of really more and the woman brought a
a purse to this interview with the post reporter with which very obviously had a camera in it
had had
there's not act like that where are hat
so the post figured this out pretty quickly by google the woman's name she use her real name and she had made a goal fund to me to send her because she got a job in new york media as a journalist
to take down the liberal elites are what oh my god
that's upset that's upset for days so the post decided to do their own little little gotcha so they brought their own hidden camera people
food quarter cafe or when or where they met and were most interesting details i found was that was the post reporter puts her purse down in front of the other woman's purse and the woman has some move the purse very obvious
it was like how high when dave chappelle is trying to get them to say the code word as a half baked
oh how high his or her method that read bad smell out of every
good good
a nickel in the movie job at the shit out damn it
so the post reporter comes in with all these receipts like a print out the go fun me and says you know you did you get that job and she's no no i didn't get that i interviewed for it
by i didn't get it and the reporter says oh okay what would you in are you for he says
daily caller and she says okay well who
who interviewed you
i swear to god she just goes
rachel
dolls all johnson
the next paragraph of the posts article just as yeah we contacted the energy for the daily call their nobody know there is no one by ever interview

sebastian gorka always a pleasure enjoy to talk to doctor sebastian gorka esquire so moving on back to the shows regularly scheduled events there there's another another bit of an entity that i wanted to highlight from this week in the form of another epic
sweet thread courtesy of one of the more obnoxious pratt's twenty first centuries
one true genre near the with i was thinking about this guy in the whole it also it has been a guy his name is benjamin wits and he is a senior fellow at the brookings institute and mean if you didn't know if you need me to explain further why that explains everything you need to know about this guy well there's one other thing and that is yet
sweet a few weeks ago or maybe i'm on three said the washington post editorial page is the closest thing i have to a political party the moon's own said something
the key
a announcement reminding people to wash their hands after they poop is the closest thing i have to my political and he replied by he replied to himself preemptively to say i can already hear people getting ready to bring up the iraq war the lady i'm bringing that up crazy petty as what it is so silly announcement saying if you see something say something close
i have to military service
this is like is an i
this rant of course was got a positive of nod from the gotta pause the by a bill kristol who said for what on earth by that he said for what it's worth i'm with you to everyone read the thread and and benjamin replied to this guy with it's worth a lot though
if that doesn't somewhat why i am so viscerally repulsed by the resistance movement in one where a cc scum funny
the ease and glean with which they have embrace a figure like bill kristol unemployment so i'm sorry i like about those pods save america though is going to do we just had a big thing the other week with their like it's like we're teaming up to fight the alien invasion on her invading somewhere else
yeah your i love about this is like someone like weird like the dude
who are there like i can't believe we're keeping up with you build crystal and it's like no you go you basically liberals and neo cons
always kind of team it's never been any liberal dogs yeah you guys have always like you just slightly disagreed over country you should and it's all like it comes down to make marginal tax rate and school choice maybe or something like that but they all think they're and lord of the rings and they're like dough
doff my calf
but have a lower hands or get together to a rubber hands over another fucking middle eastern bloodbath were cooking up between ourselves yeah
i can't believe that liberals and liberals who sometimes care about the deficit are getting
anything time i was going to read a bit from benjamin wits
when he calls a statement of principles for the hash tag coalition of all democratic forces remarry
a political manifesto and eighteen tweets he writes here and he begins with hash tag i believe i will really
a gross in cynical and mawkish way of trying to lake tie this to the me to moment
that's how i read that i believe it's certainly branding and three days
i reading this to eat storm i kind of wish it ended for me the same way that ted kaczynski manifesto did it's also it's a great song yeah i said union of souls know it's an r kelly reference nano i believe the phone
the
it's also the song from the lost boys i still believe that the the guy with a saxophone oh yes and zones facts man with the chain like i was actually benjamin with
what does he really believes that any issue that americans do not need to be actively contesting right now across traditional less weight divisions americans need to be not actively contesting right now across traditional that right divisions and a horribly written sense that gibberish when you're also or i'll answer
yeah i know says here or what do you eat out or you die or not from the diabetes that new tax bill that wants to convert poor people into can bust of will fuel don't think about it right he says we have grave disagreements about social issues about important foreign policy questions about tackling don't know each day went wow what are his disagreements
bill kristol in foreign policy now he already thinks it's out of bounds bring up the washington post support of probably the greatest foreign policy disaster in american history
that's out about of the grid it comes down to it comes out to does al qaeda get do they get the ground a ground missiles or the ground to air missiles that's the extent of their disagreement right him he says
he goes on the about what kind of judges he goes i believe hash tag i believe in putting them all aside have shack i believe in a temporary
i believe in a temporary truce on all sucks all such questions an agreement to maintain the status quo and major area is a fantasy
you know the i don't know what we were doing before we got to pay for that is fucking status quo pham says an agreement to maintain the status quo and major areas of policy dispute all americans of good faith collectively and together none of those americans of good faith collectively advance
together to face a national emergency i have i believe that facing the national emergency requires unity i remember it another time where people set aside their differences to accomplish a great goal and you know it was after nine eleven
nothing bad happened nothing bad happened from fucking talks like this
i remember when adam sandler
i was a hash tag i believe that reasonable americans across the political spectrum she's unite around a political program based on protection of american democracy and democratic institutions that means among other things and activity offensive the first amendment mentions of free speech press religion
i also means a focus on ethics and government and long term battle against the corruption prone opacity surrounding the president's personal finances and business interests leo
i am afraid to use the word
so it goes on like this
you get the point like it summed up there and that the first few things were what he's proposing is a truce so that we maintaining the status quo choose between liberal and conservative yeah what's really a truce between liberals and six guys in dc the only family of the crisis and
horowitz that's another neo cons who hate donald that's it that's a handful of people yeah oh also the idea of like the dow extremely powerful democratic party on all through
he always wanted to the super absolutely well then he had this is the hilarious part of this is that he's calling for a truce at a time when the democrats control three statehouses in america and not a single branch of the heralds have a six steel eight now and i went up a double digit
twelve
although stuff to stave off a constitutional convention what i what i like about this okay remember when tromp like sort of barely cobbled together a few words that equated to iran is bad when he went to the united nation
every fucking scumbag
at all to and elliot
brahms to all every one of these pieces of shit code they were like well i've had my doubts about mr trump but the fact that he could not talk about candice bergen and just told us closer to a war with iran shows me that he may be maturity
like yeah they're going to go back to it is roy more and shit like that but within six months there no
the iranians like shoot at one of our boats that's not crashing in their water they all seem to be doing now or whatever they'll be right back at it will be right back at trying to sanitize certain members of the trump administration because all they care about our their imperial goals and this fucking quads tweed storm will just
athletes don't it will just linger in the wind lake
the vapor from a depleted uranium shell one benjamin witless one some fruit with the people who are the malignancy it's not the administration needs the institution of the republican party and and it's the republicans in congress or the early ones we have no desire to do trends yeah
early evil is cod sadly constantly it's not this imbecile in the white house who obviously would violate every single democratic norm
had a brain that wasn't fucking sponge cake if it wasn't a wandering around the halls of a white house
pokey
yeah it's this
dumb ass child who got on twitter today and was
let's have a key the cod style
fox would win only
he really accomplishes our existing republican policies like i think the problem is the donald trump wants to have a tv contest
it it will be more actually actively doing evil things at the trump administration guess what it's not true because he's not smart enough to do it it's lifetime republicans it's people who are in good standing in the public can even harder to people who are held up as a responsible ones i would maintain our the most evil
like like how a monster matters yeah
felicia minute everyone solution because these fucking hot looks cool
foreclosure fucking but it's like you want to tell you about who has the most bodies on them when they got in there it's work in madison kelly the people that everyone respects and kelly that fucking piece of shit i loved it when he got up there and was like all the cord families that lost old global on the military
can't believe he's doing that it's like he's almost acting like he ran get mon tip of the spear in iraq and that his son died in one of his stupid fucking was a good to watch president what brains hands and make him appear legitimate so he can believe that his son didn't die for nothing which he did sorry
my point about about benjamin been better been with senior fellow at the brookings institute is i think in this this mentality and in that little thread there we keep poses setting aside our disagreements on important political issues to maintain the status quo until trump is out of office to me
so like everything that is endemic in the disease of contemporary liberalism which is like oh he's just position themselves is like five to ten degrees left of wherever the center is but the center keeps being move so dramatically to the rain that like the idea at maintaining the status quo is like
the dream or political goal of liberalism just shows are like the brookings institute shows how utterly now just impoverished their imagination is but just how evil they are in general they think that that would be like a worthwhile goal is maintaining the status quo just until we can get trump out of off well but that's because their vision of of
is absolutely one that erases the the factor of voters an actual mobilization of politics as people with political views they see it entirely as a as a capital fucking game between professionals and this is all about the professionals coming together
putting their differences aside forgetting the fact that if you do that you basically demobilization entire voting block and make yourself basically open yourself for being just annihilated by people who are willing to still mobilize voters on their behalf it's also say that it let's turn back the clock to two years ago when everybody was doing great
totally agree
how the fuck do you think we got here do you think just over night or people who are races
i wasn't racist still us on the apprentice
tell me it was okay but now that that is a thing they did think of it is a game professionals and that's why they like that
mark halperin style rating of like oh well he's he's just a kill killer and substances policy walk and she's just when hillary gets out there and she gets going to religion they sports because is a have never had any physical courage they may be played like some boarding school sport or you like through
if sock into a hamper and it's sponsored by like slave trading company but they have to talk about noon that way because it adds they have to believe that their lives are like sexy and there's a level of skill and it's not just like an accident of birth
turning people out it's not a numbers game which is what it fucking as it's not this delicate dance of strategy it's right route binary numbers with the wish of contemporary liberalism is that we could forget trump like the wish of contemporary liberalism is that we can just put aside all of these disagreements and like an episode
they really view themselves as being outside of ideology seem like they view that their position is essentially the correct objective one that is untainted by the grocer vulgar things like passionate hobby a little of populism the races ignorant probably was also the selfishness and
nationality of of socialism because they think that socialists are comes from the same sort of pit of selfishness as as hostility to other races they think it's all just bass bass emotion and that reason but yeah like the brookings institute is an organism think tank organisation that was four square for the iraq war promoted it
carrot midwife fair entire disaster also libya and every one of these for everything going on
we had originally it's rich this idea that they're going to put aside their foreign policy disagree
have any foreign policy disagreements with the status quo and also a yeah i the idea the idea of them shepherding some sort of like i'd know even status quo moderate fiscal policy it's like you fucking fucking absolute dollar were promoting paul ryan for a six year
ours is like oh i don't agree with him but he's smart about look at this graph it's like anyone anyone who looks you in the eye and says racism is not an american value will gut medicaid and you'll smile
yeah what the the brookings people like their whole critique of iraq war is that we should have said half a million troops and center of like the paltry number that like the rumsfeld defense i love that the democrats won in two thousand and six and they actually were running on let's do the iraq war right yeah let's cover every precious american troop it adam auntie i'm so over there
get hurt
i'm have enough body armor
it's easy to criticize without offering a solution and i want to tell you the listener well you need to do is go down the street to the gay community your tower go up to the fucking local hot tub salesman's house
the door as for his son who spray painted should i or law on a mask
a who is who is disenchanted with trump when he found out that his daughter as a jew and say welcome to the resistance
yeah yeah this is a grand coalition it's a grand coalition between cupid
two groups of people with one thing in common
they were all somebody his nephew
episode
no talent nepotism never you marty
they aren't oh yeah that's what we should fucking call it a bipartisan consensus party that is sort of losing all legitimacy but it's still desperately crime to hold onto the whole fucking political spectrum that's the fucking nephew partner i took an oath when my uncle said that i'd be good for this internship thirty five years ago
yeah because you know you're making these deals the people who are convinced that russian box were the ones who convinced them that a guy who was a commercial with fucking grimace
he was going to make them racist and that's the people who you're so convinced are totally pliable even though these are like deeply held beliefs and have bubbled up to the surface
yeah you're going to fucking beat them by just trying to trying to be reasonable and say that there aren't there are conflicts back to the original point about benjamin with a man who said that the washington post editorial page is the closest thing he has who is politics can you imagine looking at that fucking dog shit
and picking yeah looking at fred high hiring shadow this isn't me welcome to like that is an elite club of yang asshole else was unopposed has some really good reporting and they sometimes every once in a blue moon will run and opinion that is like maybe we know maybe we shouldn't turn yemen into a half pipe
a giant half by the muhammad did som could family glide down in a hollowed out f thirty five but it is mostly the most this collection of scumbags people who sold their soul so they could go to aspen with luck in band are bush it's they sell every
a single war and every existing war the problem is that we haven't ranted up enough every fucking every person who you saw in the movie lord of war those are all the people are touting his reformers it is the most morally bankrupt
like major op
wall street journal it's and shit but mean crazy their create that but they're just openly like a serious conversation about sharia law and the boy scouts and it's legal what watch what you're getting of respect and i respect their gangster because the wall street journal editorial pages like yeah trumps you just fire
yeah a lot of ideas
get a real they keep it real the washington post or bunch of merely mouth fucking just just reptiles area
that they use that milk toast presentation to sell reactionary fucking nightmare foreign policy as the sensible center yeah really as you can't do that with wall wall street journal nobody's buying that as the voice of reason
those that's part of and they saw side by side with sort of like center lab center right goals like we need gun control we had to return to civility and it's like i wonder if there is like an effect on the national psyche in our culture when you know we every week we hear something like oh we accidently killed one hundred and fifty the wrong people mosul are the last
and we did that actually was one thousand oh we have to be any i'm in for some reason we have to the slaves in libya the who knows look it's whatever look it's a game of moral grades we tried our best and where the if we don't do it someone else will that there may be in effect on the culture of civility that we love so much if we're just constantly bombarded by this
the rationale that we need to murder everybody was speaking you maybe a little bit in in these fucking mass shootings that's that's when they really bring the passion back to politics is when one tenth of what they inflict in other countries happens here
and
purchased no connection no connection between an imperialist motorists culture
and what people do here when they break i have to disagree with him i think the wall street journal does reach undecided voters
you know if he wipes hours and eat out a people waiting in lobbies
well this is actually a perfect segue into reading series from this week and i'm going to use this once capacity other than merely mouth piece of shit
we're we're murray is a lateral move from just
abominable institutions of the liberal press that are just got off on every respect movie watching your post editorial page to the new york times every series designed to to hit all felix's anger and pleasure centers home
alcohol normal feelings and already royal navy that's the thing i on good i don't i
it's like i know this is a boy tommy but it's like i kind of you know what i don't have the hate for tommy that i do for like fred higher because tommy legitimately believes that this shit
had a fucking is a golden retriever tom it to for those that you don't know tom friedman got the start his career but got its start because you know anyone who looked at him in the times and like the seventies eighties was like okay this guy's a fucking idiot they sent into lebanon because they just assume no one would care what happened there said that's not a mine big deal
right nothing but that's what i would do you know then the lebanese the war becomes a big story and tom friedman's the lebanon guy even though he just like he chews pennies
there you go and looks can get you everywhere
friedman's of focus
well plus you're going to be hard this article and i it fills me with and it sounds i knock on his own image
yeah and work imam remaining calm what's hear this is thomas friedman
saudi arabia's saudi arabia arab spring at last the crown prince has big plans for his society now before i get into reading this article people drag this bullshit a lot when it came out of but not nearly as much as they did that this sort of stupid profile of that neo nazi guy
get out there are people that one insane over that one which i thought i was not nearly enough noise here
it was a shitty article but the guy was trying to whitewash nazi clearly thought this was still the nineties and people would take white supremacy white supremacist or white nationalist supreme massage bad yeah but he just didn't he wasn't at the time he thought he thought that the kind of a contrast between the guys views and but his banal details of be like schilling sort
aren't thing yeah it was just like we've seen this a million yeah and this isn't fuck it shocking any was there's no point to this exists and he didn't follow he didn't really he kind of turkey like their their word on things didn't really follow like what the logical through line of their policies would be but you know people will forget about it there will be another article about
there will be a think these attacks texting that era will yell about but he really want to talk about an evil article human someone
arab someone little actual power or maybe this spring that sounds that sounds good arab spring got rid of those autocrat know it was already successful that let's dive in feel he gets hominid rate been like i said we they're a business experts their mindset experts thomas friedman is like to call a world expert
yeah what you call more fucking renaissance of thomas friedman mr a worldwide and so he knows you know the facts of the hedgehog right
the hedgehog knows one big thing in the back on there and all this on a entails

you're okay
sears thomas friedman
i never thought i'd live long enough to write this sentence
i hoped you would it
they hope you will
any sentence
this sentence the most significant reform process underway anywhere in the middle east today is in saudi arabia yes you read that right
though i came here at the start of the saudi saudi winter i it's only one hundred and thirteen
i came at the start of saudi winter i found the country going to its own arab spring saudi style
not knowing into writing this is my favorite police academy wrong and either way
saudi style unlike other arab springs all of which emerged bottom up and failed miserably except in tunisia
know had dad bought about that soil out arabs
this one is led from the top down muhammad been and just hitting the back wall
big daddy top
evolution has been topped from the bottom bracket and getting top in the double in the davos forum
tag gender
all this article is him giving tops and man how many of us are like for sure that country's thirty two year old current prince i mean once again
to find out another person younger than i am
five years younger than than crown prince muhammad i think i got some time
older than him but i haven't killed a single your many i feel like a piece of shit goes
if it succeeds it will not only change the character a saudi arabia but the tone and tenor of islam across the globe only a fool would predicted success or indeed right glowingly about it and the first place but he says but only a fool would not root for it you better understand it i flew to riyadh to interview the crown prince
known as n b s who is not spoken about the extraordinary events here of early november was will home had been solomon yeah i know that i know that from you talking about it that's right
an educator and gentlemen when his government arrested scores of saudi princes and businessman on charges of corruption and threw them into a makeshift guilty jail the riyadh ritz carlton and so they agreed agreed to surrender their ill gotten gains you don't see that every day yeah yeah i mean not of
his of the family none of their games are ill gotten it just it was really coincidental that the people he threw in prison where like you know
hotel prison or you know a guy that controlled the saudi national guard which is one of the institutions of they fear fears one of the only competent national military institutions even though it's still shit military body and a guy who the media about a in
oh you've been to lol it's very coincidental you just never see a regime leader neutralize leaders of opposing potential powers
never see them and also there is a very coincidental helicopter crash that
so i just wish he of i'm nineteen seventy now
saddam hussein has made an unusually bowl power move his party's comical
i think he's doing so the know to keep building exercise with a grenade
there's a lot of trust fall
but he goes your are we met saddam songs are budding filmmaker
i don't get it
it run its remit at night and his family's or neat adobe wall palace in we call it we we just north of reality
spoken english while his brother france could lead the new saudi ambassador to the us and several senior minister hear a different lamb dishes and space conversely space the conversely and these guys are the fucking asshole guy with the nazi article did the same thing they're obsessed with these guys eating while i don't fucking care i appreciate
as a writer myself that double meaning to the words it's like in those fantasy books about george r r martin always takes effort to tell that everything all the evil pies
isn't as the food is spicy as we know but the key the spice to the conversation like sprinkle tell that's why he's got a pulitzer oh yeah it's like you know what's the fantasy series about the the mouse is also a night that wall read wall where the hell yeah they're a hungry raised by livestock fans are out here
his good
if bread with a nice jam
the new york times and how the style is the right
writing about little cute little well it's also races will let's hear more about this food
the efforts are there is no more about the food after nearly four hours together i surrendered he won fifteen and and b s's youth pointing out that i was exactly twice his age
it's been a long long time though since any arab leader war me out when a fire hose of new ideas about transferring them in his country
like i got to get my stomach pumped after that
actual why yes it really is how did i say this before
while since the young arab leader cream pie to be with his ideas
oh run that back run that by run that back it's been a long time though since any arab leader warm
a fire hose
he about this country
that's the thomas frieden a mixed metaphor
that is the time
sure move i was worn out what am i this young barrow
so
a fucking master he's you can't even imitate his mill had a forest style is astounding new worn out by a fire
classic thing that happened so he goes on and he says here
he goes it's ludicrous he said to suggest that the anti corruption campaign with a coward grab thinking i was talking about the rapper he immediately gesture to enslave
he pointed out that many prominent members of the ritz crowd had already publicly pledge allegiance to him in his reforms
a majority of the royal family is already behind him this is what happened he said our country has suffered from a lot of corruption from the nineteen eighties until today to high on the corruption index in the economists one hundred percent the calculation of our experts is that roughly ten percent of all government spending was safe and off by corruption each year from runs hotter levels to the not
this is one family owns all the oil that sounds like one hundred percent right
so when his father who had been tainted by corruption charges during his nearly five decades as governor of riyadh ascendancy the throne in two thousand and fifteen at a time you're falling oil prices he vowed to put a stop to it all and the said my father saw that there is no way we can stay in the g twenty and grow with this level of corruption
yeah that's the problem
oil is is not long for this world is the primary primary fuel vehicles or that your other chief export is leg
graham comments
that's why they need to diversify don't forget and will have islam right all right well they get into that so he basically just prince verbatim all of m b s's statement about how this anti corruption campaign is going splendidly and is not at all about consolidating his own power
then he gets neo there is no way to root out all the corruption from top to bottom so you have to send a signal and the civil going forward know is you will not escape
if there's also the signal we send to all migrant worker
sorry take their past
robinson's most women yet
this a black person recently it all over the stakes are high for m b a he calls it this entire article because it's cool
he spent billions of dollars on a pole or that didn't work
because the stakes are high for us and it's anti corruption drive if the public feels that he is truly purging corruption that was sapping the system and doing it so in a way that is transparent and makes clear to future saudi and foreign investors that rule of law will prevail it will really instill a lot of new confidence in the system and then he qualifies this by going you know but
it could go otherwise cynical toys is the best it's like you know most writers they won't admit that things go to his but tom friedman will say something could go two ways but it'll say the forklift to progress can always run into you know like the who who
reaction isn't honestly if want to look at this from like a geopolitical powerpoint power politics perspective doesn't this whole of neo liberalism that the be ph
the also be an i b m i is carrying off here
doesn't that just make it all just look like a giant basically attempt to buy himself out of the doghouse for being the world's leading exporter of terror and solidify his western alliance is against iran
because it's there
hey you want you want to buy stock in or ammo how you want to you want to live in my floating topiary city and the red sea
these are incentives to sort of solidify those bonds in the face of iran
while i mean everything they've done even when the model of and songs deputy crown prince there was like a sort of turn before they like when they turned on muslim on muslim brotherhood and basically just fucking dumped dump truck full of gold bars en el cc to wipe them out and
secret contacts that have been going on with israel since pretty much start of the syrian civil war but i mean this
what's going on now it's like a more overt play of what they were already pivoting to but muhammad been solomon what freeman will mention is that mountains almonds like kind of fucking dumb oh
hilariously bad at all this like shit all the evening so so yemen with his project and they expected to invade yemen with pakistan's army and they were like we're good
as i stood out man
so like they're only way out now is to make a deal this delay the ex president who they were in part fighting against all this
like pope that he turns it turns back on the movies which may do and what they just did in lebanon i don't know freedom and gets to that does say
he only united the entire country behind their prime minister who they already the they actually fucking hate the he turned lebanon it's just a unified country every sacked going like give us back our shitty dom as prime through i'm going to jump ahead now i'll go to the resistance
he does mention it but only to see the m b s wouldn't comment on the strange goings on with prime minister is yours
we'll have an aunt is very obviously and they've they've got apparently black water guys beating the shit out of these dudes and the hilton while that was daily mail's satcher it maybe it maybe i mean like they definitely do use me they're getting tortured come on up yeah but the torture is like you know they show them a sexy woman and bikini and you can not
comment
bad they weren't all here's here's a picture of a made for malaysia doing her job without getting threatened you could add not going to torture family
so my family are reliable average of around here but he goes on to talk about how like actually the most important thing he's doing is not anti corruption but reforming islam and he goes here
it is if this virus this is friedman again if this virus have an antique pluralistic massage units think islam that came out of saudi arabia in nineteen seventy nine can be reversed by saudi arabia it would drive moderation across the muslim world is surely be walk around here were sixty five
the population is under thirty so he's like yeah all the people who use religious fundamentalism is like a tool to address their agenda and create like in conjunction with america create like this wave of political islam to you
counter arab nationalism and socialism in the sixties seventies any and also to hit it regional enemies well outside yeah exactly if the people who introduced in conjunction with africa
the as he calls it the virus of this he never mentions will have risen by name it in assembly
he does not know the word were hobbies it does not appear anywhere on your article or if there's anything about if there's anything about like a violent reactionary strand of a belief is easy is it is to get rid of it
as it is to spread it very easily invades the example sorry i you actually does mention one hobby clerics it's the example of pandora's box you open the box and all the bad things happen i do is put it all back
just by and i like that that i'd like that detail of what sixty five percent of the is on the thirty that means are very impressionable they've got different interests from the older ruling class
they like snap chat this is the snap chat generate if you will you know who isn't all the most organized group and the entire country outside the royal family it's certainly not people who are even more religiously art london
going to go what they can do is they can get this guy brandon war down
i'd okay is a different way and do something else arcs court t jang if they are afraid of the few other tidbits here
thomas recites goes the saudi education minister child in that among a broad set of education reforms he's redoing and digitizing all text oh hell yeah sending seventeen hundred saudi teachers each year to a world class schools in places like finland to upgrade their skills and now seeing that for the first time so
saudi girls will have physical education classes in public schools and this you're adding an hour to the saudi school day for kids to explore their passions in science and social issues under a teacher supervision with their own projects so they're adding gym class and going to have i pads and saudi schools so that has asked for rugged
the i pad in the school thing is just one other the honest but it's also for guys like friedman it is a panacea it is like spanish fly it's like they get a whiff of it and they're just wet they get so moist over just the words fucking
computer in the classroom they think that's the solution that every fucking hate that kids are going to be like oh boy i pad i'm going to go to wikipedia and learn everything i've done with the letter a
and i just did a google they're just going to type in like sex porn dot com a ratchet fight
they're going to run our call themselves and their friends beating up some girl at the local law and put it on youtube oh i think i think a lot of ads to resurrect will keep i think a lot of them are going to become gamers are some great games in the eye on the apple store
i just editing of the saudi a stone team is going to look out for them in nexus i just i think it's having the reader in the classroom there must be like when ned flanders showed homer his his cable tv package there's like fifteen hundred channels all blocked
a good saudi game
it's a variation on counter strike he plays the french commandos that rated the grand decisions every night but you only have five minutes before your temporary conversion to islam whereas we will
get a booster
passengers of the correct
i've got loot and crates
keep your keep your gaming going on when i was as argued about that with somebody i forget where but we're we're saying that late for the five minutes of the french guys were muslims that are were like what if one of their friends died in there like we all thought we would get out of this mission be able to draw muhammad again
so hard for us not to draw muhammad ten minute well there was an the the surviving commandos found charlie have done but there were there was a big controversy about loot crate because all you can get our skins of the prophet muhammad
so now living gaming job
i get that sadly leech them with so
earlier when they get to foreign policy
he says he won't comment on a prime minister hariri of lebanon come on the saudis
saudi arabian announcing his resignation seemingly under pressure so here's where it gets really revolting he goes he insisted that the saudi he backs worrying yemen which has been a humanitarian nightmare
not like
thomas didn't put the word humanitarian and for a nightmare but i think like he really was thinking public relations nightmare
area in which has been a humanitarian nightmare was tilting in the direction of the pro saudi legitimate government there which he said is now in control of eighty five always and and over him
it was all i see has been given the fact that pro iranian who the rebels who hold the rest launched a missile at riyadh airport anything less than one hundred percent is still problematic
anything less than one hundred percent control and he can only pitch it towards the safety of these inbred shit heads in riyadh not the literally millions of people are starving to death and getting medieval disease and he owes his general view seem to be that with the backing of the trump administration he praised president trump as the right person
the right time the modalities soccer the saudis in their arab allies were solely building called he doesn't mention their israeli allies or other but he goes we're slowly building a coalition to stand up to iran i am skeptical the dysfunction in rivalries of in the sunni arab world generally have prevented forming a unified front up to now
now which is why iran indirectly controls for arab capitals today damascus son a baghdad in beirut the iranian overreach is one reason and b s was scathing about iran's supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei you'd think you'd think that the who these just are iranians by the way people write to them
the right about them i mean it's a logistically impossible for them to get the type of support that the saudis gave to say like any any of this law is herbs and syria or or any any of the when they helped start isis into those and six i mean that it's him
possible for them to do it and they're not in lockstep the iranians obviously back them because of a bunch of guys and sandals can destroy billions of dollars and saudi equipment go for it but a series or gets really good and on one who she is iranian and iran and just dominated by iran anyone who's soon he is in a grand coalition for democracy
so he goes
iran's supreme leader
b s year around supreme leader is the new hitler of the middle east
but we learn from europe wide yeah i knew it was the old and hitler and his dad
sit oh my
saddam was the old hitler the middle east
hitler are you writing that he is the new hitler the middle east but we learn from europe that appeasement doesn't work we don't want the new hitler in iran is little car my head
you know precipice of an enormous crossroads we laud from the european example dead dead preoccupation with p don't work this is just like richard chamberlain when he went to manage
goes we don't want the new hitler in iran to represent to repeat what happened in europe in the middle east what matters most though is with saudi arabia does at home to build its strength and economy like of these two paragraphs is that friedman goes from obliquely referencing the humanitarian nightmare in yemen that's being carry
eat out by saudi arabia with us support that many people have basically said his genocidal at this point the starvation being carried out there among that portion of the country that has resisting saudi control in this disaster and they started epidemic their the era of yeah disease and starvation that has been
posed by saudi arabia and america as basically a were silent partner and all of this world that we're letting this happen
you want to are not a partner
we love it we we gave the saudis laser targeted does nations he's one of the of the bombs a bit strange
so he goes and describing that situation in yemen obliquely to than just letting and the ass call iran is leader the new hitler
because he because iran now has influence in four hour of capitals is iran currently carrying out a genocide in any country
i mean i guess they would argue they would argue they would argue that area
the point is a rich the call iran hitler when they are carrying out their own genocidal war and yeah also i have the feeling that mountains on and just found out about hitler
calling around eight dollars
very asinine a historical seems seems like siblings very poor choice of where and which country which country is turning a generation of muslims into religious fanatics not like maniacs for the of the hell offices the indonesia it's not fucking more they stop the extremism cut it out of done with yeah fuck it though
i'm still massage and as though it has know i'm i'm still racist
slaves
still committed warcraft i'm still going to be a cholera i'm still starving yemen
still actually liked
actually exported surrealism into syria
extremism should have done with it
so last line here he says
but can m b s and his team see this through again i make no predictions he has his flaws that he will have to control insiders here tell me they include relying on a very tight circle of advisors who don't always challenging sufficiently you needs a team of run he has a tendency to start to many things that don't get finished he talking about yemen
there
hasn't had an idiot off there's a whole list but guess what perfect is not on the menu hear somebody had to do the job rich saudi arabia into the twenty first century and stepped up i for one am rooting for him to succeed in his reform efforts of for you guys chime in here is that when he said rich saudi arabians the twentieth
a century and i'm rooting for it my mind is just drawn back once again to vintage thomas friedman who said of the iraq war that that would help wrench the arab world into the twenty first century and then american troops would be the ones to go door to door and say if you don't like maternity how bout you suck on this socket lose second
look i mean wrenching along to the twenty first century it's like pushing a car out of mode and also you have cholera and you're being bombarded by an inbred shit head and three billion dollar plane that last year i have ever give up that last paragraph solid like the copy a v h s for an eighties movie about a plucky been
kids to save a community center or putting on a show or going to work average amount of the twenty first century it's not going to be easy but i think the whack it gets get through it
same be prematurely exuberant
i hope that he's successful and we get where the corruption and massage any and the bad kind of islam and up the good guy all man i just thought about what if jobs return at the exact same time as corruption and that islam and and saudi are going to owe a lot of people but what if he said i'm going to make
saudi arabia great new what if he said the words radical islamic
that's why the thought what does he said merry christmas
we'll see
it's a political party with the ayatollah to resist radical is what if they invade iran take care of their budget deficit
