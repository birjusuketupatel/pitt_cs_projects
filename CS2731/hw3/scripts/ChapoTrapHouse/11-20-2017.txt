what does too
what if we might not even though
as the question
julia child is the
a lot of people really love the first amendment here
i shall be down to silence just for asking questions just don't i don't want to keep his a stack is it the candy it's very simple math little peek was mobile core rapper
no arrest these little bit
well i'll take your word for it speaking of things of a technology that we find vexing and ever churning making our lives better
you ever notice smart smartphones actually just many people stupid
i've got i've got a little follow up though
listen recently got some followed news on the app
right oh that faster
brainchild it's called it's called sorry
i'm sick note and brothers or know about parker brothers or whoever owns the sorry game has sued her yet but it's the sorry app and sisters
that is recorded are reading series on her launch of the out the app has actually come on why it's launched its live now you can download sorry app on your phone use use promo code i'm sorry to get fifteen percent off your first apology
we bought we all downloaded it before the show and it is it's the most pointless
to exist says you you've got nothing to apologize for your already there so i was i mean fresh he was our sure i'm good but the thing is that all you can do on this is the only things you can do is you can record a video apology and then uploaded into the stream and then other people can vote on whether to accept hundred
that is it
the top apology on that site which i believe his van susteren owner in favor of it has i think twenty views
catching on reddit varied is doing better honestly
how did you ask
so i'd kick things off here tonight i for
you guys here at the bell house and broken five us right now i'm going to record an apology on sorry out
now when you when you go to add your apology
sorry hits you with some suggestions on how to apologize
and it says before you hit record here is a few friendly tips
no great apology was ever made was angry
ah false i've only made apology is wrong
yeah have you listened stains this dog discography
john it out of the second try
tip number to his body language and eye contact can speak louder than were her eye contact with what you're fucking phone what contact
millions of people presumably how are you going to make eye contact with them all if you if you look at the camera it's like the waste news anchors do it's like there
he told that it's obvious this is stupid
the total of a dog making eye contact with the entire world
and number three i think most importantly just be honest just be understanding just be you you've got this you've got
so here we go town to apologize
i will mimic you're here on the sorry app live at the bell house in brooklyn
feeling a little contrite feeling a little humble ray to say the words i'm sorry to the bill house brooklyn venue for
what i did to the green room just a few seconds ago because certain items in our writer which are clearly clearly laid out when we agreed to do the show were not mad green upon items that were not met at all and indeed flagrantly violated i'm sorry for the property destruction but i'm agreeing now to bear
some of the cost for the damage died so i'm sorry
just trying to do better but again like the concert writer is a contract that's an agreement we we all agreed on it before and i'm sorry
i accept the healing begin
going to just post that right now
okay
review apology to i want a caption it personalize it just going to submit
either way this is the actual man joke
we we downloaded that happened we put up joke apologies before the show and i look
this a wall of apologies that you can scroll through and the public feed and one of them
was sorry i didn't eat that ass
on that note i've been a bald headed view myself
second apology in the van susteren apology app in all caps
all you guys are going to be in it but i'm recording myself
a guys
i'm astounded that i tried to use tokens to tip will during his apology
i first noticed something wasn't working when he didn't remove any of his clothing
at least other video interfaces like chatter day
russia chat
easter easter and eastern bloc on his
and i just expected the customs of those mediums to carry over to this new one and i'm sorry to the app and i'm sorry to will and will if you take actual our currency instead of tokens to
behave in suit
we have like twenty minutes in between shows
oh wait to accept that apology when opposed to the official i'm sorry feed can
whether i accept it or not but i appreciate the gesture and his next i got one
dial up my app hear a beep boop boop boop boop boop
stage business

that face for the win
i want to apologize to each and every person out there on line and in real life
i ever told that their shoes look like a fan
in point of fact your shoes were great they didn't look like a family will the truth is that i felt like a found
and i wanted everybody else the feel like a fan too
and so i hope you'll take my apologies
go out into the world wearing those shoes in full confidence that they are in fact fluke and not at all
a fan
thank you
free make male whoever that is
the audience back and decide that
i never ever ever fun
okay
i want to say i'm sorry to the haters for shy and so hard
i'm sorry to the others for being so cute
and most of all i'm sorry
that i started on that afghan you're dead grandmother made for you


you had an apology for us but i didn't do anything wrong
fair enough right
moving on then
two other news of the week
so we visited on a previous show i've taken the moment now to check in on the status of a certain a wager that has been made
between her jaw and mad over an upcoming special election in alabama would you like to update us on the stakes and the state of play
man are you feel about it i'm feeling very confident
not worry family not lonely
that so we we bet on who is going to win the special election alabama roy more or doug jones most well now in touch a peace
no jobs of course most well known for his work with more no toro
in films such as pan's labyrinth of cowboy
well the because the halls of the polls
right now are shorter consistent lead i believe you can confirm the world's oil and more polls i will only release three
mr jones and me wanting to be big stars
washington so yes the poll suggests that jones is going to win i scoff hardly of those polled the same polls that show to hillary clinton as a shoe and win which is why we are scheduled a fucking why show for a
because we thought it would be fun for everybody
cause we thought we'd all i have like a lab for see the results that take taken i saw okay we've avoided that but instead halfway through the fucking show we get news oh yeah the world is on fire and you're all too
other forty minutes of comedy that we had the fucking you all because got their balls told us that hillary clinton was going away was hubris take the title that show normal world will never end
i say to those small sir i i ask you to stick them where the sun don't shine and i say and said that i believe in the people of alabama
i believe they will make the worst was indefensible in monmouth monstrous choice that they can well that's what mattered saying i agree with and i think all of you agree with roy
no matter what he's done are people saying balls he has good ideas
and that's going to shine through
i found out a lot of our roy more in the last couple weeks that i never knew or wanted to know
a fact that he was almost fragments own soldiers in vietnam for big piece of shit
yeah they called they called him the pedophile marine because they are jealous of
he has basically doug meter meyer from animals but they didn't kill well i don't know if this is ethical or not to do when they are are stakes been involved in a wager with people on the show but there's are why to say there's one other factor found out about way more is that he lived in alaska australia i'm sorry for a year as a young man right and from
i understand he moved there because he thought that on the southern hemisphere the age of consent was go the other way
it's called the korea less effect
well you know there are there is a wager are being place among my co host but we i think we may affects the outcome of this special playing halo effect the a while we may try because they did it and breaking news
a secret source secret source his sent us on only us and this is where the only news source that as is a gigantic trove of alabama high school yearbooks of a certain era
and we are now going to read you live for the first time the unseen unedited roy more yearbook inscriptions
the first one reads year
stacey
like it says it leviticus
speak to the israelites and say to them when you bring an offering to the lord bring as you're offering an animal from either the heard or the flock anyway i hope you stay a part of the cool flock in school band stay nieto and have a great summer your how ray roy
that see totally innocent
hi it's normal i got one that's a little weird down go for it
my dearest annabel
long other nights i weigh your sweet voice my service to this country as assistant district attorney hardly seems worth it with brother pitted against rather and not brother in the way that black people mean it's not like that at all
now they are school years coming to an end i dream of the day i can pick you up from the roller rink and my burger king size sedan with horns on the front of it
until then i remain dedicated to my service to the confederacy by arresting urban teens for wearing their socks too low
forever yours roy
i got i got someone as well
my beloved tiffany
remember the strength of david and goliath chariots being a total bitch and homeric
remember the faith in me shack shad rack and adnan ago
they were cast into the fiery furnace when janet's that tells you that your jean jacket is worth it
and remember his job and remember jonas for parents and the belly of the leviathan when the cheerleaders don't invite you to the spring fling even though the invited allison and she didn't even go to a single game all year
never change
seriously never change
right way
i got i got kind of a long one because i'm closest with our source julian i mean anonymous
every go
lucinda as i've always decided you wanted the easy ones who came out of their value of wickedness to know he loves daughter until one by one they get beat the sea and land that could see a goal the lamps family is court and the unjust bread bakers of the city of sought
each man must pay three times his first born child's weight soul to atone for the inequity of sought forever and ever amen
wow i think that verse says a lot about our friendship
you know it's true that sometimes you meet someone who you think you'll hate because they're a sixteen year old j the volleyball player in you're thirty three year old assistant district attorney
she wears short skirts i were a little root beer colored leather vest that holds my little gone for baby and pussies
you get it
but the more you get to know each other
the more you realize more similar than you could have ever known
you just plain rock
you told me so much you're you're going to camp this summer and i used i used to the only jews did that
i hope you bring the same smartness cool attitude and kindness there that your grace this school with in your sophomore year
and that you don't come back as a jewish person
if you do all learn to accept it because friendship is about it if someone where they're at and where they go kill the un roy more

why is kind of different
hey trevor eat a dick you're a huge bitch if i see you at the mall again you're gay ass is that assistant district attorney

man did happen around
i've weren't a life
so we'll see how that news shakes up the national news cycle and the special election in alabama when when this hits the airwaves i should be touching the poop you'll be touching the in
my friend you will be the want to
we shall see
i've already gazed into the future in my mind tunnel and it has told me what happened as as leonard cohen once i've seen the future brother and it is to touching
virgil touch
it's december ninth two thousand and seventeen in thirty seconds they touch the poop
just another bit of breaking news or current events
when you move onto the main part of the show night
i just found this today this is some news out of the music is where there's a a new country music song
takes aim a meal in during the national anthem
of course in east texas country music star is released a new song neil mccoy maybe it is new single taken me my ass i won't take a me
say that ten times fast take my ass
kapur nick i got a place where you could put your knee
i just took a knee and boy is my ass tired
you mother fucking code care it every issue with your face on the cover and i don't want my ass with it even though the really heavy the glossy stock to shreds my androids and turns the bathroom and into the chainsaw see from scarface
i was looking really forward to this month's issue you
i want to know what chris him worth was like what he's not acting
oh
i think
let's hear a little bit of take my ass
so here we go
damn son where'd you find this

racist genders
this video looks like the assassination of benazir bhutto
gay marriage
yeah that right about it
other united states
every time

yeah
homer
i have no object
one man
okay

oh
i with him
i don't think about that is okay to make fun of him for being a reactionary but honestly he just knows his audience
modern country music is just discussed thing just palo her that these people cynically shovel out to these rooms and they they think they understand like age but a truck of air and american troop it's like everybody country function because is this
are you in the fuckin hillbillies that should be every fucking saw nobody hillbillies are listening to hip hop from ten years ago there were all wearing a unit
the people in the suburbs and excerpts who have convinced themselves that because we have about one fifty that are cowboys
the famous f one fifty driving car
yes because i live i live i live in a gated community and they've got they've got a little like a longhorn steer on the fucking arch above it when i drive through after punching in my security code that makes me a fucking cowboy i'm just a frontiers man who spent a combined thirty seconds outside of iraq
conditioning since nineteen eighty two
does anybody remember the chicken fried by the zach brown band
in my mind this is the peak of modern country know som will get better if you don't know what the songs about the title is pretty self explanatory it's about how awesome it is the chicken fried steak what about what about zero show me the i know it through this whole song is little beta chicken fried call bear on a fresh pair of jeans
fitzgerald right it's just a list of fun things to do in america
start the fire for people with heart
exactly
i actually
the fire for people who been to a pizza
but then there's one verse of the song that stops the whole thing the whole narrative about having friday night chicken fried steak to say that we got to thank the troops
because their sacrifice allows us to eat chicken friend that's the saw they felt the need to throw that in there and just the patronizing nature that is so disgusting i just like to think that there was a guy in iraq in two seconds before he bled out after getting fried by an id was thinking yes i'm dying for people's ability to
eat chicken fried steak
i love using my x box controller on the highway of death
just so people can go to golden corral i think the most iconic country song is the jays and all the insulin where he wraps and talks about beating up a guy because he talked shit on facebook
that's the real lifestyle
that's our lifestyle that it's my life and constantly voting people over headphones
so if you spend friday night you know having a beer some chicken fried and looking at nice girls chances are you spent the whole week leading up to that doing mind numbing drudgery of some kind of i'm talking about will work
talking about work folks is what we're doing we're working for the weekend here the song goes and that is the main theme for tonight show
on on the on the actual pod casts of course you do the reading series for fans of
reading is for champs
reading is for people who are listening to the show on headphones while working out or pretending to work everyday sucks
viewing series watching over the ads who come to the bell house
yeah
i bet you fucking virgin sowed out the words in your head
not anymore you're going to hear them
so yeah this is our very first for you this audience here at the dollhouse not even the second audience it's going to come here know
but you are the guinea pigs for the very first ever chop of viewing serious
and the theme for this feeling series is like i said work and we have curated
election of videos for you
are intended to be watched as part of being part of a team if you were may actually fun yeah
is the fun part of the incomes part of being a team and getting a paycheck and wearing uniforms like we're doing here
so
i think you'll learn very early on
a theme to these sort of the lessons that the people who created this video wanted it's intended audience to receive and chief among them is that joining a union is really really bad
squares yeah
oh
i'll tell you it's not on fluke organized labor
yeah collective bargaining healthcare plan looks like you're from
but before you're into that i mean unions obviously have been in the news and by the news i mean the media because there's been a union news so of course they're comforting it and just breaking today
vox has decided to form
stack what is a union
so you know we support them obviously i mean will not box but their union
yeah the only striker through if the pinker into showed up with a gatling gun
oh why every like are now as you're going to see in these videos you know it's hard to convince your fellow employees to join the union and they're always going to be some people who maybe don't think it's such a good idea
just horn subjects just natural born peasants company man company and fucking men to the not really fucking and men like male technically men people yeah should we male ask figured who was the scab that word
french german loop a german lopez will as this sounds like one of those venezuelan opposition leader
whose family came to venezuela my way of how i
by that was a very strict counsellor at a summer camp and occupied poland
i love italian about the dictatorship
yeah my dad he was a great guy he rehabilitated convicts is all ages
by work program and you know now now we're going to get it as well on track german lopez sounds like one of the fake names from episode one
alright german lopez who said looks like a bullet
i am against vox union
i know writers you want a union as protection from laziness
which will make a lot of things worse including for writers
i don't know if it allows laziness and to be pretty great
either football game and become a writer in the first place if you weren't looking to protect your laziness
if you work ethic means anything he be working in a fucking railroad driving spikes and an now says the pod casters exactly where even higher on the totem pole
the galaxy play or the galaxy guy
on our german
sorry as bought as the bond to hitler hitler's not done
the fall of the final tweet is this is the most the base thing i've ever read on the what would achieve cave used to post more than be like five hundred replies that would be like fill my whole up with com
give me a baby going to board it ledges area
i registered i if that guy in the navy
is that i don't understand it chief is like that's that's an honorific that's a rank and keep is the first name
at our owners
he think that they there
it's that keith
keith with an f
matt has your absence rap and john wayne
but now this is the most the base shit of ever probably ever my life
vox media is a generous company
usually so for digital media and some people want to take advantage of that first of all what the fuck second for you okay box that
the follow up to that tweet is just gag and noises
ezra you need a back rub and they're trying hard
i love being a little baby sitting in his ruins just feeling is warm want bosom
thinking father for nurturing me father's gifts that x l s
medical uses choose up the spreadsheets and rick irritated
right
is that enough of that good german love
the g lopez yeltsin with her tonight i let's get into this going into this feeling series his first video comes courtesy of kmart and this is a very specifically really see like a number of different i'll i came i
is anyone from sylvan came our country
i grew up in our town okay came out i everyone yeah yeah yeah let's hear it for shop co oh
we've cut out i know that shaka i were to see like the first of many sort of tactics that are taken in these in these videos and the first one is that you're going to see here is making the workplace seem really fun and cool with an awesome song so you're young
with avant garde anti art
k on my and print
you didn't know the contrast between the music in this building that looks like the police his place imaginable
have fought a powder
the bad
we're putting green
no
pass
oh my
my and way
right on
this is the violence is saturday night
di maria
here
women now
lines while
where are you in over the world
oh
every one of the shirts you're wearing
and around
yeah

that's enough for the the singing away you guys and him i sounds like a
so if you're seeing everybody in the cave our distribution center and as soon as the camera pfizer and they're all smiling and waving yeah it's just how they are
it's like david attenborough found them
the wave is sign of their appreciation for employers
the union union organizer into their habitat
so that's that's where you have
you get people on your side with the cool song cool upbeat song that again is contrasted with be working in a building and location that is look slightly less cheery than under no bulgaria pre soviet union collapsed
so
next one
this one comes courtesy of target and this is a little bit more sophisticated this is like they're really going to give you the employee the street though or why unions are not for you can i just say that the first kind of ethical concerns argument i've ever heard was that target
oh i could hamper i go to hard
and it was actually difficult because we didn't even have a walmart yet we had a kmart so like it was just it was not even on our radar
so this is the ethical company target

welcome to target where we know you'll have a wreck experience
and i'm maria
if you already started working here you're already part and important team and a great target store or i tried to
retirees take the word doesn't think your industry and open conversation with your family your work learn something new everyday
and we throw in a while
also be a lot of challenges but there's nothing we can't solve are working together a leadership team and your fellow members are anxious to help and to make working a target a positive and rewarding experience
if you ever have a question all you have to do is asking everyone here from a c o down want you to go to the ceo store bad
i learned about how should i won't be any of those on the city was federal here asking out or anything but i haven't ever leaving your always the ended this tape is a santa dr helena number and school children here daily are key part of our culture and a key part of our success
one a very competitive business and we're changing all time we have to in order to stay ahead of the other guys now just a few years ago i had reliant much the way if you read the ice out well
we're a target because we're i economy of the world trade unions and that represent grocery store workers when we think business away from unionized grocery stores that means they need fewer employees and fewer grocery store employees mean fewer union members and fewer men
oh that's a problem for the union business that's right i said business yeah that's an idea this as a pulse rate heard it in the yeah
a union is not a charity it's not a club and it's not part of the government it's a business a union and intake in money to survive
and a product that just wants holy land membership said care about you is already source of income my monthly charge money for initiation dues and fines and assessments you get
anybody on is never enough members there
so the union nine tell you they just when you hand jobs with icon
so
like this is the first major theme of these videos will you'll notice like the third out to the team members tell you that you know target is your friend target is an open door policy from the ceo of all the way down to you and like that's the targets just all about whereas the union
just wants money out of you
a union is a business unlike target them so target
family union business that's easy
we're going to see further examples of this tactic but when i think is fascinating is the way in he's training videos they projects all of the shitty is aspects of your employer onto a union
a union is a business whose to exploit you get the most out of you for the least amount of money possible
i call it turns yea
that you in mind sassy easiest and something
i've never shopped at a store with an armed guards
organize this hearing their union membership sit down and here's why
deterrence only goes to the thorns of games like it could also there are no better way of doing business and old and rigid structure old fashioned it's right being unable to change quickly and adapt to new opportunity being flexible
key to running a successful business and people are hit not had those either way now
no one knows exactly what could happen but there are lots of examples of how richard grocery store union contracts going to thirty four the origin
are you decide to ridge am actually heard out and mind in the process
here's what we make here's the nightmare relic say know
and stationary but you're walking through gymnastics on hang on something again
and ask round the guests
without even thinking about it you'd start and give them any that if they require and then they ran in our planet outside of saddam
do you don't the gas sorry i can't help you
that makes you look bad but more importantly made me later he doesn't get is going to get it so he died might not come back with no wonder everyone gets hot
yep the
that looks like a nightmare and then where i can't stop on the way to my mandated lunch break to tell someone where to find the curtains ma'am oil you tell me where to find the linens that are made by orientals
i do like that she starts with this makes you look bad as someone paid ten dollars an hour to go heard a bunch of fuel suburbanites around a target i'm like yeah and when a middle man i already look in the mirror and feel bad and what difference does this mean i want to be respected by the and phase
cretin middle manager with the lot of when he comes the most oranges thinks everyone with a name tag is temporary slim
want him to like me
normal idea the last the last item from this is target video i want you to guys with guys to watch is just a i want you to pay attention to this incredibly hard cut that they're going to be just this less turn out of nowhere like going from the to nice team members to something else so check this out because the yeah
you need your dues money at some point you might be asked to join while talk about their tactics organizers might use and a meant like learned you want one for you to know target philosophy on to your house
whoa whoa rubber team members have the right to join unions but they also have a right not to join you
you're honest that is glad that we're it's totally agree
is not in their beds you know
alan impacted the one group of todo going to you know what could kill his chosen to be represented by a year you may ultimately as won't won't read us be harder granddad okay liberalism is the ability to mimic have been outlawed
this fucking bond villain
i think that's what
he a stroke in a small cat to be like you're here usa
yeah i'm going to where the most trustworthy out that a turtleneck in a blazer
it's not it's not at all what you were when you're trying to pay for your son's private school tuition with go game
he looks like he's trying to blow up the moon
sport coat to hide the bullets from the shoulder holster
by the way anybody else that could see my man look like it's below drift
like annoys them
like if you join the marines with the flatter what i love about this hard cut to daniel que pinkerton is this terrorist target right and in these bullet points about target will do this target revolve result but they're just showing you the employee a target and then it's just like their points in a couldn't
i love that guy so much i want to stand and we keep feeling when he learns bits of other languages just so you can call the cops and other people
his vote and is all issues and grow the business together without their parents of a human or other third party
third party representation trying to divide us is contrary to our company philosophy employees yes
firemen tries to create a clear what
ones that were all the embrace the new order by working together
all of us team members team leaders group winners supervisors and man and he is starting to the are excellent
and in our service the circus
concerns the target is over her
and keep rising
had you your these things because i
for one hundred percent pure drink juice
as the round version of the golden dawn logo
you did you you'd you'd you'd just divide us and they go gets the target policy of one book one nation
i hope that guy's dead but he's probably and or something that guy know that guy that guy is under secretary of labor yes
like involved over now right ear baby
that guy is the bash gorka his office manager
they just said pleasant banter but in their stupid voices
greek is
next up is targets older the older cousin
walmart
right let's see a walmart a red state magazine
the cultural signify au revoir ever forget my dad told me that the actors in the target had her are in the sag the after
if you're gonna out to spit in the craft service before the that's one of the things i enjoy about this chap the way walmart associates can really make a difference in someone's day i also loved that the people in the store are like a second family to me when really pulled together to take care of our customers
the world not anticipate a cigar age and charles manson have the same length of attempt to fucking appeal to people were family it were a family helter skelter it's coming
check no matter how big the company gets this place is special to ask a special because of the people and we all have our care for different reasons some like me want to carry the internet
and a safe working environment as not want to get older in the long term career some walmart some just the a part time job we have seen as well as i didn't know what i pay for school
you know it's kind of isn't that all the thing that different people
england that don't want to be rounded the soil and seven
some people enjoy putting on a vast and waiting for death
it's somehow it all works i guess that's what our founder sam walton had in mind from the start
is that all these videos they all reference their glorious founder like it was always there dreamed have their employees is there for example the of crop of america you know he thinks it his employees of his family because all of his descendants literally have a compound for their fucking family the you're not allowed
he invented accompany song for warn that he made his employees saying every more
no there's the fact and he would he would he would go to wal marts and lead the
and it would involve him in front of an audience who were just trying to get through there
that's he would lead them in a in a call and response thing of give me a w give me and a he would do a while say that coming and oh give me a square ugly
for the hyphen between walmart
getting give me an ad in age well artie add they pay period and so if a i'm doing that was like that was fun for him the hell out of about north korea but at least they're fucking style like bank doesn't genius suing the ship
yeah it's not just like a loading dock guy named darryl
the hook
divorce the hook to the famous sam walton song is still used today it was pushed me to the edge all my friends are gay
i just started there's just one more than rap is that rap there's just one more thing over the walmart for i want to share hogan services are yes
it's emotional wrap my favorite canada who
lose evert what kind of name is that you are
i'm not i'm not wrong path
easy is a gun i know that what the fuck is a her
vertical vertical what it sounds like oh jesus
yeah that's right
it's stupid
i just want stupid and i don't like music at all like i've never known you to listen to music he is growing more knows more about young people culture

yeah him female that's all i'm saying
that's favorite songs are all civil war margins
it's just that one more example from the one granted
which inevitably rousing i'm sorry
another problem is dead
are also made by old is he
well associate class warm our jobs are flexible jobs gaming associates the opportunity to balance our personal life without work how we usually i get on a few i just love that because they're only walmart or flexible jobs in the example they're giving the mindless teeny on
slightly straight and for person
i love the opportunity at walmart if all the food is lined up perfectly parallel i can be buried with sam walton
i could be a supervisor in the afterlife
this next video i'm going to just only one selection from a this
gives the perspective from the other end this is a training video from was designed for management
oh you real behind the scenes sure what to do it there's union activity in why you should treat treated we actually have to watch this because we are each other's manager yeah this is open shop shadow trap
open and management is on the other and becomes a very divisive atmosphere with a breakdown in communication and collaboration year and making it hard to be efficient and competitive that's exactly the opposite of what lows wants to establish in our business it is lava
i love that they say that because they created a coffee occasional us vs that atmosphere almost as though our profits are due to the surplus value that we extract provide employees
say aerosol can retain labour which the band's the largest share possible of surplus value and management who also wants the largest share possible of surplus value which is just not says i guess
that that by its vibes issue yeah it's like why you gotta bring up old shit
now that's why you gotta bring up shit from the eighteenth back okay it's the twenty first century
hey guys
ted talks guys management no know if you read my pace been but the unions are creating very toxic environment and i'm not enjoying this anymore
okay this next one is sort of like this is like the union horror story where they're going to show you like real footage of unions acting scary a bad crowd out dreams o'keeffe thing where they they went undercover to get the real dirt the horrors of unionists
oh
oh
oh oh oh

well
yeah


yeah
oh

yeah it's like don't join a union you get to scream swears that your boss
there there's you know you get
it all of those men possess a hawk
all of this women even larger hawk
all like yeah god forbid you join a union and you get everything you want in your manage with fears you get to hang out with a bunch of cool guys who look like eric paddock the coolest the best brother in history
he had a patient mustache yes that's right they will call the swarm
union the
i just like that they all get called jackets yeah that inherent credibility nice i know it's cool that's an incredible enticement slag yeah yeah and it's like only one guy in the retail company gets a cool outfit which is like the
over burst your general counsel guy that we saw he only gets the cool turtleneck you know
okay moving on this for is probably the most sophisticated effort and this is put on by fedex in this one they've created a whole sort of narrative to go along with it so let's just take a brief sample of this one takes solicitor a typical holiday cooking a david mann and production
should the state so
what
there there
while the money's going to be rolling in couple months tops so you they so
straight
oh
did all day
socially socially
think that your little union is going to be when an first
that it's like you say damn straight worth it
i don't know why
as usual
because all collider
not how his back on
jersey made it earth
that
we went to can ask what we got everything
okay
mothers
yeah
these
snails so he was a
like an anti load
the said
take that the company said in elections
we we got one steep toss in the trash
he didn't watch it
he says this country don't watch every asia he got washed need to see what honest
a called on job and six
watching that video is like seven days only at the end of your collected by burning right
i actually i'm working on a wiki that encompasses all the characters and that thing
it's a dizzying array and they'll have rich back so i ship steve
other major work
what i loaded up the scene between the wives as she goes what you did watch the v h s you've got a hell of the company v h s but what sophisticated but this is it it carries on with this narrative were like the guys grilling outside one of the wants to go union and the sensible one doesn't but then it cuts back to the y
they have this sort of like are still within a film
for most expressions from the guise of a neighbor comes as a huge actual you're struggling to become a player in the small package delivery we're not quite or after shift
red shirt
customers pictures every profitable
business
he wanted me to see this just keep watch
the only game in town
but independent that was you yes this is fedex you see
how do you see now
witnessing to a great becoming stay to the becoming of a non union
just just watch the video and then maybe you and your husband or decide that you want fedex to be a third of the early
just watch the video and navy and seven days you won't have to vote at all
it's very sophisticated the film within a film i think this was directed by michelle gone very nice on tell because i thought it's dogs
okay
the next video moving out of her after the ne felix guided abilene bad
honestly i want to watch a movie that someone who like eric's weird in a cafe
sounds good man
watch real movies like data
the record of doing that i found on video
and the dragon ball z highlights that to ops and
my three favorite movies
now widely wisely chose not to join and there are a lot of other opportunities you can have in work life and yeah and you know learn special skills on the job as you'll see in this next as long as career from the union organizations doesn't prevent you from being cross trained there are other shift gears
we begin with your second shift
and serving guest
they find enough to it to that boy i'll say well as they put the campers arabic a lot of it
guys went method making a friendly conversations like this is a big part of greeting and serving guest
at other buffet style restaurant
guests often feel there though
what's the almost like than the faith at all country
oh there are two different islands which one do i start away or that what as a cover you spelled little more time with guess the team members that means you have a great chance to make them feel welcome and appreciate definitely want to hang out ideally the gets horribly and oh thank god someone to the cottage or serve them act like you
everyone a they were it
i haven't got my god or henry years at least i can help you hold with guests should i say if he was born in kenya he just said
are you want to predict the guest started a brief covers your that the un handwriting that the airlines yeah i can answer
you might ask something like this
that they called them on the phone do not come into work did you catch a game last night or this and the child was that's my favorite
conversations with our younger guests to have your own ellen de of shallow which fresh as well as i say why
the cross head i actually here to how to talk to children ever stations with children by saying something different
at school or this and decided what does that you're going to have
yeah i don't watch gladiator when we have such
elder of crustacean it's time to move on to the second half of his shift duty serving the guests begin by asking which definitely have a handful of what's guests have chosen what they want your cover slice of how come the american people and i was an ambulance your judgment call on your part
less us makes us special request we don't limit the second half we do however manage it to you don't limit how much it was a reserve the right
cheers for is too much this is great when you're against lucca advertising that i believe what i love that
right related over the bear or i can't wait to never even after the children usually prefer smaller portions of them as my kids
fucking and carbo loading
if you're gonna make the goddamn slur this year
quarter cut or a half cut of the meet the guest requests
sometimes guests will tell you exactly what size of cut or number of pieces they want some time as you read and you'll kill us
did the exact dimensions these days guests ah feel they are getting more when getting a thicker cut actually the think cut interest them a tender piece of meat which is why we carve dime fake mrs that's why if a guest
i to am i am out of snake will fucking hot say something like this i'd be glad to hear that better slices i've worked either though that the you can always come back up for more okay
have a lot of the way they it's you to game keep yeah but
quito an egg to reduce the amount of at the camp they are disgusting argument customers
as the carver your victim to bone law like anyone else
you could demonstrate your value and overcome the field would know
okay now the next few videos in this series i think pair very well together and they are i think on their own sort of a dip the that i like to call the soul of man under capital yeah this is this is your line
if you work if you're at the mercy of an employer this is your life
and also trigger warning it's supposed to get very disturbed
these are based on
there there is a chain of theatrical down you fucking talk about one thing i had to tell all of you about oh god what you on the hose some trying it you know it
when we were watching these tubes and these guys what does this thing and i said what you guys don't remember showbiz pizza
i hear the of course you do fellow last a hit another back because before they were gobbled up by charles entertainment cheese pizza was our rival and of a product children's
games and pizza restaurant there were two of than one point until that one was gobbled by the other which you kind of assumed was about to happen but has now led to a man i was not aware of this acquisition just knew that one day it was it different know it got over it got taken over by chuck e cheese which means we really need to press for anti trust legislation has the idea
there were at the mercy of one conglomerate for pizza and and much chronic based hi
america i want to live in it is ridiculous that would rat controls all more children
there was a time in this country when if you want to have your birthday party with chronic friends you could choose between a bad led by a male
why both
now your only choice is the mouth
by the truckload of
i made him into that ted
i so let's get into this the long lost shan i really enjoy staring at this piece of meat
i was using positive visualization
it's always the same as a serial killer now filler
the bear
hey well encourages you to the new interact in animation capabilities he hasn't rained
with the addition of an easy to operate control board
booth and the sound system it is now possible for me to talk to all my friend i lied
hey
this is actually the most recent con
i don't get it
stop him
how about anything a real person can do and it would make a visit so much more enjoyable to help here
well now that control system that gives the operator control over my character just about as much
authentic collusion
it's like the the soothing inflection bob ross and me really on
the key word here is control
let's take a look at that complete control board can which means mean troll
the original is that the argue hey and
body movements and various other buttons and switches which control different stage affects our okay let's look at each of the controls probe body movie though know that this is half of asia jagger is in control of this manner you can tilt my head out back
maturity
depressing the right hand control them this direction my hand kilts laughed
we see the back to
the feels him through his limbs
in fact is a bad enough who will have skipped and of his line
he's head carrying to the laugh like this
he will pay for death it will never come
his love watching t as the from a pariah hand is counterclockwise my head what turned to the right
banner one guy on the rise will be drinking the more as a that's for the lions by moving my eyes to go away
that is
or i slap alex to raise like this
the right hand control that growing in her eyes and ears
look at like a scam
my mouth can be controlled by the mouth button on the right hand control you let them after you are
i can
but i cannot screen
i mean we're we're all making fun of this but this is the same technology that controlled boris yeltsin if it was three years
where are you what that video that i just so eerie and just like that fuel when you have a job oh really
very comforting
i'm actually i'm playing that for my young cousins
a as an hour now

by the comet
food groups

so like you guys like billy bob and his humor
this is sort of humorous pantomime of life is sad parity or
it's about to get even worse with the probably the most incredibly bone chilling phrase ever come across that of concept unification card to notification and hope when the walls go up in the drugs
the undesirable that it will be called concept unification got to unify some concepts like resources in humans
concert

okay the the final stop on our on our viewing series is show you what it's like to be have your concept unified
what it's like concepts will be unify did not resist unification now
but there's there's a way out of your money if you don't want your boss to control your life and to be the alienated by labour you can always become your own small business owner
