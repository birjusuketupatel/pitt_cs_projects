
the




that's what i said
you guys are losing universe


she
where
this know where he met with erotic the seychelles story is just like we ran into each other at the hotel yeah
nothing weird at all going on here
craig's list casual i thought that's leave
the clinch jaws sociopath and american aristocrat who whose sister does a yellow cake rituals and public
you three hundred generation wealth and berardi shithead it isn't a religious chop it up and see where we go it is amazing watching
this the trump administration
catch all of these dudes out and all of them going down basically with capone for tax evasion shit like manna for if prince gets in trouble for for for perjury is these awful just criminal scum bag who spent their whole time doing nothing but brutal crimes and just because the guy that they
opportunistic of hung around with the hope of maybe scoring some connections stumbled dec first and the presidency and put a spotlight on all of them and other oh going to the current administration is like the god's plan video for everyone who's ever called their doctor originals or for not giving them l alice is just going around like your blast
your book go make a deal to ever go sell your shares a building go get a military contract
provide security for the junior world cup in mongolia
eighty words you kick off the show
back into this particular well but i feel i have to even though we've already begun to show doing this
i did spend pretty much all morning just watching videos of jordan peterson talk about disney movies
and holy shit dude love disney films there's one there's one videos watching where it's just him literally sort of like an audio track for the blind just describing things that happened in pinocchio
so you know what's really weird to me is because like jordan peterson has become like the house academic of of the right
i'm not sure how much breathing room marriage between between those two but he's clearly popular among that demographic and you know the alright really grew out of the kind of like fever swamp of earlier sort of like internet conspiracy speculation i mean that which was also kind of like fascinated with nazis them and race pure
already and all that weird stuff and in that world where i i spent some time back and
walt disney was considered to be like the sort of like satanic underground like the pizza gate of its day and like if you look up like walt disney world the thirty three club you'll find this elaborate conspiracies about how that's where the masons conduct their rituals in walt disney only castle in yeah so so
it's really odd that now we've got this guy who who is of the outright who is effectively saying no on the contrary like disney is actually truly as wholesome it presents of these are are on
it was at one point where it all started with snow white nine cocked man
play nice guy to some sleeping bitch
chad comes in
the or of the thing that me down this rabbit hole there's an interview with him in time magazine
i just read this literally just him interrogating the film frozen in why it's bad whereas the little mermaid and other earlier disney movies are good and his his answer is that frozen
is intentionally trying to communicate a political message and all the other animated film adaptations are merely channeling
thirteen thousand years of blood civilization or younger kids
yeah it goes it goes pay off in the little mermaid
no one here to ask you if you want to build a strong hundred you do it or not
the collectivization reverse know only from
the uplift be asking someone with the port pull the snow means that they want to take the carrot from your refrigerator
work your to either
i wouldn't want to turn and cleaner since you discover not need a classic disney films but the classic disney afternoon tv shows so i thought i had with him
imagine a man and a large blazer wearing jeans
it's very disturbed and angry for some reason on the verge of tears a nice young man
to me and her lost and scared
and i told them you have to people through
well i mean it doesn't he was lost in a jungle
started an air freight company on his own responsibility doesn't doesn't the fundamental it goes back to it goes back to the snowman story though isn't the fundamental message of jordan peterson to all those young men that they need to use their and carrot
men are crying because the role models or married who's bald
married with the ball corrupted married with curly hair to the third and when they go into the earth is play through the first hurting
the only daughter where the move the thief
because these are the robot models they're dropping ice cream with sprinklers doubted a dodgers dress their behavior
three students brady better go care but just curious
this represents benny hill has he's here
no benny hill represents our dark masculine other a primal energy force and the nurses chasing dressed up as a bobby
read didn't want to be nominated email chaos and the union of the to yeah yankee sachs plays represents western civilization
yeah that's right and the three stooges are the super ego and he could just ask yourself please if you were if you're an acolyte or jordan peterson someone's paying less for you just ask yourself how was your life was a shambles of of alienation and loss and confusion until
seventy year old man explained cartoons
his plan homey
we are just for listeners we are finally going to do the twelve rules for life with huge next weekend but it's little little jordan jordan peterson previous will taste and just to let everyone know so you can get mad at me now i'm not reading that whole fucking
titus the shit are peruse it and i'll i'll have commentary is is that i'm not reading all five hundred pages of this gibberish
i'm come with your house to read them
you're going to do chores why
ages two hundred and ninety nine through five hundred look on his plan she has read the book and also understands things like arid and all that stuff i don't know when i got i got there at once it was a restaurant that only and see health rating
i'm a really big fan of the cool ranch dirt dirt
i know you hear that european piece a shit were roasting your name fuck you i i just want to know what the twelve rules are i just want to go through the twelve rules i want to know what they are just want to know about the rules i don't want to know about post modernism or roar inch layer most important rule is model
your life as a as a language speaking a higher thought having social primate on a solitary sea creature that lives at the bottom of the ocean and never has any contact with any other creatures other than to attack so over to my might be like ballew commands a young men
mo had the person responsible you is like stared up straight clean your room walk on two feet and put on human close
pets are optional
oh just put on a shirt and were heart
do you professions that you will never dreamed of air flying a plane
richard scare is believed her own represents the warrants are your hundred brain's reward to be or that lives in an overt he drives a being your parents to bridge party food
yeah so look out for twelve rules for living in her heard the yard with mickey mickey mouse because you're goofy i should i guess now i should finally introduced our guess thing in this week it's jake bacharach back again three time champion
know shit return ticket bacharach author writer pittsburgh native true free as a share i have now been on the show as many times as the pens have won the stanley cup that feels like it can't be a coincidence
oh that's that's how we have sets off everything is lining just right
see that so there is this thing that was going around twitter this week and it was basically this it's not an academic paper because there hasn't been peer reviewed or anything and it's came up with his publisher and this woman who is an economist is associated with the brookings institution so right there
that's enough red flags to dismiss whatever she has to say a while and nominal interest but basically like what was shared was the abstract of her paper which was about the use of next alone in confronting the crisis in america an overdose deaths from heroin and fence and all things like that next alone is it's like
it's like a nasal spray that you can use to revive someone who is overdosed from an opiate yeah yeah and the poppy at the brand name is mark and nor can slay
it's become increasingly in places like scenic western pennsylvania where where i'm from where the heroin in new epidemic has gotten
increasingly serious and deadly this
you know every police officer and paramedic now and you know from the city of pittsburgh it's more municipalities and carries the stuff and it's it's very effective
reviving people who would otherwise likely perish from an overdose when i was under the impression that someone overdosed on heroin you that a giant needle of adrenaline
and stab them in the heart with it all that this is the relentless march of progress
we have disrupted the be like
direct arterial adrenaline shot man
they can't memory may pulp fiction because i will not be nearly as harrowing a sequence just putting us nasal spray and somebody knows well you know this by itself wouldn't have been a noteworthy but the reason that this sort of semi viral and people are talking about it and sharing it was that in the abstract of this paper that wish the woman who wrote it share
she seemed to imply or she's just outright stated that the like there's a moral hazard effect here at work with the
the now of the proliferation of using new york and to treat heroin overdoses and she seemed to me he implied the moral hazard was nor can allows junkies to continue living after an overdose and continuing doing drugs will you be more risky and yes yes yes i meant which is the
basic moral have any moral hazard argument right but of course the paper i read the paper
the data
backing it up wasn't available isn't isn't yet public presumably it will be made so if the paper is submitted to peer review and actually published in a journal somewhere there are there are a number of figures that seem to possibly show some correlation between basically stay
eddie levels of mortality among users and the use of this of this drug this or or or antidote so to speak
there's the causation that is
insinuated throughout the thing there's just there's just no evidence to support it and ultimately at the end of the day when is it true that people who don't die from using intravenous drugs will potentially continue to use them in may at some future point i yes but you've still i mean it's also true that somebody who
is successfully has their cancer treated into remission is going to die of cancer
the the
a political argument that's being made here is really basically saying you know these people are drug users who commit crimes and we're creating a perverse incentive by saving the lives here it's like this get out of jail free card for being a heroin addict basically now now you know if you have this you don't like there's a you can save yourself from
someone you know from having oh right
and then there's the story
this is you put you hit me do this because the paper begins with a story from your neck of the woods said i was hoping you could hear ya
so this is like this is a totally
an apocryphal story
it was reported in in local media and it was basically the idea that that
road users are now
throwing nor can parties
where everybody gets together got kit gotcha little glass in bag everybody cooks himself up definitely a bigger don't know that they should take because
getting because overdosing is it feels great
let let me tell you as cynical outline or yeah yeah
exactly there's there's a cultural precedent for it so so they do this and then there
they all the revive each other
and needless to say this is totally preposterous there is there is no evidence that this is a common practice i compared it to back during one of the teen sex panics
the the old rumor about rainbow part know
we're all like queens like go into a room and suck a dick with different yeah rainbow lipstick
start thinking about the mechanics of it and you're like how the fuck would that work
it's the same but different color of six and they all kiss the same
yeah they would have moved their lives
don't know how like dicks
it wouldn't be like times i am pleased
yeah
sharing a ball
in any case the whole the whole paper is
what you would expect to come out of the brookings institute
a a sort of like when late pitched level counter intuitive contrary an argument that basically says that something which is an obvious moral good that which is saving people's lives when they would otherwise die is in fact complicated a it's also what are you this is bad
i mean they also love it because it is sort of american liberalism is of
there's like a little bit of a high tory element were any social welfare has this sort of paternalism to it and that's what all the apps and means testing or about their about well you know let's just see if you can get your act together to get this and this is this is the highest expression of that going well you know if we just bring you back to life where are you going to do it again
and just for all the like these are the same people are like you guys we need to raise awareness of mental illness and addiction whatever that they love the logic song words the suicide hotline but they don't actually believe that no one really actually does with that but they especially because if you really like thought this was the public health crisis would your answer be like a parent who
it's their kids screen time because they got a d well and you know one of the other points that the paper makes is it says the resources that are being expended on york and our could otherwise be expended getting people into treatment programs first of all there's there's no evidence that
that much money is being spent on this stuff in the first place and second of all treatment is deeply ineffective so you gotta save people's lives well that's the thing i mean frankly there's a lot of things about this that sort of on their face
wrong one of them is that a lot of these additions or fenton overdoses and they're saying well if you revive people who overdose of northern more likely to take that know but it's getting cut in and people don't know it's not seeking it out necessarily so your whole idea but even if was true even if you could put the numbers on a letter that said this definitively increases over all negative things
overall no amount of crime or whatever overall risky behavior you're you're still arguing that people first responders who would have the ability if they had dark and to save a life are instead supposed to watch someone die that that would be a better thing for them to do and that act is
more corrosive to the idea of social obligation and social connection of any kind than any negative cause by actually any negativity caused by by reviving people with market and that is the real idea behind this shit and that is why megan mcardle predictably grab this thing and immediately wrote a fucking article
who we can we can tell people to let let their fucking fellow citizens die in front of their eyes this is a perfect way to continue the steady march towards total neoliberal subject where you have no obligation to anybody else but yourself and that is the real and point of these sort of who he contrary
slate pitches social studies i think that her
anyone is the opiates any type of editor all they should be loaded into an airplane and if to jump out naked
i have to jump into circle and find a gun and maybe pants
and there's a storm and circling that we create with darpa weather machine and they lose one point of health the harbor way every time there in the harper machine they lose one point and there can only one left in the one guy left gets the narco but you know what to be totally seriously though how
that is in fact a comic exaggeration of like do territory so how how far a step is it from saying we should just let these people expire on on their like vomit soaked mattress while while the paramedics like take sell fees to hang around to just saying you know
just empower the police to extra judicially assassinate anybody who's using drugs
this is my sister's the terror take as planned
less appealing and everybody
god's plan that's a new thing that i'm going to want to kill myself
i cannot hear it from two weeks until there's a not all guess what i'm going to get like ten more things for my fortnight
and you can't go anywhere with anybody
whatever the ballet i thought of going to be it a fucking van with him
right hours in a car
we'll get ready because they say i have a lot of top donald's always have my my sister's boyfriend is an f t a y m s
probably shouldn't say is don't want to get him in trouble but he saves people from oh dang the and he he is tony that speak of dark and he has responded to multiple like o d calls in which like it's just someone like fallen out in an alleyway and the police got their first now
be the year now all carry nor can with them which is like i said is like a nasal spray and he said he has seen multiple instances in which cops who just literally sprayed it on their face
and it's just like he just like mace or something they just makes the with an arcana they're still lying and in l a concert
that's like it was like the famous pepper spray cop out like a berkeley oh yeah
he was putting round up on
love imagine just stupid you know cop loading big of new york and into his gun and shooting occurred
fucking moron
it's almost like they can only relate to citizens as people to be subjected to the violence so sorry you need to stay still ok okay stop global seeing ivor coded my broad sword with nor can
do you like the highlands
show me either movie i thought was kind of gay going to punch you in european guys weren't skirts but wall now than the future wear pants pretty cool
the way they can only be wanted to you that
but all i know we all know that sort of paranoid folk idea that you shouldn't mark
yourself as an organ donor on your license because then the empty will rise by drives are you off and busted open like opinion
and of course we all know we have an intuitive understanding that that's absurd because that's their job is to save lives but if you tell these guys yeah you just watch them die then they're probably going to search his property open and taken out your fucking kidneys because you broke in that fucking obligation between people because a child told you to markers and organ donor because she gave me brain
god's plan
fuck
well actually
god's plan
move on from home nor can appeal it crisis well
briefly odds
checking in on the president chicken and how's he doing what role
our little party
just two things first
earlier this week
trump said
tell everybody going to meet with kim jong un face to face first time ever the american president and the leader of the world
you know god's plan
like what are what i've read that i was like holy shit like this isn't a huge deal like yours
face to face meeting between the president united states and the leader of north korea i think it's great because like so i'm a game and my boyfriend and i have pretty much the same body type and we are able to share the same wardrobe and i think that trial
and i absolutely darling oh my god they cut out there that they've also changed switched
oh god oh my god you're cut donald trump
yeah but the ball yeah they both have kind of way
for cubes yeah yeah
i it for men
before we get north korea they could read off a really good joke i saw the how to from ah
my favorite comedian my inspiration my kid and it's miller
wow trove just announced the north korea's will be held at story daniels his apartment
went there he went hill
oh
now i'm i i like the moto reaction to the deeply arcade
like this are really work of cannot handle
the john birch society
basically she
imagine the the worst like tea tea party like
like anti john kerry propaganda that's basically rachel mad our now about donald trump
like he just doesn't have the guts to just like stand out it because i am
here's what happened
apparently
south korean official who is meeting trump at the white house told trump that mr kim would like to meet with you
delaying that message from north korea south korea and official trump interpreted that apparently to mean that this is the first time this has ever happened he's asking for me
personally because he knows i'm the deal guy and i can get deals done and he was just like yes let's do it
make it happen and then of course he had to walk back for about a day there were i was singing about this happening i was like wouldn't it be like the best troll ever if donald trump actually peacefully ended the korean war by meeting with
because of course they're saying oh no now you can't this is what they've been asking for years and years and years if they meet with the us president it it's it's like to legitimize them and i'm like who cares
is the alternative nuclear war
that's the weirdest sort of like centrist liberal to sort of like neo conservative line which is that like this
going to this is going to legitimize their government
that government hereditary monarchy that has been taken place
last half century boys and a half century it's legit it's bad right
there's lots of bad stuff about any trouble for
my father jacob
the say
dougie i voted
or
but seriously it's like you can have objections to like the way that the north korean state is organized but the one you can you would get wrong that the one thing that you can say is that the is that it's an illegitimate government
the saudi monarchy is naturally yeah then then the kim dynasty or is a legitimate government they will they love they love this
usually legitimize the was and things like you think that they're just going to break up it's like a bandit got together on craig's list if they're like well it's been been a few decades
no one's the junior ministers got a pack it up onto the next thing well to be fair to the lives i think that the legitimate fear at least than their mine is bigger than the same room together
his adult painted senile man
i'll be tainted with fire
kim is a is a man in his prime with with at least average intelligence and those two men and a room from was probably going to get rocked somehow
somehow it's north going to win the negotiations but so what if they do what do they want that would be a disaster for us or anybody i mean realistically i mean they're not going to take over and of south korea but what we give them some more food aid or so but who gives a shit we've made the deal with lifetime
the my wonderful friends in the democratic people's republic of korea they will be executing graydon carter
we now we now have a formal statement
from the leaders of the d p r k the republic of korea and president g my great friend admitting that i could have had guilty and eighty two
yeah i want you okay trump that's going to come out of the room he is going to disavow olympus has fallen
that that movie was racist
his career
and that's going to be that i mean okay so they lose if trip loses negotiations or whatever that is vastly superior to them continuing to not talk and continuing the tweet brinksmanship and kill trump decides to send dog the bounty hunter to pyongyang
came with the fucking crossbow and ignite world were fucking three seats i've seen this guy gordon ramsay do so many great things you have that starvation problem over there general manager told me about he's going to do your whole country unfortunately president came to the kitchen nightmares
chef ramsay has been equipped with thirty to thirty five fight and hybrids and three battalions of us marines and he will be bringing the london gastro pub experience to you
i don't think it's going to happen
true
gives south korea
it's evident unify the entire korean peninsula under a theory and in return
winter is for the dogs
look i just learned a lot about how they do with people who betray you
now i don't think it's going to happen because they already walked it there are other are they doing the same thing that they've pushed it to have we're not going to negotiate until you are until you basically agree to our terms which isn't negotiation and probably that i honestly kind of think that that it probably started off as just trump
it because yeah they've been making this offer some clinton and they've all said no and they just did it again because trump has an ego maniacal moron he said sure
i honestly think it's to make them more reasonable to keep like chinese underside side i don't think so i mean sure you'd love to get him in a room because he is going least you want to eat him i mean she has talk to him and if there's any contact between me and him he's like do you do not know if you tell this guy that his tie looks good he will fucking decide that you're the greatest
leader of china's vegas and it's easy
it's like all i got to do was throw him a parade and if there's one thing they can do and it's not a fucking break a million people making his face
there a all like placard are objects a giant
just death to see
that idly somerset
the gap and saying this out it nine eleven and they did two things which is projected stupid fat head on a hotel and then just like funneling money through funneling money through lobbying groups and this trump trump associated law firm to pay off which like we said his imagination and so small if you give him like fifty thousand dollars
like i've changed my mind you didn't do nine eleven so what little old is north korea have to do know by jerry's building the triple six hour drive
no i ran into a giant here
everything is coming of shared now we knew work for you me we love you
cnn an article today there was like silently jared is cleaning up the swap
i thought
it's like from one of the people they made in the lab with toby layer
like blonde conservative twenty somethings and it's like that has to be like double a minor leagues of be a conservative young bonded is like you get jared be the journey because not even mega people like jared yeah he has a constituency of vodka
besides i looked at facebook page called jared kushner fans
the biggest one i found had nine one hundred likes nine hundred one after church by
yeah but i either already the other mad goons or in his ears
preconditions and it won't be mad
you probably won't just fine but if it does hoo boy especially after after they kick out h r path and stuff yeah
alton and yeah
because like
barry holy terror of i only scary the only thing saving us from the like the queen drag heads of bolted and haley just the neo cons of moment i is that trunk thinks bolton looks like shit yeah i was like part that she doesn't like the mustache think
but then gorka had that he that's cool go to power is alpha seagal david clarke gorka it's a power ring or oh yeah yeah my thighs your speech reminded trouble like a bear caught a was
oh that's how i might take a little by the middle that's the best part no one tells you put it back in the box make charity
with facial hair is it's euro is rolling the dice if you present yourself a facial hair a trump because he has very complicated feelings about because he clearly grow any of his own because of hormone deficiency which also why isn't the red sox and then he gets weird feeling for some reason that that circular thing he finds calf some profit
i think like a regular must she just feels in someplace he feels the inferiority of himself that he can't grow it out as i said was never ever speaking of our president having sex this is the or rubbing his penis
penis against the woman's belly button because he saw it on soft core cinemax said
yeah i went to third base with her yes i wrote the small back
the for news or the week is the persistence of the story your story which i had one we forgot already really late but it it it's sticking around because it it seems like strawberry really has the could smoke this this enormous got receipts yeah and
not so much about what was great the sweet but god trumps and lawyer michael cole and show
he's such a great like mid season addition you know where this guy he's hey he is that your fargo character
well i need the thing that i've always liked so trump the thing about him is he has like all the upper middle class attendance that a rich guy has like that like he has his doctor he is lorries his accountant but the thing about trump is he never pays any one so he has to find like the shitty weird type of person who will just accept no money and be able to
make his get is not by living off the rift and trump world so his doctor is like that guy the guy with a weird long hair or his account it is probably going looks like brent spine or an independent
he has his account is account is probably like a drinking bourbon advocates that his lawyers michael called his lawyers a guy who appears in one episode of justified tries to buy a bunch of obviously for that's what
well as he says is like now just because i support our have dropped does not mean operate nearly shot and
events in truck not paying any one was the incredible the one hundred and fifty grand that they apparently they paid stormy the animals in hush money right before the election was it michael cohen to get a mortgage or his house or some time actually
that's a story daniels out of his own pocket
apparently still hasn't paid him for this
sorry sorry about that michael pick up her next dinner okay remind me to get used for that i can't work van baron won't show militarily to arrange this michael cohen
sent the emails from the trunk campaign he knew and apparently three daniels attorney
says michael cohen
was not even license to practice law in california where this arbitration to place for me
their claim now and court is that he didn't even sign it the right yeah but if it was drawn up by a guy wasn't licenses would even be valid
there's multiple levels
the document anyone can drop a legally valid document you don't have to be an attorney before the are somewhere to to drop a contract between two parties long as everybody signs off on them but i i'm not sure if i mean an arbitration is cause i legal proceeding i'm not i'm not sure it probably depends on state law weather
or not you can conduct an arbitration hearing
if you are not license to practice law and while i think trump things just being jewish
they're everywhere the bar mitzvah
all that you're passing the bar bar mitzvah they give you your license and you go practice law i mean to be fair as you could probably tell from the comment that i just made that's actually true
as we do believe ourselves out of it
the upshot of all this is that get yourself ready to see his dick
the she's gonna do this is all a prelude to her selling a bunch of shit that she claims to have and she said so far has been proven to twenty eight april first ever presidential nudes i well it's like no one of those creatures that lives on the sea floor and just eats the like little bits of whale
that filtered down for thousands of feet of clay that thing that angler fish is tangle out of their mouth catch the other one i can't wait for the reaction before it's like first you're going to gain entry or if ryan will president
do parents issues but has penis length of three point eight inches and a shape that it as a corkscrew is quite don't
and then like all the manga people are going to change their display names like deplorable mag a micro penis
how would a tiny pick is alpha as shit yeah you will give a shit about the pitches pleasure image or balls look bigger
no according my wife loves my clock
as as if the lab is like the black swan to wide school to have a swans exact
by by the way i'm actually a double life
this is actually a perfect segue we're talking
mustang club like creatures floating and tanks
the ancient of genetic destiny and bug once i'm talking about dune
i have a theory that actually there's there's a sort of narrative jared
connection because i was just thinking about like jared jared going to meet with with like the qatar is to get like the most precious substance that he needs to continue to run his empire so it's like palm what the even like sovereign wealth fund is the spice
jared successfully bribes a zoning commission or for the first time he goes to the father the sleepers
who is a gurney halleck the jared
oh that's a good question
doesn't have one i think that
he has no retainer he has no a false sort of warrior troubadour i've always gotten
is the hooker that his dad high as traffic
cafe to say that is straight out as powers in three there no woman born child has ever called this many times jewish sleep wake
many many have tried to sell six six six park avenue they have tried and
six six six park avenue it was created to train the
the killing word is you know who bike dad
yeah up
we knew you were coming on so we had to make some time to talk dude
for for give us listeners if you're not as and books as we are well i was june bananas international in canada
has influenced the lot of chapa there's been quite a few references throughout jake got me into doing and
we just it's it's a love the all share so if you're not familiar with the books or even the david lynch movie or later sci fi many the ministers
starring in the second one the one that they made about about the children of dune starring young james mcavoy who later went on to play the young charles xavier
he got his where he got it's like that had our
but i agenda for anyone who isn't familiar with the dune can in the frank herbert verse
could you describe roughly what do you mean is why it's economical of suffered know or yeah yeah said
dune was written in the in the sixties in that sort of the sort of like
early ferment of like the ecological imagination and the time when people are like getting interested in mysticism and you know it's like eastern mysticism
the various oriental isms that go along with that and frank herbert who actually knew quite a bit about environmentalism it was really interested in it wrote this
this epic science fiction novel
set in a sort of like measurably distant future tens of thousands of years hence when there is a sort of cause i futile
galactic empire
rule nominally by a powerful emperor but largely controlled by immensely wealthy families who who sort of own hold planets and the planet dune which is officially called rackets is this desert planet
controlled by a sort of villainous family called the har conan family
and then the noble a trading his family from another planet are are basically given it as a thief by the emperor and this is immensely important because doing is the only place in the universe that this
really kind of a mcgovern this magical substance called the space is produced it's the spice is just literally the comb of gigantic were yes yes although at the beginning of the book nobody actually knows that i'm not sure where it comes from they personally offer it later you need the space to fold space for it to make internal
lactic travel possible which is the undergrowth into the whole galactic empire depends on it but it's also a really tight for him loose and yeah
it it permits all sorts of kind of like semi superhuman abilities so you know there's this mystical thought society of women the been a jazz or it who are sort of like a a sisterhood like based on based on nuns are kind of medical order something and traveling pants yes
a sister hood of the travelling like his jobs actually a way to sort of described in the in the in the novel
they're sort of power brokers behind the scenes and they have various mental and physical abilities
it in thousand certain people who have the right genetic background with limited ability to see the future and that's basically the story so they a noble family takes over the planet from the evil family though it's all really a sort of double crochet yeah they're they're setting up a treaty to fail they are eventually ran
invaded by the evil family with the backing of the empire the father was killed the mother and son flee into the desert take up with a group of wild bedouin like nomads called the freshmen and at that point the son of the treaties family paul
discovers his late and prescient abilities become the leader of the freshman and ultimately conquerors the empire becomes the galactic messiah thick yeah it's away and then subsequent volumes which god describing the plots we'd be like all week but then the subsequent volumes follow the story of him in
his descendants on for like thousands of years and become
incredibly weird as frank herbert gets older and more interested in writing about his ideas about sex though
everything anytime sci fi author talks about their ideas about sex it's fine
find their the most normally normal sexual guys in the world or thousand i don't want to get into it too far away from the original up from the original book and story but there is there was an amazing scene in one of the later novels is duncan idaho climbing climbing scenic were or one of the characters a character from the first novel named duncan idaho
are great at names i don't get on could save a whole
he is he some handsome compatriots are trying to kill the god emperor who has the descendant of of the original paul more deemed and so in order to do so he has to climb are really high cliff so he does this and these two women who are his compatriots and fellow rebels are watching him do it
and the one of them
as as he crests the top she experiences such sexual attraction to him for this physical feet that she has unmitigated orgasm while standing there watching a guy climb up iraq
yo yo bitch so i'm inclined to kill the emperor is you were granted
silva has to play duncan either in the new had been yeah if you haven't seen the original david lynch movie you'll be seeing the new dentist villeneuve wave
the movie or movies he said he's making tool you really think they're going to let it make to i hope so i don't even know
is the first ones not has to be do better than literally every other movies ever made some good luck
he hasn't really made a successful know he has said the thing about do know is that when you when you read it as an adolescent you know you you identify with the park character you know he he is the sort of special person with special ability is that like every adolescent henry hire you will check
wants to be and he has this amazing abilities and it's all great and his family are noble and their retainer deck and are servants love them and the other family is this evil her and family run by a fat fe homosexual village so fat that he can't even walk he's carried around with like anti gravity devices
i've been out by it he has to buy two seats and spaceship
so so they're the sort of epitome of evil and the and the atrocities family pulse family are the epitome of good until you start to think about the way that this universe is set up when you realize that the entire universe is being described as like a brutal eugenic aristocracy in which the person who is the hero of the book is himself
the product of like a ten thousand year long human breeding programme manipulated behind the scene and it's joy division
and so then the whole way that the sort of
morality of this of this universe is is constructed begins to like really care
the to like pieces of fiction from around i was like twelve when i was sixteen link the two things i enjoyed the formative adult who the formative move into adulthood was realizing that tony soprano you should want to be like him and that paul is like a bad guy
well i think this is cool but the dune books actually like as you get further into the series isn't it becomes way more complicated that like paul becoming this global messiah figure is actually not so good
like galactic hitler
guy he is he's galactic hitler in fact that one point and even even muses allowed you he's talking to he has these memories that go back in time
he is talking about these past dictators and naming them many names hitler and he killed you know he was only able to kill twelve million people and like has his lawyer on retainer who's standing beside him says well you know nothing compared to your accomplishments the lord think of the hundreds of billions that you've exterminated on all the plan
not very good then his son takes a bunch of the spice turns himself into a symbiotic with the sand worm transform always be of all transforms over thousands of years into a giant worm god there are actually speaking again speaking of sex and are like multiple times where he explains to
that he no longer has a penis
like unbeaten is like i no longer have a human genitals
end of the second book paul is blinded and that sort of like castration metaphor as well yes yes and and then forced to walk out into the desert yeah i'm really annoyed because i've only read the first when these are all spoilers and fucking furious now i'm not going to be than either
i read those the to he totally got along yes car right now
not a fan i remember her own thought this june messiah children of dune got a book on tape or read by jordan peter
matt i understand if you don't like that
bring my ex box in the car and i'm going to put the chat on speaker so you can be michael like all the hudson's as talking to each other about god's plan
they will it
god's plan could have been the alternate title
it is this like the question for paul is like weather like it's just like he does he have any choice whatsoever in starting this in jihad or whatever it takes over the entire universe does he have any control over it
is it says it will happen anyway i will happen it'll happen
because once you take the spicy begins to have this like consciousness and more for linear time and past present and future sort of collapse into one theory a plane and the future has already happened essentially so there's hundreds of billions of people there already there are already dead has no
you might as well throw out an arcana
the have throwing spice parties
hands and boxes
no i know going to talk about aware it's like a sexual thing that the boxes of the web so pall mall make you make your fingers do a combo hit her
it has played the box okay so at the at the very beginning of the novel
paul's mother is supposed to have a girl and she is going to be bred with another royal family and they're going to produce the prophesied messiah but because his mom loves his dad she's like i have to give them a son
so make of that what you will so she has a son and the sisterhood who the been a jazz or at who have been kind of orchestrating this are fucking pissed but they're like still good genetic material so we were going to we got to make sure that this kid is okay we've got a test them to make sure that he truly
has the ability of a person of a station so they bring a box a dark scary box and they force this kid who's sixteen at the time this boy and they're like you have to put your hand in the dark box and don't remove it or else will kill you with this poison needle so he sticks his hand into the dark forbidding box
and suffers excruciating pain from which he for which he bears the scars for the rest of his life and i have to believe just knowing frank herbert and as attitudes towards sex and women that there was something going on
i think that fictional
paul put your hand in the box as eyeballs that's brain
so in the book became like it was kind of like a because of the time it came out it was although it was written much later obviously then
lord of the rings it kind of along with lord of the rings was sort of like taken up by hippies
and became like this real part of the like sort of like sixties counterculture and the thing is although it's actually it's a it's an interesting science fiction book it has some interesting ideas and it's like the way that it thinks about ecology the way that it uses this like this fictional substances like a metaphor for like carbon extreme
action all of those things are interesting but frank herbert can't write a fucking sentenced to save his life and one of the important things when you're like when you're creating a fictional universe that that talking for all of his faults was good at and herbert was not is like coming up with interesting names and languages for things and the best that herbert could do was basically like give
goofy fucking names and occasionally like throw in some borrow word from arab yeah and that was about it
and it makes the read like especially when you go back to it as an adult really yeah because that's the thing i didn't read it as a kid nerd shit as cool as job as a sport worth reading all the jock authors like derek
i don't regret
so i literally just reddit a year ago because these guys kept talking about they're going to get the fuck and references and yes the pros is absolutely brutal well here's the thing hurtful frank your perfect and herbert was a newspaperman by trade you using a newspaper
journalists and i think it's like a gift to curse when it comes to writing these blokes because i like the way he reports on and constructs this universe is like i think very credible and sort of like interesting like the details of it but his language is terrible
history x three desert race breaks down
read all about it i know what it's like it's written like what it's like an article in the atlantic
like a like a like a ten thousand word you know like here's a story about this place
in goa or whatever and it's like you know and it's root for the the western audience it's the it goes through like all of those kind of like long form like journalism ticks where they like established the setting and who are these people are what are the different factions are and the dialogue all sounds just like in one of those long form articles it's like the sounds like a rica
creation of like of the words that people actually use that has the sort of like still fitness to it so you can definitely tell that he came from a background will journalists say fi and fantasy or kind of like nineties rap because they love taking normal words in just replacing every see with a k
like fire spelled with a y instead of and high that's how you know your fantasy psi or kappa donna album
but for i guess for me like doing is kind of like my other my favorite series of anything metal gear solid because with metal gear solid like a lot of that dialogue is clunky because the first or japanese and then it's brought over and que jima is an insane person who just watched a bunch of movies but the
building is so interesting and the can't like the concepts are so unlike so many other things in the genre that i don't care you know doing is one of those things where it's kind of like
oh you don't how people like anything that's like sapphire fantasy
wikipedia articles are like written by people who know a little intimate details like everything about the world like it's the truth talking to like if you really want to just like learn about the world building of the dune series without like the excruciating necessity of the first book i think is quite readable i would recommend people read it the ones that follow you got to be really
dedicated the read
oh man that's a slog getting children to the general part of our
tough while it's because they're basically just hiding and like nothing now hands have been case of my like some tigers to the desert or some shit
so i wouldn't want to wrap things up talking about dune is so jacob he talked about how it was sort of adopted by the hippie counter culture in the sixties sort of like lord of the rings now like in the twenty first century
of the rings has become kind of like right when door like tread can pop culture yeah i live on that gates of vienna
yeah all that stuff when they all want to be habits you know like that's their ideal like come tyranny
you got internal community
you guys had china me on here there's a great i forget the title of the article but he he wrote a really great sort of like both admiration and take down of i'm talking that's definitely worth looking up especially coming from him as a as a fantasy writer i my dad he loved of the rings and easily well you know the homes are clearly jews and
other the smartest and coolest and breathe and i'm like are you sure
i'm pretty sure the jews are the ones that they dig out of my i thought
i don't worry their focus token shit i read george r r martin because they fuck that's all comes down to nobody and token a sex everybody is fucking
the song of ice and fire so that's clearly superior work and that's the one i actually read george r r martin strikes me as a sex nerd all totally okay so who is he goes on in my life
terrifying my question is like what you know where it is due slot in like the twenty first century the fact that we're wrapping it so hard i remember
early on in the run of the show one of one of our biggest fans who shall not be named by me right now
use the facts that felix had a screenshot for the david lynch movie is like avatar to as evidence that felix bieber layer is hilarious g hottest is a hilarious nato running dog fashion because herbert is larry of hitler in fashion
everything is yeah all all and to all entertainment is is fat i mean it's not not fashion but like will know what it is pretty fast
hitler hitler in is just man is the worst or me
boyd way you know what it what does what is due to offer us in today's today's i think do i think dune slots in very well with the with the in the sort of like oh right area i mean they don't care about the environment and herbert cared about the environment but you can sort of ignore that stuff
it's all it's all part of the world building but like the central plot line that runs through dune is about of like these sort of like you generally excellent people in racial destiny
out about racial destiny and about and about the sort of like innate characteristics of certain groups and races of people and you know like so the idea that like the freshman you know who are i don't know how you feel about them because they're clearly arab but like you know they they have all of these like very particular and like rationalized characteristics but
even though herbert sort of describes them in some ways as like
he describes him as a certain phenotype they have these certain characteristics and lots of they're all like that and i think so i think that that and the fact that this universe is clearly constructed as a sort of futile universe in which everyone knows their place and people sort of like place at birth is destiny
slots in really really well with a lot of ideas that are my kind of like you find bouncing around on the sort of like alton far right and also the idea that it is it's it's us right it's the far future
first human diaspora doing this yeah the idea that we can go back to those sort of raise it higher while in fact there actually in the later in the later books there even a point where the the the atrocities character that of ruling family who comes to rule you know the whole human universe they actually a trade is is apparently
a corruption of atria the house of a tree us from falling at the bloggers a blocker
no from
frank herbert even predicted
really
so in the book i mean then this goes back to the
the whole like rome athens jerusalem thing it's like they literally the ruling family traces their roots all the way back to the sort of like bronze age rulers of ancient greek sick
twenty three and me must have gotten really fucking good in the far future because that's a lot of generation father the puck all his clinic this row
just it to wrap things up with i was going to be clear here that for us and anyone listening to the show
if you enjoy any work of art or like fiction in particular that doesn't conform exactly one hundred percent with your current political beliefs and postures you can't enjoy it and you should get rid of it you should read it and did you forget about it the delete this episode dune is bad the dune is perfect but
you can't watch it because it doesn't the you're like the perfect ideology so here are the things you can enjoy that fit the correct ideology as of march the tenth reports of march tenth four o seven pm eastern standard time the last boy scout with bruce was amazing the glimmer man with them
sick all white chicks with other ways brothers don't be a menace
south central also wins and then finally we got the classic reign over me
i
wow that was great i love talking do
but let's talk a stock david brooks about that
there's something i love more than going a whole week avoiding every fucking person linking to a fucking david brooks thing coming in to do this guy their show and having to listen to this fucking human avatar of the turtle that you were supposed to draw to get into art school
i'm afraid you whine about the liberal college students and why why it's actually intimidated by his younger wife so yeah and again he's talking about you know liberal student mobs campus activism
and the reading series this week which is understanding student lobbyists by david brooks modest lobbyists
i can't wait until the only remnant of of colleges are are just a few shacks on the few remaining human settlements and fucking oil tankers fucking refugee camps and these guys are whining that bill too rude to the fucking instructors
it was running into their instructors so good to david brooks here he's rates students across the country continue to attack and shut down speakers at a steady pace from this one fucking got them thing
this guys are freaking out about a fucking script in summers there is a five second fine
i was getting booed from two weeks ago that she then she gave the speech after that she was attacked she was killed separate fuck
up
sorry because you know how some of his dad she was killed
plays in pleasant epic based mom murdered by no scope head shot
this he says
ip larry summers and killed him in nineteen ninety nine at oberlin college when me and some other people yell at a little bit when he tried to make a speech which he made anyway
thank god these people were kids
traumatic thing that they saw the thing that read the world was we are we are all getting shot by jack ruby on national television and the now in their damage it's christina hoff sommers getting yelled at jesus
fucking christ was he goes goes here
like this he goes to shut down speakers at a steady face from christina hoff summers to jordan peterson like that from to the shortest distance
the same person
like there is no difference in their beliefs they're like the exact same figure he goes i confess that i find their behavior awful my gut reaction
my gut reaction is that the student modest managed to combine snowflake fragility and lynch mob irrational is enough and snowflake the fragile about every fucking op ed writer on earth having a collective nervous breakdown for a solid month
about one person being rudely spoken to a college campus will the christina hoff sommers figure or the jordan peterson's or bench shapiro's or whatever of course are just stand in for david brooks and really what they really don't like and what they're so horrified by is the idea of kids just being like doing the jerk off oh shit every time they open their mouth
like that or or the digital equivalent of that which is twitter so he goes they have combined this fragility a lynch mob irrational isn't into a perfectly poisonous cocktail
but empathy is the essential character trait for our moment
guy who is never felt everything in his life but i guess so i thought it might be good as the moment with empathy what i thought it might be a good discipline to try to see things from the students perspective to not just condemned recycle analyze them but to try to understand where they're coming okay
i'm my favorite now my view or my own do not reflect reflectors of my employer but i do work in higher education and you know when when an older man is trying to into it his way into how the young codes are thinking particularly when it's an older man like david brooks who married someone who
barely out of being a fucking coed than like there's something else going on
let me let me let me just do this just do this experiment
professor of virtue studies with is shining bald peyton and manly classes and knowledge of classical literature he's a fucking sexual dynamo god
i just really need to have a pillow fight right now i just i just want to pass my top open for him because he is not losing t a drastic rate every moment
he's a virile man god
i would begin my stab at understand
just sit on my couch now with we all have a talk about the stabbing stabbing
can i just haven't via acknowledging that i grew up in one era and they grew up in another okay now i came of age in the nineteen eighties in that time
this some shaw
i'm not sure if i believe that
when it is like is is grinder profile he's got his age listed as like twenty nine and
like ninety seven
time
distant past of the nineteen eighties there was an assumption that though the roots of human society we're deep in tribalism over the past three thousand years we have developed a system of liberal democracy that gloriously transcended it they put reason compassion and they can't provide has three thousand years have not been a unit intellectual history
from from from tribalism from like living in hunter gatherer bands to like
question time british parliament like it
history moves in fits and starts and in different cycles and there have been all sorts of different experiments and government and social organization like there's a whole history as crack we must in with
the three thousand years of culminated with america and the nineteen hey to his which transcended violence in brute force and put reason and compassion
yeah the nineteen eighties were definitely the most compassionate time in american english we talked about this last week every fuckin movie was hey how are we just have a guy covered and baby oil murder five hundred for us
because there was also an assumption that while we might disagree on the means we all wanted basically the same us to tattoo game so
you didn't get a to mine managua harbor
for example contravention of you and law for example though america was plagued by economic divides we all wanted a society in which social mobility and equal opportunity where the rule
though america is plagued by racism we all wanted more integration and less big and we all wanted a place where tally that the people who are fleeing fleeing to white flight suburbs and instituting a fuck a draconian racially determined to drug war wanted integration
isn't that what we wanted was a place where talents in character mattered more than skin color and prejudice we want to we all are the guy who has the one line from the fucking martin luther king's three as the entirety of their social conscience and ideas
has given those assumptions sophisticated people in those days wanted to be seen to use scott alexander term as mistake the arrests
this is reduced goes it goes it goes for the rat like the rest of this described a different scene
six theorists and what he calls conflict theorists
i might read this shit because it's already too much is that it stands out where he's like i'm going to attempt to understand what the people yelling at christina hoff summers are just booing her with they really feel even know they repel me and i think they're awful i'm going to try to discipline myself with empathy so rather than actually like talking is any the any
one who doesn't like hoff summers are jordan if peterson or bench shapiro he's like i'm just instead of going to talk about a bunch of ridiculous jargon a about mistake the okay i have not read this thing because i try to avoid this like an asshole
but just from what you're saying
tell me if i'm wrong
these two ideas are the people who are opposed to us politically are mistaken
or they are resolve openly opposed to us are those the to what does he wouldn't the kindness kindness as mistake the mistake theorists are people who who believe that progress and human achievement happens largely by mistake and compromise an accident and just like oh i have a vial for
of democracy and i have a i have a beaker for capitalism and i knock them over they fucking hit each other when the fun says a steak theorists believe the world is complicated and most of our troubles are caused by error and incompetence not by malice yeah ok okay yeah and problems are caused by mistakes in all what the same thing some people goof
you have a holocaust
you send a few crates of machine guns to know rapists and in central america this bill so he says in the conflict theorist world view most public problems are caused not by errors complexity but by malice and depression the powerful few keep of else down the we all have caused by different material interests
different groups of people have have have different interests based on their material circumstances you know i'm i'm sure that there are other that there are complicating factors but that's at the root of different people are trying to get a piece of the pie class fares so they aren't they are in conflict with each other in a society that still has
scarcity
there remains scarcity of resources in our society and so people have to figure out how to apportion it and unless you a portion at equally to everybody
system of rationing then and through room central planning then then people are going to be in conflict and that's what it is you know i'm skipping to the end here he goes if i could talk to the students david talks your wife she could fill you in here i try to persuade them that mistake theory is a more accurate and
effective way to change the world than conflict theory but i probably wouldn't persuaded so i just asked them to take two courses the first would be and revolutions the french russian chinese doesn't interest all of the other ones that there is no such a course the level to be cherished memories wasn't a hardship revolutions corn on the smell
there will be setting the french russian and chinese and american revolution because those are all those are all singular erupted historical events with no context or connection to other historical occurrences which you have to understand in order to understand the revolution we're just going to start at the at the moment the sa
sans clothes fucking storm the bass bastille and we're gonna we're going to end the terror and were and then we're going to move onto the next revolution will yeah so that we can teach people the revolutions are bad yeah he doesn't he doesn't have the american revolution in here he just says the french russian and chinese and all other ones that unleashed the passion of the mob in an effort to overthrow oppression
and the way they all wound up waist deep in blood
like the things that they revolted against like there were about ankle deep and boy
they got up to their way through high it all got bad that's what happens you know we start getting serious about oppression and injustice
the idea that the people doing it to us are bad and not just mistaken but meanwhile the students on college campuses are not revolutionaries i mean a few may have pretensions of it but most most politically active college students in these let's be honest largely elite institutions that we're talking at all because like you know go to like
big state school and things are very different
but
these people are like these kids are interested in controlling the intellectual life of the community in which they live and they are opposed to certain people with objectionable views in their own minds cut coming and and propagandize in for them on their campuses and
all of these people have outside platforms anyway but the idea that students are like our or a step away from the terror
or from like or from like i don't know enforcing the a ukrainian famine unlike the entire center of the united like the entire mid west is preposterous so what does this argument even have to do with what's actually happening on certain campuses or the other point is that like like this christina
last summers thing is a perfect example of it because the like
well funded right wing student groups invite these figures like friendship hero or peterson or whoever to come give a speech
the full knowledge that they want people to protest it and then people protesters or and will blue or heckle and then they can have their video clip that they can share and then they'll go on and give the speech anyway so i mean i think it's another example of like i don't want these fucking like griffin is using the university that i'm a part of to hawk their idiotic
see both worlds see here's the other thing too is that like part of this is also and brooks is like an avatar of this part of this is a weird
american culture of like difference and pull it has to to power and to people in positions of power and while there's the you know
i certainly am not going to praise like british politics or british public discourse which is a fucking cesspool at the same time like if you watch like the british parliament where people actually do harass and harangue and blue and yellow at the prime minister or like think about like the british tradition of like public speech and debate it's like there's there's a culture there of impolite
it's ok to happen
a shit who fucking cares
they need them to do it that's the other part of this
pro wrestling they their barnstorming these campuses it's just like when when the heel shows up and says this town full of you guys state like are you know
isn't that doing that on purpose
he'll shows up and says your apartment smells like
either point that i think was a good one that was general buoy actually made it this week where he was like he put it out that we're now pretty much a generation removed from the first round of like campus pc panic which went on in the nineties and culminated with a little film called pc you pc
classic know that pin and have
the first ball that
the moral those moral panics the exact same content and tone and subject matter of the things going on now you know the idea that this campus
nazis or like language police saying we're all going to be so politically correct and and it's like that was narrow twenty years ago all those people who came up in this cultural revolution and no graduated and guess what gone off to continue in maintaining and running are rotten economy and races society so what do you fucking afraid of
the same thing is going to happen with these kids flood know i honestly do think that it's like a fucking it's like it's like wrestling it's a barnstorming rustling circuit where the fuck kids are the are the audience throw and shit into the ring and the speakers of the heels and the fuck and shapes and brooks is dumb ass
run around with their backs turned while guys you live in a steel chair and it's all just part of a thing they all need each other it's also not all of them of them have a job or thing to watch on a friday night if they're not all they're doing that
