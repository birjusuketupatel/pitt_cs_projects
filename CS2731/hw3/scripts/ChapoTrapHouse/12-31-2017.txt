another i was going to say a boiler suit because that's not the type of sooty makes pretty easy
he so spend spend spend your hangover journeying back with us to the year that was through the lens of chopper
what what what do we got on this playlist this best of highlight reel well hey everybody it's me it's chris i've been insinuated into the pie gas before but i think this is my first official like introduction not use the cousin oliver of shepherd her happiness replaced
a classic character gone out for various reasons he was actually not say his name you not say is i want i want i want to wanna
no you're not he is dead
the nameless one who is also of course in the room right now i thought that the physical presence will be a good handshake but yes i put out a call on various media's social and otherwise to see what fans would enjoy hearing from this kind of thing and obviously the first thing that i her back was don't do this thing all you will hurt
was slow moving and winking yeah
re
the the various sounds of farm animals just crowding my years but we did have some broad consensus is the favorite bits and i'll just list he's offering them
the noise bit was
confront the noise
this is an aside but did you know that the noise campaign ended because he has seen guys named noise and kill don't
yeah it up a truck and he took hostages at an atlanta area dominoes because he thought the noise was about him and he actually one of the pizzas and then he killed himself
for the flip the fuck that's why don't we don't care for that
people always like when nine eleven happened you know
now this reflect on islam but no one says anything for the annoyed
she's not accountable i think that never should have got away well he must be avoided if the
then it would it would be kind of funny though if they brought the noise back and then found out that he was
i've got super league of faster food spokesman pedophile this latest like that it leeway to second domino's pizza domino's pizza ceo apologize that they're like crust it was a little bit cardboard he has the subway
ever apologize over there i covered as we talked about earlier they covered that shit up
they're covered up allegations that fogle hoover photos and it's like
you know you just like father and opus day the guy he never officially apologized for vocals
what is are doable i'm sort of the government frame burger
resorted to barack obama was jealous of vocals careers moods way in had is crooked justice department laura and i say an essay
an essay for surveillance at reveal that fogle was going to endorse drop yeah they needed to liquid a neutral only will was going to speak at sea pack and i wonder if there were people in the country and never watch the news so had no idea that fogle was arrested but like watch you know all the commercials and saw him and all these commercials and then he
then he disappeared and there was no explanation and just got to do you like it
there was a hokey nerd and now is not on t v anymore and there was no no resolution to that club yeah i don't get any better yet again
was my by jake david chase that's how the noise people felt because the noise was just off tv when i get really invested in the no era to someone in corporate was like whoa whoa wait hear me out here we don't have to retire the noise will do a thirty minute special a healing special hosted by the noise called gonna come to the know
no he no longer to be avoided
guys i didn't know
i didn't know
i think about best gas yeah adulthood and look like
i'm gas lighting myself here because now i just feel even though i don't have no evidence of it happening i feel eight donald trump and sodium did the know
a job as some specific grief that the kids that annoyed that even in general
i didn't know treated me very badly for many years
will always mentally
i want to get a pizza
where they got its name from
by the sudden
the dead dead
i talked to general kill you he said that it was a fictional t v
kids you care to a signature drone strike against the noise
imagine i don't want to hating are sure
could anyone listening to this shit mean like them
power and grow
power
yeah democratic
after that
oh issue
that toy it's about the door was originally about folk in
during races
marginalizing the noise the real every the real n word as the know
draped over it
supporters have been invisible eyes
go
the oil it out the noise was not there are nine eleven or the world trade center
want to talk with him
this room and nine eleven
what a stupid show
i don't know how i don't know how to actually show ever going to are the actual reading series in the top that noise
the point was that
in this conversation

we should wrap it up a reshuffling how i'm going to probably about fifty yeah political analysis
yeah got oil
no i am a discussion about what office furniture we're going to get these days
that's what i really did more political stuff yeah i like the noise bed and i think it belongs on the best of because i think it's it's a good primer for people who were like maybe you want to introduce to the they're like it's the school political talk show you that it's like political they they speak so like you know the left about socialists
and our times or and then also just sort of lake
long forgotten tv advertise not as gods out of a little the shows you know we're not scared of getting a little controversial as sure so we're going to call out the noise
you buddy my table stop ruining my pizza
favorite part of that a bit is how in the middle of a you all say that this this show right here in this moment
the threat to standard liberal yeah because that's the same episode where we talked about our peter dial personally called us out and said that he unlike other liberals recognized the danger that you post as and later that day we spent twenty minutes talking about the noise
fifteen
i'll never forgive you for that by the way they were great minutes their goal
like tears in the rain as as all these bits are
she's on a dominance
coming up in the top five felix's black mirror risk
yeah it was is it was really weird and i didn't think that anyone would find out who it was that she would have been treating about me but i guess while she was seeing their angry she was dragging me for for the
hi sweetie is on mind this is definitely the most boring episode of black mirror
actually it's probably not
actually had a hand held what what if your phone knew your name
if all of you or of you and your computer had the same birthday
or or to what if what if your mate was a t v
what to have to plug you'd you'd dog into law charge
what do what if what if instead of someone saying all how was your day they said what did you download

can we said way for that potentially that that be in future
to two hours
so good that surgeons professional comedian has decided
they wouldn't got
without attribution i don't give a shit already made
yeah i had a funny and modern were felix was in the audience slide okay i already it's already out there but the bit
yeah so going a little bit into my thought process
your we're going to lock the gates give us the behind the scenes of your process
like say you guys have saga thrall
muhammad ali you know comedy is with dealing with the world
and take things like racism donald trump phobia capitalism
communism all the ideologies are take what's wrong with all of them
and i sort of synthesizers into this thing where people could swallow the truth so thank you through my thought process of this one i was like what the show black near was thirteen percent charity or
accurate estimation as a like from this that the description of this bid on the bonus episode what if your mum was a mobile
perhaps funnier than any of the actual riffs coming up next is mats a higgins impression on t you don't think i saw that says called on me let me tell you lie and i'll do the access
like what is his job
congress may in the house you house what he used to be one of those fucking few it started out the first generation of cats
to start small town caps writing letters yeah don't want to get famous he was the absolute right
letters ungrateful celebrities and now is clicking conyers gorge
he's literally in a gas chamber right now
self i saw that gets activated
keep those hearts go and seven
about twenty minutes
then
and enslave loom our keep that camera still his his cage and accent is incredibly to strength
you
you choose to be good at it is you get you some tuna salad
now no
these jews and have no toilets

did it did use it fifteen minutes

certification sailed punishment
if you're it's just his giant egg like head just dominating the frame is he saw only tells you about the man's inhumanity to man that he just learn about this
every year in europe
call for help
yeah because stop
world's a smaller place now in a world war two it's not
status more accessible
no era like this
our to walk away from
gas chambers and ovens
without a sober
need for mister pip
commitment unwavering commitment
you is just didn't word
it people got a raw deal
the how great it will be when trump it's the can
slide show notice there was still
the show
i got it
hell yeah that was ah representative good shit
primo levi say that no marks or book made who will for free older day
while osha has to be stopped
the last image was like the last it resist still have just his his bowed head covered in a cowboy had with his arms out with his police uniform unleashing uniform on super impose american and israeli flag
adolf hitler
remember when clay hagens ran for congress first because he was a joy or pio wanna be who did the crime stoppers videos that got him fired because he would just rate up moonbeam like local criminal
and the celebrity thing but before that you'll be interested to know he's not even really a fucking cop he was a used car salesman just like
so cobb dollar he became a cop there some fucking like steven seagal
then he like had jobs in the fucking police and now he's still a legal law enforcement agent in lafayette louisiana
oh the places he pleases lake
mcdonald's employees and citizens arrest yeah give them in france yeah he's that guy you posted this on facebook thing a couple months ago just literally just calling for the genocide of muslims he's one of the worst people align all that after you have to the same muscles real still genocide
elsa and this is like this is a good view into his apocalyptic mindset that the muslims are coming because we have opened borders and they're going to set up death camps for their your they're building the right now
every mosque is that that's why they ever curve top that's how they store all the cyanide gas i would say this guy is know setting himself up for a fox news career but you know he's probably going to be in the senate and a few years
as a three and sure if jon benet beat him to to be the first cat
higgins a louisiana politician who wins our and i doubt
show people that you get some jewels or you put them together with germans on the east l front a well while to mon ami you got some out
some common
another great one rounding up the end of the year actually is felix on you liberalism and cutesy apps
i have a little theory about why bernie's old this actually helps because people are hundred clinton honestly that was last year revised people of your one good and that's literally it the reason that people like bernie and like corbin so much is because this stage of neo liberalism is just it's a daycare everything has been
right fucking pastel colors when you look at ads for shit you look at ads on the train it's on rob and like apps that help you do we live in a garish time yes all the ads are all the ads like you are a little good good boy you deserve it
today we're like them
the ground
and when you when you when you call when you call like your fucking when you call your fucking life is garbage have a sand dune
ugh
and when you call your fucking garbage monopoly a telecom company is your shit doesn't work you get like a little in fantasizing jingle they paid played a tyrannical fat children to calm them down like to do to try to get to you and everything everything is a nurse everything's worse your money buys less half your fucking income is going to read you
the baby all these apps do basic things where you because you have no time any more
where it because your life because you because your boy i found or even say i yeah yeah
fiddler hydration fucking after nine hundred water because your boss now is like you principal they could call you at any time to get you in trouble for anything school never ends and you when you're on the phone with your principal you're on the phone with a fucking in fantasizing customer service or just everything in this world
seems like a daycare you want an adult to break through and yell at somebody and that's bernie that's your fucking angry grandfather who at least respects you to tell you how things are and that's corbin and i think that why people have an emotional a little bit of white people who have an emotional connection to them now i'm serious
so you know part of my creative process is
you know once a while take the train and listen to my favorite tunes and not listening to my favorite rappers are
ross hobson
you know instead of them blowing my mind i'm thinking more i to to her to do with these guys do and so i look at ads on the train and i try to write a rap song like hobson and i fail and angrily call my mom on the phone and ask her why she didn't turn to foster musical talents with him because i wanted to be enough
emotional rapper and then i throw my phone on to the train tracks and then i remember we have to record and then a have the only the only non true thing about that is that he would not be on a subway
take the train twice yesterday
lads on the subway now for of
ladies underwear that you can just months waiting
and that means we're really close to having underwear for men that you can just piss
those that are fucking depend though they're called it's called adult adult undergarment nowadays
pants trust me i'm not old enough now types or not that's a totally different thing i'm talking underwear that's form fitting and stylish that you can just go hog wild in and we have the technology obviously you on mars is making it he's hoarding it for you see i think that would require some sort of matter real
beijing ability that we've demonstrated that we're doing it the ultimate goal of eon stacked knowledgeable innovations is just free pissing forever that would be good yeah i would let him be lord god emperor of the world like it just a giant floating head
some sort of machinery
i'll just czars are all just like exactly and we're all just like blood boys who must like render unto him blood and oregon's for him to live forever if i got to piss of my pants without it causing a problem our going to convenient we're going to move on
because he's in the room again will not say his name but the traders great it
yeah that from his pennsylvania campaign
chapel blondes
host mocking cold open
oh yeah it's really funny when someone you think was your friend
everybody it's brendan
so look we had a pretty good show lined up here this week it was actually really good we had
barack obama on the show
but unfortunately felix spilled a great knee high on my laptop and we lost this one so we're in a tight spot
everyone's busy and they can't record today
but luckily i have been producing this show for a pretty long time and by now i can basically you know act out everyone's stick almost by by rote so
what i'm going to try to do is basically fill in for the gang here i've got other mike's set up where they usually sit and i'm just going to
channel them and
yeah i think this is doable
okay
hello friends it's chopper
it's this week's chopper
chopper let's go it's me will monitor your host the main one and with me
felix be vermin
reminds me of soda
when you leave your protein powder
the german then you're playing in the soil off ism
crispin
i'm so mad
gar i can't stern prestige tv art is all the tv have to be so good bullshit
also joining us is amber
oh i found a bad on the subway i'm going to take it home even though it's covered in radio and virtual texas
yes you know i'm getting hungry can we can can we call the crown fried chicken in newark that's the one i like i won't eat any other food oh now now my tummy hurts so i don't want any food never mind now i have to go to sleep oh so this week
we've got some news and a reading series and it's all here on on chapel i'll try to talk directly into the mike even know i usually forget and and brendan has to do even more work keeping the levels balance sometimes taking him up to two hours just to add one episode
oh there's the theme song and other thing brand it has to do good let's let's make sure none under fan art includes him by the way he doesn't deserve to be represented
he's not technically flapping his gums on the air every second of every show every single
i've been on well so yeah stay tuned for trap oh cap has
look i love the line okay great and that's another thing i guess brennan's going to have sex good another thing for brennan
no doubt it if i had known people were in like it that much i would have liked planted out more of it is literally a last minute decision that i had no no insight and hours going to do it but it was fun it was fun to do it and yeah i did get a little let out there was a little bit pissed off
it does take upwards of three hours ten down
well
this will my lens on do a little more broad discussion about the year
the another a big big fan favorite was the risk on
trump brain state around them people oh yeah
this is true speaking of his son in law he goes you know what i don't even think apartments here's why nobody did anything wrong look at jared everybody and we do appreciate your editorial but everybody said jared kushner carries a very private person he doesn't get out i mean maybe it's good or maybe it's bad what do i do but at least people know how
i feel carrots this really nice smart guy who'd love to see peace in the middle east in israel okay
again it just like
the wheels just keep spinning just me it's bad maybe that's what what does they had to see to that
he is he is a president of deals and we all know that that's the makeup of as has his dna i think that every moment if you actually this is a little theoretical but if you were to zoom into his brain every moment is a deal and he is negotiating with like his own brain
birds and he's like i really like you see what will can give me they get
local milk people
here and can't get any better
better sense than that looking people that's not too good i don't think that's going to somebody that
not everybody i know it has come know people say it or else that's it i'm out
i can negotiate of his old bray that was the original order the deal is like look over on the flintstones israel everyone has the martian that tells them
he has a pretty smart guy but nine times out of ten a trick and
that's what he thinks jury it is
it sees as are
although had be afraid
geared committing usury caveman time
it's a living
betty go go go
not going to terry back though calculator
i end up like steak is stores is writing an open letter
guys guys
i want to take this chance to ask you guys like just looking back on the year in total we've now
lived suffered
thrived to survive survived and thrived in weird persisted states under the rule of of hair trump
how do we feel about him is a personality a characters like what what to make of this looming figure over us after a year well first of all i think of him as a leader yeah i think like for all the jokes make like
he knows he's doing the best he can which is actually pretty good like he's starting to figure it out i says defeated brought her back
taxes cut stock market booming yeah
i mean this is back christmas you can now legally say christmas again
the guy has done everything he promised there was a giant glistening wall
the mexican border it's got casinos in there there was a fuck him all you can eat two thousand and four hour buffet it's it's amazing
yeah you can see all the way through it so no one could throw a big brick of drugs over the top of it in the head
now he rules he is exactly as stupid as we thought he'd be but somehow more he's able to surprise is able to introduce new stupid things all the time he taps himself on a regular basis which i didn't think he'd be able to
i've been pretty impressed frankly i think i think he said something like this game at my impression of the first year of trumps presidency is it like he just keeps coming up with quotes and like still images like math you said that if you were to have sent back in time to any human being would have caused them to just like yeah
this is an actual this is the future
like your brain where they would have immediately passed out or die or committed soon as you know and they had to send for that far back
yeah i know one year two years i'll say two years because he was he was already well in a position where thinking he could be president was realistic but if you set back three years just any picture of him
in the rose garden leaving it film as a boxy joseph a bag suit do with the double thumbs up with the fuck and a hat on that said usa on it and just like with the giant fucking tie going down to his his knees
anyone would think this is not reality this is absurdity your chin send to drive me insane but it's our everyday truth now and
continue to think we should know that are keen on earth
a twenty four hour
we'll win a game will be a ninety year old god emperor her where his body has dissolved into fucking chicken gelatin but his plane will still be alive and it will be connected directly to the twitter
server so the he will be able to instantaneously issue all of his proclamations on twitter and a real and a lot to follow them
it'll be is it was a frightening specter about a year ago the notion that he would pursue this staunch white nationalists agenda and we've obviously seen fractures in society and increase in violence in society violent racial hatred the empowerment of just wretched
dogs in the border patrol in customs anyone with a badge frankly is in power to crack heads down and that is what what we always really was the worst of it but in terms of what he's done as president
things have gotten a lot better since the deep state took control and the global us said you know we're going to need a steady hand on the wheel here and they just put them down in front of daytime talk show television and they've been john kelly
real cheap
a ball president now he's pretty fine job bang up job i think but ultimately when i see tromp i don't feel this immediate revulsion that the liberals feel because he's such an obvious senile clock own idiots
it is completely feckless president but i do feel just the most violent revulsion what i see paul ryan and mitch mcconnell virtually any public in congressmen fucking god that's really nice
these are the actual monsters and coastline what virgil said for me it's the guys like ben ass like i see ben sas up and yeah i'm doing his like you know i'm i'm reasonable thing or went on the nice guy that turns my stomach anything more than more because like i was so good about this i was thinking about how well
i would see george w bush on tv i would get a not my stomach
a visceral hatred wouldn't take over me throughout his entire province here
and that doesn't happen with trump as no matter what he says because it's so transparent because he's so obviously a puppet because he's so obviously his brain as the he his ears because his existence is such a perfect distillation of america's cultural and political trends that he seems perfect
to be there and i like the fact that is there in a way i like the fact that this destruction of america this final dismantling of america and
poet peace has been sold off of the highest bidder is happening under trump it makes sense
politicians who put on a fuckin smile and act like politics is still a thing act like there should be a political k fade the idea that we should act like there's a public interest that we're all working towards that lie is much more nauseating than any just like would trump goes up with steve school is who got shot
the awful fucking policies these guys are trying to put out and he's like you know that's one way to lose weight
it is like rodney dangerfield president and there's only so much hatred you can have for that were as a guy like school east you're like why the fuck couldn't that bullet have to spend like a little bit higher
i really feel visceral hate when i see like john kelly or nikki haley the people pushing like the same neo con bullshit like the thing that this missile the same thing that like during the primaries all these fucking hucksters like max boot were like this guy can't win because
then then we will send money to the
hitler barbershop quartet in ukraine and like of course we're doing all that like day we just started selling weapons to ukraine which is great and we're doing all the evil shit we were doing under obama but more because his foundation for defense of democracies bullshit but when i see them and when they do their little things like haley saying like oh i think trumps accuses deserve their day
in court and people praise them it's like now fuck you you fucking road and you're getting up
do you think donald trump is a rapist because you're getting up there and you're pushing your fucking neo con le could nick bullshit line where you get to go in the land and talk about other singling out israel and talk about how we need to get rid of the assad and now we need to send weapons ukraine and give them ninety two every fucking sexually repressed dip shit from london who goes
anywhere in the middle east at the behest of the saudis you want to do that while also having your cake and eat too and saying the donald trump's a reference or purse and fuck you you worse than him because at least he has fucking dementia you're just a fucking hyper ambitious road and creature you know what i hope they all go to jail for fucking rush shit i don't give a shit about any of that but i hope they all go
gee i hope nikki haley as to do interviews of fucking basile in their dog about participants she fucking said at the un fuck all of them but especially fuck the ones who want to be who want everyone to look at how pain they are like little marco when he cried when they ask you to endorse drop and he didn't leave me to say a know he needed say fuck it
oh he said
i don't know and that he did you fucking did it because he a in all these people are fucking pussies and they'll all this is all they care about is their resume and they're fucking bullshit neo con ideology and their austerity politics and will degrade themselves anyway if trump asked to use in marco rubio is foods foot all know
is only condition for building a third temple or whatever fucking creepy shit that goes through sheldon adelson was he fucking do it and fuck all of them and their crocodile tears would put that rant in the best as twenty
right after
the violent the hateful and the he staggeringly ignorant narcissistic pronouncements from the president on his twitter feed
and it is identical to what a random mag teak shot at it in a facebook group called case the confederate flag to trigger the black lives matter thugs
it's identical to that kind of nonsense by somebody who just watches fox and friends which is just it's i mean i respect that more than somebody who watches the daily show to be fair but it's obviously just it means it's not just melting your brain it means your brain is already melted that you're at that space and it's obvious that the
president doesn't direct policy it's a totally unprecedented situation that the country is entirely governed by what is the mainstream ideology of the republican party which is naked greed and eight and islands yeah we should honestly called us like the fucking like i don't know the the coke regency
or something
all right i just want to run through a few more of these classic chap of funny is real quick and maybe we'll just do a second or two to toss into them
but i just want to get a special shout out to virgins
second round of the role playing games the tabletop game terrorists are moves yeah
your merrick lapland brand
you're in the mansion listening to doctor penny far they explain the tower your mindset when the visitor bell rings and your loyal portuguese butler hits the get to answer moments later you hear running footsteps the front door of the mansion burst
into the study dashes what appears to be some sort of vagabond he's about five eleven a pinch the skin and hair like an overgrown crude he's also quite glad to be a hobo
the cover its severe open wounds bruises he comes into which darling his gaze choking his head all around like a squirrel yes
manic korean on his face and wide they are alive he looks over frantically goes the bar the mark do you have the mark

oh yeah i'd just take a big gigantic fucking
amp fuel full of oh sweet mommy opium and injected right
order order know
you bring it up by you think maybe i could also
oh yeah i mean i'm just i'm not holding regime
i don't
what are my favorite bits from this year you have something i thought he laughed harder it that like was going on around the obviously bad news is a of gravity and troll and it was very hard for me to to credibly try to write a classic love craft insane character
and have that be a liberal because they've just been so sensible this entire time
it i mean i'm sorry if that stretched everyone's
ability to suspend their disbelief the notion that the hash tag resistance individuals
might actually not be all there
this one is
somewhat of a fan request but more of a personal request i really enjoyed mats dispatch from see the boss baby and also amber
requesting more information about the war the tolkien catalyst infants i am so fascinated by bass baby is so happy to know that there's not only going to be a sequel theatrically but there going to be a net flicks series about the boss me about about the world of corporate america infiltrating even seat right because
there's such as as show here
it opens such a can of worms in terms of what the world
baby lives in is like what what does the structure of us and i can't wait to see the future and how they fill in all those gaps and i will report back with all my findings from all future boss baby franchise endeavors for fun fact that is twenty billion dollars in debt
and there's a scene towards the end where the boss baby goes back to baby having succeeded and gets a huge party and they're spraying and with formula and honest to guy looks like a cocky
we were like look at each other like anybody who goes this movie unattended with a child deserves to be chemically castrated including both of us
then they go to when they're spending time in baby hard like i was just yelling basically under my breath
does he have a house does he go home
the restaurants and stuff
are there other baby is doing like manual labor and things are like is their boss baby city year they're about
because there isn't money yes i know how navy couples yeah either married babies so past baby you would recommend going to see a movie highly aggressive go just go in there is you will be occupied either by being viscerally upset by the really perfectly rendered digital baby asses
and when we walked out as like holy shit i'm glad we decided not to see the three d
and i just want to toss to have one more than many many people requested the baseball crank
a giant read animate opening
so yesterday
there is some argument i have no idea what the context was but it was a couple of superstars of of the web heavyweights heavy weights
big dollars
enjoy and read m s n b c pandit arguing with our our old friend the baseball crank our own your own
oh yes and
to me
scanning the conversation that people were laughing at it just read extremely like and a dialogue and i couldn't get it out of my head so there's something about the cadence of these two and like their statements to each other that sounds like it's been translated between two or three different language and then back again exactly and it was just and it's just kind of implied in in seoul is going
nowhere
caring for some big just imagine the the the action lines radio
and so is it really did seem like an a and i thought what if what if it wasn't and and there was a of a
i think it would go a little something like this

my name is joy and no one cares he was the baseball this guy's a superfluous
these guys
my own name on the web for seventeen years man
nixon dispensed with you get eggs those who did no such thing
you jumped into my mentions invited baseball show yourself out the same way you can made if you don't like the response
i prefer factual accuracy so i so disengage from what you were offerings
no
how can i miss you and i don't actually care that you were even here

say tentacles this is all
journalists that large i've heard there's a big school about tentacles
oh
it's another one of our combatants is enter the oh my god
i that you are doing is wrong
that you will not stop me from using all the birth control those mega do that
prepare to be destroyed i will eat them as humorously as the mice on the new wins
taste by rat by sanctimonious prayers go a baseball


one person on twitter i thought very delightful he said that he played well making breakfast for his toddler and now every time the toddler hears wills voice the toddler says go away baseball
there are of very it's very shallow kids it's happened next generation a coma we gotta start like a algorithm based j content generation mechanism that makes chapel content except it's all like baseball crank heads replacing with
gorka youtube video yeah because these kids are the ones who are going to shelter us and our old age and the after escape when we're running from cannibal gangs and we need a night
in front of a fire with with with some canned goods it's going to be these kids and remember us and take a sudden i think that was the last cold open that i wrote and edited and i was it was bittersweet was thinking a lot about the show and my time with it and i felt good but if you had told me
the than their infants and children would hear it and then start to build is there were old and memories from it i don't think i probably would have done it and i'd regret doing it and this is a public apology
the us hear something there
japan are sort of sad buzz in the air
that is tapping to get your cats
it sounded like a traitor

oh it's the scene
he's at the table
when he goes
i'm going to the ambassador

yeah
this is a little behind the scenes grew from a this is a highly requested bit of losing his shit about megan mcardle grin fall take so hard security had to be called on him from episode one eighteen all the political will and the world cannot conjure up enough sprinkler systems and sprinkler system installers to instantly transform money
asians housing

yeah
absolute
i think it's a good point because we can do it overnight we shouldn't do
okay
great
unless it's instant coffee i don't
up is that yet
all arms
byron
her think about what her annual salary of bloomberg is versus what would it cost to install a sprinkler system in that building that's enough
can and will more highly requested mad man on the rick and morty sash one sauce disaster from the patton oswalt episode episode one forty eight but when people found out that limit certain stores were going to have actual session sauce the bum rushed every
and there were two our lines all over the place a lot of the store said they didn't have it a lot of the stores they ran out immediately and so there were hundreds and thousands of insane only pissed off nerds screaming about how mcdonalds did not give them the session with sauce that they have been promised never get between and virgin in their condiments
people were fighting the police were called
a coward the mic on yes if they had more upper body strength that could have been a real threat that would be that is going to be a red october
i think it will be because this is a real revelation i had about this is that so you're young subject of late capitalism it doesn't work for you in any meaningful way your life is shit you have three or four awful part time jobs you have no health insurance you have half a million dollars in unsecured student loan debt will never pay you have no future
in any meaningful sense
all the avenues that you've been brought up to believe we're going to lead to prosperity and stability in your life gone but the one thing that capitalism promise every stupid shitty nostalgic or phone nostalgic indulgence you can have yours at your fingertips and eat my life is a fucking neoliberal hell but i can't even get a fucking
cup of sash want sauce yeah why the fuck am i still allowing the system to control me we should burn it to the fucking ground
oh right okay so we've done a lot of dupes in this clip show but i did want to highlight some of the more serious or insightful in and inspiring moments as will might say we've got the the sweets but we also got the veggies so here are some of the the more thinkers the the think he bits from this year
first a i think really a central moment this is tim thousand on health of justice from episode one twenty nine i'm just gonna do a series of these for years
what really more importantly
i think a federal thing i said before that i really want to touch on his lady at the federal single payer is a giant instrument for healthcare justice
oh and you can begin to realize this but a federal single payer beans that finally the federal government bears the costs of providing care like paying doctors and nurses and not providing care which is people getting sick in people dying and people are getting sicker from preventable conditions that somebody else should have cost
your insurer doesn't give a shit about you long term because either you will change plans are different and sure or you'll get old and go under medicare so they're actual like they care about keeping your costs down for as long as you are with them slightly know you to pay for it but they're not really like a positive actor who cares about your actual long term well being because
those costs aren't born by them because you become not their problem the federal government which is just a proxy for like society everybody around you does bear the costs of you getting sick long term so i think it's pretty reasonable to make them me that people that bear the costs of providing care in the first place like join those incentives together and so when that's the case you can begin doing things that you see it
this thing called be a social determinants of health which is like understanding what happens in the world to cause folks to get sick or then trying to address it
no the new york medicare medicaid happy birthday medicaid by the way is like a fucking under valued unsung hero in america it's really been tackling these things the new york medical director jason hello and what a big paper on the it's fucking dope do it if you have a federal single payer bears the cost of providing a not providing care then if part of your population is getting sick
and dying because the food they have access to is unhealthy and the food that is healthy is unaffordable because it's not fucking profitable to sell commodities healthy food where they live in so little of in the food desert than the federal government has an incentive to provide affordable subsidized or free healthy food
population because food is health care if their housing conditions
lack of affordable housing or lack of housing altogether are causing people to get sick and die because you die from exposure way faster than die of brain cancer than providing affordable or subsidized health care becomes a form housing when i was an income support
doesn't that open the door to this kind of nanny statism that the conservatives are constantly pretending to care about right now the government have an incentive to ban smoking or alcohol use right now we delegate these decisions to private entities who seek to make profit off of i would rather delegated to like the collection of people that make up government makeup society right
another good example right like a thing that isn't really addressed as that like if a person in your population is being assaulted or beaten or harass like at home or at work or by the police or by the domestic partner than providing like safe havens is a form of healthcare like all these things fall under the umbrella of health justice that's the actual thing we want to get to
single pair is the tool health justice is the goal and kind of along those lines but one thing i think hasn't been said not but people like me
is that like single payer is one like important process one important tool in the push for health justice but it is not alone things like repealing car several drug laws is a form of reaching for health justice right there is no reason that like one it prevents people from getting rehab if they needed are going to get tripping
if they needed and to you put a jillion people into prison that don't deserve to be there and that drives cost of a quality of life in an unhealthy if it comes down to
let's talk about like the housing look at like the fucking grenfell fire in london right obviously providing safe housing and mandating safety norms as a form of healthcare that as a movement that has like parallel like a partner in the fight for health justice and lastly like the hyde amendment right which prohibits federal money from being used on abortion repealing the
hyde amendment
is an extremely important part of the fight for health justice it is a parallel fight to the federal single payer program like there's this idea that you can only have one at a given time fuck off man i can walk and chew gum at the same time i can fight for repealing the hyde amendment and pushing for single payer the same
one is a bit many people mention from episode one thirty three
i will call a new liberalism will not see
and here's a it is the fucking lightweight it wasn't share blue people in our or fuck in da da vinci people or people waving hillary clinton signs that was in the streets actually fighting these fucking nazis and stand by the way standing up against racism and for the fucking rates that we do have and should have in this fucking country
against people whose explicit stated goal is to eradicate them there was the people were sending out and the people who that asshole drove his fucking car into was the i w w p s l people that have a yeah they were
course that black on black lives matter yeah all the like the whole span of the left leg left of us
yeah yeah but who was posting
that's the real cause who was roasting the the shoes that look like a fan that those nazis were wearing on twitter it was the resistance but like it
i support i mean like this to echo what our tea set on our show a few weeks ago like to sort of risk
to respond to the charge that like the left quote unquote is the one who wants to make common cause with racists or make a separate peace with fascism or whatever or like doesn't stand for like against racism
don't even respond to it like i know it's hauling but like you have to understand what these with these people are doing which is they have nothing they have nothing so just keep talking me they have nothing in terms of an argument or a coherent world you are a useful practice what they do is they are speaking on behalf of a
hedge i'm monique liberalism that is going to get us all fucking kill
you don't talk to them but because they're distraction from the real fucking problem which is that fascism arises because of the collapse of institutional legitimacy of liberal institutions that's our that's how we got fucking trump tower going to get what's coming next after him that's going to be even worse
because if you think there's not going to be more logical and economic catastrophe is in the future that liberalism is wholly unsuited to fucking deal with and that failure is not going to lead to fascism feeling that fucking whole you got another thing coming and that's what these guys are these guys who marched martian charlottesville these are the people
who aren't aware of the unspoken premise of this sort of zombie neo liberalism were living in which is that we're coming at a point where there's going to be ecological catastrophe and it's going to either require mass redistribution of the ill gotten gains
the first world or genocide and these are the first people who have basically said well that's the choice i choose genocide and they're getting everybody else ready intellectually and emotionally for why that's going to be okay when it happens why they're not really people when we're when we're putting all this money into more fucking was
balls and drones and bombs and guns to keep him away and so that we can watch them die with clear consciences it's going to be because we've been loaded with the ideology that these guys are now starting to express publicly on the other side of them you have people who are saying in full fucking voice know we have the resources to save everybody to give
everybody a fucking decent and worthwhile existence and dad is what we want and that is the fucking real difference between these two the you could tell that to the next asshole who tells you that there are actually two sides of the same coin
here's a little collection of virtual grants from episode one sixty four the deficit rag this is a collection of virgins take on the political responses and possibilities in response to the passing of the terrible terrible tax care bill and then after this we're going to be back into the record and material so you won't have to hear much more me
when you hear these call it too much beer civility listening to both sides been friends across the aisle you've implicitly accepted a right wing reactionary frame that says that politics is just about these petty grievances because a conservative frame who the conservatives enemies it's liberals point
headed college professors starbucks cops it's trivial shit so of course they could be lecture to reach across the aisle they could even do it because their grievances or asinine it has absolutely nothing to do with a day to day lives but a whore that democrats enemies is it wall street which hedges it's beds between both parties is an energy e o's every democrat elected in west virginia own
it's a rickety coal mine is it big pharma like joe mansions daughter is it recipients of big unearned inheritance is like all of their kids and all of their donors kids you can't have this frankenstein democratic party where we say okay we're we're we're going to have a huge like a powerful donor base but also left wing pa
critics it's impossible it's not going to exist it's just basically power through chicanery it goes to show why you can't resist
this right wing class warfare without in in in effective and monolithic working class party because the democratic party members of the democratic party elected officials who are just the same running birthday cake eating creeps as tom con are just always going to be widely reviled
bad as you pointed out of course these poor slobs who won't benefit from this bill whatsoever that it's going to get fucked by of course they should vote republican because republicans will still give them something they want they're going to trigger the lives looking at the polling in this bill the messaging against it was totally ineffective you had a massive number of people
undecided they don't know anything about this bill there was no coherent opposition message so people just who had an opinion about it just relied on their preexisting affiliations in grievances and as we saw online
the child's are all hoarding and winking for this bill because it it will trigger that hymns that's exactly why i don't give a shit children are not off limits to these ruling class sick goes we should be attacking meghan mccain we should be running ads showing that the fucking psychopath
trump sons not bear and me in that old meghan mccain chelsea clinton the cast of h b o's girls people who are widely reviled no matter who you are or where you stand society unless they're just an extreme partisan moron and just say the these are the people who benefit at your expense in society they're getting hundreds of
millions of dollars that they never fucking worked for whatever
so coming out of a whole series of more inspirational grants i just want to say what are we looking forward to in the coming years we've we've had a lot of despair but we've also had a lot of positive visions between
but your your cat
tim thousand what is there on your horizons
who were
get pay for if it sells well
please burgess the boat for brandon sake
the book me and twenty eight team i've had
i had a really good time writing the book i mean it was like obviously reading a book is hard but when you have you doing with your mates with your best buds sort of by committee
others like the best of chopper for me was just reading the book with you guys is here and i think people are really going to enjoy it when it comes out also now two thousand and eighteen
the democrats will win bag both houses of congress and at most one seat in the senate but still make a majority now
i am keeps ago or if he retires somebody else will take a fuckin
racist
one of the racist california raisins will be will speak or the house are going well it doesn't matter what happens in politics and twenty eight in or really ever actually looked up studies in for economics nothing that has ever have in politics is infected anyone's life other but what does affect people's life is content coming in
two thousand and eighteen
john voice it's finally coming i didn't give you authorization to do this when the taking all the critical long have you heard this is the rock and the commander from iraq this is my prison i had harris i'm ed harris and the the i see the ends with bio bio agents on them are fighting in the age limit
as my documentary about the cultural history
and present and identity then the may it's coming out in two thousand and eighty five fighting in his of loneliness is my favorite pusher immobile it's a whole it sounds cool descriptive of what it's about you just don't like you don't like anything that's about like you only like sports when it's a beers will
more on sport like football where hip hop divas disrespect the flag and the brave men and women who are protecting them and they're very games meanwhile in may
all the athletes respect the police and that's what my documentaries about
i look forward in two thousand eighty and although honestly it might have happened by the time you listening to robert
all are we fired by ronald donald trump and it'll be the funniest thing in history
i totally expect that comfortable npr listening volvo drivers across the country are going to for maoist urban guerrillas else like the sam be in nice liberation army
on that one
omar obama and half group
they will do the acts of terrorism across the country kidnap and execute figures in the national government and will be back it'll be basically like like mid seventy's italy it will be the day it will be the days of lead the years of latter common folks i love the strap the fuck it i love the idea of the bill marble
taking hostages and they give the police the demands and they're like none of these are demands just as new new rule
the helicopter and
sir we don't know how to respond to this is just as new rule if your baby cries on an airplane and you're in first class you have to move to coach
police negotiator new rule
i don't understand
i say twenty eighteen
it's probably going to be wow was going to be crazy when the encounter on excellent content from the chopper family and that we will continue to be the only funny political sets satirical pod cast in existence
oh yes and we will be our number one on the atlantic style fifty to recovered for you
you mother fucker said that situation is about to be kept fucking dangerous about acceptable michael barbara has been compromised do an unacceptable and
i'm just a few moments from this year
stand out to me in my head is a special from the show is when china will notice phyllis
very beautiful white cat that was special i enjoy aid adam friedland sort of reminiscing about his zionist summer camp and teenage years
thought that was interesting
here's our his hair raising encounter with the help
hash tag resistance broadcaster every atom appearance has been great
number of the favorite moments from the year were drawn from adam episodes there's a confluence of his appearance on the i guess you would happen is to nurture a child
zero eight him i would have happens when you let someone so anecdotes so here
spent more bug content and team
you know obviously repeated guess that are sort of chapel affiliates
t ricky rawls absolutely episodes of him and now his own show derek davis and derek davison just charities champagne sharks charity have and asia napoleon very proud of him
alex nichols low an option one of our best writers now for doing good work every every article from alex is is a must read for me
libby watson
doing great work for splinter right now
i just love i love to see the whole the whole chopper team shannon
a few times but
before i even came onto the show the way that ten thousand is able to talk about the essential illness of health care not just as real orchestrating the healthcare system but real orchestrating the entire system of providing for people in this country as a whole system of jail
as a whole was actually incredibly revel a tory for me personally and a real refraining from this entire debate that was just absolutely on present in any other thing so i gave us a lot of coverage of this year of the republican healthcare appeal plans and as well
well that a wonderful thing taking his show on the road going to say chapters beauty meetings all over the country in our deliver his methods message of health
in order to deliver his message of health justice
a trunk thing auto played on
also shut out i mean most of all shout out to all the charitable are celeb guess
of us let's just be is better than they're better than one hundred thousand people
by being famous they are at least twenty percent better than every other person on the i'd chosen for their better than or other friends and family all the celebs that were on the shit are my real family i'll be buried with you
thank you in particular thank you celebs i cannot wait sorry the flesh to where the flesh to be born in the new worlds where their flesh becomes mikey james dean dome in yes obviously a me and gorka was like gorka seriously girl was the political impression of the year and on any show no like sh
all that shit
no a dome in with cork yet
was the political comedy character of the year
you know that's a testament to genes as well
chuck
goal sung
the secret
the
understanding is quite wrong
some
winner winner
oh god
hi
yeah

i like the gorka thing so much because i feel like for a very long time
comedians would tell me about a domain like that he was really funny way i remember one trump vs bernie was running before going on t v like every really funny comedian i knew would just dog in these amazing term about a domain and then you know the first time we had him on like obviously he was amazing he did not just gordon like it was pre gorka it was all these impressions but
like because of gorka because it became such a big thing people are finally realizing how good look of james is judged to be pushed up because it was on a hack pushed up basically everyone did bush but if you watch it now even years later he is incredibly funny and that's like really challenging to do to actually make push funny after all that stuff leslie
i want to
just also what we're saying you don't means praises i want to shag out him as walt men on the dead authors pod cast his episode of that is legitimately my most funny pod gassed recommendation of all time oh wow okay

oh yes one last thing that you're all looking forward to in two thousand and eighteen is the great gaming debate between me and matt crispin to be held that brooklyn's bell house on january nineteenth tickets are still available
so when you say guys on were to twenty eight in and if you this
what do we always say this is the year where we fix all the problems
the only limitation
