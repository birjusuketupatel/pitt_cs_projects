
right
it's chopper
i'm gonna kick things off right away this week and were now
making a second appearance on the show
someone who i regard as the greatest humanitarian of our times a humble genius a dreamer and a beacon of hope for all of humanity
you on musk how are you doing good thank you it's so great to be on the show again to share my vision with you guys it's great to be with the chapel clan on
you know you're coming off an amazing week
captured the world's imagination and rescued all those children trapped in a cave in thailand because you to all a little bit about the it's a fantastic weekend you know it's a building on a lot of other fantastic greeks i haven't had a bad week since nineteen ninety and the political events that happened in that year
but you know
you know you go to forgive me because i'm i'm here we are on the ground and two kids and we're still working on the operation what we did together
with the royal government to thailand you no kidding the twelve soccer boys added a tunnel just really the kind of inspiration did i need for my space force and i was very inspired by the work of not only the young boys but also of the government to tell him we did it together we did it together in space x
and the long must could not have done what we did without some of the assistance of those people so i have to be generous in that sense
probably the most crucial elements of this rescue was the introduction of your personal child size submarines can you can you speak a little bit about the development of this been working on it we've been working on a few years different program to spacex one of a projects because it takes so long to get to mars we will working on deep
i pods so that we would be able to have children go between earth and mars if they have divorced parents you know like on an airline
and they'll be able to travel on their own you see and so we were working on that and we thought hey this is a perfect opportunity to reconfigure an existing projects and try to get some headlines and that's what we did and it was really fantastic the perfect child sized pods they work whether the biological organism is alive and nods and they just
perfect pre made for resulting their way through an underground tunnel or whether it's and get or whether it's in an undisclosed location where you will see me surface again so you on how do you respond to criticism i mean i mean it's shocking to me that i want to cut you off their it if i might will the way i respond to criticism is by being online all day
long arguing with people on twitter because let me say something i you know a socialist socialist that i'm also a socialist you know i'm a socialist who happens to believe in the power of the markets and extra political power for billionaires some people have said that your this rescue that you did of these children and again they wouldn't have
and rescued without your help
was just simply a publicity stunt to gain get some cheap eat for you in your company publicity stunt that sounds like that
sounds like something that warren buffett in his little troll boys would have put out the publicity stunt is when you have a very doughboy on tv getting poked in you go by pillsbury dough
he done his electrifying and elephant to prove that kind of electricity is not the right kind of electricity which by the way we're going to go on a tour of the united states and canada in the next couple of years and we are going to be electrifying some elephants just to prove actually that
this oldest city vision and tesla battery greed is perfectly operational so it's going to be a positive exercise in electrifying elephants know what we were doing is was saving children with saving children and we went down there
specifically asked by the king of thailand he said he learned i have no plan i don't know what to do and i was communicating with them every day we one face time
and they said you know you going to do this and i'm going to get on the ship this so we have we had we have a little submarines we also have bringing over
boring boring company large drill
in the good news is the boys are out and the thai government has been kind enough to give us the site
of the caves and we're going to use it as a proving ground for tesla for spacex for the company while going to put some more boys down there were unsure what i mean that's obviously down the line but she got engineered first and make sure it's safe and not safe so you know what to allow for
they're all going to be real boys but not before we put in a little boring company time we're going to widen it's just a little bit so you can just comfortably move tube have one child at a time through the tunnel and it's going to be perfectly horrifying attraction people are so impressed with this rescue there are reaching out to you
use your genius and your intellect to solve some of our societies other probably as a on it i see check
i've been seeing a lot of people ask you know on what can you do with your magnificent technology to make the people flint michigan have clean drinking water what do you planning for that so we're talking about the flint michigan and yes sure no problem i can get you drinking water what do you know what do you want do you wanted to be hard water do you want to be with you
want to drink it it's no problem at all the solution is gonna be done with nano computers a whistle we're working on that we're working on that we're working on biologically changing the people of michigan so they don't need the same amount of water
i'm working on installing solar panels in people's stem cells so that they can draw energy from the sun instead of from a hydrogen and oxygen molecules you know this is the stuff of
what were inspired by the work of isaac asimov were inspired by the work of robert heinlein you know were inspired by similar great political think as a south african a lot of other places and we were going to make humanity
lean they're not going to need as much stuff you understand how wow is all i have to say that i'm also working on a deodorant
be a deodorant called the fragrances called deal on musk it's going to go into your armpits and it's going to just buy a logically change your pheromones so the you smell like someone who belongs on more epic sir epic last question
i saw a story in the news today that you are one of the top donors to the republican congressional caucuses reelection funds yes sure is that the problem i'm socialism is socialist who believes in
the revolution of the proletariat through donations to the republicans
i'm playing a game of the holographic chest that you can't wrap your mind around i can wrap my mind around it but like i would expect a lot of a lot of painters on line will be upset by this are saying that it's some sort of hypocrisy on your part but i don't think they understand that you're giving them money
so that when the time comes for them to do right by you and the people of america you can threaten to withhold that money i care about is how they're going to treat the future of humanity and by that i mean how they're going to treat my companies that i'm hoping to make billions of dollars off of look i don't need to all sides i don't know republican i'm nonpartisan
and i donate to all sides i do yes we're working with the republican caucus to get them to support some very important libertarian issues
also donating to receive it
editor want to make sure that turkey
just a cleans out any political elements that get in the way of a massive spacex campus
we we don't have to all sides i'm working with the dutch royal family were working with the saudi royal family obviously we have connections now in thailand we're going to have a massive tunnel underneath bank that may drop it into the mantle of the earth but what will be replaced with will be magnificent
see the vision
but add to ask out sanguine in
the stars through glad
sometimes the route june with the stars
the quickest route causes a straight line between two points sometimes that line points directly through the center of our earth that is why do you must drill our way to the stars mr musk thank you so much cheaper your time
on behalf of those boys rescue from the cave i know they haven't done this to you personally yet so i will do it on their behalf thank you mr musk for saving or were monitoring with them with monitoring like the we we like what they did and so we're going to monitor them in probably kidnap them into an x men program some
time in the next ten years once they've a fully completed as adolescence
and yeah we're gonna we're gonna see if they can survive and those tunnels were going to shoot a minute test look at mars and see if they can survive that what a beautiful vision of the future mr musk thank you so much thank you hold on let me i gotta get into some my engineering right here if you don't mind pull his body out online



every one out of it
hopefully actor
it's like every generation
this
and then they all these other kids going to do
you know we're all going v c ads
for made out of nine eleven metal
but this one
but the daughters of course you can really cool twitch streamer she thought she may already yeah she's probably like is in phase and we just don't know it yeah she's not going to be one of these useless fail children of privilege she's going to be a twitch streamer
twitch streamers are the only self made people anymore
we have noted there the american dream
you know what that's one hundred percent accurate that's also i'm going to drown myself a toilet so
yeah so again thanks against you unmask for colon and and once again thank you for rescuing all those children they would have died without you
real quick
things started with a a story three
quickly one that's very much and are will house i know our fans love it so much when you talk about fast food franchises and defend the various perfectly disgraced spokespeople for said franchise and i can hear the squealing of the hug from here
papa john of papa john's pizza unfortunately has had to step down as head of the company and head pitchmen for his pizza franchise because apparently only conference call with shareholders they he no he said the bad at the n word the noise
smith in the house hopper that's our word so just just before we get into this week's show i would just like you're trying to have a good time some noise has
the difference between pizza guys
oh yeah i just want to make a pitch at the very beginning of the show for listeners of the show to buy papa john's pizza and then recorded videos of you throwing it in the trash setting it on fire shooting at like skied yeah yeah throwing it on the roof like breaking bad or just like
stock up on like a million of those little the garlic the word all into one big jug and then film yourself just pouring it into the gutter thing is you protest the this shit us he wants the hours to say it that's what he said
so that he was pressured
sometimes i feel that pressure
every day you guys are like know just that you're going to be the one who changes
if everything is that he said it because they were talking about bad pr related to the faces of different franchises and he was talking about and i think he probably is so mad that he had to get promoted for saying oh we're losing pizza share because of the mailing black eyes and he goes well you know
colonel sanders said the n word
that is a real person now
yeah i was always an amazing here it's not just norm macdonald
colonel sanders a fascinating figure he he killed a man
i got a few will he shattered
he killed one day he shot a guy in a in a dispute over over regular restaurants yes he had he had he had a roadside restaurant
and there was a guy who had one like down the road and they were headed whether this this is like the forties or something and he was messing with a sign and colonel sanders came out blue
i don't believe any of the final terms of north yorkshire the forties were also if you're like a like i have killed somebody
chicken shop and you could of
all right we're giving you the toughest sentence we give a white business owner and nineteen forty eight you hit a rock with a hammer for exactly have to wear this straight be out in like an asshole
he stand with a adorable kernels energy does to our money i'd what he was given away and actual military rank in kentucky does that
kentucky kernels is sort of learned that they give yeah it gave hundred s thompson one of it
johnny depp is a real
he isn't from kentucky is from indiana
and he eventually sold the his name and the franchise to what became yum brands but they kept them all as as like a guy who would do they would pay him to come and do little presentations at different like opening became so he has a real colonel sanders and he's wearing the white suit
he's waving and everybody but as he got older and kind of losing his marbles he would go in because they are so when he shot somebody right well though that was just business
he would just wander into kentucky fried chicken restaurants that he didn't own anymore and go in the back and just start by quality and control things like sticking his hand and i mean idea
i hear it hurts them and apparently the corporate world was just if he comes to your store and starts banging around the base in the kitchen just let them
do it and then when he leaves you can clean that's what america is great again when you get abused by elders there isn't an elder abuse
it's the saw i was how many people had their childhoods marred by go into a cave see interests in the senile
potato okay
just fill the colonel fans
dropping shows
you're you're at your table with your family and you got your pocket and sides or whenever he just comes viable exist
sit in the us whistles it around was he was the frank alley and oh kenny rogers
that's what it will sasso oh jerry lewis was burning this movie called the not which is just like one of the higher concept jerry lewis wizards leg or are the guy was kooky
also i said it was easy to be white and kill somebody back then it was so easy to make a movie back then because every movie cost twelve thousand dollars to make it he just had to go into whatever producer did the most way eludes that a be like what if a guy was sort of jewish but in a wacky way and i was jerry lewis his career but he was promoting
there was like a tie and it was when the first high promotions like a k of c and the not promotion
and there's his fame
infamous poster jerry lewis and the colonel jerry lewis was like whoa that not all this chaos say and colonel sanders looks like he wants to take out of fucking fleet lock apollo has such a
it's one of my favorite like how fucking pissed off kernels and really curious
oh my
well before we get you far again too fast food franchises and their disgrace to pitch and
let's let's start to show and will be introduced our guess for this week sitting in his actually feinberg
actually now if you fall ashley and social media and of course you do i wouldn't you
know that you are one of the you eat when it comes to documenting the social media
of the trunk family i think you are one of our finest reporters in that regard and i want to begin by talking about this photo of the trunk family that i saw this week and i literally can't stop thinking about we're going to make it up with the episode art so you'll know you'll know what i'm sorry there's actually two pictures of trunk that i can't stop thinking about this week but this first one i ah
honestly think belongs in like the museum of modern art or something
not museum
as i was going to show to you know i'm sure you sure you saw at the sweeper
yeah that's nice one
different ways the city this where i've had for
have
eric champs senior and junior all
pushing their bras like i mean the thing that's a sign is
think any of them men and tram actually have a man boobs felt like this stand it looks like they're exact as of as a dodger has an hourglass he's a very bluntly figures as to air it actually is that is that dungeon your pre across with the new there's a new picture on his his chest testing is deaf my purse cross
he doesn't know how to handle like new york yeah he was him when he was when you watch him work out he's working out like he's trying to injure himself on purpose so we can assume crossover that is what money
it's just injuring yourself
i was actually talking to someone who went to his cross which him and apparently he brings like his like twenty children with them like half the time and they just run rampant around the cross a gym like for some people take photos of them and like no one really says
like scared because there's a serious serious everywhere but it is a nightmare it's a safe place to place where they barely train people are properly lifting and dropping hundreds of he has
can i get home
that's what you know what i find so uncanny about that photo is that all for them
our standing in ways that are different have each have an individual standing technique there is just so uncanny and inhuman at the same like their arms or out in a weird it reminds me of like in hanna barbera cartoons when people in character would run but they will have their arms perfectly straight down there
looks like he like up player like a young age and like and covered super quickly but it's still like is like totally confident and like balance while
eric's normally better that photo is an anomaly for that yet
dawn senior which lake i always wondered about that if he knew he would be referred to as on senior name he he's he say they want and eight
one of the worst deals
he always stands like he always stands lake he has like this this for area but for thinking he's a minute or
that's actually a very easily just saudis
do you think you can get your mom is
no one has lose again
okay the next one
again just very sorry i can't stop thinking about this ever since i saw this is a form of it kinda sweet from trumps now sort of disastrous trip to the u k which i want to talk about that
i wouldn't have gone but this is a photo of trump sitting in winston churchill's chair and here as i was going to show that you again could you describe it
trump is doing a very classic winston churchill pose yes he has kept his pant legs which i've never seen and i've thought about that a lot of of the past few days at who who did he asked to do that because you can't and down that fire and how long did they cuffed how funny would be if he sees the new tuner someone i mean we asked as i see major yeah so
he is reclining in this old leather chair and he's sitting that way very far back and has his legs crossed and sort of a provocative pose and he has his hand
perched atop his knee and the kind of like the know sex touched
i said when needed his ex
as he's casting casting couch in himself
republicans are going to me to himself or sympathy and i think it's so important he said
i think someone gave him a book or a seminar on all the ways that you can sit or stand when you're fat in a way that doesn't make you appear fat and i think that's what he's doing here he's like a very very high crime
to cover his his girth sitting down the leg is there to your the they suppose english slimming
he didn't have such a stupid brain where he's like the suit is the symbol of business
one all the time he would just be a cafe and guy he would be like homer
yogurt judicial this is terrible but i was singing for the steely dan i was wondering like is is he ever like when he's playing golf is the only time he's not in a suit me like my brain was like what does he dressed like when he's just around the house and then i started thinking like oh yes the shower and then i started thinking about him making about that
yeah we finish our i just imagine him like get it going into the shower closing the door and they coming out in a suit that tries off and then just puts on a suit and
america pair stopping it and it's got to be at least like touches on i think of other constantly yeah i think about this hyper and here i think about the sidebar and hair just lying
he's awful like neon orange pay us
i don't think it i don't think it like it's like low than comes up i think i think it's like his hair is like suicide doors
like the strands there like come in from the
back is squarely bald yeah that's got to spell it all up
he was so cool he is the u k trip like james bond i know who should play
the entire time he was like the newton who like all he will humiliate himself just to protect like bonds in like monetary options and shit and here don't talk about breaks don't know dude he's got it and then the second he gets over there is like drizzle may honestly looks terrible
he wants to put our own and a burger yeah she should be wearing but anyway she is screwing up this deal and jimmy saville would be a wonderful
through the drugs it predicts it is pregnant folks okay that's all there is to it
as big inside when asked them about my favor was his meeting the queen and i gotta say last the cow act rabbit and for china's a gun i genuinely angry and disgusted the queen of england must be to be new york
good so bad
the fucking remembers unfortunate finally die never gonna die it must have been really weird for the queen to meet like stupid spoiled rich influence jeffrey epstein point
like a totally new experience for her
the queen of england is probably never met someone still races his meant more show most and chris hands
no that was incredible to see them walking together it was great but now
obviously like trumps social media presence is well known but i want to talk to you about done juniors was talking about here is sort of like when your favorite character
i have he is like the extent to which all of them are like complete idiots like astounding and to be with without question the dumbest one of of them is like an is is incredible i don't even like who are you done or than eric
or evocative august i think if well yeah august it but like eric looks like a late habsburg prince he's got the job he's got like they have a huge bland someone had face the constant sort of like like he's trying to think of a math problem area just looks like a dollar and yet somehow john jr is dumber than here because he doesn't have not like station
yeah yeah eric leg i mean eric's mouth
seventies desserts words like put chick lit sort a thing of jello
but yeah it just he fooled everyone just looking the absolute dominance but you know don he probably has purchased kevin rudolf singles on
his mom and dad both unfortunately doing like a shithead drugs and i had another the lines but like i'm sure they were more as with first one dungeon it has every to kevin trudeau mega memory book that's libraries and every one of those on is the kind of rich and the kind of dumb guy who thinks he's a smile
guy oh yeah he thinks he's a sly business magnate like his father because it means pinch up here and he also emulates his father and his only real desire that's express constantly is for his father's a faction which makes it so funny that he's the one singled out as one his father who ate
it's the models his mother was if ivana
she's my daughter she's my sister is where i may i may regret eel folks reduced or don't in my family
i make my daughter one of one of the mothers my children another deal of one
the story i think was an avant his memoir about how she tried to like use done junior area
custody chip and yeah i'm going all in to be like i want one hundred percent full custody a done junior and trump was like okay
she was like i don't want to throttle than yeah not
all i love
that's your take someone to take custody of a junior have a child had junior and that after a few hours ago now fuck this scenario was like i'm finally going out of and i am willing to send him back in atlanta downey jr is interesting because in some respects he is superman on krypton which is to say he's his dorm his dad
but his dad has a superpower is the most amazing the most amazing personality type on earth which is that it's like nearly impossible for him to feel embarrassed like he's he looks like shit all the time he's wearing like these his pants local zoo members are so big on him to hide is weird by and for like to feel like you're like yeah
eight the longest zipper in history every day there's like a news report that's like all of this guy's closest friends say he is the dumbest peace initiative alive and as it's made up
is just like everyone sees him look like shit all the time act like a fucking he's like and so good at this a ruse jealous of the and his son like can only feel shame in his son got all the shame of us through his dungeon and believes his dad when he is says everyone loves them any his bro
and like he has no reason to question that didn't have the capacity to understand other childlike yeah well he hated his father for a while according to his classmates at the university of pennsylvania where he was nicknamed diaper don because you piss himself after he got drunk all the time he would find him literally path in the bushes in front of the dorms is that he hated his dad and
college which i mean what really hate this just monster as a twenty story were like his dad as i've taken some baseball game and yeah i can do is draw graham an engineer like not all like stoke like renting and like a yankees uniform and according to like hundred years of college for and he said that tramp
punched him in the face whole new like put a suit on and i is going to go in the car and i will be less of they like saw this i'd even explains a lot i put i mean that's what it's like trump the story daniels like it's like i believe he's like
morally would do that but it's like i can't picture down from having sex i can't picture in my pond and slapping his left leg i get very weak
ever thrown a punch
i i love that story though because it just there's so much going on like the punch takes like mute everything else in the background but it's like this brands re watch it relies new things like you have to wear a suit to the baseball
like that type of the tongue and i donald trump is the first rule of respect his style
pages
has to you if you're going out wear a tuxedo don't care where it is it's like the tragedy of dungeon is that he hated his from all accounts and hated is that for good reason in college and he probably had some fantasy that he was going to be able to break away from his control and become his own man enough to deal with them and then he realized that some point oh no i am
fuck moron i can only exist is a remorse fish suckling off of this corrupt empire and he had the stuff all of that resentment down and just just become his name but i hate pinstripes it's yeah it's like that a brutal well he actually some you catalog a lot of very depressing dungeon
graham yeah want to talk about other guy and
i think it's interesting he always uses the cried laughing about you you fucking loves that mit but it's a tell
with such a good
ours
that's why i'm crying it's brutal it's fucking brutal he everything he probably that thing where it's like you in the stories like he wore a yankees jersey but done junior probably were like a full yankees unified socks up to his knees playing an asshole
how does all full kit lanka because of like some genetic disease he probably got knocked out in one blow by his dad's
and select the most formative moment of his life and it just cried laughing the most you ever since yeah well speaking of cried laughing one are my favorite three lines in the done junior instagram saga is ongoing divorce and relationship with kimberly got cow foil of guilt
while the fox news gavin newsom ex wife what the fuck bizarre
gather going back to our last last week's theme of the show the disgusting incestuous their eyes wide shut like relationship between every rich person they'll do some his pipe assholes
they're not gonna some is fucking drake of them
every
i gather news and probably for jerry brown and forgotten
he walks as you were my favorite
in your coverage of engineers instagram is the sort of like divorce guy motifs that he keeps coming up with the divorce guy bracelet like i remember you should he had he had a zippo lighter with a little insist on the now
got her into school possession of one hundred percent of freaking awesome
what are your what are your some or some other your favorite like dun dun junior divorced guy material and then the thing that baffles me most about him and his yeah he has not followed any like instagram point of cancer and models like he only follows like like giant school rings like and lighters
like my i remember he was like look at me like making a fire and like you like clearly a like for someone to like film him for at least five minutes like building this fire but if you look at the back you can see that there's like two other guys around and i didn't like composed like fire pit and he's like feeling have some like learn how to camp training thing
it's so depressing
he's got train for he's got a train for of being outdoors because he's got to get out all of that aggression against his father on endangered species of
feel anything as my parents are imagining that when he blows elephants brains out it's dancing and that elephant lake
big pussy is the season two it's like that elephant like turns to him
has done seniors facial composure almost and it's like
i came up with the idea for roller rinks on and on credit
actually were you the one who broke the story of you found darn juniors accounts on hunting message board that was so funny to me because even on these message boards people are like your fucking stupid
you may want were his comments are hunting message for there
like a boring like hunting shit and him asking to buy everyone's guys but also
post on like a like for like stories about like how this like one kid finally like second of this liberal bully and like punched him in the face in our kids are going to fat and
that's like he's like stupid bullshit stories you like tweets about now but like back then he was just to guess the other material having but is that's great i like i like dungeon years ago and posts wary of like his workouts and stuff and they'll show his incredibly wet face and like it's hot cross paid one hundred and twenty degrees like gotta grind hard
every morning
which is crawford through the perfect thing for him because it's like
he thinks because it's hard it's the best like just because it's the most difficult and cumbersome it's the best work out like it is the top stupid go work out who am or hate him man i had a great workout today shredded both of my that's how you know the kidney failure
you a hatch my retina as he was bragging about working out in lake of very high gym that's like any actual the national average lead a jordan boroughs famously he's a american olympic wrestler one of the one of the best of this generation and he famously like change the way a lot of people cut weight
he's like know it's like stupid to like
put on sweats and work on the hot room with you're going to kill yourself as do it gradually and people because wrestlers are all like very hard working sort of fish the dedicated guys like or town
the food the crossword guys are just like thirty years behind on her like i'm going to have it all i am radio or have brain damage that is what i'm doing i want to put my head the microwave
i'm committed to it so moving on from from the trunk family and the the wonderful ways of standing sitting and just being their human doings as we mentioned before i mean human evidence honestly i really do often seem to be creatures were in human skin evident than physical pain and they
audience is like how they're standing in each country and looks like he is his entire body is on fire when he is like sitting or standing like wants to remove his skin for himself
i mean that famous picture of him on the log yeah
die because that on unchanged
it looks like he's losing his balance but the thing is trying to balance on his just the earth
oh god whole and zone and bone deficiency
i always think about this
our friend michael

i would respect him so much more he had not only did it to tweet this show i just keep him fucking like own his and strawberry and strawberry to eight and six personally i can never completely dislike and now because he has still not a leader that we were at like this big party what you see in her when the ashley's you're the first verse
i i never been more happy in my life until other age we did was a better before
okay so moving onto an actual news story from this week
i guess the thing that the picking us troops supreme court pick brett cavanaugh i want to talk a little bit about this guy doesn't not have reject i don't care about him personally and like honestly every time there's a supreme court nomination it's like my least favorite style of news cycle because it's just also wrote knowing
the same thing happens and like mainly what i hate about it
is that we all have to play like everyone in the media and the democrats and republicans all play this game of make believe were like a vacancy they all pretend that they're considering the nominee and that they always talk about whoever it is as this sort of like they're intellectually voracious and just over everything they just love the law
all they love the law more than a table of debating the law writing about the law and it's this like whole kabuki theater where we have to pretend that we don't know exactly especially if it's like a right wing guy from the federalist society like per capita we all have to pretend we don't know exactly why he's being nominated exactly
if you on the supreme court
you know i will keep an open mind i will respect precedent
and you'll see what he says will will know the answers my question
and committed here and i just like it really doesn't matter i hate it so much and i'll tell you exactly why does doesn't matter
it's like a little bit about this is a piece that was in the daily beast this week it was very good piece by jay michaelson about this guy named leonard leo who is like the
kappa oh of supreme court appointments for the right he's this federalist society june
i want to talk a little about the sky in light of the cavanaugh nomination reading from this piece jade michaelson rates here
at the center of the network is leonard leo of the federalist society the association of legal professionals that has been the pipeline for nearly all trumps judicial nominees leo is on leave from the federalist society to personally assists trump and picking a replacement for justice anthony kennedy is formal title as executive vice president but that role belies leo's influence
directly or through surrogates use place dozens of life tenure judges on a federal bench effectively controls the judicial crisis network which led the opposition to president obama has nominee judge merrick garland heavily influenced the beckett fund law firm that represented hobby lobby and it's successful challenge of contraception and now supervises admit
guns and hires at the george mason law school newly relieved in memory of justice antonin scalia leonard leo was a visionary this is it really important leonard leo is a visionary said tone carter who served on leo's media relations director when he was chairman of the us commission on international religious freedom in an exclusive
you he says he figured out twenty years ago that the concert conservatives had lost the culture war abortion gay rights contraception conservatives didn't have a chance of public opinion prevailed so they needed to stack the courts and that's exactly what he's been doing with great success it goes on to talk about
he's be was responsible for the picks of a lido gossage and now cabinet and roberts to and they all share with him a arch catholic fundamentalism this guy's a member of the knights of malta hoo boy and his it says here leonard's faith is paramount to him carter said when he traveled staff members had to
find a church near wherever he was staying three kids attend mass every day
again this is why it doesn't matter this is why everything you read about brett cavanaugh does it matter this is the only thing that should be discussed in this context in that using other right wing religious fundamentalists who is being put on the court to roll back the last fifty or sixty if not one hundred years
frank haven't wanted the massive a know this was but brick oven are going about to find out is also bruises
and a carpool we're going to get there but i'm sick like
the real the context with which this nomination or any nomination by republican president should be viewed as part of a highly organized and disciplined and ruthless in a way almost admirable if it weren't so evil
attempts to stack the courses people who are reliable ideologues who will vote to overturn roe v wade the overturn the right to privacy which underdogs the right to abortion and contraception
return every labour law and basically as i described it earlier this week if you have a right that you think is foundational to your dignity and existence as a human being get ready to have a given to either a private corporation or religious authority because it's not going to be yours anymore it's going to be theirs
that being said everything i read other than this this week about cavanaugh was about what a great guy he is yeah guys are going up on is a good dude
anyone who's asshole kid got a clerk ship from him says he's wonderful yeah everyone at the raytheon acres bridge game league they do the bridge tournament
aids that's not good enough for three hundred four hundred however many people live in this country to figure it out
that's not good enough for them
we just not have reports i will you want yeah really do not want nine fossilized psychopaths determining whether you live or die is at the world you won't recognize the yankees an
we can get him to start doing crossover
i mean i have
that his his ideas but he is the supreme court justice
most look like steve little from is bound to happen
i'm not gonna go and for
also it's interesting the new york times had a piece liberal case for cavanaugh and that shit a two minutes after the exact all means that everyone on that short list they had a fuck yeah
written this guy is actually great article by some liberal who is somehow incestuous related to them either they're fucking three year long at all
tottenham at school or their stupid kid is the clerk some way connected to them where that person being on the supreme court raises their status that's what that's why they think these guys are great that's because him being on the supreme court reflects well on them or their family here
here's a perfect example of that are in the wall street journal cavanaugh is a mentor to women this is by amy child the the tiger
yeah tiger mom for those you don't remember it's a book about being a furry parent
no nope
a series of identical articles and i'm gonna share a couple of them all sketched out this idea that where they basically say i don't know how he's going to ruin the court nor do i care you know way he's a wonderful man and he's like a role model for young women again like and this is all very calculated because the really the main issue with this is that they're finally going to have a major
already to overturn roe v wade which i fully expect them to do so they want and you want you to talk about anything other than that and the way they're going to do it is by appealing to the bra sensibilities about what a good guy is you know how he believes that like you know what women in the workplace or whatever as want to read here from from amy
he writes judge bread cavanaugh jurisprudence will appropriately be discussed in the months ahead i'd like to speak to a less well known side of the supreme court nominee his role as a mentor for young lawyers particularly women the qualities he exhibits with his clerks may provide important evidence about the kind of justice he would be i've gotten to know this side of judge cavanaugh lost
irving on yale law schools court ships committee for the most of the past ten years it also affects me personally last year my daughter accepted an appellate clerk ship from judge cavanaugh which is set to begin next month while in addition know there's no man that has been as good a mentor to young woman since charles manson
know on one hand like the fate of hundreds of millions of women and reproductive rights on the other hand someone is going to enable your daughter to become is repulsive the human being is you like really wins here i think it's interesting that it is the tiger mom this she she's this like she she became fame
because she wrote a book about how to like psychopathic the abuse your children so that they can play the violin real good but her most recent book is about her tribalism is tearing america apart and i think it's interesting here that she's just like bread cavanaugh what do i know about him i don't know he gave my daughter a job
this big a puff piece on him and the wall street or all that those tell you what they mean what she and other people mean by tribalism as people having any kind of ideological commitments because it's just the world is a big country club it's a big it's a big network of of glad handing and mutual back patting back scratching and anybody who
who wants to disrupt that is being tribal i mean to hurt her big endorsement of cavanaugh is that she wasn't worried that he was fucking had daughter which is like yeah
this is the end it says these days the press for stories about powerful man exploiting are abusing female employees that makes it even more striking here judge cavanaugh as female clerk speak of his decency and his role as a fierce champion of their careers
judges confirmed my daughter will probably be looking for a different clerk ship but for my own daughter there is no judge i would trust more than brett cavanaugh to be in one form or clerks words a teacher advocate and friend it's good that tiger on here
is very concerned about powerful men exploiting are abusing their employees which break haven't i will make officially legally
has no right to redress against sexual harassment in the workplace but yeah i know of course he's not gonna fucking
do sexual harassment and anybody it's hard to do that when you wrap your dick and horse haired fucking apart
liar liar because you're an arch catholic psychopathic sure the fuckin albino monk from the da vinci code
so i i
financial statements on facebook
someone posted something some us in this to me
the name but i'm post on facebook that anyone who went to georgetown law school in two thousand and ten would have been very surprised to learn you married
and i mean like i can mean one million different days but like a
maybe it means
played with his friends real late at night it's like all but don't you can hear you
again i mean i just go back to that line about the leonard leo guy and this like incredibly well funded by dark money right wing groups that it is just like plotting to they understand that they are immoral minority that wishes to exercise a veto power over everyone else in this country they know they can't win politically
so they love the supreme court because it's a lifetime tenure with which they can you know like they're all like hold over law and authority in this country
see why the supreme court should be abolished but just keep that in mind these people understand there are moral minority but they have no problem loading on democratic power over the rest of the country
next article this is this is the worst one this isn't the washington post and it's almost identical to the one that appeared in the wall street journal
i don't know cavanaugh the judge but cavanaugh the car pool then why great guy
yeah that's him
so sick of hearing about these people fucking liar know it's important because it's part of the job of the most because you know they say that the most junior supreme court justice yes the close the door
has and then get coffee and pick up everyone one of america's kids so i need to know how he is a carpool that this is by julie o'brien in the washington post and the article begins and a little like just lets you know julio private lives in chevy chase if you don't a chevy chase maryland is from one of the most evil
zip codes of this country it's literally all of the new york on iraq war architects live on like the same block and it's also where chevy chase
there is there
if like i had pick any place in america that as a yellow king ceremony
a chevy chase there's just such a dark energy go there yeah everybody everybody lives there
and they're fuckin clause that they've got an unexplained black robe
well cavanaugh will it will have an explanation of her hands
okay so that are a room to work again and how embarrassing
okay so this began julio brian dawkins here much has been written about brett cavanaugh us presidents stroke nominee for the supreme court
that fact same fucking lead why do you why do you even know who they do it i know horses
i'm always it for soccer now i don't think it's a stretch to think that like these people are just giving like forms your idea is weird leonard leo satirize like the in today's society
certified that has i don't even think it's that i just don't think these people like try that hard i think it's like for them it's ridiculous to think that anyone would not like the guy from their car poor who gave their friend a job
well you know there are many judges in america i mean all they needed like a public endorsement of this feature supreme court justice to have his air like when you become justice so she writes
much has been written about but the discussion is focused on his record is a federal judge and his in his legal career i wonder why i'd like to talk about him as coach k like the one it also university this coach k is also a mentor to student athletes who love basket and isn't repellent shit in scumbag
coach k but his players are sixth grade girls
ret breaths older daughter in mine have been classmates at blessed sacrament school a small catholic school in the district for the past seven years on evenings and weekends your link that you're likely to find bread
at low at a local gym or athletic field encouraging his players or watching games with his daughters are friends he coaches not one but two girls basketball team hopes and because his positive another wedding
i was erected
his positive attitude and calm demeanor make the game fun and allow each player to shine the results have been good this season he led the blessed sacrament school sixth grade girls team to an undefeated season and a citywide championship in the local catholic youth league to the parents of players on the squad it's no surprise that the team photograph
with the trophy is displayed prominently in his chambers right next to a photo of him shaking hands and grinning with pinochet
a father
opus day founder who had like six kids that he us
i am just i gotta say it's not read your main this article or care of on himself like in the catholics and calm down with what they named their schools
fuck in school this is bloody now is that ackerman
to get ulcers and
metal marianne rules i think they need to cool it
you are you prefer
a protestant names and are like friendly hands
also no one noticed a lot of positive attitude
heavenly gate l l c
corporate religious like yeah of course your kids are going to grow to be like ambitious judicial freaks like a colonel bloody destiny lower school like the man
brits contribution to our schools community extends beyond the sidelines he and his wife actually support their two daughters and other national in
i should disclose that
support their children are countless school and church functions throughout the year
they don't could count them in the summer bread is the car pool dad often shuttling students to and from practices games that activity made how many had to either in there during the summer
well as this guy find a job i didn't realize it
get back to work on his father
show for a really good competitive stations of the cross
lift
it's also like i like oh this is like a reason why would be good judges like he helps
his daughters be can do whatever you can only knows how to drive get it he said
kids can get a little spicy here i think all the stuff about that he's he coaches to sixth grade girls basketball teams i think this is all coded message this is all like code to the people who are like in the sec they're like what they're saying his folks he's really dedicated to disciplining and policing the bodies and too
i'm sorry what i'm going to say either i don't think if you're an adult man you should be coaching sixth grade girls teams yeah we have like catholics can't coach basketball teams anyway because they can't tell the girls drawn suicide
brett is a steady presence at his daughters events even if it means racing across town just to catch the last fifteen minutes of a game or lime the team isn't enough
that is not count and mark for bread
yeah fest
it goes breaths friendship and mentorship have touched my family and and especially personal way a few years ago my husband died what are the most difficult aspects of
however many
one of the many difficult aspects of that loss was that my daughter had no one to accompany to accompany her to the schools and your father daughter dance that first year in every year since my husband's passing brett his step forward to take my daughter to the dance alongside his own so he's seeking to daughter
someone else his daughter to the fathered rather bread gave my daughter her first chance to my my dad died and i gonna say that the last thing i would ever want is for literally anyone else to take me on one of those direct dancers and i would feel wage and going to have to say now is this seems like cruel thing to do anything i mean my dad was twenty one and bread cavanaugh it's
i have kind of weird i like i'm not even a girl
there's no doubt that is also
i admit it was heartwarming when you see them in a step out on a desk for that first time for that special dance to the song from eyes wide shut
not the athletes chanting during sex ritual that's only a daring if he goes to the dance wearing his judicial robes holding a gavel and he says things like motion for upon
oh
another say there are filed father died dance is every area
what age thirty
get married sad effect until you get married
catholics have to relocate i'm now becoming a zionist work i was against them at the start of the segment but now i realize have been infected by protestantism oh through ah doesn't junk know it's trying to get out of an absolutely this doesn't happen in the vatican because they don't acknowledge their daughter don't clip that i'm just giving you
it's not offensive
this t pain song overwrought
oh man so yeah i was delightful virgil
it just finished up here i'll leave it to others to gauge judge cavanaugh his qualifications but in writing this yeah
all he did for others the judge actual qualifications
but he says but as someone who would bring his work the traits of personal kindness leadership and willingness to help when called on him he would receive a unanimous verdict in his favor
i like oh shit like literally doesn't matter if he's a good guy or all that's important is how you will yeah
as part of the supreme court which we know that guy who put them on the court is a member of the knights of
all of this is coated it's for gullible liberals who do read the wall street journal up ads
and to tell them look there's no way he's going to overturn roe v wade the coaches and girls' basketball team
now that i mean that is all of these are are geared towards professional and you're right it is obviously coordinated they're there to soften opposition among liberals among people who already have soft enough heads to begin with and way to soften them a little more because there's nothing more than than through imagine their their leaders as
regular people and evaluate them as suction and just think of not think of them in terms of these replaceable cog in a political machine that is determined by the interests of the parties but as free individuals who who who rule and vote based on their inner character
find the find the vine that and you'll know how they're going to rule and how they're going have now we're going we know how they're going to vote as we know how pissed a feels about roman sexual and religious minority the twentieth century vatican two labour control
era cycles and as not overturn roe v wade have fun out of girls to coach
one of those memes that's like a basketball player
not turning point
third of the league
placid virgin summer day care
i mean again
oh we say it all the time
but this is why i'm such a good president
he there literally no stories of him being noticed his kids
only one and he just one on his own merits of will try to write a story like this about donald ulcers and being super nice to have aga
he's the man i had a really bad one
donald trump is that you're dedicated father he started a home school wrestling with a bunker
i did on
damn don't clip
they always have a way to trick you
like you were talking about these
the federal societies yeah conservative legal group and how profoundly successful the yeah getting their nominees through to you know rather different republican presidents are just the sheer amount of power dedication they have within that are it's not just the supreme court it's like every other
and like the federal society we exist like basically just groom the next generation of black eyed psychopaths to like you know eviscerate that is probably the greatest power within the republican coalition right now
obviously there are liberal legal groups of society's by the obviously can exert that level of devotion or influence in the democratic party because of a could they would have never gotten alina kagan on the supreme korea sort of my or yeah sure but here's the other thing like a day i get our act was admired despite how he
it is the fact that they're not afraid it all of the fact that like i said that there are moral minority that wishes to use power to exact their vision of the conflict their vision or the world on everyone else i gotta say that's kind of the point of
level so you kind of have to admire them if they were also evil and should be not having having a zillion dollars to do it really how in the daily beast article it does it by the end of it it's a very good article i recommend you read the whole thing but it a talk about how it's very hard to say who funds all this but we know for sure that the koch brothers in the mercer yeah speaking of packs of like
the fact that like just suspiciously all these articles are ready to go like literally the mini cavanaugh his name was announced
here's what i was wondering number one
if when obama got kagan and sort of my or
do you remember reading in any venue the conservative case for my
no i just the she was a dumb bitch that's yeah yeah she's a dumb what he's doing identity
grills or yeah i know there was a further away and there was a zillion up and about her completely and dying comment about being a wise latina like augur like the doom of american culture and yeah
i am for him
pat buchanan was on tv and his face was just bright red and steam machine out of his ears and he was firing two pistols at his feet and hovering above the ground he was so pissed about the wise latina thing i remember that and get it's because she's the best just regard and yeah she is wrong
any better than kagan and i'm sorry and urge
yeah
dude i don't know man
yeah i hear what if there's like a nine hundred year old jewish woman
get this she's similar to black rapper
what about why our you
you take her initial okay
got it you know it's our be are luigi are be okay how does that sound like
ziegler
i was going to say chief justice keith
gee that's a rose most you display
gotta be emulated fucking chief justice gives quote
quote weeding washington post malone
i got so many of us on anybody
then here's another example of a reason you didn't read any of those articles that were like i've been in the federalist society my home address
dedicated my life literally to are turning back all social progress made over the last hundred years but here's why sort of my are such a good person yeah at least be considered you read those articles because those people are fucking stupid yeah they're very successful at getting what they why unlike their their opponents and garland was not
donated use of milk toes beige ass fucking room temperature milk ass motherfucker center right mother fucker
white dude but he nominated him because i thought well they want to check him and they'll give him the same sort of benefit of the doubt that these people do both have another way like while america island is he's on the same circuit as cavanaugh he's been there are no longer and they would think like oh no the conservative case for given
garland because you know he talked about with the idea was amazing fucking softball coach and i know like the idea was with with garland it was like we're going to get nominated guy so moderate that they'll really look foolish if they tried zappa like they'll although the cradle not real bad
extremely didn't win an election like two years before by being like we're going to turn want
lake that everyone know they were not benefit of gerrymandering this dark money network you can't like if they had been explicitly running on since two thousand and ten were absolutely out of our minds i mean them that over the one thing that would have been a good move
much as hunter ever got here was that they nominated trumps sister because she didn't like she's actually a liberal judge like they they like said no to that because his trump off well that would have pissed off
that's true
what a very much because you know they had a very game plan and they were very well funded and they had of cards and denying garland the seat there was nothing anyone could really do about it once they decided that they were going to ignore those norms and then the really nothing to be done i mean really the criticism of obama and those guys is really just that they
nominated garland in the first place someone who know and on earth could get excited for and then just kind of didn't pointed out because they assumed they were going to win
they didn't think it was going to matter that like well
in and then she'll show know garland up again
yeah yeah i remember a few months even after the nomination where it was clear that grassley mcconnell would refuse to hold hearings at the demand wasn't a points approve girl of his records the man was just hold the hearing and garlic would go around capitol hill and like they will moto op's with democratic senators
and just just you know you know the smiling grinning their legs crossed talking to each other and thinking when this kills on the front page of the washington post mcardle will look so bad
people have made this mitch mcconnell there's no real like democratic equivalent to mitch mcconnell of his entire thing is like yeah i hate me fucking want good
my voters and going to vote me out
it was a little i read as a client
but just from like it there was someone who said it i didn't you at tangiers
you are not to get you know my guess
happens every time in canada at the tangiers hotel did you not promised me that i was never your guest you will never my gosh i can't you i don't coffee at least two or three times a month at the tangiers i'd like to answer though this time
i was present at that dinner fuck harry reid to his credit that character is unfair because read actually punched to guy on f b i surveillance you're trying to bribe and unlike his counterpart
harry reid was a little bit like someone who
had better politics and the read i'm not saying like i expect like you know someone to come out there and be like mitch mcconnell but for like socialize in trance i mean like every little am but like just someone who from like just doing the stuff the democrats even say in their website even that sub standard stuff if they were just would go that far
it could yeah it could be it
will never be chuck schumer ever it will never be any hoyer it will never be any mother would you rather than your other problems that the whole like most of the are gonna caucus is totally rotten and the republicans march in lockstep become only has to deal with what maybe to hold outs one because he's right you insane and the other because she was prime
hurried and is still bitter of audio visual
like it's very very unlikely maybe it's very unlikely that the democrats even if they were entirely unified could start a bernie sanders with the majority leader how much legislation do you think he can pass out of that said it even if he does all the procedural trace source to get to fifty one exactly and like look the best i mean the best we can hope for from these
they provide a united front and loudly and angry
have some fucking firing knew about be clear and honest so the american people about what this actually means no governor has got to three democrat votes how easy life hands and mansion have already said it so yeah
all boring anything truly incredible in his basement think that the baseball yeah there's some weird shit going on in their ass of thank you for reminding me about that the baseball ticket thing is so funny he
the headline where it was like cavanaugh when thousands of dollars in debt buying baseball two hundred thousand
it was two hundred thousand dollars that he spent on nationals this all baseball's you take to take unspecified people because you baseball games and current unspecified number of time yet which i gotta say like imagine the fucking goals that he was born there
look like as exists
they did they had no proof like the only thing he wasn't even i
home and forth
yeah early in the russian personnel records that are you don't have to provide proof that this is actually what the money was for he didn't have to name who they are like i can't imagine why the white house would come out and downstairs like and unless it was like seem like they're being super transparent about something that's actually like him looking like buying hobo kill or something i don't know
he went to these games
druids of games or he just bought the tickets for he bought my ticket apparently like it's like ticket packages like you can only in and fourteen it off a real fast he took he took the whole basketball team
well nationals games and you beard costs of based on it
one thousand i mean if a quarter million dollars i seriously
no it isn't just my fucking nefarious thing were easily it's like some complicated byzantine scheme more like the seals merc pays him for like a ruling words okay for puppy should kill the firstborn your kid is the bible time yeah exactly but that was the one story if he just was
going into debt because you love going to be
those those that would be okay about in the car bullshit like that's cool
i got out would be like from wisconsin the nobody knows only way
yeah i mean just so he's probably gonna be on the supreme court
the baseball think it would be a good example of how a company in opposition party could potentially make a big deal out of like imagine if sotomayor or a million dollars and weird thing is he's probably going to be on the supreme court as i've outlined i think i think we know how he's going to roy and if it's you know women's rights civil rights of labor
aids environmental protection of any kind right probably won't be even a single square miles of land in this country that will be opened up to like the oil and natural gas realigning industries
if your job poisons you knowingly you'll probably not have any legal remit to sue the minimum wage minimum wage or probably out on
death penalty for striking know yeah i mean labor laws are ready got fucked by this court but it's going to get we were so i want to want to close out by saying like we know where this is going we know
going to happen i think it's intolerable i think the democrats should absolutely start laying the groundwork now to as we've talked about packing the court abolishing it out right i mean that's the dream but that has a yeah yeah i mean however that
phantom just the pragmatic position at this point is packed the core problem
words put it in a ideal position abolish for fucking court and said by the way i guess i know a lot of a lot of people go in like oh you want to pack the court will next other republicans going to they'll just patently that anyway
just keep going back and forth like that itchy and scratchy very affluent bigger and look amazing
anyway
it all started for like an ox we're going to have the right thing and i go fuck just keep doing that until every american is a member of the supreme court
now at our our people are still playing they gotta have the fuck supreme court cases determined in like yankee stadium
not not not don't the point is contrary like i mean in the baseball tickets thing as a good example of this as well as the deep deep dark money that funds all of this this idea that the supreme court justices live in this like magisterial castle of the law untainted by political roads yeah is an absolute fantasy these guys are political actors and operative
and that is why they are being given this authorities that they can act of political guy has earned enough in a fucking cave his whole life and he's being called to service he was in the fucking bush white house yeah that was the other funny thing is when he worked for ken starr he definitely thought a president could be impeached and then lo and behold he discovered as soon as you started working for a republican white house
you doesn't work so hard that's what he said he said they work so hard and it's so hard to work for the white house that i just don't think it's constitutional to ever prosecutor yeah he's added crimes i if people have credit him with growth and willing to admit he was wrong
because when there was a democratic president he was trying to get have been paged he thought that that was the presidents were liable to courts and then you know what it's just such it's such a complicated job you can't be distracted but that kind of stuff wow he had he had a real come he had a real growth moment there instead of just it's all being absolute opportunistic horse shit with
no fucking underpinnings of any kind of meaningful
principal for me in closing like we know where this is going like this
his ass holes are going to be with us the next forty fifty sixty years deciding what rights we can and can't
if that's the case forget the democrats what they should or shouldn't do with back and record for everyone else
you need to start preparing yourself now to break the law and create be sort of networks of support and solidarity to continue or whether it's abortion or unions are striking
if you build build now the social and political networks to carry on as if this didn't matter because because i'm sorry living under these people is intolerable no person should have to submit it wouldn't be a civil enjoy it
you should now and the only way to live as a human being with dignity and as a citizen of this country is to start is going to be breaking the law
providing of providing abortion services in the states that are going to make it legal that's a first step but there's many many other things
for example they are going to require individual citizens many of us to consciously break the law
well i think labour for example with they're trying to go back to the explicitly trying to repeal the entire new deal that's the whole concept and how did the new deal get put their in the first place because of massive illegal action by by by unions by by militancy by sit down strikes with were not legal by violating judicial restraining orders and
things like that and wildcats and things just general
outlaw unionism and then then it was and then the new deal existed and it kind of
co opted the labor movement into the framework of the wagner at and of the labor relations board and it's well if you're going to get rid of that then you're gonna have to bring back the same kind of disregard for legal niceties that prevailed before those mechanisms came into play and if you are one of the supposedly good billionaires who are
the broad don't like this
start creating the same kind of networks now not just for the courts but start donating your money to have a huge pool of resources available to provide legal counsel and bail and protection for peace for people who do break the law
well we're not going to see that because most of them this is going to be good and they're going to be happy for it anyway
my closing thoughts on cavern on the supreme court
yeah now
for the definite immediate future democrats are still going to think this is a sparring match and that they can only hit as hard as they want to be head while they repeatedly get knocked out by seventy three year old man with wimp bone
they were his own sorry
but for everyone else
those aren't rules
so in conclusion recognize that land of many con
on one hand will make this country of ours was on the other hand he helped like thirty girls all named mackenzie
bloody down managed to eternal life know they're not donkey
probably makes them all like dress up like larry bird
the fundamental drill valley
has passed
that who are your favorite basketball players larry bird on stockton
kevin mchale bob cousy tony to oh he's like i don't want any dribbling on the masses just passes bounce passes only yeah brick oven like his of like all the other coaches or do lake doing like says
hi i'm roots and he's just having them like throw medicine balls that each other
like this is a good old fashioned work up for their ruined the game
protestants
you know as well when you're talking about abortion rights and roe v wade it's really fundamentally a class issue because some face like brad cavanaugh if he happened to live in a post rose state that had or band abortion on demand
and his basketball player mckenzie daughter got knocked up he could always pay for a plane ticket to new york or where abortion is legal republicans have always always always always all caregivers in every nation it's going and obviously in a post roll country it will be harder for people have less
means to do that is well it's harder for them to get abortions today so you don't really have to wait to finance support organizations that pay for abortions that do abortions
lock them out look them up we've mentioned if few on the show in the past go and and the post the receipts whatever you encounter someone like deplorable derby your big fat piece of shit out of magazines
he did you don't need it in there are donating their name and then tell them to buy the book by there are there are
there are parts of texas
was not an abortion provider within six hundred miles which makes it essentially de facto illegal for anybody he doesn't have the money to be able to travel yards or so
yeah that about sums it up for this way ashley feinberg thank you so much for joining yeah
as a blast a please keep us posted on the antics of a truck family the hosts were created an atheist
next i can't wait till they all spend the night of the busier
the holocaust museum
