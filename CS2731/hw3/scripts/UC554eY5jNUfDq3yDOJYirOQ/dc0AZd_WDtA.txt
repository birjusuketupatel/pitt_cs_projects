so it turns out that the atheists
actually violate the principle that
they're standing on they require
rational justification for the absolute
known as god but the absolute that
they're reasoning from
they have no rational justification for
it and then they'll say oh it's
axiomatic
hey what's up buddy oh good to see you
here would you like to continue the
conversation
yeah i absolutely would i have a better
vocabulary
you want to start where we left off um
no we can actually start from the very
beginning
okay good so you're an atheist what is
your what is your
principled criterion of atheism um i
don't believe there's any justification
for the belief in god
if there was rational justification for
god would you believe in him yeah of
course
okay is would would god by definition be
an absolute upon which everything
depends
um not necessarily i'm not sure uh god
by definition would be
let's say um in the christian god is an
immaterial mind
um who has the the power to initiate
and bring into existence everything that
exists and sustain it so by that
definition
god would be the absolute right by that
definition yes
okay good so that's the working
definition that i'd like to work with is
that acceptable to you yeah
so you reject um
you reject the belief in an absolute
known as the christian god because it's
not rationally justified right
correct is that a is that an arbitrary
principle or a consistent one
um it is somewhat consistent
well it's it's it's either arbitrary or
not arbitrary which is it
so i understand now what the technique
is so
what we're going to get into is
presuppositionalism right do you want to
start that conversation
is it arbitrary or not arbitrary i can't
answer your yes or no like this because
i understand how the trap works is your
is your principle one that you use
consistently
past presuppositional beliefs yes it is
okay so you're consistent in applying uh
rational justification
for your ultimate beliefs is that right
past presuppositional beliefs yes it is
i don't i don't i don't know what that
means okay that that's more verbal
misdirection do you
require rat do you require rational
justification
um for your most ultimate beliefs are
you going to let me to explain this so
you're going to keep talking over me
well i'd like just like a non-evasive
response sure so the response is past
presuppositional beliefs yes
i don't know what that means can i
explain it yeah sure
so the foundation of which we build our
reason and our logic on is on
presupposed beliefs so presuppose
beliefs such as
i experience things or causality exists
or i can create logical rational
statements these are things that are by
definition unjustified that every single
person that engages in any sort of
argument has to rely on is that true yes
how do you know that because because
that's the the bounds of what we can
prove is as human oh okay so
so our most foundational mental states
don't have a justificatory path
correct good so that necessarily entails
the falsity of the christian god
it does it what it necessarily follows
from that the falsity of the christian
god are you aware of that
um not necessarily well that's your
definition of the question
necessarily it would because in the
christian world view
by definition the christian god has
ordained
and sovereignly given us our most
foundational beliefs
about reality and they're therefore by
definition
not axiomatic or assumptions okay sure
yeah i can i can accept that sure right
so so what you're assertion
that our most foundational mental states
are axiomatic or unjustified assumptions
then from that it necessarily follows
the falsity of the christian god so
agreed
sure okay good uh do you have a defeater
for the christian god
um can you explain to me my defeater
yeah if you don't have a defeater that
falsifies the christian god
then your stipulation that our most
foundational beliefs are axiomatic or
just assumptions
is not necessarily true i don't think
that i need a defeater for a belief
no you no you do you need a defeater for
the existence of god for the existence
of the christian god because in the case
that the christian god exists unless you
rule him out then in the case that he
exists then your stipulation is not
necessarily true that we start from uh
foundational assumptions
if my foundational assumptions lead to
your definition being incorrect
then i guess then foundationally i would
acknowledge that your definition is
impossible
yeah i'm wait i'm waiting for a defeater
for the christian god i've already
applied one if i if my presuppositional
beliefs are the defeater then that would
be the defeater yeah giving me an if is
not a defeater do you have a defeater
i'm going by your definition your
definition was that my presuppositional
beliefs
rule out the existence of your christian
god can i please finish my sentence
please before you cut me off okay so you
asked me to provide a defeater to your
christian god
after you told me that my
presuppositions were defeated for your
christian god
so i don't understand why you're asking
me for a defeat or whatever you already
provided you want are you using certain
can you please
can you please let me finish this
statement before you come up okay i was
almost done but you're really anxious to
get in with your next
fallacy okay so just let me finish this
statement before you go on go ahead
so you're done i'm done now yes okay um
is your defeater for the christian god
circular
if you consider an unjustified
presuppositional belief circular yes
okay so you show that the christian god
uh is
is false because of an unjustified uh
stipulation
if those unjustified stipulations are
presuppositional beliefs yes
okay so the christian god doesn't exist
because you just imagine it
i that this is completely non-sequitur
i'm sorry can you explain
okay so what what fundamental idea that
you hold to
falsifies the christian god the
fundamental ideas that we cannot
epistemologically defend
causal chain of events or or rational
like
forms of argument or our observations as
conscious beings that these are
indefensible that we cannot deal with
not understand i'm not understanding
what you just said how does that falsify
the christian god
it falsifies it because you told me that
my presuppositional beliefs necessarily
falsify it that was your statement you
connected those two things no no no
no i didn't say that i said what
necessarily follows
from that okay i didn't say that your
stipulation
falsified you see you need to listen
more carefully to what i say
i'm listening very carefully to what you
say well well what you just said to me
showed me that you weren't okay can i
summarize
if i say what necessarily follows
entails the falsity of the christian god
that doesn't mean that that stipulation
falsifies the christian god
if if your assertion happens it can be
uh shown to be vertical
then you would have a defeater but you
didn't show that it was whoever does
that i'm gonna end you okay no nose on
this stream
okay now i'm still waiting for a very
cogent
very circumspect falsifier for the
christian god is it
your basal assumption that falsifies the
christian god
it would appear so according to your
definition yes no no not my definition
i'm asking you
what is it in one sentence or two that
necessarily
falsifies the christian god i presuppose
things such as my ability to observe or
a have a conscious experience what what
what are you supposing i'm presupposing
that
that logic or reason exists i presuppose
that causal events happen i presuppose
that i can observe let's go
let's go through these one at a time one
one at a time okay so you
you presuppose that logic exists are you
talking about
reasoning or are you talking about the
laws of logic i'm talking about
the our epistemological understanding of
logic that that a can lead to b can lead
to c truth tables basic things like that
no no we we need to get even more
rudimentary though okay how about this
deductive how about deductive reasoning
let's go no we have to go even more uh
foundationally that we'll talk about a
equals a and a cannot equal not a
uh does the stipulation that a cannot
not equal not a does that falsify the
christian god
according to you it does no it doesn't
i've never said that
i want you do you does does the
assertion a cannot equal not a at all
times in all places falsify the
christian god
i i don't know i'm not sure it depends
on your definition of the christian
wait a minute well i'm still i'm still
waiting i just gave you my definition
okay well then i would say necessarily
no
that that particular thing necessarily
i'm still waiting i'm still waiting
give me a circumspect case that the
christian god doesn't exist because
in the absence of you falsifying the
christian god then your stipulation that
we all start foundationally in terms of
unjustified axioms
is not necessarily true so you have to
falsify the christian god
at least do you realize that you're
talking in a circle
i'm i'm not believe you i'm waiting i'm
waiting for you
to falsify the christian god sir so what
i have said is that i believe
in certain presuppositions that are
necessarily unjustified
you said that those presuppositions
necessarily entail that god doesn't
exist
and now you're asking me why god doesn't
exist do you do you want to talk about
whether or not we can presuppose
sir if you listen if you you see i
debate hundreds if not thousands of
people over the last couple of years
if you think your evasiveness is is
going to smooth me over it's not going
to happen i'm not being evasive
i ask you a question sir can you falsify
the christian god do you understand that
you're talking in a circle
can you falsify the christian god sir
are you are you just a troll
is this all i spent so much time today
like looking at this argument
i think you're just a troll okay good
you can you can say that all you want
now
i'm still waiting for you to falsify the
christian god
i don't have to falsify the the
christian god we have to talk about my
priest
can i please finish my statement
responding to you justify the christian
god
i have i say that i have presuppositions
and you say those presuppositions
necessarily entail that god is not real
you do you have any
object do you have any objective
stipulations that falsify the christian
god
i don't understand the question do you
have any do you have any truth claims
that falsify the christian god
i don't need any truth claims can you
falsify the christian god
i have by assuming my presuppositions
according to you
okay so what you're saying is uh in
virtue of something that you imagine
because it doesn't coherent conform to
the christian god therefore the
christian god doesn't exist
if that's your argument chair no sir
that was a question it wasn't an
argument
it sounds like you're just rephrasing
what we've already stated
listen there's only so much evasiveness
i'll put up not being evasive at all
one more time one more time i'm going to
ask you
what is what is your uh objective
statement that falsifies the christian
god
and again i will answer the same way
that i have presuppositions that are
necessarily unjustified because
epistemologically we cannot justify some
presuppositions and according to your
definition of a christian
god these presuppositions necessarily
entail that he is not true
okay so so you falsify the christian god
from your foundational uh starting
points
and are they the product of your
imagination i'm not sure i can't really
say
so you don't know where they come from
that is exactly what i have just said
okay good so the christian gods does not
exist because of
you have ideas that you don't know that
they're vertical exactly
good so the christian god is falsified
in virtue of i don't know
correct okay do you realize how absurd
that is
can you justify your presupposition did
you
do you see i hope somebody's recording
this okay
why are you acting like why are you
acting like presuppositions need to be
properly justified
do you realize what you just said he's
gone standing right now
you just stated that the christian god
does not exist
because i don't know can i hear your
justification
i will be glad to discuss with you my
point of view but i'm
i'm waiting for a cogent defeater for
the christian god
saying the christian god does not exist
in virtue of you stipulating i don't
know
is not a defeater for the christian god
i don't appreciate
characterizing our epistemological
limits i don't know
no i don't i reject i reject your
characterization of my argument
so can i rephrase my argument can i
rephrase my argument sure
go ahead okay so epistemologically we
cannot evaluate
whether or not presuppositions are true
or false it is not possible for humans
to do
for you to summarize that position for
you to summarize that position
can i finish my statement please for you
to evaluate that statement and claim
that it's the same as just simply saying
i don't know
is an incredibly harsh characterization
of what i'm saying
okay do you know what's possible sir
using what we have agreed
are our reasonable ways to make
deductions i'm interested i'm not
answering what is we i'm asking
you do you know what's possible like
truly i don't know what the question
means like truly
no no the answer is no the answer is
always going to be no to a question like
that no okay so you don't know
anything is possible correct from a very
foundational level correct
right so then why are you here
stipulating anything if you don't know
anything is possible because i'm curious
how you can make those same claims when
you rely on the same presuppositions
that i do
sure okay so so anything that you assert
you don't know that it's possible right
okay i want to hear your justification
for your
position i've already answered yes a
million times sir i don't want to talk
about my system anymore i want to hear
you justify your presuppositions
okay good so just for i will i will
explain to you
justifying the christian worldview
momentarily but i want to go on record
here
it's already been on record sir nobody
is hiding not over talk me if you ever
talk me i'll server meet you okay
yeah oh boy right yeah destiny
i wanted to go on record here and i hope
somebody's recording this
that he is stipulated he doesn't know
anything is possible
okay welcome to it that is correct
good i'm going to remind you of that
further on in the conversation
i'm going to mirandize you anything you
say canon will be used against you now
the christian we can know that the
christian god exists in virtue
of the christian god's revelatory acts
in natural revelation
which include how he's constructed this
world okay wait before we do this
can i stop and ask you questions because
i don't want to hear you preach for two
hours where again if not i have no
interest
i didn't even i didn't even think i
don't i don't need you to finish this
okay i don't want i don't want to have
to serve him you
sir so i don't want to listen to you
don't want to have to
calm down calm down calm down
calm down
shut the [ __ ] up it's my goddamn server
all of you destiny you the [ __ ] included
because i don't know who the [ __ ] you
are all i know is is that you're doing
some [ __ ] amas on
fake [ __ ] politics so you're gonna
shut the [ __ ] up
and darth you're gonna shut the [ __ ] up
because destiny
the only [ __ ] thing i know about you
is is that you have the same name as a
[ __ ]
video game so here's what we're gonna
[ __ ] do
we're gonna unmute destiny right see
kitty as the video game okay then
we're gonna go and have this [ __ ] make
sense
right and if you don't like it get the
[ __ ] out of my server
destiny included because in case you
forgot we
are the largest politics server always
will be
we don't ask for amas people like
destiny just show up here because well
