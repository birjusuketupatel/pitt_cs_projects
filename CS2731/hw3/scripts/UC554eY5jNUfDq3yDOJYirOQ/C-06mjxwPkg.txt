fuck-boy part
for some reason I got a I was on an
airplane yesterday to fly here and I
always like really congestion before I
got on the airplane and then when I got
on the airplane and it started to go up
my ears popped and I can't unpop them so
I am like half deaf right now my left
ear is like super popped and it kind of
hurts I hurt really bad on the plane I
thought I was gonna have to call like a
paramedic but my ear is still popped so
I'm hoping that one of these days it
will unpop or I'm just gonna have to
live my life without being able to hear
again what oh did you guys go to the sky
tower when you were in Auckland do heydo
you went skydiving why would you hate
the sky tower there was a lot of people
there oh yeah like I I'm very sensitive
to capitalism she's really okay really
he's [ __ ] less tasty oh yeah what Big
Boy the tree yeah bigger trees in
America yeah we do it's okay I guess I
gave it a 6 out of 10 you touch his
cheese why don't you get more in tune
with your nature side because I am
nature Wow how do you okay
do you cry when you see lots of tourists
no ok their trunks like the what do you
call it the skin of the tree so to speak
the bark yeah the bark it can be softer
on larger trees like that I think that's
really cool because you can kind of push
in on them I feel the same way about
chocolate chip cookies sometimes when
you go to places they're very soft and
you can break it off and chew it and
other times they're very hard in the
snow ok time to keep going
[ __ ] judgmental [ __ ] going on here
there's nothing racist here at least so
that's better than Sweden where a lot of
raises Swedish sign do you think the the
golden God himself put those up wait o
Kiwis here oh my god we might have to
see this at some point I haven't seen
any Kiwis and like real ones ok but
they're special useless birds look at
how much they love the Kiwis ok
just keep that in the back of your head
we have to see this at some point today
Wow good job

what are the chances of dying on
something like that
other breaks yeah okay

people can fit in one luge it's one
person per loose can I hold the camera
and lose at the same time or will it
believe you can yeah I guess I could

plastic car that we get in and then we

aristocrat yeah and like medieval
European times and you walk out into the

crass jokes and throwing [ __ ] at each
other and like raping cows and stuff

coming on into it yeah yeah

think you've been presenting at that
often because there's still a lot of
people in switch that you know who don't
probably don't know about it yeah well

six out of that okay what would you rate
your
I'll give it a 7 I can't really taste
anything okay
okay what are we doing tonight guys what
is this what are we doing tonight this I
don't know okay wait I meant like next
like our - what are we doing tonight
well how about that I got turned up
quite a bit what would you like to do in
the next hour while we're still
streaming so I'm wondering what you're
thinking up there stream oh my god guys
they're all the way listen guys I've
been thinking about it more and more and
I really like I'm ready to go nuclear on
the makeup thing I'm like I have this
position so well thought out and it's
gonna be the perfect position because I
think a lot of my extreme lefty fans are
gonna disagree and I'm gonna bleed off a
lot of them send them off to the Sun oh
my god guys I'm ready to do this today
I'm actually like the more I think about
it the more I don't like how much people
like are crazy about how they edit
photos and like dress themselves up for
like social media I think that people
have a really unrealistic expectation of
what like a normal human being looks
like okay yeah I think it's really
really really bad sure but the problem
is like it's so hard to address it yeah
because like let's say for instance so
like the easiest people to call out are
women because they do it the most but if
you are a woman and you don't do it then
people [ __ ] on you for it so it's like a
really hard yeah because like if you're
a woman like let's say you're a woman
you're like okay well I'm not gonna wear
makeup and I'm not gonna touch my photos
I mean you post them every one of us say
you look [ __ ] too ugly so it's like
what do you do you know yeah so it's
like really difficult but then if you do
like touch up everything like you're
contributing to the culture that's like
that makes everybody have unrealistic
expectations and
it's so hard to stop things like this
huh so not saying that it's a good thing
but it's probably going to follow like
the victims responsibility to their
self-esteem oh yeah maybe but like
that's it's really hard to tell someone
else to do that you know really hey like
you need to do this order and I don't
feel comfortable like telling someone
you need to have that burden right
that's like really shitty yeah maybe I
know hard to stop things like this like
creating a culture where you well I
think like calling out guys that do it
too is really important you think yeah
the problem with my position is that
like most of the people that are gonna
agree with me you're gonna be [ __ ] in
cells so the problem is that like most
guys that say that like they like women
most guys I said they like women that
don't wear makeup like are thinking of
women how they look when they actually
have makeup haha like people will post
like pictures somebody was looking me
like pictures of what's-her-face
Lady Gaga like in a movie and they're
like oh like she looks really good here
without makeup on like every woman
should like look like this I was like
dude like she's in a [ __ ] movie like
this is not felt like she's definitely
like her face is perfectly smooth she
has no bags on her eyelid come on dude
misconception about like how people have
girls without makeup yeah but you're
really lucky here yeah real lucky we got
it no no I don't mean like that I just
mean you're lucky that nobody has the
balls to tell you how ugly you look okay
that's what I meant to say keep going
go get out of here no you're not fishing
not today not today
we did we pay No oh we should do holy
[ __ ] Oh Oh my god I'm so used to him in
