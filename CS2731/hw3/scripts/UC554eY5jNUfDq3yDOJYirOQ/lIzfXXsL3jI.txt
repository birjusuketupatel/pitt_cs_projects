before I came here okay really did you
know that the Hawaiian natives are
probably Polynesian people the same
types of people that populated New
Zealand okay yeah well I was there's a
lot of theories about how the Hawaiian
people appear like if they came from
them or if they were conquered later or
if it was like people that came over on
boats called what walk Azure walks I
think oh they don't prefer to be called
batman' [ __ ] up the video a lot about
