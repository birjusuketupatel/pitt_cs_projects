please just just let me go my capo my
overlord

i i have absolutely no idea uh one of
your dudurinos uh talked to me about a
certain report that was released about
two days ago
oh the one yeah what about it uh yeah
and it seems like you wanted to talk
about it
[ __ ] who can you tell me who this was so
i can permanently ban him for my discord
[ __ ] dude give me the name give me the
name
i thought you were in here because i
thought you wanted to talk about me
people do this dumb [ __ ] with like they
go to someone else and go like oh jesse
really wants to talk to you and then
they can be like oh that dude really
wants to talk to you
and i'm like oh okay well and then we
get here like oh what do you want to
talk about then neither person has any
idea like what
i'm i'm sorry um i mind like
come on don't put me in the spot like
this i can't like [ __ ] over someone you
know
come on was it derry d-a-r-y it was that
guy wasn't it
i i can neither confirmed it was
definitely that guy i know it was
okay what about it what do you think
about it did you read it i didn't read
it yet
yeah i actually finished reading it let
me just uh switch the volume down a
little bit give me one second
yeah so i finished reading it uh about
20 hours ago give or take um i was
incredibly disappointed
uh it's a fairly boring uh piece of
media
it's not even like a proper study it's a
research report essentially financed by
a
think tank uh done by a single
researcher
and the quality of it is like
exceptionally low and i was saying that
as
one of those evil political commentators
um i actually mean that um
the level of citations is incredibly low
she are the researcher
miss lewis doesn't really have a
theoretical framework in which she's
operating and she's just sort of
spitballing as she goes saying that hey
there's this network of people uh they
stream together i'm gonna make this
super arbitrary
definition of what constitutes this
network or not and
something something this radicalizes
people um
yeah it's it's boring it's uh
disappointing
and people shouldn't actually pay any
attention to it in my opinion
hmm interesting
like i saw a lot of the usual suspects
already kicking up like a big fuss about
it oh i saw i think it was paul joseph
watson
um already starting at twitter friends
about how this
is a centralized attempt at destroying
free speech on youtube something like
that
um if it if it is it's an exceptionally
poor one
like this really reeks of a sort of just
as i'm an amateur as a quick aside
before we dig into this nothing makes me
want to kill myself
more than conservative shits complaining
about freedom of speech
when it comes to like social media
platforms you realize how insanely
hypocritical that is right
um or i don't really deal with this
issue
enlighten me so in the united states um
freedom of speech is extended to
corporations as well right and if you're
a corporation you're not compelled to
host any sort of
like speech on your platform because the
government isn't going to make you do it
so the idea that you would be the idea
you would talk about freedom of speech
insofar as like twitter or facebook goes
it's just very strange to me because if
you want to compel them at least by the
government to not ban people off of your
platform
um i mean that's kind of a violation of
freedom of speech in and of itself
and then if you're gonna make some
argument that like it just seems weird
because anytime people have ever
complained in the past about
corporations say
polluting the environment or [ __ ]
over workers or engaging in horrible
business practices
conservatives will always say oh well
the free market will you know dictate
that somebody else will come up oh the
free market will provide a solution oh
what's wrong health care is [ __ ] well
a free market doctor will come along and
do this circuit half the cost even
though these things don't really happen
as easily as people would like them to
so it's kind of funny now that they're
getting [ __ ] over by the free market
by corporations that are too big to fail
or whatever
now all of a sudden they're crying and
screeching and ringing that some
businesses might be a little bit too
large
for the overall health of the uh i don't
know the economy or society in general
actually something really bothers me
one of the sort of common arguments you
will then hear is that
our google or twitter youtube is so big
that they stop being a private entity
and become a sort of
a network provider and sort of are a
semi-public
thingy because there is only youtube to
watch videos there's only twitter to
tweet
and therefore they have a duty to uphold
freedom of speech something like that
yeah this isn't an argument that an
intelligent person could make but if
you're a conservative you've completely
forfeit that argument because you
totally have rejected that every single
time that in the united states i'll say
not not
maybe maybe in other western countries
or not but in the u.s
conservatives constantly balk at that
idea of something is too big or
something is too monopolized or blah
blah blah blah blah
and they'll always counter with this
absurd notion this very naive
notion of like well you know a free
business will come up and will take over
if that's actually true you know if
these people are bad and they've got a
monopoly you know
um what's the thing a kid a kid in a
garage can put microsoft out of business
if he's got a good idea
right that's what conservatives always
say so so to pull the
to pull the idea out now that like well
maybe some things are actually so huge
and so like embedded in society
and even in government to some extent
that maybe we do need to bring in a
little bit of regulation here
as a conservative you've already
rejected that argument so many times in
the past i think it looks really bad to
don that hat now
you you genuinely do hate conservatives
don't you
very much so like i'm like i've moved
full on to like the political violence
level or the real violence level
when it comes to conservative people
yeah i think they need to be like excise
for my [ __ ] country
i think they are demonstrably [ __ ]
evil people by any moral system that
most people would use and then i just
hate them because they tend to destroy
the outcomes related to this country
which is what i'm concerned with yeah
absolutely uh yeah there's a topic i'm
not
yet sort of ready to touch uh you know
i'm not prepared for this topic
um but but suffice to say i'm not
opposed to uh
quote violence to be quite honest not in
not
only in this context but like generally
speaking um uh
some people are just very sort of
detrimental oh yeah but
yeah so uh we want to talk about the
report yeah sorry i kind of [ __ ]
um no problem can i start um
i'm just going to kind of like uh where
do i start do i need the introduction
here
uh from you for the report from the
report [ __ ] okay let me just start
let me just start going through this
okay are you ready okay let's see um
okay
for a short time on january 4th 2018 the
most popular livestream video on youtube
was a broadcast dominated by white
nationalists
more specifically it was a stream by
youtubers andy warski and jean velvet
facilitating a debate between a white
nationalist and a libertarian the debate
topic was scientific racism which they
refer to as a race realism a
contemporary incarnation of the
long-standing claims that there are
measurable scientific differences
between race of humans
argue in favor of scientific race and
was infamous white nationalist ritual
spencer known for having popularized the
term alt-right
ostensibly on the other side was carl
benjamin a youtuber who goes by the
student of sargon of akkad
during the broadcast the debate became
the number one trending live video
worldwide on youtube with over 10 000
active viewers the archive version of
the record has been viewed on additional
475 thousand times
four participants carried out their
debate via google hangouts the video
lasted more than four and a half hours
they would join it various times for
other youtubers
during the broadcast participants made
it arranged positions popular in white
supremacy communities using academic
terminology and treating the topics as
theoretical discourse
they discussed for example whether the
monogamy was a development of western
culture and whether their biological
qualities that constitute whiteness
spencer has had
years of experience arguing as racial
theories and spoke with more confidence
than benjamin in the live comments and
through subsequent reactions on social
media many audience members responded
positively to spencer's performance i've
never really listened as much to speak
before i said one user with the
pseudonym
nashville but it is immediately apparent
that he's on a whole different level
more broadly commenters praised the
debate and expressed excitement about
its popularity half a million views in
only three weeks i honestly think this
is a sign that people are hungry for
what's good for humanity
one commenter wrote they followed it up
by stating ethnic nationalism is freedom
for everybody
this date is part of a larger phenomenon
in which youtubers attempt to reach
young audiences by broadcasting far
right ideas in the form of news and
entertainment
an assortment of scholars media pundits
and internet celebrities are using
youtube to promote a range of political
positions for mainstream versions of
libertarianism and conservatism all the
way over to white nationalism
all the way all the way to overweight
nationalism while many of they've used
very significantly they all share a
fundamental contempt for progressive
politics
specifically for contemporary social
justice movements for this reason i
consider their collective position
reactionary as it is defined by its
opposition to visions
of social progress uh united in the
standpoint of these youtubers frequently
collaborate with and appear with others
across ideological lines
together they have created a fully
functioning media system that i call the
alternative influence network
um okay i'll stop kind of like page to
page is there anything in here that you
like disagree with so far or
well there's actually uh two things um
that are i think
sort of interesting to talk about sure
um the first one is
the entire framing of this uh research
paper of this report
um uh the researcher is very specific
about uh
already trying to paint this picture um
it's bad
that sargon of akkad someone that's not
sort of educated in the question of race
realism
had a race realist or a racist on his
googling thingy
because this gives the alt-right
platform this lets the
alt-right win um the problem here is
that
sure you can't expect hardcore citations
directly in the introduction
but it would be nice if she was already
giving us a sort of framework
uh um i'm following a agenda sitting at
a framing narrative unfolding a priming
narrative some sort of theoretical
framework because
uh all she did so far in the interaction
is say hey there was this one stream
i did not like that stream um and i have
a few comments
few just free i think it's three or two
comments something like that
to sort of bolster my narrative that is
a somewhat
weak start off to a report because it
doesn't actually
uh suggest any sort of empirical
findings okay sure
um i would agree that the empirical
findings thus far are pretty weak the
only real numbers we've been given are
the amount of views on a youtube video
and a couple of comments which aren't
necessarily representative
um but i will take issue with a couple
things you said here
so um i think that her claim that it's
bad that sargon mccod had a race real
estate on his google hangout
stems more from the fact that he seemed
ill-equipped to debate that point
and i think that her supporting
arguments here were the ideas
[Music]
spencer has had years of debating
spencer's had years of experience
arguing his racial theories and spoke
with more confidence than benjamin in
the live comments and through subsequent
reactions to social media
many audience members responded
positively to spencer's performance um
this word
many is a little weasely maybe if there
would have been some sort of polling or
something it would have been better
maybe it would actually be better to
refer to the um
let's see spencer versus sargon youtube
video maybe it would actually be better
although it's still kind of uh to refer
to the likes the thumbs up and the
thumbs down on the video
because i see that the video is thumbs
down one point six thousand times and
thumbs up seventeen thousand times
so maybe um appealing to something like
this and the top rated comments might be
a little bit more data driven
so like this top comment here uh past
sticks and hammer who's an e celebrity
right this top comment here oh my god i
rewatched this sargon it's just
embarrassing himself and making himself
look like a coward
a shill or just a [ __ ] not sure which
um styx and richard are like two phds
having a debate in a college bar and
sargon is a local drunk chick who didn't
finish high school
i think that reading these comments and
going by the fact that they have the
most thumbs up on a video that's
overwhelmingly like
i think would strengthen her argument
here do you agree or disagree
okay i fully agree uh i i do think that
it would be better
but uh arguably the best way to do this
would be to actually do a content
analysis of the comments that are done
under the video uh because
uh even looking at the top video top
comments right is definitely better than
looking at just
some comments it's not the ideal that
you should strive for if you're making
a sort of if you're trying at least to
form this seminal work that's
breaching the the hidden layer of the
intellectual dark web
if you catch my drift sure um
i think that digging into more data is
good i'm not sure if going by analyzing
every comment is
the best i think that thumbs up is
probably better um for a variety of
reasons i would have to get really heavy
into the data to really understand this
and i could be wrong but like here's
like a possible hypothesis that could
throw this off right
perhaps people that disagreed with
spencer are more motivated to leave a
comment but people that agreed with
spencer are more motivated to thumbs up
a comment right
things like that could throw off our
analysis maybe we analyze 20 000
comments 18 000 of them are [ __ ] on
spencer
but the 2000 they get upvoted or all of
the other people that agree with him
that come on right
so but i do agree that the data could be
a little bit heavier here um i'm willing
to be a little bit charitable just
because we're kind of like establishing
our framework and we're not really
digging into the meat of the article yet
so she's just kind of like setting up
her
you know i guess her thesis or whatever
in the beginning so i'm willing to go a
little bit light but i can understand
kind of the irritation of this being
pretty light on the data or the
empiricism or whatever
sure um okay um
cool all right i'm gonna read the
studying for the next page
um the content creators and the ain
claim to provide an alternative media
source for viewers to obtain news and
political commentary outside of legacy
news outlets such as cable channels and
print media
with this positioning they're
capitalizing on a changing news and
information environment youtube has
become a crucial site for broadcasting
political news related content
the 2018 pew research center report
found that 73 of us adults visit youtube
but the percentage rising to 94
for the 18 to 24 year old demographic as
of 2017 youtube fell behind only
facebook as the social network most
popular for viewing news stories
simultaneously trust in mainstream media
outlets is continually in decline with
only 32 percent of americans claiming to
trust the media in a 2016 gallup poll
the ain also relies on youtube's ability
to support a type of micro celebrity
that is niche celebrities who are well
known within specific communities the
platform's motto broadcast herself
encourages individuals build audiences
and promote themselves outside of the
