do you believe that um uh uh politics is
inherently violent
it depends on your definition of
violence but depending on how you define
it sure
because i feel like a lot of people a
lot of centrists
idealize this notion of political
dysphor of course
being able to um be hashed out in this
sort of neutral
arena where only uh rhetoric matters
but in reality and i can say this very
authoritatively because
right sorry i thought i had to i ate an
enormous amount of beans before coming
here it was a um
another power play on my part i thought
it would give me confidence
um and i can say this with a degree of
authority because all sociological and
political science evidence backs this
assertion up
politics is already a game of violence
when like like political organization
is based around who has the ability to
force whom else to do what
um even acts of violence which are
engaged in legally
um if facilitated through the political
system
could already argue to be argued to be
unjust because they are engaged in
through a mode of um
uh um organization which many people
consider to be illegitimate
i don't think there's any way to engage
in advocacy for a movement in a
non-violent way
but i feel like the myth that you can do
so
inherently hampers the left because the
right has never
operated under such a delusion nobody on
the alt-right
believes that they can achieve their
glorious ethnic state in a way which
truly complies with the ethics of a free
society
yeah they're all across the finally
they're starting to abandon that
thank god they were more honest it's
actually one of the most refreshing
things i would rather deal with a
literal neo-nazi today than a
conservative from 10 [ __ ] years ago
like it's refreshing when somebody says
like i don't care about democracy
or i'm not going to pretend that i want
equal rights or minorities like and like
the the the lack of dog whistling and
the
and the upfrontness of other beliefs is
a little refreshing to me but yeah i
know i know
i agree completely at what point do we
just get to shoot them and i'm not being
facetious there
when a person and you believe in and uh
what do you call it reciprocatory
the the social contract the way that my
moral system works is that i will
reciprocate values with people who will
reciprocate with me this is where my
my my tenuous uh justification for
eating meat comes from
right that animals will not and cannot
reciprocate values with me so i can
slaughter and eat them right this is how
all my whole moral system is built and
so this would be the idea between like
if somebody
you know threatens violence against me
then i can threaten violence or kill
them right because
they're not reciprocating my value
system um so if i'm
encountering somebody that won't
reciprocate i guess some but it would
have to be part of my value system
that's important enough not to
to to warrant that response so for
instance like i wouldn't appreciate a
stranger coming up to me and hugging me
but if one came up and hugged me that
would be not reciprocating my value
system but i wouldn't i don't think i
would be
morally um able to like you could
probably come back
yeah but like i wouldn't be able to kill
that person so like i don't know what
the i don't know where the line is i
have to think about it more i'm not sure
okay like until the problem is hey yeah
well until a few weeks ago like there
there are certain fundamental core
beliefs that i have about people in
general
um god maybe this sounds a little anne
frankish but like i believe that every
person
them has the potential to do almost
anything to be like the 99th percentile
and anything if they put their mind to
it
um i think that most people are capable
of achieving
or aspiring to much higher things than
most people are even aware of
and that includes like logical rational
thought but over the past month when
i've engaged with people like jf
or andy warski not even as much but
people like the ian chang guy
right there the tonka guy like these are
people that are so
[ __ ] far gone that like if they got
if something bad happened to them for
like politically related [ __ ]
i don't even know if i would give a [ __ ]
like i don't even know if i would call
that out if
like it would just be like these are the
representatives of their movement too
yeah
people that are posting about me on pole
or kiwi farms or any of that [ __ ] so
yeah i don't know i'm not sure these
people are scarcely human
in your debate with vegan gains you said
that because you believe and i'm gonna
keep using social construct
contract real quick just because we're
bringing this up and because we're
bringing his name up in the vein of
everybody else i thought the vegan gains
guy i don't know much about him but he
seemed
reasonably intelligent i feel like i
could have a conversation with him about
anything even though i think he's like a
huge anti-sjw
i've never talked to him about those
views but i feel like we could have like
an intelligent conversation about him
being an anti-sjw
i just wanted to make a reasonable
person yeah no he seemed quite
reasonable in this discussion with you
and i feel like you took a pretty hard
argument to defend because
in the um in the uh at least in the
philosophical communities which with
which i am familiar
online and on my campus veganism is
almost accepted as axiomatically of
course morally correct well to be honest
you necessitate virtue yeah to be to be
a meat eater you have to reject some
very basic parts of your humanity
because we're hardwired for empathy
including
animal empathy it's just something we're
hardwired for you know if you show like
a four or five year old a cat or a dog
being tortured
and you can hear it screaming and crying
like you have like natural human
responses to that
and if you want to take like the
meat-eating argument you have to be like
a beacon of rationality that has no
emotion
and it makes a lot of people really
uncomfortable so yeah that's not
surprising to me
and i'm sure i'm sure you understood
that in that debate your actual
practical real-life world uh
views divorced somewhat from the hyper
intellectual robot position you had to
take
consistently for me no no for me not at
all
but i understand that that's something
that i've had to come to terms with over
the past few years
um well i won't hold you to it sure but
in your discussion with him in your
social contract memes
he posed to you the question that if you
discovered an undiscovered indigenous
people
living right we're right and they were
absolutely incapable of respecting the
social
contract you would be okay with gunning
them all down
yes correct because i would consider
that to be something different than
human
in terms i guess insofar as how i define
humanity right and to an
extent i agree with that i think that uh
and now obviously that's an extreme
hypothetical i don't think things have
ever played out that way in real life
though
and let me be clear the reason why this
is an extreme hypothetical is because i
don't believe there are groups of humans
that are incapable of reciprocating some
sort of value system i don't think that
those types of groups of humans have
ever existed in the history of all of
mankind
what about people who have um uh cast
aside the belief
in fundamental human equality in
treating drugs
and treating those justly and free
speech in in um
in a free trial under the law i'm
talking about nazis
i'm talking about people who and yeah
you know what couple of them could be
uh could be convinced otherwise a lot of
them could given enough time and effort
but they pose a very real political
threat to our country and to our planet
now
and i feel like they have very willingly
cast aside many of the axiomatic
principles
that we base our social values yeah sure
and i'm sorry
i was speaking i was speaking i was
speaking specifically in terms of like
encountering people in the past
sorry that's like encountering tribes of
people i don't want somebody to take
that statement and be like oh so you
think the aboriginals should have been
slaughtered in australia or the native
americans should have been or the
you know the aztecs or the you know i'm
not saying that no no no i understand
also
also you know historically for the most
part aboriginal groups have actually
been extremely friendly and welcoming
to um to to like westerners who
uh approach them for the most part there
are exceptions but i mean you know
curiosity beckons these folks tend to be
dark skinned you see some
pale folk come on curiosity i think
overwhelms the um uh tribesmen desire to
fire arrows at
unfamiliar things walking towards them
for the most part
anyway so nazis
we've got people who have willingly cast
aside the axioms upon which we base a
free society
ones that you and i both hold extremely
dear fundamental belief in human
equality
um uh an equal treatment free speech
fair treatment under the law
these people have done so willingly and
they were born with the tools
to make better decisions with their
political ideology growing up though
of course you know nobody really makes
choices on but yeah because
i'm not that hard-line determinism but
yeah but we can speak about it
i understand what you're saying go ahead
right but i mean
at what point do you recognize the
decisions these people have made and the
political threat that they pose to the
nation to the world to their neighbors
at what point does it become severe
enough that you have to
accept the necessity of extra
extra legal forms of violence i'm
stepping and i think you and i agree
at least to some extent on the legal
[ __ ] here but really
punching nazis where what's
discuss i'm not sure i need to talk to
richard spencer i feel like if i tweeted
him he'd do it i don't know i mean
probably
uh it's you know today is the uh one
year anniversary of him getting punched
it's the puncheversary some [ __ ]
[ __ ] tweeted at me and they were
sent me a dm and they wanted me to
moderate a discussion between
her and spencer uh i don't know why
would you why would anyone call you in
as a moderator i don't
i mean i could moderate really well i
think i can moderate very well yeah of
course it's just
getting people to clarify their points i
think i understand people's arguments
generally better than other people do
because i'm not like too busy trying to
scream down the other person um
i think i could make a pretty good
moderator but i don't know this person
got like hardcore triggered i guess
because i didn't know who she was so i
don't know
can we get you to moderate the next um
uh set of primary debates
in um in 2020 i would really appreciate
never be allowed to do that
that'd be fun though yeah that would be
fun the
uh okay i feel like you kind of ducked
out of that though i feel like we're on
the cusp of a revelation
punching nazis oh yeah i'm not sure i
have to
i guess i have to think about it more i
don't know i feel like
um what i say in this regard might be
delegitimized slightly because you know
that i'm a political radical but i've
shifted a fair degree away from
authoritarianism
over the past couple of years i try to
think of
political violence in a more practical
sense now in regards to what kind of
societal behaviors are being encouraged
when you engage in those forms of
political violence
the the nazis in this country um
excluding those which are embedded in
the government and in the police force
of which there are many
the ones who are just your rank and file
citizens the people who
have the exact same legal rights as me
these people are for the most part
uneducated confused and scared um
that like oh yeah my the
the problem that i have with everything
is the it's the lack of an objective
morality this is just where i become
uncomfortable
making all of this so like so like let's
like i can give a few hypotheticals
where i'm okay with punching richard
spencer okay
if everybody shared my moral system
um i would be so much quicker to jump on
board with political violence
i would i would do it in a heartbeat if
i knew that most people or all people in
the united states shared my
moral system then i would endorse
political violence and extra legal
violence 100
because i would know for sure that the
only people they would be targeting
would be people that i would
morally deem unworthy of moral
consideration i was i used moral twice
there but like people that i would deem
unworthy of moral consideration
um and in that case i would say
fine go for it because because the
people that are that the violence is
being enacted on don't aren't worthy of
moral consideration
however um the problem is that when i
come out if i say something like i'm
okay with richard spencer being punched
i would have to add that caveat because
there are a lot of people that would
want to punch him
who would want to punch a whole bunch of
other people were that i wouldn't be
okay with punching does that make sense
no i agree completely and that's what i
mean by what kind of behaviors you'd be
encouraged
if you start punching people you
disagree with and for and and for
all of the things richard spencer has
done and said and for all the arguments
i could make against
his uh political views at the end of the
day
i disagree with him is about all i can
say in regards to justification for
punching him on like a one-on-one
in a vacuum context wait can you wait
i'm sorry can you repeat that
oh i mean to say that at the end of the
day
regardless of the reasons for why i
punched richard spencer and regardless
of how odious his political beliefs are
it would be seen as an act of me
punching somebody i disagree with
and that would implicitly encourage the
punching of people other people don't
disagree with oh sure i'm one of those
people
people don't disagree yeah i agree i
agree okay
i haven't gotten punched in the face
since like eighth grade i don't know if
i could take the hit that well to be
perfectly honest
right getting punched kind of kind of
hurts it's not like in the movies right
no you got punched recently not recently
but if you get hit in the face you're
out pretty quick yeah
yeah it kind of hurts i mean i'm a
pretty big guy i feel like i just could
knock the [ __ ] over though i don't want
to get punched in the face
but i want other people to get punched
in the face so
i've had to develop a and you know
pardon me for sound of pretentious
i've had to develop a um
a set of principles and of
ways in which those principles could be
practically enacted
um which allow for the punching of nazis
and don't allow for the punching of me
and my soft jaw and i feel like these
are reconcilable concepts i feel like
even in the absence of a system with
objective morality
it's still very possible to
collectively agree upon certain criteria
against which
um you're more justified
in engaging in political violence or do
you disagree with that do you think that
there's
no way to hammer out a set of like
informal rules like yes these are the
people that should be targeted these are
the people who should not
i mean you can't we've already done it
to some extent with our legal system
right when you talk about things like
murder or stealing or espionage or
something right
what if well that's yeah and i i think
that's actually kind of the point i was
going to get to
uh i consider it uh simply a matter of
self defense and i feel like this is a
justifiable
stance to take because it fits in line
with a set of legal uh concepts that we
already have in place now
if a nazi goes out and advocates for
xenophobia
advocates for racism advocates for white
nationalism advocates for the
deportation of people they disagree with
that is an expression of political
violence i notice you give mob
status to
actually relatives women they don't
deserve to go in these bathrooms and if
you go in the bathroom that you believe
isn't the one in which they belong
you're free to beat them up these people
are engaging in political violence
and violence can be defended against
acts of violence against those people
aren't retaliatory they're defensive uh
i saw you shake your head on stream oh
