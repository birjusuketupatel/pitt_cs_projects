what's going on fam what is good
happy uh 2018. it is uh january 5th
we have a uh very special guest today
on the baked alaska show it's uh a
person probably a lot of you know
uh he likes to debate right wing people
i guess that that's sort of how i know
him but i'm gonna ask him some more
questions
uh and get to know him so the way i
found out
uh about destiny was actually uh when i
was
hanging out with ice poseidon on a
stream and one of his guys came up he's
like oh you gotta
debate destiny and all that stuff so um
and he and he tweeted from my phone so
i'm not at like a huge debater so
i the topic i chose is that we debate
star wars because it because i
i'm not i'm not some like super serious
guy here i'm a comedian i'm funny you
know
i have my views i like to play video
games but
so we're going to make we're going to
debate star wars so but before that i
just wanted to
get to know destiny a little bit because
i haven't talked to him before
and asked him some questions and and he
also there's a video if you guys haven't
seen
he gave ice poseidon uh advice about his
streaming community when he was sort of
[ __ ] up
and i will never forget that video is
just really solid good advice so this
dude
you know whether you like him or not has
experience in the streaming community
and so
i look up to that for sure so uh welcome
destiny to the show
hey welcome me thank you welcome you to
my show and yeah what's up
just chilling just chilling man so uh
what have you been playing these days
uh mainly a horrible game called league
of legends and then a couple of solo
player games
every single oh dude league of legends
is not a terrible game i love league of
legends
then it's horrible what do you mean i
don't know
that that's pretty much my favorite game
right now i mean the meta the met is
kind of shitty right now
i will admit that but what do you like
do you play ranked or whatever
yeah what like rank are you um
i'm like a challenger
so does that mean gold or silver or what
plat oh okay that's not too bad no no no
i'm uh i'm silver for
oh i'm in here well you're trying i'm
trying i'm not that good but i'm like
i don't know i enjoy i play i like
jungle a lot
i've been playing um the [ __ ] out of
warwick warwick jungle is pretty op
right now
and um and then a lot of adc so gin i've
been playing gin
jinx ash there's a ton of adc but
mainly i do adc and jungle but my best
character right now
is definitely warwick the warwick jungle
it's just
just crazy what about you um yeah i
normally play 80k
um who do you play uh right now i'm
doing tristana
um tris is super op i always i usually
ban tris
it's it's ridiculous the i thought the
worlds were really good this year
they haven't been good for the last
couple years but i i enjoyed the world
so that's cool though i'm glad you play
league i uh we should play sometime i'll
put my uh
here's my league name
you sure you do you share your league
name publicly or is that private
um yeah i mean i kind of have to right
because i'm streaming so people can
always see it
punish destiny okay cool yeah i'll add
you after this that's cool man
so um yeah more about you so
i just want to ask you like so who
exactly are you i mean the way i
described you
is i i i know you've debated some of my
friends you like to debate right wingers
you obviously don't like trump like
where
when did you start streaming and how did
like video games turn into politics i
guess i
i'm pretty curious about that um
i guess i've always been i've been
screaming for a long time i was one of
the first professional streamers i've
been doing it for
probably over seven years now um
the um i've always always kind of talked
about other stuff
on my stream like philosophy or psych or
ethics or politics or whatever
and then during the 2016 election season
um that thing during that whole ordeal
the political talk really picked up
and i noticed a lot of other people
doing politics on youtube and i felt
like a lot of it was kind of dumb
so i decided to jump into it so now i
split my time up between gaming and
politics kind of 50 50.
okay that's cool so what like what is
your
w would it be correct to say that you
hate trump or
or what is your feelings on trump um
yeah i guess you could probably say that
i think that everything he's done is
pretty bad i don't well
i don't know if i would say i hate trump
i think trump is really stupid um and
pretty ineffective as a leader and then
obviously ideologically we're opposed on
a lot of different grounds as well so
whatever you want to take from that you
think he's pretty stupid you think he
eats too much mcdonald's drinks too much
diet coke i don't
know about any of that i just think that
his answer to every question related to
anything more complicated than
like somebody how do you know he's not
playing 4d chess buddy how do you know
he's not
taking you for a whirl there well
because there's been no indication that
he has
i guess i mean i think 4d chess would
have had you know like
i feel like it would have been less
disastrous in office by now if that was
true but
i mean some raspberries dude i'm on this
like all fruit diet
all fruit isn't that like a ton of sugar
i'm doing like it's like all fruit
during the day until like 6 p.m
and then you can like eat a bomb meal
you can eat whatever you want but i'm
during like the fruit
only portion and so
it's hard i'm struggling here i'm like
eating this thing raspberries
um gotcha yeah so
so you think trump is not smart so you
think
what you're telling me is you think
someone who isn't smart can become
the president of the united states yeah
i mean it's not like you have to take an
iq test to become president i mean
people like ben carson and
jeb bush well i don't know if jeb bush
is an idiot but people like ben carson
and whatnot we're running
um carson is super smart dude what are
you talking about i mean he's smart when
it comes to
probably like neurosurgery but outside
of that he said some pretty dumb things
do you think he's not smart because he's
black why is that i
i mean i don't think i said that i
listed jeb bush as well and i don't
think
that sounds a little racist destiny i
mean i'm trying to keep things
i'm trying to keep an open playing field
and just you know consider everyone's
feelings and not just like look at the
race i think ben carson is a
very intelligent man okay i mean i guess
i would disagree i haven't really seen
outside of his neurosurgery practice i
haven't really seen any evidence of that
seems like he's pretty lost in his whole
uh hud position and yeah
during the nomination he said a lot of
really dumb things so
i yeah he he has said some dumb things
i'll give you that i'm just messing with
you but um
we got a super chat here uh james laurie
thank you he said
destiny could be part of your daytime
diet ooh
looks like that's a dig so how tall are
you i've i've heard rumors you were five
one yeah i mean what what what are the
official stats
i'm not actually even sure anymore um
so if i stand next to a wall and i put
like a ruler on there
it says that i'm five eight but so many
people online say so many different
things i kind of
start to wonder i'm not sure if maybe my
measurement devices are a little bit
messed up i might be five two i might be
four six i might be a dwarf i'm not
actually even sure
well 5 8 is not bad that's not i don't
even think you're in manlet status but
for some reason
everyone kept saying you were like 5-1
yeah i don't i'm not sure i guess when
you run out of real arguments you kind
of go to the
go to the random things maybe go to the
ad hominems yeah that's true
so real quick i wanted to ask some
advice i i know you guys uh you know
want me to go at it with destiny
um and we'll get there we'll get there
to the star wars bit but
what i want to get some advice from you
because i i do
look up to you as a streamer we might
not agree politically but um
what advice could you give me sort of
lately
i feel like i don't know if you can uh
relate to this but
i've had a lot a lot of my community it
seems like it's almost like
weekly now it's just like there's a lot
of discord drama
there's a lot of people that don't like
certain people that are like
i'm not going to be in the community if
these people are there and there seems
to be a lot of
stuff like that that goes on kind of
frequently as
seems to happen online and trying to
make
peace with everyone like i've sort of
just i don't know i i always feel like
i'm always disappointing
some people and i'm trying to keep rules
and keep like standards because you know
i don't want
people in my community that are complete
[ __ ] and are just going to be toxic
and all that so what advice could you
give me as far as how to
like sort out the toxic people from your
community but without being
like a dick about because i do like free
speech and i do like to allow
people with different opinions in my
community i
i mean i don't know too much about your
stuff but but i know a little bit about
it
don't you do like um and i don't mean
like an install by this don't you do
like a lot of like really edgy
like racial related kind of
charlottesville stuff
didn't you weren't you involved in a lot
of this kind of stuff i'm not i'm not
super edgy no
not at all not even a little edgy
the only reason i bring it up is not to
like not to insult you whatever but like
i mean if you build a community around
like really edgy content like that like
if you
if you draw a lot of viewers from like
like pole esque places or like the
donald esque places
like then you would expect that to
manifest in your community in dramatic
ways right
you think the donald is edgy yeah
i'd say a little edgy yeah a little edgy
a little edgy okay
or maybe very edgy yeah i get i guess
i'm edgy i guess i'm edgy
uh but yes no no i was i was at
charlottesville for sure i think i think
the public perception of me
definitely is that i'm edgy but i think
when you sit down and talk to me or get
to know me i'm really not that edgy
so you know i i believe in free speech i
believe
being able to talk on a stage with
people you
don't fully agree with and i think
that's totally fine
and i think you know if you know what
happened to me at charlottesville i got
attacked by antifa
so i showed up i showed up to speak at a
free speech rally they had a
permit for the rally and i was invited
and there was
various types of people it wasn't some
scary kkk rally like
the media reported and uh you know there
were some stupid people there of course
i would agree with that
uh but there was also some good people
there wait wasn't charlottesville
the literal like nazis that
you're are you joking i i can't tell if
you're being serious wait i thought that
i'm pretty sure charlottesville had
literal
self-described you know it was not no
it's not a nazi rally no wait are you
sure about this positive yeah i was
there were you there
i i wasn't there but every article that
i read on this described it and i think
the organizers were
yes you you read fake news destiny
that's what happened that's what
happened
so that's the big misunderstanding there
were people
sure about this i'm positive yes i was
invited and other people were invited
that are definitely not nazis i'm not a
nazi
and well not every single person there
might have been a nazi but it
but it's not a nazi rally it was not a
kkk rally it was a it was a free speech
rally
is the point were there people there
that are national socialists that showed
up
yes there were some people that showed
up their national socialist
there were apparently some kkk people
aren't they literally
chanting like blood and soil and jews
will not replace us
i was at the i was at the torchlit rally
i never heard wait the
tiki torch rally oh i was i was at the
famous tiki torch
rally baby yes okay i never heard
i never heard that i never i heard you
will not replace us
which is a demographic uh immigration
debate uh for another day but
i don't think there's anything wrong
with saying you will not replace us
which to me means
uh we want to keep the demographics
majority whites
and because that's how our country was
founded just like in japan
they want to keep it majority japanese
and i don't think there's anything
wrong with that it doesn't mean i hate
other people or don't want other people
to be here i just want to keep the
majority
okay well so like if we're talking about
like keeping the demographics majority
white and stuff
aren't we aren't we getting kind of
close to nazism there
like a certain race of people should be
you know upheld
in terms of like our you know not at all
not even a little bit not even just a
little itty bitty
nope not at all you're stretching okay
because when somebody
takes a country that's pretty that would
be destiny that would be like saying
uh japan are nazis they have 98.4
ethnic japanese there so i think the
japanese are nazi's destiny
kind of yeah japan is one of the
israelites
well japan has some of like the worst
like treatment of like other people
in in the world it's actually like a
really well documented thing like
destiny take it back you just
you just said a thing that is gonna be
this is a meme right now
anna the anime fans are never gonna uh
forgive you for this man
okay you better think about what you're
saying i mean i'm thinking about it but
i'm pretty sure that japan is like one
of the most racist countries on the
planet or at least it was five or ten
years ago i don't know how they've made
progress
so okay so japan is nazis okay so
israel they also have a high pretty high
ethnic
uh jewish population so are they not i
mean i am
you're i'm you're not going to find a
defender of israel here i'm not a big
fan of the way israel conducts itself so
are you what what does that mean that so
you're anti-semitic
no i just i think the whole israel
palestine thing is really [ __ ] up
you're not a fan of israel not not
really no
so you're not a fan of the semitic
israel that would be anti-semitic
correct am i am i reading you correctly
to be anti-semitic i would have to not
like israel because they're jewish
i don't really care that they're jewish
i just don't know why don't you like
israel i don't know it seems like they
bully those poor little palestinian
dudes around quite a bit
i'll tell you why i you know i i have a
love hate relationship there you know
like
as far as making jerusalem the capital i
have no problem with that
as far as them existing i have no
problem with that um but
us giving them boatloads of money
constantly
when we get nothing in return i i think
that's a shitty deal and i think that's
a shitty deal with
um any country sure well i mean we we
we're interested in
like um geographic influence right it's
like probably one of the big reasons why
we're fans of israel
unless you believe that the jews are
secretly controlling us to be big fans
of israel i'm not sure how
far down that route you are or road you
are but
i mean everything is a jewish conspiracy
i mean that's
just obvious you know ice beside and
he's not
trolling he's like 27 and he's pretty
greedy
it's impossible to tell if you're being
serious because there are a lot of
people that really believe this
well okay wait so i i don't i don't
think the jews control everything
um quite a bit of stuff i think they
have an over
proportionate uh amount of influence in
our media i would agree with that
okay well hey so if you thought what do
you think about that
i'm serious i'm just curious if you if
somebody told you that they were
marching with
tiki torches and they were chanting you
will not replace us and they were really
concerned with the demographics and they
also thought that jews had a
