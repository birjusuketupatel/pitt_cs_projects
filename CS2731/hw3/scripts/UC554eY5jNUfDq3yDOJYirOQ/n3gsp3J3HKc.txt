hey steven
hey what's up can you hear me right now
yep i can hear you loud and clear all
right awesome i'm sorry for some reason
my internet's been i don't want it so
i'm at a starbucks right now so if i
need to sneak up just let me know okay
yeah yeah i've been there myself no
problem
all right so um how you doing buddy
doing well uh i i've seen you debate a
lot of uh a lot of uh trump supporters
and
um you kind of make mince meat of these
people a lot of times i don't think
they're really
equipped to have a conversation with you
about politics or economics or whatever
the subject of the day is just browsing
through some of these videos and it was
pretty
pretty
insane to see kind of
wait i think you might cut out just at
the end there hello
uh can you hear me oh i can hear you
right now all right yeah yeah so it's i
i think that uh i'll be particularly
better equipped to you know talk to you
about i mean
i think that a lot of the confusion with
regards to economics is
separating trump's rhetoric from his
actual
economic principles or dogmas or
whatever you'd want to call them uh but
there's there's one group of people that
seem to be particularly good at doing so
and that's people that actually bet on
the market every day uh like i did
and
it's my living to
you know figure out what's real and
what's not and what
what it's going to do and what he's not
going to do
and really the extent to which that has
any impact on what's happening in the
world
uh a lot of people have this idea both
negative that that trump is some kind of
magic force going to the direction of
world markets and
it's really misplaced faith in some
cases and misplaced blame in other cases
um
you know like people predicted this
whole inflation trade as a result of
trump
none of that happened it's not as if
trump is going to change the trend of
global
hold on one second
okay i'm sorry they were grinding
something in the background um you
stopped at reddit it's not like trump is
going to change and then it yeah i mean
it's like people predicted that just
because trump happens to be the guy in
the office of obama that you know
inflation would jump from one percent to
three percent and and
global bond markets would sell off
massively and that's just a ridiculous
concept i mean it you know that trump
decides things that are in the realm of
billions of dollars over atoms
um you know when you think about
something like infrastructure spending
if that's really done big i mean if they
just decide that they're gonna do a
massive infrastructure bill you're
talking about a trillion dollars
and in the grand scheme of the global
markets that's not even that much money
um you know every day on the the new
york stock exchange
seven or eight trillion dollars worth of
apple stock alone trades hands um so so
this idea that
that you know trump is going to have a
profound impact on
on economics globally whether or that
trump is some kind of you know anti-adam
smith mercantilist protectionist kind of
person is just is is completely
misplaced
you know where the protectionist kind of
claims come from right
well there's there's certain there's
certain things that poll well okay and
whether you're a democrat or republican
buy american hire american hashtags
whatever you want to call them slogans
these are things that pull very well and
if you want to be elected president and
do whatever it is you want to do these
are things that you should say so trump
needed to say that he was going to put
like a 20 tariff on mexican products or
that he was going to try to tear up
other countries in an attempt to bring
back manufacturing do you think this
would just pull tested ideas
i think that i think these these are
full tested ideas that that do very well
politically speaking okay i guess
yeah so so with with regards to like how
that how that kind of
plays down to policy um
you know the real question is and you
know what's kind of given rise to trump
is that
you know globalization has won in terms
of the the global war ideas just like
capitalism is one i mean the the only
there's basically one country two
countries maybe that don't participate
in in a globalized economy that would be
cuba now and in north korea
ideology um so
the idea that that protectionism is a
thing first of all is kind of misplaced
um but the the debate is how do you
manage the downsides of globalization
because there there are downsides i mean
too many people have this this concept
that
certain things are all good or all bad
like like you talk to people they say
immigration is all bad or you talk to
others they say immigration is all good
have open borders don't do anything
about inspiration and i mean i'm just
not to cut you straight i'm pretty sure
i'm gonna agree with everything you're
gonna say right there are some people
that are disproportionately impacted by
certain globalist policies a lot of
these disenfranchised people voted for
trump to alleviate their concerns and
went out i don't discourage any of this
for sure
yeah so so but the question is how do
you how do you manage that because there
are ways that you can manage the
downside uh you know in in democrats
case they they had you know these these
rinky-dink programs that that were
supposedly going to turn full motors
into you know solar panel insulation
and magically these people would would
make as much money again
uh we've seen from empirical data that
retraining is very very difficult to do
and maybe even impossible for people you
know like past 30 40 years old you're
not going to retrain a somebody working
in a factory to be like an engineer or a
software dev
yeah and and if you were going to even
think about doing so you would have to
spend 10 times as much money as
anybody's even thinking about spending i
mean these are
this would be an undertaking
the likes of which has has never been
done in the united states um
you know these are things that they do
and kind of command and control
economies like china very regularly uh
where they move into a village and say
you're not a farmer anymore go do this
uh but in the united states it would
just be incredibly tough to do that um
it would have to take place over
multiple generations and
you know spending the money would be uh
would be a perilous
task because you may spend
half a trillion dollars doing that and
it just it just might not work it just
might fail
so i don't necessarily disagree with
this um all of these opinions sound
really reasonable i guess um
the thing that kind of confuses me um
kind of the precursor to our initial uh
this conversation and kind of in terms
of reading your twitter um i'm really
curious what you think trump has done so
far in terms of policy that's actually
impacted the markets because it seems
like i don't know if your twitter
persona is a little different than your
normal persona but it seems like you
have a lot of
confidence that trump has enacted some
policy or done something that have
dramatically moved the markets yeah so
so just in terms of in so there's a
couple of things that i'll that'll
happen there and just be just because
it's in the news i think that it makes
sense to start with the fed chairman
pick um it looks like that's going to be
jerome powell uh guys that i really
respect like chuck gunlock got this
totally wrong and thought that trump
would
would bring in neil kashkari or some of
these other figures that the betting
odds and the market just didn't suggest
were possible picks um and when you talk
about the fed chair a lot of people
don't think about this but the
the fed chair in many ways is sort of
like
a supreme court pick in the way that it
totally transcends
the the power of the presidency it has
almost nothing to do with the day-to-day
operations of the presidency and yet
it's so important because if you get
another 2008 trump's not going to fix
that
congress isn't going to fix it the
stimulus package in 08 was a was
basically a bust it came down to the fed
lowering interest rates to zero and
injecting funny money into the economy
and it worked i mean they put the
economy and the markets on heroin they
drove down interest rates and they
forced people into risk assets when
people are forced into risk assets they
stopped saving they start spending it
works i mean it's it's a pretty
documented
uh agreeable strategy
now hispanic and jerome powell
represents somebody who
is sort of a janet yellen-esque type of
pick in the sense that he's very
dovish generally speaking when it comes
to raising interest rates he's not one
of these
economic militants that thinks you need
to jack up the the base rate to three
percent overnight because
xyz and it's not even worth discussing
what the xyz is um but he's different in
the sense that
he very much seems to be somebody who's
more along the lines of a rules-based uh
monetary policy whether that rather than
janet yellen which is which is much more
kind of just blowing in the wind and you
know this month she might want to raise
rates but maybe not
and and we'll see but she won't do it
unless the market bets on it and so
people will just manipulate the the
libor market to you know
dictate what janet yellen is going to do
i mean her her policy is it's worked
fine i think that she's done a fine job
i don't have any major issues with her
uh but
we need to we need to get things sped up
in terms of raising rates because if you
get another 2008
and rates are at you know 75 basis
points on on the floor rate for the fed
or they're at you know one percent it's
going to be really tough to do anything
about the situation uh and we're going
to be in a situation like europe where
you have negative interest rates which
would be
fundamentally something that i think is
agreeably
sure and i don't disagree with any of
this but um yeah so and then as far as
like trump impacting the the economy
that like i don't think a potential
yeah
the fed chair pick is is one thing um
but in terms of in terms of other
policies that i that i think are
favorable uh to the economy um
in terms of
getting things done um he's made very
clear that you know while well he may
not be you know the the
sort of caricature protectionist that
the media makes him out to be he's he's
very willing to
walk away from deals
um and on the foreign policy stage with
respect to things like the iran deal you
can't really do that right i mean it's
not
the iran deal is not like a new york
real estate deal where if you don't like
it you just you just walk away yeah
weakens the ability for america to make
deals because then everything looks like
we could walk back on it
well and and and the alternatives with
respect to
those types of foreign policy
implications are are very
dire when you talk about war or you know
covert action et cetera et cetera that
these are very serious impacts however
with foreign policy in regards to
economics with with deals like nafta
with deals um like the tpp
these are deals that that
you very much can walk away from uh
these are these are deals where
you can make the argument that
they weaken the united states position
in the world and ability to make deals
this out of the other i actually am not
a big buyer of that perspective because
really uh uh you don't have any choice
but to make deals with the united states
we are such an economic machine uh that
that you don't just get to choose to opt
out of making deals with the united
states and you know no matter who the
president is whether you like him or not
well i don't know if that's necessarily
true because if you look at things like
um wouldn't you say that one of the
things that worries me the most about
trump pulling out of some deals like the
tpp is that we give up a lot of
influence to say china who's trying to
explain a lot of south america and stuff
like that that kind of stuff doesn't
worry again
some some i i i think that that like i
said i think that's an argument that can
be made but i think that it's a lot less
sturdy than people make it out to be you
know that's always that china's making a
real effort right now to exert influence
in the rest of the world economically as
they continue to grow
the argument is if you if you step out
of the world you make yourself harder to
deal with then people will just deal
with china instead of you or
people who made the argument with
respect to the middle east if you pull
out they'll just they'll just deal with
russia instead of you because everybody
needs their own personal superpower in
their corner well but i think that i
think they can be demonstrated the iraqi
leader because we toned down support um
came out and said that the newest one in
there so that he would be willing to
work with russia if they could help and
um china's made significant investments
in african countries in terms of
education and labor and whatnot that we
kind of haven't been doing as much of i
think you can make those arguments
pretty steadily now
i i i agree but i when when you talk
about economic deals like the tpp which
are which are very specific to shipping
and manufacturing and
things that aren't so related to let's
say military boots on the ground which
the middle east very much is kind of a
military boots on the ground kind of
question
um with respect to the economic deals
apple is a fundamentally american thing
if you want iphones you have to deal
with apple period uh if you want
computers you have to deal with
microsoft period
so the united states
has a a demonstrable economic edge
over a place like china which you know
if you want trinkets if you want coal if
you want um
cheap manufacturing go right down to
guangzhou they will hook you up believe
me uh but but the united states does
have a a novelty factor over these
countries and it has a size factor i
mean people forget america's economy is
still about 30 larger than china's uh
the growth rates in china are
precipitously higher and the reason for
that is simple okay china went from
there they're making up for lost time in
china
in 1980 the united states was talking
about flying cars and and beginning to
have computers in their homes and china
was a
basically one giant farming commune so
so they're making up for lost time it's
it's not a matter of a massive
population as well right they have a
massive population they they have they
have a command and control economy in
terms of authoritarianism which brings
with it certain benefits
um and and the other thing i mean the
biggest part about china that gives them
that growth rate which i think cannot be
understated and is is understated all
too often is that in china when you have
a centralized economy
uh alibaba is
is they are the people and if they want
to
get into social networking
all they do is they call up the the
leaders of china and the biggest social
network company becomes a part of
alibaba
overnight
they are very much not opposed to to
trusts in their economy uh everything is
organized from the top down and so you
have these kind of giants where
you don't have facebook competing with
twitter competing with snapchat and and
other companies to gain traffic it's
just all one big machine uh and and in
some senses that's good and in some
senses it's bad because obviously you
don't have competition for labor um
you know you you have kind of a bad
situation for
lower class people in china you have a
middle class which is beginning to crop
up but not in a in a really serious way
uh so so it becomes it becomes
troublesome but
um
back back to what trump's doing i mean
i think that on the on the global stage
people really didn't take obama very
seriously um
a country like north korea really did
not believe that that obama was a
credible threat in terms of using
military force on the peninsula
that's very much different today
and you saw the same thing in economic
deals i mean you know obama would
and then and then obama the worst part
about it too is that he wasn't honest
about his kind of passivity when it came
to dealing on the global stage for
instance the iran deal i mean he came to
the table on the iran deal
um and he told this grandiose story
about how
we strangled iran with economic
sanctions and we made them come to the
table and that's not what happened at
all i mean we didn't make iran come to
the table uh we made clear that we were
prepared to offer certain concessions
and and they came to the table uh
sanctions are real you don't think the
sanctions are a big part of that iran's
economy has been like really those
sanctions did a lot they were like one
of the most ancient countries in the
world i don't i don't i don't think so i
mean talking to the the experts that
i've talked to uh sanctions are are
really bad things in the short term uh
but but countries adapt to sanctions and
they figure it out and and they move on
especially in a place like iran or north
korea i mean in north korea they have
