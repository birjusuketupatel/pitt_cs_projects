what do you got buddy
kmx what's up how's it going let me uh
meet your stream real quick i'll throw
your two of you okay
all right [ __ ] and i'm nervous i got
like a note back
uh notepad sort of okay with like a
bunch of random topics
uh i guess like the first thing i wanted
to say was like
a sort of appreciation kind of thing
like i started watching about five six
months ago or something maybe even a
year
i'm not like a very good time but
something i noticed was you actually
keep if you were like if you're um
interaction pretty high despite like
your viewer count increasing quite a bit
as time goes on
like right now you have 8k viewers but
you're still doing these q and a's and
stuff
etc yeah i tried i emailed you a
while ago oh and i i don't remember like
i was actually really surprised that you
actually um replied
oh okay and recently i've heard you say
like oh you've tried to reply to like
every single email and i think that's
like
i try to but i don't do it as much
anymore so don't give me credit
yeah like it's still impressive
regardless okay
i think it's like i guess making having
your own twitch chat
helps with that since it sort of cuts
down on the people who are in your um
in your ddg yeah a little bit
all right across from that uh
i guess i'll give you my take on a
portion not even like i'll ask you about
yours
okay it's kind of like um
a question about somebody who tried to
lay out your view
and i think like you agreed with it but
i don't think it actually encapsulates
your view
too well okay he ended up saying um
hold on let me think he said
that the only reason you
are against abortion is because if you
were a fetus you wouldn't want to be
aborted
something like that yeah yeah i don't
think
do you entirely agree with that because
you're never going to be an abortion so
why would that affect you you're never
never going to be a fetus why would that
affect you
okay something i've heard you say a
while ago that i think would make more
sense is like
if you're older maybe 80 90 years old
and you were in
a sort of coma-esque state or something
along those lines where like
you're not exactly as functional as your
average
say 20 year old like you wouldn't want
to be exterminated or something like
that just because
you say like less intelligent or
whatever is that like
more closely yeah you wouldn't want to
set a president in a society where we
can kill certain members if they are
below some level that we deem like
worthy of whatever yeah
yeah but my question is like do you
actually think that
if we were to legalize abortion or
if we thought it was morally okay that
we'd sort of be killing
seniors i feel like society as a whole
would just be against that
no matter what maybe i don't know
i don't think there's any situation or
like any rationalization that would sway
society and to think that it's okay to
kill elderly people but like
society seems to be more okay with
killing fetuses
because they sort of don't look human
sure
uh that's about it when it comes to
abortion i guess oh i
think it's like mr moon isn't here i
guess i had a question for him
i remember a while ago he was like
he put some ban on the discord thing
about like him nobody being allowed to
say the n word with the at the end
oh yeah yeah and i i was curious about
why that was
i think it got weird because like like a
lot of people were doing it and then it
became hard to tell like who was white
and who was black and like some people
like use it as an excuse to say it
even though they weren't so just it was
like yeah [ __ ] it like
oh yeah it's like i guess i still don't
fully understand it
and i i think i would if somebody were
to explain it to me
wait i don't necessarily think i'm like
like that reasoning
oh well because we don't really want
people saying the n-word i guess and
discord
no no i went to his twitch stream and i
was like
i just buy logs of it but i asked pretty
respectfully um
like why that is like if you somehow
you tell the gender of people i mean not
the gender the um the race of people
that you would like um ban some words
for some races and
make it okay for other races and then he
was sort of like oh if you want to
ironically think
that white people should be allowed to
say then like you're beyond recovery or
whatever
i guess i have like a sort of negative
opinion on him because
i don't think he's a bad person or
anything i just don't really like
that line of thought that like you
shouldn't even bother with some people
even if they're like oh yeah i mean i
don't generally agree that i'm he
probably decided hyperbolic they would
be my guest
what's the thing what happened with them
being racist against white people mr
mutton
how am i being racist please go ahead
what happened i missed it no he's mad i
mean if people were just
i'm not mad i'm not mad no mr moon's
mine oh okay
i am i'm just curious like if people
were to claim
that they're black and they weren't
black if everybody else thinks that
they're black i don't see the issue
because like more it's just more like i
can't
ask people for their id's on discord and
i don't
think that you can say that word anymore
on discord um
if it was like in a perfect world i
wouldn't really care
probably it but it's like i don't want
to spend like the eight hours moderating
it
does that make sense i'm questioning
like why it's wrong
i i think i don't know if i said it was
wrong i think i'm just talking about
like what i can do on discord
no i'm asking like why would it be wrong
for a white person to stay with the a at
the end like that's my question
oh it's like honestly it's probably not
i'm just too lazy to police that [ __ ]
right now because then people are gonna
cry about who's like
should they be allowed to and blah blah
blah and then people are gonna say
someone said it but they said it mean
but they used it with the a to get
around one percent african in my blood
can i say it or like just or no even if
it's like full and white like i don't
know it's just people use it to be
racist and then pretend they're not and
it's just real dumb i don't know [ __ ]
that [ __ ] it's just like
too long to moderate it's so much
[ __ ] work dude could please that word
would they at the end to be racist
can it be racist yeah of course it could
be sure like nick fuentes was saying it
do you think he'd be saying it to be
racist or just to be true
i i don't i know nothing about politics
or public failure figures if you're like
dog whistling it could be really racist
yeah i don't know i'd rather not
translate anything political because i'm
like 17 i don't know anything about that
stuff
i try not to have opinions on stuff that
i don't have knowledge on okay
well yeah i mean i think like people
could be people could like use it and
pretend that they're not being racist
but they're just using it to be racist
it's possible
like i don't know if i'm verbalizing my
question
well but when you say that if you could
somehow know
the the race of every single person and
that you would like
ban everyone from saying it unless
they're like black i mean if you could
100
no then it'd probably be more chill but
yeah but
why why would you do that
um i mean okay so like
let's say somebody were to say that
they're they're black but they're white
right
and they use the n-word as in like
sending them to bro or like son or
whatever
like is that hurting anyone because then
no
it's not that it's hurting anyone it's
just it's hard to know like when people
are being sincere versus when people are
like being racist like people could use
it to be racist
and then it gets like really annoying to
have to try to like figure out who is or
who isn't and then to try to police that
or whatever would be like really
irritating
or annoying i guess okay so it's not
it's not even like a matter of
morals or anything it's just like
practically right yeah like
like realistically like white people
saying like with a soft day i don't
[ __ ] care it doesn't really [ __ ]
matter
at least i personally don't think so
some people might but like i don't give
a [ __ ]
but like in terms of like trying to
police that like that would be a [ __ ]
nightmare [ __ ] that [ __ ]
okay that's i'm fine with the answer
okay
i do feel weird about telling black
people they can't say it but [ __ ] it i
finally
finally we have power to tell black
people and it comes from sjws that's
what i've been waiting for
my next question is like if do you what
are your opinions on
culture and tradition as a whole being
like toxic
well i don't think anything passing on
passing on beliefs in general is just
not a good thing i mean you have to your
beliefs have to come from somewhere
right
do they where would they come from
otherwise
um like your own thoughts and opinions
what are your thoughts and opinions come
[Music]
from
i don't know well they come from like
the people and culture around you right
they have to
i guess like the question came from i
saw some video of
like a buzzfeed video or whatever and
there were um these
three asian teens or whatever and they
were trying out
american chinese food and then some girl
was like i like it but the other two are
like oh this is fake chinese food and
they were like giving her so much [ __ ]
for it
for like being asian and enjoying
american chinese food
i thought it was like really toxic i
mean you can be toxic about
something without saying like we should
just get rid of all culture right
i don't know to me um
have you ever heard of the i mean of
course yeah but like the whole white
genocide thing is like
white people being breeded out as in
like interracial couples will ruin the
purity of white people
so on i've heard of that yeah yeah
the idea of it like the opposite the
opposite side
of like people inter-breeding and then
they're not being
uh concrete race and everyone just being
mixed
i think that'd be kind of ideal though i
mean like everybody's sort of becoming
just people rather than black or white
sure i mean i don't care i think it's
fine i don't really care much about it
yeah
i don't know if it would be ideal
necessarily i mean maybe i guess i don't
have to think about that a lot more but
i guess
i didn't really articulate the thought
much i just
thought if people didn't have their own
individualistic
traditions and cultures they wouldn't
have this i like
challenge yeah maybe yeah
if people sort of just had like this
whole
one mentality of everyone being the same
but that's sort of
naive no um i mean maybe i don't know
it's hard to say i mean we did it as
americans right we all thought of
ourselves as individual people that
lived in individual states and then we
came together and we thought ourselves
as americans so i mean
it's happening even then like people in
america
don't necessarily call themselves
americans even if um they're born in
america
most people call themselves asian or
no it really depends on you are most
asian people
well in my experience asian people that
are born in america lived here consider
themselves american
like if you would ask somebody like lily
pichu like what do you like are you
asian or korean like they would say like
someone who is promoting breeding out
white really if you were to ask lily
where are you from she wouldn't say like
korea
no definitely not no no she would say
she's going to call herself korean
no most asian people would say like
they're american it's like
that's like a really big deal that like
a lot of asian people face in the u.s
where like
if you're born in america and you're
asian white people will ask you like uh
like
where are you from and they'll be like
i'm from l.a i'm like well where you
really from like a lot like if you're
born in america
and you're asian you consider yourselves
uh americans you would say like oh i'm
from korea
like no asian person says that unless
they're like unless they literally like
immigrated over here or whatever i guess
here in like new york city
people tend to have like this pride
about their um heritage or something
i don't see i don't understand it
personally i don't think well people
have private heritage you can still have
pride in your heritage without being
like
like where are you from and then saying
like my people are from korea right
uh-huh i don't really see the point in
people being prideful of like
their ancestors in general yeah i mean i
agree with that yeah but i mean like
people are but i mean i probably am
actually gonna agree with you again
i guess in the same breath as like
culture and tradition would you consider
yourself anti-religious
like anti-religion um maybe i don't know
i'm anti-theology i don't know about
religion i have to think more about it
like for example um
parents teaching their kids creationism
is a fact this is amazing yeah like
theology stuff like i'm against
a lot of the theology stuff but like the
rituals and traditions that go along
with being religious seem like they're
important to a lot of people so
so you wouldn't consider yourself
against religion it's just
not something you personally would do
definitely not personally and i wish
more people wouldn't but i mean there's
a lot of good that comes from it so
maybe that's important for society
oh so you you in an ideal society for
yourself
you'd wish everyone was atheistic pretty
much yeah i think so
yeah so i guess doesn't that make you an
anti-religion well kind of when people
say anti-religion i don't know if you
mean like do i like walk around like
screaming like [ __ ] religious people all
day or something oh no i don't want you
to play guillotine religious people or
whatever
i'm saying like do you wish people
weren't religious
yeah of course if they could maintain
the positive values without needing the
theology or whatever yeah that'd be good
i think
um speaking of like positive values
you get your values from
personal pleasure right kind of sure
or whatever because they're like
personal satisfaction yeah
you described it as descriptive egoism
um i think it's what it's usually
described as kind of yeah when you draw
yeah
do you think you have to like hide those
views to achieve
certain pleasures in life like for
example
if somebody were to ask you like is
murder good
and then would your aunts like you can't
necessarily say like
oh it depends because then they might
jump on you like oh are you a murderer
like would you wear it i mean
i mean like for me i can be pretty
honest because of what i do for a job
but like in normal society yeah you'd
probably be a little bit more
or less forthcoming about your views i
guess yeah
do you think that like holding that view
of
for for some people not necessarily
yourself because of your like the way
you make a living but do you think some
people like
holding that view is sort of
counter-intuitive because
like having those thoughts and having to
hide it would
undermine your own personal satisfaction
like for example if you're like yeah of
course
a student in school and there's
discussions and stuff about
philosophy then you sort of have to
constantly hide your thoughts on
certain things sure
i guess it's just an interesting
question i was thinking about
okay like in that it's sort of the same
topic do you think that um
doing things so long as you don't get
caught is like a good
way to live i mean it depends on what
you're doing
like i guess only extreme would be
cheating right
it's like if you wanted to cheat with
like some
big titty girl or whatever okay
and there's very little to no chance
that your
partner would know do you think that's
it's for your personal like moral system
you think it would be okay to cheat
and not like as long as he doesn't know
like no no harm no foul
um i mean i guess theoretically maybe
yeah if that gives you personal
satisfaction i guess sure
same goal would go for like stealing or
yeah literally theoretically anything
you'd think you could like not get away
with yeah
although you'd have to be really worried
in that case that other people could do
the same which would kind of [ __ ] you
really hard right
and it's really hard to usually do type
these types of things without like
[ __ ] up or getting caught somewhere
like it's usually more effort than it's
worth
when you say that like um it depends on
if people like other people do the same
and it would like negatively affect you
do you think that you um
explaining your thought process behind
egoism
to like thousands of people and seeing
is that like
your rationalization does make a lot of
sense it would probably persuade the
vast majority of people into being
egoist
do you think that like negatively
impacts you at all or society at all
well no i mean like because i usually
tell people to like
act like righteous in his fight and as
far as anyone else would right
like for instance like i mean like you
can lie to people but i don't think you
should because it's usually like more
trouble than it's worth and other people
could be lying to you and it'd be like a
pretty [ __ ] society if everybody's
like lying and cheating and doing all
that [ __ ] all the time right like this
would probably be
like really bad in a lot of different
ways
i mean you could tell somebody that if
everybody did it in society then it'd be
bad but
like in their own mind they'd think that
oh
well not everyone's gonna do it if i do
it's fine it's only one person
it's kind of like that's like the
tragedy of the comments though i mean
that applies to anything but it's also
not
probably a good thought process to have
i guess i'll keep going down the line of
like your thought processes what
are your opinion what are your opinions
on skepticism like
the idea that um you can never know that
you know something because
oh yeah yeah i mean i agree with all of
that sure i don't i usually don't think
about it much because it's kind of
absurd too but i mean i agree with it
yeah
do you let it influence like anything in
your life or is it just like this sort
of own
niche it's just a thing that just kind
of sits there that's really shitty
that's uncomfortable but no i i can't
really ever influence anything in your
life i don't think
because it would be absurd about um
other epistemological
views it's like would you ever be a
skeptic of determinism or something
um i mean i guess you can be sure if
you're an ultimate skeptic you'll be
skeptical of everything right
all right would you consider yourself an
ultimate skeptic um yeah but i don't
consider it much because it's
because it leads to absurdity right
uh-huh yeah that makes sense
uh i guess to end things off i had a
request
of you a while ago and you said yeah
sure but i thought you remember it
um i asked if you'd ever make a video on
how to collect data and stuff
and how to form opinions oh i said i
might at some point because you kind of
talk about i am
it's like sources are incredible et
cetera because like me personally i have
like almost no opinions on any political
stuff because
i don't even know where to start on that
stuff like people will say research and
i'm like okay how do i know certain
things are credible and they're like go
to go to the citations like oh [ __ ]
that's so much
i don't know where to start you know and
there's like when you when you look at
the discussions of like well your
debates like debates in your discord and
people are
talking about the [ __ ] french
revolution it's like holy [ __ ]
i have no idea what any like any of the
stuff that they're talking about how do
you even start like
there's so much stuff that goes into
these debates yeah
and you need to do like these mountains
of research to even begin to like
encapsulate whole topics sure it's like
it makes it almost impossible to hold
any opinions
without feeling um like you're doing it
without knowing everything that you
should know to have
an opinion you end up just having no
opinions at all sure i mean it can be
difficult yeah
yeah i guess that's about it thanks
sorry if it's like
me muttering or whatever no it's not
good i love you buddy be careful all
right see ya
you
