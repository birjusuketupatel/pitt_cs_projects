things that he used to do in k-town was
he would I guess he was walking to
violin lessons because it was kind of
close to where he live so he always had
his violin on him anybody was going like
to and from lessons sometimes there
would be kids on the street that would
be like playing like whatever songs and
Albert would take out his violin because
he has perfect pitch and everything and
he knew most of the songs are playing
and he would just like show them up on
the street until they [ __ ] left he
was like telling me this laughing and
this is like I couldn't believe it he
does like dude like these kids are like
trying to make some money you were just
like completely destroyed like that and
he always said that like the way that he
was raised that should just be like
motivation for them to get better okay

to describe it kind of think of the
plane that I take from like there's a
certain type of plan I take from oh my
god from Amsterdam to Dusseldorf in
Germany and that the turbulence that I
get on one of those flights is
horrifying yeah like they're like
multiple seconds like four or five
seconds of like what feels like freefall
on that plane although I've been
implanted there's just like kind of
turbulence like this is the one I've
told this straight before there's the
one where I was like um I was trying to
email Rachel my bank passwords and
everything on this flight because I was
100 percent fine all right 100 cents
sure that I was gonna die like a million
percent sure I legitimately thought the
plane was gonna crash
we were like flying like this way like
straight it was like [ __ ] horrifying

crashing like the truth boys

been in my life where people clapped oh
mylanta

you think those houses are like these
houses down here there's no way
[Music]
Oakland is in a massive housing bubble
at the moment so prices are likely to be
mad hi-yah
is this just a result of like Chinese
trade deficits cuz like I've heard that
like so I've heard that in Auckland a
lot of Chinese people buy houses there
and I've heard that like because when
you have like a trade differential with
a country right that you bring those
dollars back and invest in real estate
doesn't the same thing happen in America
and it like Toronto and Vancouver and
[ __ ] as well no that's okay we can find
someplace to like stop in and get me do
you think it's all because of like trade
deficit stuff
Chinese just buying [ __ ] all over the
world yeah and then I told her I heard
that than in Canada I think they were
gonna start penalizing people that buy
houses but don't live there there's
apparently in Canada Chinese people just
buy houses and sit on them like it's
like a ton of houses and like price is
going up and nobody lives in like a lot
of the houses because Chinese people's

get like a steak
this is a cute place guys
I tried to text edit right before I
really just don't like the texture maybe
I could try it again but then it's like
a point where it's like um there's a
point where you could get to like medium
maybe even medium rare depending on the
cut where the fat like gets marbled and
it's like really really really really
really good I think like my perfect
steak really thick cuts of meat and the
middle is like [ __ ] rare and I hate
it so like I just go medium I actually
went to um there's a restaurant by I
think Wolfgang Puck called cut in
Beverly Hills and that restaurant they
actually offered something call them
like medium-rare plus and that was like
perfect whatever that I don't know
that's a normal thing but like
medium-rare plus was like the [ __ ] that
steak was cooked almost perfectly
Farwell perfectly I guess but that place
was were really expensive for two people
we paid like five or six hundred dollars
yeah
actually there's probably like really
expensive rent and summer here the two
best steak houses I've ever been at
before though are the SLS that Bazaar
meets place in Vegas which is also
really expensive which is like two or
three hundred dollars I think for a big
steak but then there's another place in
Omaha called called the drover and that
place honest to god is as good as any
huge foot steak house I've gone to and
that place is like 80 dollars a person
it's really really really good like it's
on par with or better than like 150 $200

haven't seen that anywhere here at all
ya know a lot of areas smoke-free I'm in
the government has increased which will
subservience and the whole lot of sort
of things to reduce Varsha

that ship do you think we'd win
they're a lot bigger but I don't know
how many people they've got we could
probably board them and [ __ ] them up
so I don't know I see a couple of
workers walking no no way I'm gonna
guess 30 people tops on that boat no way
there's more than that I bet it's less
than that when you grab on ferries I
think oh yeah with the Joker it's gonna
make my joke earlier but every time I
make a joke with like security people I
always get in trouble
they never laugh of anything I was on
the airport and I set up and a guy
looked at my passport he's like what's
your birthday and I'm like my birthday
or that guy's birthday any like glared
at me yeah they like they don't do humor
there at all it was like you could just
like shout like down
yeah I mean you're probably pretty
[ __ ] up oh my god so a few days ago I
went to this place called bouncy-yo with
my kid yeah it's like a giant inflatable
bouncy place and I am at the front and
there's a really cute girl at the front
counter and weird I ain't gonna pay and
she's like oh it's 950 and I'm like oh
do I get in for free and she's like yeah
there's no charge for adults and I'm
like oh [ __ ] do like a ton of adults
come here and just bounce and she's like
no oh and I'm like and I don't know if
she didn't tell us like joking and I was
like yeah and I was like oh I just
thought cuz it's free you know yeah and
she's like sometimes groups with special
needs adults come in and bounce yeah and
but she like wasn't joking you know when
I was like okay it was so awkward she
did not oh my god I was like okay dude
Jesus I was not ready for that level for
that level of autism oh my god Davenport
Davenport
we gotta stand the middle dick oh my god
what's happening we're gonna tip over
boys this is the end camera focus is
scuffed no it's actually supposed to be
like this I'm trying to show you that if
you focus on the problems that are
immediately in forth in front of you
you'll lose sight of the beauty behind
okay some real deep ass shut guys just
break
the end of I rock at what a lame name
for a boat oh that's a ferry never man
what kind of wood do they use to make
these dogs oh that's definitely birch
wood for sure you can tell by the call
it by the temper that's what we say in
the wood crafting business and then the
vertical pillars I made of pine and
cedar I don't [ __ ] know guys I don't
know mmm for me good oh [ __ ]
our hand has our butts up hands
do you think the boat used to be a
person and it was transformed into a
boat or do you think that they added
hands to the boat so I could signal
better who knows
if I'm the only one with a hat on when I
feel awkward boys
I look like a tourist I don't like it
well let's try Amma Taurus [ __ ] these
guys you're right
but these people having a lot of trouble
moving holy [ __ ] I'm getting very
triggered it whole makeup it blocks my
[ __ ] of course he does
thank God my tickets are these
recyclables or paper
Oh No

right okay Jenny Chang
okay guys all this walking is making me
tired I don't know if I'm gonna be able
to do this for a long time okay sounds
good
this building looks pretty sick I
approve do you think that these outside
white things are actually like
load-bearing or do you think they're
just for design
Jesus Christ is that Jesus Christ in
that sacrilegious
can you explain the concept to me what
what you think the metaphor I don't know
it looks like Jesus is holding up a
clock I mean it's probably not Jesus
it's probably just like a dude or
something or maybe it's like father time
I guess that probably makes more sense
this place my don't have such I'm gonna
be so mad
I got it's literal ice frying screaming
thank you well we don't know if it's
good yeah it looks like have a massive
[ __ ] razor no whip everything after
this Kevin's gonna tell you an extreme
yeah if we go to this head dark from
feeling pretty tired how far it scared
me

sky tower I don't even see it behind
this building
I will the [ __ ] the science for your
streets
where the signs for your streets like
what street is this you guys have signs
here streets okay

I don't see the sky tower anywhere
what if it collapsed
I'm not getting sunburned because like
I'm good right
some guy sent me some really paranoid
email about out even when it's cloudy
out the Sun will like melt your skin in
like 30 minutes a cat cafe is there just
like the cafe with a lot of cats in it
are you supposed to bring your cat to it
okay we have a um I don't know this is
common in other countries but in at
least in my Nebraska state there are a
lot of downtown they're like old book
stores that sell like antiques and old
books and there's always like three or
four cats that like live in these places
that everybody kind of knows and they
just like hang out yeah
I think if I had it I don't know it's
there they're like totally different
animals right yes like cats are nice
things that like chill near you and
you're gonna like pet him and stuff
yeah but dogs are like if you want to
feel like super loved by something like
a dog does that way better than cats oh
[ __ ] guys the battery my backpack has
finally died so we are running on
auxilary power I'm at 36% I'm gonna kill
the stream probably at like 5 or 10 so I
don't have a good my streaming tonight
at your place what there's nothing to do
what would I do
no I'll probably sleep pretty early
after all the walking today it's like
the most walking I've done in like 10
years
what's up buddy I'm just just past five
what's your name yeah come up this way a
little bit that's where we were gone
yeah you live downtown here yeah yeah
honestly this place reminds me I've said
this many times
have you ever been to America I was in
LA briefly the place called Washington
and then I get like very big Washington
vibes from this because we have like in
Seattle there's like rain and muggy
weather all the time
I don't it looks like fairies and it
sticks to the water and oh yeah
what's your name in chat oh oh dear that
guy wait like pho e and IX or never yes
spell correct yeah okay gotcha
oh yeah so you're talking a lot good job
you are not believing you're like the
first big non lurker the Tracy guy
earlier was an ilogger but usually I
usually watch the vod's because I'm like
too busy to watch the strings for the
time you guys
maybe I'll see you when you come back to
walk on yeah
okay guys quick he had the chat open
everybody start making fun of him he'll
get super self-conscious just if I can
make fun of him guys everybody go
yeah okay don't stop me if I don't he's
gonna think I said something mean Oh
everybody stop oh damn we're trucking
now I don't know if you can tell a
strand boy this is quite the hill okay
I'm not gonna lie I went to the it's the
Space Needle in Seattle it's super
disappointing it feels like a really old
touristy attraction thing that hasn't
been maintained or I don't know if
someone else is in Chapter two yet oh
maybe I'm wrong but this looks actually
a lot cooler like more maintained
no you're right that's think yeah it's
like really depressing it feels like it
used to be really cool but then like
when other buildings started to get
taller than the space because I think
when the Space Needle was built wasn't
it like the tallest thing in Seattle but
now it's like not even close
oh my god no rugrats sure it's so cute
wait how do we go up
that is the wife
this traffic is like non-existent
this isn't even traffic but it's also
this is a Sunday night here so yeah this
is like a trillion times better than the
Space Needle but I think that's because
this is actually like taller than
everything else and uh you know what the
Space Needle is in Seattle yeah the
thing is is I think when they built it
in Seattle it's like it was the tallest
thing in Seattle I think at the time but
then all the other buildings got taller
so if you get in the Space Needle you
can barely see in some areas because
like they're just buildings everywhere
here you can actually like to see
everything
oh my god there's so many people here
taking pictures okay let's try this way
wait what is the point of this like Oh
[Music]
just don't like that they're fine
Oh mana the kids really scared of
heights okay is any picture any of these
people aren't gonna take care any better
than like any other of the million
pictures that are already in Italy
what's the point
one of the saddest things I mean I guess
you know I can say this but one of the
saddest things I think I saw while -
really sad pictures one is not that when
I was originally thinking but like the
top of Mount Everest
there's like a line of people depending
on when you go they'll be like a line of
like a hundred people waiting to get to
the very summit you feel like take a
picture whenever it's just like this
massive line of people and then the
other thing was I think somebody took a
picture inside the museum with the it's
a bit like it was for a was it the Mona
Lisa we're like it's just a room full of
people holding up like phones and
tablets and stuff
[Music]
I don't know I don't think I could do
the Skywalk I think I'd be too scared
this thing is so tall oh my god we're
literally above like everything
is this like the tallest thing in all of
New Zealand
yeah I guess well I guess if there was
something taller in Auckland there
wouldn't be anywhere else huh
this is the tallest structure in the
southern hemisphere phulwa okay
the elevators of it we were on the 51st
floor whatever that means I don't know
if stories are like standardized in
other countries like they are in the US
or upstairs all right I'll see if you
guys can see some of the ride down
[Music]
