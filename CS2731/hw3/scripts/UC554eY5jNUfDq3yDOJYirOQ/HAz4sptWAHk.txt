um all right how's life how's it going
it's going well how are you i'm doing
okay
what are we talking about today um i
guess i just wanted to
further i want to make sense more of
what you said
on the stream without people screaming i
don't know how you thought i wasn't
gonna be screaming today
i mean you can you can scream at me but
whenever everyone else is screaming over
me and it's like oh my god i can't even
[ __ ]
i don't know yeah i'm happy with you
screaming at me i kind of like it so
go ahead go ahead do it it's fine okay i
heard you were like rolling your eyes
you're like tara babcock wants to talk
about something
oh yeah because i usually want to kill
myself when i have this conversation but
that's just my memes for stream don't
worry i won't do it here it'll be okay
okay i'm excited i got a hot chocolate
so i'm ready for this one okay
all right uh so last time we talked we
were talking about like the
responsibility of the content creator
you know for like what he puts out there
and how other people might take it or
whatever
um and you said you had some kind of
like actual data that shows that like
racist jokes for instance actually do
turn into radicalization
or something or was that alabrel i can't
[ __ ] remember
probably alberto i'm not sure what kind
of data i would have for something like
that
i think i can describe like pathways and
we could probably look up studies along
the way to support my arguments but
yeah i guess um do you want to lay out i
guess like you're kind of like
foundational
like tell us tell us what you think
about that
well for me personally where i stand is
i'm just a free speed abs a free speech
absolutist but i can
i i can always change my mind okay you
know i want to poke so
i want to poke that a little bit okay go
ahead okay what do you mean when you say
you're a free speech absolutist
like i honestly don't think that charles
manson should be in jail or should have
been in jail
like when you tell someone to kill
themselves or tell someone to do
something
i still don't think that the onus is on
the person who told them to do the thing
okay um well here let's
let's get off of example so you think
that free speech
in and of itself is good regardless of
the effects it has on other people
yeah i think that the ramifications of
kind of curtailing free speech
are more than what can happen if you
allow free speech
what if if somebody could demonstrate
the opposite
do you think you would change your mind
on that so if somebody could demonstrate
for instance that more harm comes from
certain types of speech than benefits
yeah but then i also think that we would
probably come
to an impasse because it would be a
subjective like personal preference type
of thing like
you'll probably think that like we'll
hurry not necessarily you but let's say
someone cares more about hurting
someone's feelings
um than they care about actually saying
the things that they want to say or
being genuine on their platforms or
whatever
like i can understand that position it's
just not a position that i hold because
i personally think that like i also like
when anyone says like oh some word hurts
my feelings or something that you say
hurts my feelings are like
um something is harmful because people
might think a certain way
i i always like if someone is taking me
wrong i'll always clear it up you know
and i always want people to become
stronger people
like i understand the argument where
like oh you can take criticism or you
can take
people saying these words to you but not
everyone can i understand that and i
understand people being sensitive to
those
sensitivities that other people have but
i also think that it's more important
to not be a huge [ __ ] and to like get
stronger and not allow words to control
you other people's words should never
control you and
saying that rather than curtailing my
own speech makes more sense to me
like i'm not actually trying to hurt you
my intent is not to hurt you or my
intent is not to
start some kind of horrible degenerate
[ __ ] culture or whatever it's
it's just i would rather i i have a big
thing where i i can't i don't like lying
i don't like not being myself i would
rather just be comfortably on my own
platform
but i understand that that there might
be ramifications to that you know so
i don't know you would have to convince
me that there actually would be more
harm
like you know so you convinced me
okay so um
okay i'm thinking
so from a personal level i agree with
everything you said
um personally i try not to get upset by
certain things
and i think that giving people advice
personally to try to overcome
different people saying certain things
to you and not giving people control of
you i think is a good thing
however i think that this is kind of a
surface level look at things
because the unfortunate reality is that
words are really never just words
because ultimately these can manifest in
other ways
so for instance let's say that you have
people that hate gay people and they
tell a bunch of anti-gay jokes they
use the effort a lot towards gay people
they hate gay people
and we say um you know like well they're
just using those words it's not a big
deal don't want to bother you blah blah
blah
but then let's say that five years down
the road you know there are so many of
these people that now they're voting
against things like gay marriage
now you've got something where it's not
really just people talking anymore
now people are actually like
demonstrably harming you
via their speech by way of like
legislation
do you agree that that would be like a
measurable harm to have people that are
voting against your interests in the
united states
i mean i don't think that the speech is
what gets them there i don't think
they're just saying the
the effsler is what gets them there and
i think that
like do you really think that there's a
certain type of speech that
is more it changes people's minds
more like do you think that these these
people who
really hate gay people and want people
to vote a certain way do you think that
like when
it's just hard for me to believe that
people joking about that word
who don't have that intent and people
who have that intent are gonna
make more people than would otherwise
change their minds
so are you arguing from a standpoint
like you personally morally don't want
to do it because you don't want to
contribute to it or are you saying that
we should actually
have some legislation against it um i'm
not too sure yet actually i would have
to think more about that but
but that's a little bit past where we're
at right now we can get to that part of
the conversation
my personal position my my the ethical
framework that i view
decisions through is a consequentialist
one so i don't inherently believe any
action is good or bad
what i typically want to do is maximize
the amount of well-being for as many
people as possible so through that
framework i look at something like free
speech and i don't really care about
free speech in and of itself i care
about whether or not
certain types of speech are providing
benefit to most people and whether or
not there's like an overall benefit
being served for all types of speech
generally i'm a pretty big free speech
person because i think it does serve
most people
but i do think it's important to
recognize the consequences of certain
speech
and maybe take a look at how some
speeches platform i think it's good to
be aware of both sides of it
okay so how do you think someone like
you or me who aren't against gay people
saying the f word
like trickles down into something
actually being harmful yeah
people so um there's a name for this
[ __ ] pyramid and i just watched it a
while ago in the video
but basically what you kind of have is
you have people
that have no interest whatsoever in in
hurting certain groups of people and
then you have people that are literally
ready to go
genocide certain groups of people oh the
pyramid of violence might be what it's
called
but basically the idea is that what you
can do is if you take a population of
people
and you introduce them to a certain type
of humor if you do that relentlessly and
you normalize that humor people become
desensitized to hearing
certain types of ideas platformed and
are more likely to kind of listen to
those ideas
less critically or maybe more critically
dependent how you look at it in the
future so for instance
if i were to suddenly start using a
bunch of jokes on my stream
about how dumb uh jewish people were or
corrupt jewish people are
um and i already do that over the course
of months and months and months if we
were to start watching videos about how
jews are actually controlling the west
there are going to be some people that
look at that a little bit more favorably
because we've normalized so much
anti-jewish humor in the stream
i think oh my god hold on i can't hear
you my [ __ ]
oh guys my stream deck's not working
please
don't do any sub oh i can just mute it
okay sorry i couldn't hear you at all my
[ __ ] something went off
okay pick up so i think generally what
people do is people use humor to kind of
normalize certain concepts people use
humor to introduce people to certain
concepts and once you've
embraced the humor enough it becomes
easier to actually pass like real ideas
into your mind because you're so used to
joking about it
that i guess it becomes more believable
to you do you believe in that concept
do you think that's totally not true at
all okay i generally think that people
are really [ __ ] stupid right
um and i think that most people
don't scrutinize their beliefs enough
but
i don't know like i can i can be open to
that actually happening
but still again it's like
why then should it has to be like
i don't know like for me personally i
think i care more about
me being able to do what i want on my
own platform and me being myself on my
own platform and
like portraying that to my audience than
i do about
what could in a contrived way
push that agenda a little bit like in
some trickle-down way you know like i
feel like it's not
like i'm valuing myself over the masses
and i feel like you
often value what benefits the most
amount of people like you said
over what you want to do or what would
be most comfortable for you i also think
you like are you just like
you care less like what if what if this
impacted you what if you found out um
that what you'd like everything about
your stream
is like toxic and contributes to that
kind of thing like even talking about
opposing opinions or
political stuff or whatever like at what
point would that be
too much for you to give up for the good
of other people
um well i mean if it actually like if um
it's hard because to consider this is
kind of antithetical to my position like
i believe that i'm in a position where i
do
try to do at least a reasonable amount
of good so to say that i'm doing
absolutely none it's hard for me to
fathom i guess
um but i mean i like i would i would
probably try to change up if i thought i
was like
measurably harming society i would most
likely try to change up what it is i do
okay i think i would have to be
convinced probably a little bit more
than you would that it's a measurable
harm
and then i would also like i don't like
subjective stuff i don't like subjective
lines
so like what if i say one like
semi-racist joke a month
obviously i'm not contributing that much
or should i just like completely cut it
out from my
like vernacular to even talk about
certain things like that
like it's just so hard for me i would
rather have the rigid line of always
free speech
and try to of course you state your
intent so that nothing is ever taken
out of context sure so i think that's
important
kind of yeah so well no well i disagree
but we'll get into that
um so the i don't like subjective lines
is always going to be a problem when
we're talking about things as
complicated as culture because like
there's no way that we can ever rigidly
define even like what is a racist joke
um can arguably be really difficult to
define depending on who says it
depending on the context like
so it's going to be really hard to draw
rigid lines i think what i'm more
interested in is kind of like drawing
out
general principles that can be adhered
to and then kind of like going from
there i guess
backing up to something you said earlier
you said people are really stupid and
that
you shouldn't be held like hostage for
your own personal speech
based on the stupidity of other people
so one thing i'd like to do is i'd like
to reform that statement that people are
really stupid i think that instead of
saying people are stupid i think it
makes more sense to say people are
oftentimes a victim of circumstance or
victim of their environment
do you agree that these are kind of
equivalent statements or just kind of
like rephrasing what you're saying
yeah yeah so people tend to do what what
is shown around them if you show
somebody a whole bunch of a certain type
of thing there's a decent chance that
the person's going to be more
uh more warm towards that particular
type of thing
i think that i'm not good yeah i think
that
as long as you recognize that and you're
willing to accept that
then it becomes a little bit easier to
utter the statement afterwards like i
want to do what i want to do
as long as you recognize that you do
carry the potential to cause harm for
groups of people
in doing what you want to do and there
might be you know types of people that
like really really don't like you as a
result of that
yeah i mean i'm fine with people
disliking me for whatever reason i
i just i would have to be shown
like okay where is your personal line
then you just don't tell any racist
or sexist or homophobic jokes ever
anymore well so when i'm on public
platforms um i try not to attack groups
that face
lots of real life attacks by majority
power groups
at least in the united states i'm sure
that i'd probably [ __ ] up in some
country or whatever
but like a joke is an attack um i don't
think that a joke in and of itself is an
attack
but i think that repeatedly joking about
certain types of groups of people
harmful attitudes towards certain types
of people and that can manifest down the
road and people holding certain beliefs
that eventually vote a certain way that
eventually hurt certain people
i think there's like kind of like a
chain and how that works
okay and what is repeatedly like
occasionally you'll like
let it happen sometimes but you don't
want to make it like a habit you don't
want it to be like the main
or well for me i try to i try to never
do it because i don't want somebody to
catch me at the wrong time but like for
instance like so people that do like try
hard spam when somebody like jacks a car
or when somebody steals something or if
somebody like does something like
any time something bad happens when
people type like black people emotes and
chat like i don't think that kind of
stuff is funny because i think that like
um
i think that it kind of like normalizes
this attitude well black people are all
criminals
you know or like the anil stuff i think
um knute got in trouble for that
when somebody got arrested he was like a
neil or whatever like all muslims get
you know arrested or a card terrorist or
whatever
i think that the promises are so many
people that actually believe this type
of stuff
i don't i'm not comfortable joking about
it because i don't want to further
normalize those types of beliefs
okay so what do you think is the like um
the starting point for someone whose
brain is malleable enough to
start actually believing those things do
you think they are
neutral about let's say black people or
do you think they're kind of starting to
go toward the i don't like black people
because of past experiences or something
like where do you think they are before
they hear all of these jokes normalized
um they're probably they probably have
some very small level of like built-in
biases
it really depends on their life
experience but i think and then humor
starts to move them in another direction
okay like one thing that people don't
realize and like um the big problem i
have with these is a lot of people just
aren't honest
i think when they have these types of
conversations one people don't think
that people don't realize is
there's a saying there's a little bit of
truth in every just kidding like certain
jokes are only funny
because you already have like certain
types of attitudes towards certain
groups of people
like if i had a white friend and we went
to germany and you know like he rented a
vehicle and he showed up in like a
[ __ ] in like a ford pickup truck
like i wouldn't say to my white friend
like watch out like people are gonna
look at you funny because
why he's white that doesn't make any
sense now if he was brown or middle
eastern and i made that joke well it's
kind of funny because brown people are
terrorists right like that's literally
the joke right the joke gets its laugh
from the fact that we have this
preconceived notion
of a certain minority group of people um
and i think that furthering that with
more and more and more humor kind of
builds on that and leads to more
normalization of those attitudes
okay so um you're not saying that the
person that makes the joke
uh okay you know the the seeing
some truth and the joke i agree with
that but i don't think it necessarily
has to be
uh either the teller of the joke or the
consumer of the joke that actually
thinks those things i have to i think it
has to be like a
a stereotype that exists not necessarily
something they agree with right
yeah so exactly like neither person has
to believe yeah neither person can have
bad intent here both people could
actually have
in fact both people could even have good
intent both people could actually like
middle eastern people and don't think
that type of racist stuff is okay
um you know that's one of the harder
things about this type of speech that
spreads that's kind of harmful
is it's one of those things where
technically have you ever watched the
wire
no [ __ ] okay it's one of those things
where like you can have a whole system
that winds up being like pretty
homophobic
like an entire system that does it and
there's only really like a few people
that are genuine bad faith actors
like for the most part a lot of people
just kind of like along for the ride
kind of like because of what you said
initially people are dumb
reformed to like people are kind of
victims of circumstance i think
okay
i just every time i i think about this i
keep going back to
um thinking about it not being
normalized
kind of just feels like it's auto
radicalizing anyone who would find those
jokes funny
like if they don't have a place to if
it's not normal or okay
around their group of friends or to hear
on a youtube video or something
these kinds of jokes but they think
these kinds of jokes are funny or they
want to say these kinds of jokes
i just feel like that kind of person
that actually is neutral might be pushed
toward these like
4chan style like white supremacist white
supremacist white nationalist groups
because that's the only place that they
can
talk about these things and then they
get radicalized from that and that's
like
that's what i always thought i thought
that if we don't normalize this stuff
then we're essentially radicalizing the
people who would
wouldn't necessarily be that way because
they can't find
friendship in anyone and they feel like
they're constantly being
i like okay so on the podcast it felt
like
like i get that being racist is bad i
get that being a
you know shooting up a school or
whatever is bad i get that all these
things are bad you know
but i don't understand why we have to be
so angry at it i don't know why we can't
look at it through a more understanding
lens and i'm not saying being
understanding of them
i'm saying understand them you know like
understand i totally agree this is why
yeah this is why i'm popular and what i
do what i do because i don't usually
come at it from like the screeching like
you've got white privilege and
everything you say stupid and blah blah
blah blah
i do think that uh on the left or i
guess i guess like progressives are
usually really bad
at communicating their points um because
of stuff i've said before like um
if you come at somebody and you tell
them immediately that they're racist and
they don't feel like they're a racist
they're probably not going to listen to
anything that you say
because they know that you're wrong so
they're going to write you off
immediately for sure yeah but isn't joke
demonizing a little bit of a form of
that
um someone makes a joke like that and
you're like hey you can't [ __ ] talk
about [ __ ] like that
and then you're making that person feel
like they're other or something and they
want to go find a place where they
feel like they can well i mean who
wouldn't find that funny yeah i mean
like
there are ways that you have to call
this out and not like really
aggressively but i mean you're also not
really considering the flip side of this
either right so like on one hand you've
got a person and you're really really
scared
of saying something that might hurt
their feelings because you're telling
that you don't want them to joke about a
certain
thing but what you're ignoring is like
well if we let them joke about a certain
thing there's like a very real group of
people that are like
measurably harmed by the spread of these
types of pervasive thoughts
which which i think is something that we
kind of overlook a lot especially if we
don't belong to any of those groups like
realistically like whatever like every
lgbt person in the world can be [ __ ]
discriminating it doesn't affect
why i don't know about you but it
doesn't affect me at the end of the day
or same thing with black people or
hispanic people or middle eastern people
like i mean i'm white and straight
male and so it's whatever so it's like
it's easier for me to say like well hold
on
like i should be able to say whatever
joke because at the end of the day they
really don't affect me but i don't think
we consider all that there are a lot of
these groups of people
that are belonging to a lot of you know
these larger groups that kind of end up
feeling like [ __ ] when people constantly
you know take jokes at their expense i
think yeah that's something i can't
understand from any point of view
because i
can't imagine being offended by a joke
you know so it's hard for me to
empathize with that
truly like it doesn't matter it doesn't
matter if i'm a part of it
you know like i've never been offended
by like bimbo jokes or sexist jokes or
anything
so from my standard this is like i'm
gonna
i'm taking a lot of wild shots here and
making a lot of assumptions about you
which is kind of unfair
but um in some ways uh you being a woman
um that's attractive that does what she
does like kind of benefits you in a lot
of ways
um but maybe let's say that if you would
have and i don't know if you did this
but like so you're okay with like people
joking about it right now because it's
not really like a negative aspect to you
it's literally how you make your living
let's say that you wanted to go into
engineering or you wanted to be a doctor
or something
and then people started making those
jokes in conjunction with excluding you
from groups and whatnot
i feel like you might have like a
slightly different opinion of like how
you hear that those
types of jokes if it's actively being
used to discriminate against you rather
than people that are just attacking you
but you actually use it as like a form
of strength i guess
well i mean there are times when i'm
trying to do something serious and i
literally cannot be taken seriously
because of the way that i look and
that's just like a thing that
happens i just feel like if there is a
way for anyone to ever
become okay with these kinds of jokes
that target their little demographic or
whatever
i feel like they should and that's
another ramification
of not allowing people to hear that kind
of criticism within a joke
is that a lot of people will become more
and more sensitive
and very easy to control with words
because
they're not building a thick skin for it
you know like i understand that
like there's a lot of marginalized
groups right now
but i also feel like they they should
have bigger problems than words
and jokes i don't know yeah and i mean i
totally agree with you and that's kind
of one of the problems like
the problem is that like none of this
stuff ever just stops as like words or
jokes like
that a lot of these things kind of like
end up manifesting down the line like
for like if black people only ever had
to worry about being called the n-word
or something in society a lot of them
probably wouldn't care that much
it's more the fact that like if you get
pulled over by a cop you have no idea
what that interaction is gonna look like
you know if you do get arrested you
don't know if you're gonna get a fair
shake in court
um if some you know if you get turned
down for a job you know when you're
in the south like you don't know if it's
because the guy just doesn't like you
because you're black
um you know if you go to date a girl
something is innocuous like
no well to some level like you're kind
of always nervous meeting your
girlfriend's parents as a guy
but for black people holy [ __ ] that
experience is way [ __ ] if you're a
black guy dating a white girl meeting
her family is like one of the scariest
[ __ ] moments in your life
and these are like a lot of things that
like white people think of and it's more
than
you're not scared that like a police
officer is going to call you the n-word
or judge isn't quite the end
or your girlfriend's dad isn't quite
there you're worried that there's gonna
be actual measurable harm done
in your life as a result of some of the
preconceived notions that people hold
about you
so are you saying like uh when people
say that kind of stuff you
get nervous that people will react in
that way or are you saying it's kind of
like kicking a person while they're down
like
the word alone wouldn't mean anything
but after they've experienced all these
like hardships all day and having these
problems that like
they don't need that as well like which
i think i just think that people at the
end of the day don't empathize well with
other people and that if you joke
constantly at the expense of certain
groups of people especially people that
are already [ __ ] in life you kind of
lead more people to kind of like take on
those attitudes
like something that i've been
uncomfortable with for a long time and
i've even stopped doing it over the past
probably two months it's even like using
like autistic or [ __ ] as an insult
because there are a lot of people that
have a lot of problems in their lives
because of these and like i don't know
if i normalize that type of humor like
actually it still happens today
right if somebody comes up to you and
you know they're like hey i've got
cerebral palsy
nobody in chat is going to laugh at that
or make fun of them nobody's going to
make fun of you for having cerebral
palsy because it's a [ __ ]
it's a horrible disease nobody jokes
about that but if somebody comes up
you're like hey sorry you know i'm i'm
autistic everybody in joe and chad is
gonna start making jokes about it like
oh [ __ ] what are you [ __ ] asking like
everybody's gonna laugh about it and
it's like [ __ ] like that kind of sucks
you know like
you don't really necessarily have
control over either of those things but
people are gonna make fun of you for one
instead of the other because of the way
the kind of culture works around them
okay i think i'm better understanding
where you come from with it it's just
i don't know i i still i still see that
as like
i don't okay so in that situation
the person would be sad because they're
being made fun of yeah and not just that
again like
it never stops here it's like maybe you
don't get invited to hang out with
groups of friends and you don't know why
you don't know if it's because of
something you're [ __ ] up or if it's
because they don't like a particular
minority group you belong to or you
don't get a job or you get an unfair
shake somewhere else right it's
all these questions are always in the
back of your head you know women deal a
lot with this like in the in the tech
world and whatnot or even in the
business world
oh here's like an actual study that like
i could look this up if you wanted to go
over it but like for instance um
uh if a woman presents an idea in a
boardroom full of men
um she'll get some reception to it if a
man presents the exact same idea he's
more likely to get a more favorable
reception than the woman would just by
virtue of being a man if both
presentations are more or less identical
like this is stuff that's been studied a
lot in the past
oh with the women and men thing oh god i
don't know if i want to go down that
rabbit hole but i honestly
feel like you know men and women both
have their strengths and weaknesses and
with women
they will also get treated initially
better
or anything that they do well will be
like oh my god you did it so well even
though it's something that a man can do
easily
i just feel like there are strengths and
weaknesses that women have and
to show me that someone won't take
something more seriously
in one situation but in other situations
the girl has it easier
it's just well like so like a lot of
them a lot of women would actually say
that they don't like either of those
um a comparable thing for black people
is as a black person it can be really
[ __ ] annoying when a white person
says to you oh wow you speak
really well because like for like an
educated black person like the [ __ ] the
[ __ ] is that supposed to be like
how do you expect me to talk you know um
and then same thing with women a lot of
women in um
tech or like medical stuff don't like
the condescending like oh wow like
you're a woman and you got a he's like
that's really good like that stuff feels
equally as shitty as somebody's saying
like you don't belong here because
you're a woman
so i mean both parts of these can can be
disliked by you know by the minority
groups that are affected by them
yeah i can understand that i
what's the harm in in things being
inequal so this is so this is from my
we're running down to like normative
ethics okay we're getting very
foundational so for me
i think because i'm a very big liberal
in the sense that i'm
from pro liberalism uh not like liberal
conservative but like for like a liberal
society
i'm very much in favor of people having
the freedom to choose the things that
they truly want to choose
to make them happy as free from
environmental pushiness as possible
so if a girl grows up and without kind
of being pushed hardcore into anything
decides that she wants to play with
computers or if a boy grows up and he
decides that he wants to play with
something
i think that people should be free to
kind of choose what their interests are
and kind of explore that as much as
possible with as little negative
pressure from society as possible that's
like that would be my goal my dream
society
so if growing up if you're a girl and
you want to play with computers and do
that
i don't like the idea of a lot of people
telling you whether it's via tv shows
whether it be a humor and jokes whether
it's via
actual teachers or parents telling you
you shouldn't play with this because
you're a girl and girls tend to be
better at these other things
just because girls are boys and i you
know i actually i agree with you like
men and women are probably
on the strict biological level are
probably somewhat suited differently but
i don't think that that kind of
naturalistic argument should lock you
into having to follow a certain road in
your life like and i don't think people
should prejudge you based on your
gender or sex on what you have to do
either you should be able to choose what
you want to do without people giving you
[ __ ] for it i think
well yeah i agree with that but i think
that over correcting for it can often
it creates a divide i don't know well
like it creates a divide
over correcting what do you mean by over
correcting for it
like affirmative action type stuff or
like gender quotas
or diversity quotas um so like i think
typically the um
typically the way that it goes for um
over over
um these are totally different arguments
all right well
so if we want to dip into like
affirmative action so the idea is that
the thing that sucks about society is
that a lot of the stuff we have
is like very cyclical so there's never
just like and this is kind of one of
those things earlier that i hate about
this stuff it's so complicated there's
never just
one thing that would say keep a woman
from pursuing a job in tech right
there's like 20 different stages in life
where this could be impacted
so for instance um when you grow up your
parents might buy you
different types of toys to play with so
there's a study that shows that women
were making gains in like four different
areas
um against men in society except for in
computer science it dramatically dropped
off in like the 80s
and one of the hypotheses that people
suggest for this is that even though
women were starting to make gains here
when video games were introduced they
were only marketed towards boys because
they were violent and as boys got more
hands-on experience with video games and
and all that and grew up by the time
they hit college they had way more
experience with women than
that stuff right so maybe just like the
toys your parents buy you might push you
you know on one way or another towards
like a certain interest and then past
that
maybe you have teachers that um don't
treat you
as well as boys like if you're a girl
you don't get treated as well as a boy
in certain topics
a huge meta-analysis a huge study was
published i want to say this was even
this made it to the
life um or time not not like sorry time
magazine
um about like a conclusive meta-analysis
that proved that boys in school
were more geared towards math than girls
and it had all these studies that went
through all this it was like a huge
[ __ ] thing
and um what it would happen was even
though that was considered like really
huge
as people went back and they started to
analyze the data what they found out was
well hold on it's not just that boys
participate in math more than girls
it's literally that if a boy and a girl
raise their hand at the same time in
class a teacher is more likely to call
on a boy than a girl
that little things like that can push
you right and then you've got and then
there's like a million more things right
if every tv show that you watch
um if every tv show that you watched is
geared towards like showing women doing
one thing and men doing another thing
that could push you know you towards a
different type of career um there's
something called the scully effect where
a couple people
um gathered data about women that were
more interested in going into like
forensics and whatnot
just because they watched um uh the uh
not twilight zone um
the x-files growing up and they saw
scully as an agent with muller and
because she was doing things they were
more motivated to go into
you know like science disciplines
there's like there's like i said i could
go on but like there's a million little
parts of your life like that
that could come together to kind of push
you towards certain fields to do things
and i think that like yeah i'm gish
gathering the [ __ ] out of you so i got
it
it's fine all right um so you think that
these
little things being piled on um okay
let's say that
you're a little girl and you want to go
into something
math or something um all these little
things like in the back of your mind
telling you that you shouldn't really be
able to do that or whatever you and you
end up
growing up going into something else do
you really think that that person um in
the back of their mind is thinking like
i'm unhappy with my life
we can argue that you can argue that now
she actually thinks she wants to do
something else
and it's really hard to actually tell
if that's just her biology or her
preference or something changing in her
because you know you can always go you
can always persevere and you can always
be a woman
in tech or something but are you
actually saying that that person
who doesn't because they feel like it's
going to be too hard
is sad now because i'm hearing that
you're also saying that it's
changing what they think about what they
should be doing
but then i'm also hearing that you're
it's hard to explain
i mean i think there's anything else no
no i understand what you're saying like
i i think that it's
what i'm saying is that whatever level
of happiness that you achieve in a
society
that pushes you towards a certain thing
i would think or i would hope that it's
possible to
for one it's more economically efficient
and then hopefully you would be happier
choosing something that you truly wanted
to to choose
rather than kind of what society pushed
you that like maybe a woman grows up and
she kind of wanted to do tekken at early
age
she got pushed out now she has kids and
she's happy and all of that but maybe in
another lifetime maybe she would have
been happier making the choice to go
into tech
and more importantly maybe it's
important to give people that choice and
even if they would be less happier at
least they were able to make that choice
on their own rather than society pushing
them in a certain direction
okay because i feel like a lot of people
who advocate for like the we need to
represent women more in video games or
tech or whatever um
i feel like they're kind of doing the
same thing that the people who just
didn't put those girls than
advertisements are doing they're kind of
unless they had they have perfect equal
representation in every ad or
in every classroom or whatever they're
kind of over correcting and doing the
same thing but opposite
i mean it's really hard to navigate like
what exactly is the perfect amount of
just having people see things so that
they end up doing it you know because
i feel like it's it's also the parental
responsibility to tell your kid that you
can
do anything and if you have a [ __ ]
parent like what are you going to do you
know like
i don't know parents it's very rare that
parents tell their kids they can do
anything right like
how many like the difference um the
difference between how parents treat
their daughters and their sons is like
pretty massive
in society in terms of like what they
think their children should be allowed
to do
i don't i don't know well like so for
instance like look at like um so here's
like a standard thing in society look at
how protective
fathers are of their daughter's
sexuality you would never see somebody
treat a son like that right
okay um yeah like that's an example like
you know treating a son really poorly if
he decides that he wants to wear certain
clothes or do things that might be
considered feminine right some fathers
tend to push their sons into hyper
masculine things like you've got to play
football you got to be more rugged
um i um i don't want to have seen this
person because it's anecdotal [ __ ]
but like i mean like this is something
that happens like it's
pretty well observed in society the
fathers will push their sons towards
certain things and sometimes like girls
will be pushed towards other things like
you should know how to cook and clean
you should although not as much today as
it was like 20 or 30 years ago
yeah but um but yeah i mean i mean even
like and and again the important thing
when i talk about all of these things
the thing that is so frustrating about
all this is there are no bad actors here
so my mom i would have sent my mom one
of the most like loving people that i
know she's nice she's warm she's loving
she loves everybody blah blah
but if i talk to her about like women in
the workplace like my mom will
un-ironically tell me like i don't know
if it's a good idea that women are
working i think women's place is at home
taking care of the family my mom is the
[ __ ] air force and she'll say this to
me and i don't think it's because she
hates women it's just
her kind of way of how she's grown up so
that's like another thing to keep in
mind i'm not i'm not saying that any
individual person here is like an evil
person for
killing women and destroying their hopes
and dreams it's just something that we
all kind of do
that yeah that i would hope would kind
of change a little bit
okay and you think that it would be
changed
okay so what needs to change do you
think just the advertising the schools
and the way people interact with their
male or female children
you want them to be raised as like a a
nothing
well like i guess like i mean like my
dream or my goal i guess
it always has to be multifaceted
approach so like in terms of like
representation and media i think having
like a diverse cast of people to look up
to i think is really important
um there's a lot of little boys that
grew up like oh wow like i really like
superman
or i really like batman or i like all
these superheroes and then there weren't
really like counterparts for black
people
you had like blade or morpheus i guess i
don't know you didn't have like a lot of
counterparts for black people to look up
to
um or you didn't have or if you were a
woman you had like one or two
superheroes to look up to wearing like
the amazonian armor and like that was
all you ever really had so like mainly
it was geared towards
you know boys you know advertising like
masculine means honorable and strong and
blah blah and feminine is whatever
gets left behind that's not cool um but
why do you need to have more than a few
people representing it especially when
like for instance with
blacks there's less blacks than whites
in america so it would make sense that
there are less black superheroes or
whatever
um well i mean because you you don't
need like i'm not saying that like
everything has to necessarily be like 50
50 like
all across the board but i think like
having like a decent cast of like people
um just so that p there are like if
whatever like race or
um gender you are like it would be nice
if you had more than like one superhero
a decade to look up to like
i don't think we're at a point right now
where like as a white person i'm like
[ __ ] i just don't have anybody to look
up to in society like i'm so [ __ ] i
mean like it's still like majority white
if you look like the marvel cast
most of the people there are still like
white men i don't think that any
position is threatened
okay um see like in the past i would
make the argument
uh like just naturally i would make the
argument that like
of of course you can do whatever you
want and you don't need a representation
to tell you what you can do but
obviously you're talking about the whole
like it's little things
throughout your entire lifetime
that just kind of ingrained that in your
brain and of course you know that you
can do anything but you don't really
feel it
yeah okay like it like it
it's just like like if you're like a
woman growing up like your whole life
like
is there a reason why like a lot of it
doesn't even make sense if you think
about it a lot right
is there a reason why women are better
suited towards being teachers than men
like we kind of think that i mean i
would argue that there is
but then if we were to step into a
university most of the teach most of the
professors are men
or like we would say like women are
generally better cooks than men right
like women should be cooking but if we
step into any four-star restaurant all
of the sous chefs and a lot of people
are going to be men so like
even but then i would still even argue
that that's because
like when it when you get to the top of
the top of anything it's
men just obsessively being trying to be
the best at something
rather than caring to have interpersonal
relationships or settle down with a
family or something
yeah but i mean if you go to an ihop i
mean i you can go to any any store that
has like line cooking it's always going
to be men like
it's very rare to have a woman on the
line in any restaurant even in like
shitty restaurants and i don't think
that like the most ambitious cooks are
working
you know microwaving vegetables in an
applebee's kitchen um i just think that
um
i just think that all of these like
little things that you see throughout
your entire life like
men are supposed to be doctors nurses
are supposed to be women like these are
just kind of things that get so
ingrained in us for no real reason
um i think i think it's okay to have
like different representatives in
different areas
so that like when you grew up you're
just not stuck with that hardcore like
if there were a lot of female
superheroes and you didn't ever watch
superhero movies and you didn't care
about it it's not like it's going to
impact anybody negatively but if you did
like them i think it'd be cool to be
able to see people there that kind of
represent you
okay kind of like in the world cup how
like everybody had like the world cup
isn't like
16 teams from brazil and like one from
germany or something right like it's one
team i
right i think it's like one team from
every country that participates in the
world cup you know
because everybody likes to see their
team there it makes people feel good to
see that they have representation
somewhere
or if you remember from starcraft right
when we had the big debate on whether or
not koreans should be in every single
tournament
nobody like that ah it blows my mind
because people on one hand say like i
don't need representation in media and
then everybody wanted to split up all
the regions in the world because they
were tired of koreans winning every
tournament
now replace koreans with white people
and then be like a black person in like
america watching movies and it's like
the same thing you know
yeah but i wouldn't i would never argue
for splitting out the regions in
starcraft i
you know i just saw that koreans were
better than
you know foreigners or whatever and
there was you know they had to get
better if they wanted to be up
on the stage with them i don't know like
it's really hard for me to empathize
because i come from a place where like
i feel like i can do anything i was
raised that i can do anything i was
raised
pretty agender where i played video
games with my dad and then you know i
was more adventurous more tomboy and i
can't understand
it's really i i understand what you're
saying like there's another thing i feel
no how effective
correcting for it is either and like it
becomes when it comes
becomes compulsory that there's some
kind of i don't think you i don't i'm
not saying that you're saying that
everyone should be like a like you said
it doesn't have to be like full
diversity and like forced and stuff
i feel like there are a lot of people
that are taking it too far
it to the point where they're making
things on fun or something or like
worrying too much about offending people
or worrying too much it's just i don't
know i guess like the thing that kind of
like made me take a step back and really
analyze it when you say things like that
so like for instance like maybe i can't
make certain friends because of the type
of humor that i use
i think that like at the end of the day
i think it's important to step back and
be like well hold on like
why is this type of humor so important
to me and my character that i
literally can't think of like can i
really not think of a way to call
somebody stupid without comparing them
to somebody that's [ __ ]
is it really impossible for me to do is
that such an important part of my
character
that i'm willing to like lose friends or
seclude myself in the world because i
can't let go of that form of humor i
don't know i feel like
that should be something you can
overcome well i understand that
position but i'm not like holding on to
one specific type of humor
it's just more like when i think of
something in my head or when i want to
be able to say it it's a unique thing i
just i just want to be able to be myself
all the time 100 of the time and that's
kind of my shtick
on youtube now especially so
i don't really care to argue about for
myself because no matter the outcome of
this even if you change my mind i'm
probably gonna still
do it because it's easier for me and i
don't know i'm a psychopath or something
i don't really care about other people
but i do want to understand other people
and where they come from
as much and as intimately as i possibly
can and
this has just always been kind of a
disconnect i feel like
all of these things that you're telling
me are there they're smart
and it seems good but i don't know if
it's actually
going to work out the way that you think
it would or that it's as important as
you think it is
i mean so like here's like so i'm
similar to you um
unfortunately i would consider this to
be a detriment i used to consider to be
positive
and that i have a very hard time
emotionally relating to other people um
when i was in high school i jerked this
off a lot because i thought it was
really cool but now that i'm older i
think it's actually a detriment to my to
my character
um a lot of the stuff that i've had to
learn has come from personal experiences
with other people
so here's an argument and you might even
remember making these arguments um
here's an argument that i used to use a
long time ago when it comes to women in
video games
um i don't think that women should
complain so much about being harassed in
video games because everybody gets
harassed in video games
literally no matter who the [ __ ] you are
you've always had somebody call you
where you've always had somebody hate
you've always said some people do crazy
[ __ ] [ __ ] especially somebody like me
has gotten more hate than 99 of women in
gaming um just by virtue of being
as big in public as i am and i'm a man
so women shouldn't complain about it
um i had a friend that was between jobs
and she played a lot of cs go and we
sat down to play cs go over the course
of a month and i'd never i'd played like
a few games with her but i never like
hardcore like played a lot of games with
her
and when we hopped into a game um the
first game that we played it was cs go
we loaded it up um i think she called
out like two people on v or whatever and
as soon as she talked somebody made some
dumb joke like oh like
go go wow it's not a girl you should go
make a sandwich well like same dumb [ __ ]
whatever okay that's fine and then we
got through that game and then we got to
the next game and then the same thing
happened
you know she called out like somebody's
unable and i was like oh what's that is
that hold on is there a woman maybe you
should be stuck on a deck
and by like the fourth or fifth game i
was actually like ptsd
every [ __ ] time we started a game i
was getting anxious waiting for her to
open her mic and say the first thing so
everybody could get their stupid [ __ ]
jokes out of the way
and after the first day i was actually
done with it i was actually so [ __ ]
triggered
that every time we joined a game every
[ __ ] game we joined and this was like
five or six years ago so it's gotten a
little bit better now like overwatch
everything
but every single [ __ ] game we joined
as soon as she talked every [ __ ] guy
would have the same stupid [ __ ] joke
to say
over and over and over and over again
and it drove me [ __ ] crazy
and i took that experience and the
embarrassing thing is that i've had
experiences like this in my life that i
couldn't relate to
these types of things so for instance if
you work in customer service if you've
ever worked retail before
having a customer come up you scan the
item and it doesn't go through and the
customer is like oh
does that mean it's free like even
hearing something is innocuous is that
like [ __ ] your joke is not funny dude
[ __ ] off but like imagine that as a
targeted insult
over and over and over again and i
started to realize like well [ __ ] like
if i heard this [ __ ]
every single day in my real life i don't
actually know how this would affect me
over a long scale of time
i like to think that i'm kind of like
this beacon of rationality and like this
[ __ ] wouldn't get to me and maybe it
even wouldn't
but for most people holy [ __ ] this [ __ ]
is annoying i can't imagine hearing this
on top of like the far worse stuff that
targets you because of your gender as
well
so you don't think that the stuff that
you get over and over again as
you the streamer is just as
often um i mean i probably get it worse
but like i mean
we also have to consider that like we're
pretty exceptional in terms of where we
are like i wouldn't be here if i wasn't
like a cold
[ __ ] right like it's just like
by virtue of like surviving to this
level
but i don't think it's reasonable to
expect the average person like
you know oh yeah you know i've had the
fbi calling me twice you know to show up
my house anybody should be able to do it
like i think that's pretty
crass or not crass they're pretty naive
of me to expect that any single person
could deal with that
um so like yeah even if i might get like
more hate than the average person i
still think it's really important to
realize that one
people shouldn't be expected to go
through this and then too not everybody
can deal with like the same level of
hatred as like
you know high-level content creators
just by virtue of where we are right
seems like it's kind of a cycle like um
girls wouldn't get that much [ __ ] if
they were actually good at video games
but what's stopping girls from being
good at video games is the fact that
they're currently getting that [ __ ]
yeah and this is like the [ __ ] thing and
there's no bad actors but like say like
a girl wants to start playing games
early on
and then her parents are like stop like
it's your brother's playstation or
nintendo like [ __ ] off go do something
else it's fine they get older they get
to high school and maybe they want to
play with games
um but now there's not as many girls
playing because a lot of them are pushed
out of and they want to play with their
guy friends but they're always kind of
[ __ ] at games
and then when they show up there it's
very rare that a girl's there so
everybody kind of fawns over and be like
oh look at you [ __ ] e thought [ __ ]
upper video games
and then you get to online gaming and
the only thing you can play our support
class is because you've been bullied out
of your whole life
and now you have guys saying well you
know maybe if you were good at games we
wouldn't be [ __ ] all of you it's
like what the [ __ ] like holy [ __ ] like
i've been [ __ ] my whole life to try to
play games and now that i want to get
involved in it like i'm still
yeah it's a horrible [ __ ] nasty cycle
i think
yeah it's just i always come back in my
mind because i experienced that exact
same thing
and if i was really [ __ ] good at
video games which i could if i just like
stuck to one video game and just like
grinded it out and didn't stream it and
didn't listen to anyone else i could get
there
and i just don't i don't feel like
that's on anyone else but me that i
didn't do that like yeah people are
gonna tell you not to do things but
people are always gonna
be around to tell you not to do things
yeah so like i understand what you're
saying
um i'm not trying to sound like um like
i'm brushing it off but like that sort
of analysis i don't think
um serves us well because it's just not
a very realistic way
to analyze broad groups of people like
this is like um
like i'll be like a little bit ego
driven here like i think that i have a
penchant for dealing with a lot more
than the average person
um and i think that because of like the
things that i've learned in my life i
think i'm capable of a lot more than the
average person
but i have to be careful and understand
like because of my circumstances i am
where i am
and it would be foolish of me to demand
every other person would rise to some
very specific challenges that i was able
to meet because it's not realistic
so for example somebody was like really
poor and was really [ __ ] and they had
a big health thing coming up and they're
like their life is [ __ ] i wouldn't say
that person well listen dude
i was in your spot and i became like a
massive streamer you should be able to
do the same thing
you know and like i mean i could that's
what all the right-leaning people and
all the centrists on youtube do like
they basically will take like one-off
examples like i can make so much money
if i was that person on youtube right
well it's okay guys like
is there not is there not some merit in
that kind of
stuff like are you from the time like
normal distribution like you've got like
the big hump in the middle and like the
things at the end yeah yeah so like just
because there are people that exist at
the ends doesn't mean that we can expect
everybody to move there no
i don't think there's much merit in that
direction it's kind of like when people
say like black people are okay in the us
because obama was president well just
because one person can make it out like
that's an exceptional character you know
yeah but on one side you're making
excuses on the other side you're
okay so like on on your end on the
extreme end of what
you are saying is making excuses on the
extreme end where i am
it's um expecting way too much of the
average
person but i think there are also merits
to the
the stuff that i say it's kind of
empowering in a way
well like what you say is like it's kind
of like mind [ __ ] but like what you
would say i would always give us
personal advice
or in the form of self-help advice don't
let anybody keep you down [ __ ] anybody
that talks [ __ ] to you
like you have to rise above you know you
have to be successful not because of but
in spite of like these are things i
would give like as personal pieces of
advice
to people but from a broader range like
it's just not realistic to expect like
no
class problem or no class struggle has
ever been solved by telling you know
people like hey guys you just need to
act better like you can do it like i
believe in you right you have to change
that's true but i think that the
one single person especially someone
who's just talking about like philosophy
or politics or something
all they can do is really inspire people
you're not going to change any
legislation or anything you're not going
to actually well but you can change
legislation right
so like for instance like here's the
thing right every well i would assume
that like most black people that are in
jail have probably committed crimes
right so what we could do is we could
tell black people like well stop
committing crimes you don't go to jail
it's like
okay i mean that's something we could do
i don't think that's very
realistic or like successful like to
tell people do that or
maybe we do something where it's like
hey well if we make lax
some of the um you know statutory jail
times or certain crimes like say
marijuana
maybe if a black person commits a crime
maybe they're not locked in jail that
[ __ ] their whole life
up maybe they just pay a small fine and
that black person can still go on to
have a family and to be there for their
kid and then that black person's kid
won't necessarily be a criminal because
he's coming from a two-pound household
and he's better off right
so in this way we've kind of amended
social policy to put people in a better
position
to make it so like the next generation
is better off without just telling
people to act better you know you can
always do both
yeah no i'm actually for that what i'm
saying is you and i like people with a
platform who are just speaking
we we can't necessarily like i'm for
certain reforms
that will make it so that newer
generations don't feel the
institutional racism of before you know
and they have better like starting
points or whatever
i'm all for that but at the same time i
feel like the only thing you really can
do
i have a problem okay let's talk about
mental health like i have a problem
with how much it feels like feeling
bad for people with mental health health
or like
bad mental health or like telling people
like it's okay
i'm here for you just take as much time
as you want like all of that stuff
there's a fine line between like being
nice to people who are having issues and
also
enabling them you know like
for for me it's always felt like a lot
of the
tiptoeing around and stuff is kind of
enabling and normalizing them having an
issue rather than
than them going and seeking help like
you have to take responsibility for that
and so because that's kind of my natural
position anyway is to be
colder i would i would rather be talking
about
that end of it yeah of course you should
have people in your life that like are
there for you and like make excuses for
you and stuff but
it just seems like a lot of that like if
we all changed as a society
to not not do certain jokes to be
more sensitive around like first of all
a lot of the the like minority
groups and stuff don't want people to
walk on eggshells around them
it can be harmful to walk on eggshells
around these people right
like like they don't want to be treated
other do they
i mean um so like i mean like when so
so i'll do my brief spill so for mental
health stuff really quickly
um there's oh this is a really
complicated topic
the the big problem with like mental
health related stuff
oh god this sounds so [ __ ] shitty to
lead us is it like if you haven't been
there it's
really really really really [ __ ] hard
to understand that the struggles
somebody with mental health goes through
like it's like you're literally like you
go to sleep at night and you are stuck
in the bottom of a pit that
nobody else can like climb into and help
you out of like you feel so
absolutely like you feel a loneliness on
a level that is inexplicable even if
you're around other people you feel so
cut off from everybody in society that
nobody can understand you
nobody knows what you feel like um and
like these people are
so absolutely [ __ ] in a lot of ways
that i think in a lot of ways
it's i think it is really positive to
provide like some level of understanding
for a person that's in that position
like now i do agree with you that you
shouldn't necessarily like enable
um unhealthy behavior but i i feel like
we're still at a part on society where
people are
really clueless about the struggles that
somebody like
actual like severe depression goes
through because it's so much more than
just feeling sad
like you know like when you say friends
like if you're feeling sad here are
things that you should do to make
yourself feel better
the problem with somebody with
depression is they don't even see the
point in that right like if you're sad
you usually you have
the desire to get better most people
don't want to be sad but somebody with
depression doesn't want anything they
just exist in this kind of like hollow
empty state where everything in life
feels pointless um so i don't
necessarily think we're
in an area right now where we're
indulging too much you know in like
in bad mental health enabling i don't
think that necessarily happens right now
um okay um how how do i navigate a
person who has
mental health issues because like
i i don't know if you think this is too
off topic but i genuinely don't know
like i always just say like i've never
struggled with mental health but i hope
that you're you're doing your best
to not like just self-indulge forever
and not get any help you know like i
really hope that you get help or
something
but i don't i don't know like a lot of
people say that like oh as soon as i
went and got and did xyz
therapy or something or had some kind of
intervention i i got better
but then i see a lot of people who are
talking about debilitating anxiety and
it's like
is that actually happening or are you
just making excuses for not doing the
things you're supposed to do and you
want sympathy like it's really hard to
tell the difference
so would your argument b just like
pretend that everyone
is actually feeling the same level of i
mean like if somebody says that they're
suffering from those problems you don't
want to deal with it
i would say like just don't talk to them
but like i would be really cautious
against like delegitimizing people
that um that feel like they have issues
like well yeah i would never try to do
it yeah but but like
yeah i mean like um this is a really
really um
[ __ ] i don't know what to say it's so
hard do you think that i'm like a pretty
mentally strong person
uh i guess i don't know okay i mean i
would like to think i am i think i've
been through more than
than most people and i think i've gotten
through like a lot of stuff but like
i've had a couple i've had two different
periods in my life where i suffered from
something similar to depression and then
something similar to anxiety
um and in both cases it was very
short-lived thank the [ __ ] lord
but like in the second case like i was
actually so [ __ ] that i was like
laying in bed like wanting to do nothing
and like i was literally like texting
this is stuff that i would never
consider doing in my normal state but i
was literally like texting like the
mother of my child like telling her that
like i would give her full custody
because i'm a failure of a person and i
don't want to be around my kid anymore
like this is like how [ __ ] my head was
and there's no possible way that at that
point in time
like anybody could have talked to me and
have told me like are you really just
being anxious because it's kind of a me
like do you like the attention that
you're getting like that's like so far
outside of the lived experience
of a lot of people with mental health
that i think you have to be like really
really careful and it can be really hard
to empathize with if you haven't been
there but i would be like really careful
in telling people
like i think that you're just being
depressed because you're like either
really narcissistic or you kind of just
want the attention for it i think that's
like
well yeah i would i wouldn't do that but
like i would just
i would try to be gentle about it but if
i see someone that keeps exhibiting this
behavior they're not doing anything to
get any help i would
just like kind of nudge them into
responsibility for it a little bit like
getting help
because you you can i don't know i
i think i feel things differently than
other people because like the reason
that i'm doing the raw show and the
reason that i'm talking to you right now
is because
i've developed this weird social anxiety
where like if i
what i want to do eventually is to be
kind of like you
where i actually have live debates with
people and i feel like i'm okay
as long as i'm alone but i've developed
this weird like i don't talk to people
and when i do like
it almost feels like my teeth are
chattering because i'm so nervous
and stuff you know and like that's why i
started doing this stuff because i'm
like this is
not healthy this isn't a good way to
view things and this isn't going to work
out for your goals and stuff
so i just kind of fixed it but i don't
even i don't know if i
actually had that or it was just
something that was starting and it's
really hard because it's all like a
personal experience you know like
no i can't actually i totally 100
percent get that but
like the hard thing i understand about a
lot of mental health stuff and like i've
i've learned all of this like in the
past year so i'm i would have been 100
on your page
uh if you would have talked to me one
year ago about this the hard thing with
a lot of mental health stuff is that
um like you that you have an inner
person that exists
that has certain desires that you have
never questioned before or i'm guessing
i know i haven't
so like when i think of like there is a
um
so like this is how i used to think of
mental health issues okay i have a
problem
um like maybe i want to be more social
or maybe i want to talk to more girls
you know maybe i want to put myself out
there more
and i'm kind of nervous to do it so i'm
going to push through
and i'm going to i'm going to do this
because i want to better myself as a
person
so what i always thought mental health
issues were where like a person lets
their nervousness get the best of them
and they're just not overcoming it right
like
you're nervous and you want to do
something and you know you just got to
push through it and people with mental
illness are just people that let that
nervousness get the best of them
but it's not that at all the thing is is
that like you have this like
underlying thing in you that drives you
that you have no
influence over and your thoughts can
become poisoned before you even know you
have them
so instead of for instance let's say
that i want to put myself out there and
talk to more girls
instead of like i'm nervous and i don't
want to do it instead i have this weird
thing inside of me where it's like
why would i even do that like i don't
think that talking to anybody is going
to make me happy so why would i even try
that
it's like if i'm in one of these states
and somebody tells me like well hold on
you just got to do this and this and
this to overcome it's like
well why would i want to overcome that
like i don't even know if i care about
being happy or existing as a happy
person i don't think any of that is
going to make me feel better
because your thoughts are poisoned
before they even get to your mind and i
think that's the big difference between
a lot of mental illness and a lot of
just kind of like
bad habits and it's so hard to empathize
with because until you've had like that
underlying structure really [ __ ] with
it's really hard to to understand like
why wouldn't you just do this thing to
better yourself because all of the
struggles that people like you and me
have
are things that we can confront head-on
right i have a problem i'm going to do
something to fix it because i want to
fix it and i'm going to think
i'm not even going to think about the
fact that i want to fix it that's
something i take for granted but
somebody with mental health issues they
might not even want to fix it because
their thoughts are already [ __ ] before
they get to the front of their head
well the [ __ ] how do you know if you
have a mental health issue then
um well if you want you can do a [ __ ]
ton of psychedelics and then you can
have some mental health issues for a
while and that's where i got all my
perspective from
um really i'm joking but i'm not joking
like that's that's where like all of
this came from like my
um the amount of understanding that i
gained from mental health issues after
my massive shrimp trip has actually been
so
unbelievable and i feel so [ __ ]
embarrassed for how naive my view was
of mental like so for example my child
my child has hardcore adhd
um not like he can't like you know like
oh like he can't really pay attention to
class and he's just drawing a lot like
he's like rolling on the floor in class
like he cannot stand in a chair or stay
in a chair like two minutes he has to
like crawl through tunnels to like
help him like release his energy between
classes to like maintain focus it's
really hardcore
um so you know we finally got him adhd
medication and it's helped a lot and you
know conjunction with some behavior
stuff
now when i was thinking about that at
the time i was thinking like okay like
if my son needs adhd medication that's
fine i would never take a medication
though for my mind even if i was
depressed
i would never take medicine because i
don't want it to change me and i think i
can fight through any issue like that i
know i can
i knew that 100 that i could do it and
then after um i did a
way too big of a dose of psychedelics
and for a few days
i had like a month stretch where i had
problems with general anxiety
and i had um something related to
depression and when i was in those
states
after coming out of them the biggest
realization i took was that if there was
any medication that i could take
whatever the [ __ ] i had to do to fix the
inner workings of my mind i would do it
without even a second thought
without even considering it if somebody
could present to me some sort of ssri
that could get me out of a state where i
feel no desire towards anything
i wouldn't think twice about doing and i
felt so [ __ ] stupid for thinking
before
that like oh well i could think my way
out of it because what i never
considered was well what if the desire
for me to think my way out of it is
compromise i've never even considered
that thing before it's just always
something that's been there you know
well at what point do you know that you
have a
problem then i'm actually asking because
like well like
i always tell myself that i don't want
to make new friends or i don't i don't
want to actually go out and do stuff and
like i have this problem right now where
i don't know i tell myself i don't want
to go out and like do things on the
strip now that i live in vegas there's a
lot of [ __ ] to do or whatever i tell
myself i don't want to do those things
but at the same time i also have like a
fear of
like ran being randomly attacked or
something and i'm like well why would i
overcome that fear of being randomly
attacked unless i'm already deciding
that i'm gonna do that thing because
i don't really care to do that thing but
like how do i know if that's a problem
like i
i don't even know like how does one know
if they're actually developing it like a
mental problem or if they're just
i think that like their logic is working
against them like i think as long as you
have this kind of like inner drive
to like better yourself and to do things
that make you happy then i think that's
like indicative of of a good like
default mental position if you find that
you want to do things to hurt yourself
or to harm yourself or to [ __ ] yourself
over then
i think you'd have a big problem but as
long as you have like a strong healthy
drive like if you're capable of
identifying a problem
if you're like hey like this is bad and
i need to fix this and then you're
capable of kind of like thinking like
what are the steps i can take to fix it
then you're probably okay
that's generally that's how i am in my
daily life like even if it's something i
don't like i have a problem
you figure out what it is and then you
work to fix it even if you can't
necessarily do it successfully
so you think it like manifests in like
more aspects of your life than just one
if it actually is a problem like where
you just lose drive to actually better
yourself at all
yeah it's where you don't you don't even
have the desire to better yourself
because you don't care
because you're like whatever okay yeah
[ __ ] yeah i don't know anything about
mental health i just try to understand
but also
not enable you know it's like a hard
weird like you've never been there so
you actually can't
like our brains are crazy i don't know
i've been watching these ayahuasca
like [ __ ] vlogs and [ __ ] holy [ __ ] i
want to do that
but um uh going back to okay yeah i
should but
or just your dmt you don't need to do
the full [ __ ] ayahuasca that [ __ ] is
a nightmare
[ __ ] that but if you do dmt and come out
the other side
isn't dmt more dangerous like physically
um i don't
whoa be very responsible if you're gonna
do any drug make sure you do your own
independent research before you take
anything i say
i don't think that dmt is necessarily
like dangerous i don't think it should
be unless you're like a crazy [ __ ]
dose i mean it'll [ __ ] you your mind
will be it is a
crazy [ __ ] trip but from my
understanding like if you do ayahuasca
that's like a 24-hour [ __ ] thing
and you're gonna be [ __ ] and puking
and everything like the whole [ __ ]
time like it's a much harder thing to
deal with because it's on a longer scale
of time
but oh yeah and dmt is only like 15
minutes or something
i think it's like if you smoke dmt it's
like a 10 to 15 minute high at the most
okay i'm really afraid of psychedelics i
feel like
bad tripping like i've been told my
entire life that all that [ __ ] is like
really scary and
to lose my mind would be like scary on
levels that you could
never even imagine you can't fathom the
[ __ ]
horror of dissolving yourself into any
of these crazy [ __ ] drugs it's
unbelievable
jesus so curious though geez
so before when you used to be because
you used to be kind of like a free
speech absolutist right like you used to
be a little more okay
so like what what were your values then
like what did you value
and why didn't you value what you value
now more um
well the problem i internally i still
have like everything that you're saying
are my
core beliefs they really are like i do
think that you shouldn't let other
people dictate like i but
i guess like when when i grew up what i
kind of started to realize was that um
my emotional processing and my drives
are very far outside the norm
um like if i had i don't really have
many friends if i had no relationship if
everybody was calling me an idiot like
i'm okay with that
i like waiting through forms of people i
like i [ __ ] want to post on my own
kiwi farms that [ __ ] is [ __ ] funny to
me i enjoy that i love the conflict okay
that's fun for me however what what i
realized over the past like five or six
years
was that a lot of this was very very far
outside the norm and it was really
stupid of me to project my internal
mechanisms onto
other people and i learned that with a
lot of other
like events that came up and it was kind
of like after some of the events
happened i was like oh
[ __ ] like a lot of what i'm saying is
actually furthering dialogue that i
totally disagree with and i can't
believe how [ __ ] stupid i was to not
see that all of my words were being used
in ways i didn't want them before and
that really bothered me
okay so you you have to frame things in
terms of like what selfishly benefits
you right
kind of yeah okay because i absolutely
have to like so for me the only way i
can
i really like knowledge and that's the
only reason that i care to
like understand everyone else like it's
just like that's what i like you know
but um for me to like
[ __ ] deal with it man up and then
feel also like i'm kind of empowering
people to do that
i would have to
be be benefited like i would have to
maybe like it's more powerful for me to
make
friends and to be
nicer to people you know like maybe that
will benefit me in some way i don't know
like
phil's it sounds horrible i know no i
mean like i mean i've been where
you are like i mean not to say that like
i'm better now but like i understand
like your
your thought process because i've had a
lot of these thoughts before um one
specific thing like
like here's an example of something i
used to say that i still internally
believe but i realize not everybody does
and i was really [ __ ] irritated when
i found this out
um i used to always say i don't care
what the main character of a movie or
video game looks like as long as it's a
good story or a good game
and personally genuinely inside i don't
care i've been to south korea i've been
to taiwan i've been using i've been all
these different places i don't give a
[ __ ] if everybody's asian i'll go hang
out with the offline tv people
they'll some of them will [ __ ] speak
korean if they want me to say it doesn't
bother me i don't care if i'm with a
bunch of people that look differently i
really do feel that way and i used to
make those arguments publicly all the
time
but what happened was what i noticed was
when
games started to come out that were
featuring like hispanic main characters
or female main characters my argument
didn't change i don't give a [ __ ] if
there's like if there's a game when the
lead is like a transgender
[ __ ] black whatever i don't care it
doesn't bother me i still don't care
but all of the people that i thought
agreed with me before were all of a
sudden starting to freak the [ __ ] out
like well hold on
why do we need women in games why do we
need black people what do you mean hold
on i thought we didn't care about this
stuff
and then i realized that all of the
rhetoric that i'd used all of the
speeches i'd given all the points that i
thought i'd made so logically
consistently
were really just being used by a bunch
of insecure people to further the status
quo they actually didn't care about what
i was saying it was just a convenient
truth for them because it furthered
their own beliefs
which was they actually do want people
that look like them they want white men
in all the video games
and that kind of [ __ ] really [ __ ]
bothered me holy [ __ ]
so yeah cause i feel the same
yeah that that's interesting i don't
know so so you feel like
the majority of people who
think like you do because you're so
different
are probably bad actors or potential bad
actors yeah i think basically what
happened was like a lot of my arguments
kind of just ended up furthering a
status quo
and i didn't realize it at the time
because i was too naive i was too busy
projecting my own
internal thoughts into other people
because i kind of thought that like
anybody can do what i can do i don't
think i'm very exceptional like i think
that i just got really lucky blah blah
blah
and i was just a little bit naive
insofar as how other people thought of
things and yeah and i projected my own
thinking onto a lot of other people it's
just really bad
well how do you know if you're actually
different or if you're just hearing from
like a
vocal minority like i don't know well i
mean like i mean i just basically look
at like broad like if you look at like
kotaku in action like that subreddit is
like a really good example
like i used to be like a kotaku an
action hero when i posted that my dick
pick was being hosted on a subway store
i had like the number one uploaded post
of all time and that subreddit for a
while there's so many people behind me
and then as soon as i started to see
places like that like especially a lot
of the gamergate movement was like
starting to freak out because they were
like
women in video games and like a lot of
the arguments that people would make
like for instance if i were to release a
movie with five male actors and the
movie sucked it would just be a bad
movie
but if i released a movie with five
female actors and the movie sucked well
now it's a bad movie because of
diversity like why can't it just be a
bad movie on its own
i basically like when i started to pay
more attention to the arguments i
realized well hold on
i don't think a lot of the people
actually believe in what i'm saying i
think that i was just kind of like a
convenient like mouthpiece
um there's a name for this like a um uh
useful idiot
basically yeah where basically people
were just kind of like writing because
i'm really good at arguing i talk fast
my points sound good so they would just
hop on because i was furthering the
status quo
but as soon as like that started to
change like they're like well [ __ ] hold
on i don't like this anymore i'm gonna
go find a more convenient truth that
kind of suits me right now
why is it not enough though to just
distance yourself from
that whenever it comes up or to i don't
know because i
i think there there's it it makes you
more interesting
if you hold certain opinions but you
don't have the same intents as everyone
else if you're just like a weirdo or
you're different or whatever
i don't know i don't i mean it kind of
does so like here's something that like
so if you go on reset error right now
there's a huge thread of people [ __ ]
on me there because i'm not progressive
enough for them so for me personally
i make a lot of racist jokes and [ __ ] um
personally um
i i like i do i'm like i'm very [ __ ]
edgy my personal conversations my
rationale there is that i'm only with
people that i know and i know that these
people have
certain beliefs and as long as like
somebody's not actually like somebody
hates gay people yeah i'm going to get
engaged in a lot of race of humor with
them
however i'm not going to do that
publicly because i don't know who's
listening to my message at any point in
time
and i don't want to be somewhat i don't
even want to be remotely responsible for
somebody that feels some sort of
camaraderie
or empowerment with the things that i
say my big turning point
a lot of people accuse me of like
bandwagoning this but it was actually
way back in 2013
i radically changed my view of the word
[ __ ] i used to use that word all the
[ __ ] time especially if you were in
the strikers and everybody used it or
everybody didn't give me use it right
and i had a moment where when i was in
poland um
i was listening to two people talk and
one of the other people
um said that and i the way that they
said it i realized like oh [ __ ]
this guy actually hates gay people and i
never had that happen to me before
where i heard somebody use that word and
then use it in a way where it's like wow
this guy actually hates gay people and
as soon as he said it
um what i realized was when i was in
that house i was so [ __ ]
uncomfortable ever saying a word like
that around him
because i don't know if he thinks like
well maybe destiny hates gay people too
like we're like cool like that i
never wanted to say it and then when i
got back to my stream
i started to apply it there like are
there people that listen to me that
actually don't like gay people and when
they hear me use certain words that are
really only powerful because at one
point they do mean gay people do they
think that there's some sort of
camaraderie there do they think that
they have like an ally or a friend there
and i don't want to ever give that
impression like [ __ ] those people so i
won't use that word um or or i
avoid like a lot of kind of like racial
stereotypes of hearing because i don't
want somebody listening to my stream
that like thinks that who thinks i'm
like secret like oh yeah like destiny's
really into
that [ __ ] too like [ __ ] awesome bro
you know so personally for you what is
the
you just don't want people to think that
you might be advocating for that sort of
thing it like grosses you out or
something like what's the personal
benefit there to not being a part of
that um i don't want
well it's twofold um one i don't want
those groups of people that are
disproportionately impacted by those
types of words i don't want them to feel
like [ __ ] when i talk because i don't
mean them too i don't want you to feel
bad if i say some [ __ ] like that so i'll
kind of i'll avoid that if i think it's
if it [ __ ] those two people and then
two
i don't want people that do think that
stuff to feel empowered because they
hear me saying certain things so they
think that they have like an
ally in that fight okay yeah i've
experienced occasionally like some
things that i say i get like a small
group of people who like in the comments
section will say like oh she's one of us
or something and i'm like very [ __ ]
not i've never felt like i needed to do
anything or i had more responsibility
other than
i didn't even feel like it was a
responsibility just something that i did
because it was like oh that's not me you
know i want to clear this up
to just say that no that's not what i'm
saying it's different it's a joke or
it's like
for a different reason you know i mean
that's something that like that really
bothers me like there are certain topics
when i talk about them i have to be
really careful because i don't want the
wrong person feeling like they're an
ally so friends like
um at one point probably still do like
i'm not entirely sure how i feel about
like heavily sexually suggestive content
being on twitch it's something that i'm
kind of on the fence
on and i still lean more towards it
probably shouldn't be here but like dude
like if i make like a tweet or something
on my old twitter if i would make like a
tweet like i don't think that sexually
suggestive content should be on twitch
everybody that tweets like yeah i get
these [ __ ] [ __ ] with like these
[ __ ]
low-cut tops that which was like whoa
like dude what the [ __ ] like this is not
what the [ __ ] i am talking about
and like so i like i have to be
cognizant of that or i feel like i have
a responsibility
because i don't want like some tweet
that i say or some message that i use
to get posted on some [ __ ] board
where somebody's like well look
destiny's really [ __ ] smart and he
says this [ __ ]
like when we know we're in the right i
don't want everyone i don't ever want
anybody to feel that way
that totally disagrees with my main
points okay with that specifically
um i understand
why they speak that way i don't think
it's an inherent hatred for women or
women's sexuality
you know it's like the whole feeling
disenfranchised because you're looking
at someone else's life
from the outside and thinking that they
have it a lot easier you know and
i feel like we should deal with racists
and all these people who have been
pushed to these extremes
in the same way and actually engage with
them
and i feel like that does more good than
pushing them to the fringes and
not even letting them speak or if you do
let them speak
demonizing them you know i feel like
there are a lot of people a lot of
people who would be good
and who wouldn't say things like that
and i've actually had it happen to me
like a billion [ __ ] times
where i engage with someone who's like
[ __ ] [ __ ] put your tits away like
you're you're good for nothing but
whatever the [ __ ]
and i don't know i just i understand
where they're coming from
like very much so and i don't think it
should be
as much of a fringe thing to talk to
those people or about those people or to
i don't know i just yeah i don't
disagree that at all i i try to engage
we're shutting down dialogue in some way
yeah no i mean i agree like
i mean this is i mean this is why i'm
talking to you right like i agree that
these types of conversations are good i
think that a lot of people on the left
are progressives have kind of lost the
ability to have these conversations
like we just kind of like or a lot of
progressives just kind of take their
positions for granted and they don't
know how to communicate with people
um i arguably i would say that's one of
the reasons why i stayed
um so uh socially conservative for so
long is because
somebody would say like destiny you use
a word you must be homophobic i'm not
homophobic the [ __ ] like no i'm not even
gonna listen to what you're gonna say
because i know i'm not homophobic right
so that kept me on the other side of the
fence for a long time because i do think
that people on the left have a really
[ __ ] hard time
engaging with people that think
differently from them and then like i
said like even today like
um reset era is like i think one of the
largest words on the internet where like
a bunch of progressives talk there's a
huge thread up right now about how like
[ __ ] horrible of a person i am
because i'm just a white person that
wants to say the n word all the time
like and it's like
[ __ ] dude if i don't meet your purity
test like you guys are so far gone like
you're never getting to like a jordan
peterson fan like you're
so far like out there like so i mean
like yeah i definitely i agree that
there are like big problems with with
messaging on the left in terms of like
feeling way too condescending or being
like way too haughty over some people
yeah i feel like there's a there's an
emotionality to it that doesn't allow
you to actually
converse with the other side because
you're already demonizing the other side
as not even a person anymore you know
yeah sure and that's a problem i
okay so like i don't agree with a lot of
the people that you hate on the right
but i can stomach their content and
sometimes enjoy their content because it
doesn't feel
like i'm being told exactly
what to think otherwise i'm a horrible
human being you know like
it just feels more about freedom and
while
it's very easy to dismantle a lot of the
arguments that actually matter i feel
like everyone
that i encounter on the left including
contra points which i think you like
is it's just too much for me it's too
much of like
that condescending like i have the moral
high ground here like
as a moral nihilist and it's in myself
like i just can't
i can't stomach that kind of content you
know and i wish there were more people
on the left
and it's crazy that you're on the left
now because i can actually talk to
someone who's kind of on the left
i don't know it just seems hard for me
to even
understand the other side because the
other side's screaming at me
yeah for sure yeah i understand i don't
disagree i'm never going to disagree
with that yeah people i mean i still get
it from a lot of people left that i'm
like yeah
so yeah i totally agree all right
well [ __ ] i think i talked too long
enough it was too long
i feel bad i'm sorry no it's not good if
you ever want to chat or whatever just
hit me up and let me know okay
okay thanks be careful bye
