destiny read the comments
i'm sorry guys workers are [ __ ]
stupid they are i don't know what you
want me to say
i don't know how anybody can disagree
with this
i don't know how anybody could work a
job
and come away thinking yeah my fellow
co-workers are so smart i wish they ran
the workplace
i don't know who could possibly [ __ ]
think this besides white college kids
that haven't worked jobs before i'm
being elitist i acknowledge that
[Music]
people in the comments start [ __ ]
are you saying that you sucked as a
worker i was an amazing worker
i was the best i challenge you even
rachel who will roast me over
everything you were talking about
groups of people based on
destiny took one chance to hack into the
workforce and he couldn't do it i had
three different jobs wait what does he
mean i couldn't do it
wait what because i've happened to be
streaming for the majority of my crew so
my opinion was valid up until
2014 i guess and then after that i've
been
manage these nuts on your chin oh wait
you can just hover the names now
that's an easy one that sounds like a
personal attack
two personal attacks that's a two year
ban
i feel i'm going to start challenging
this [ __ ] we're going to start making
you guys i'm getting really disgusted
with this [ __ ]
all all wages they're all laborers theft
[ __ ] it's a real [ __ ] dumb take
and i haven't seen like that cancer
like being like spread as often as it is
now and i'm starting to see people just
resort to it like verbatim like
like this idea that like a ceo shouldn't
make a thousand times
why why not what's the number what
should it be or what shouldn't it be
you don't understand they're making all
that money doing nothing because they're
just stealing
from the labor like the [ __ ] dude come
on you have to have a better non-fucking
[ __ ] argument than that come on dude
um
i don't know that
[ __ ] that [ __ ] in many countries the
richest people aren't allowed to make
more than 1 000 times
what one thousand times there's a lot of
money dude that means your lowest paid
worker makes twenty thousand a month
or twenty thousand a year then you can
make 20 million a year don't you mean
that number is a lot lower
are you never annoyed or irritated by
how smuggly comment your communities and
a lot of [ __ ] takes i cringe
every time i entered a baby yeah i guess
like i wouldn't care so much if i was
actually getting like real responses but
like dude so many of these [ __ ]
comedy responses are so [ __ ] cringy
holy [ __ ]
not to mention the franchise owners who
make hundreds of thousands if not
millions every year who the [ __ ] opens a
mcdonald's
who franchises a mcdonald's and makes
millions of dollars off of it
what the [ __ ]
like i feel like none of these i don't
know i got so triggered
and then also like these memes too dude
i feel like the jerk went way too far in
the other direction
this idea that like oh anybody could be
a supervisor or manager the real hard
work is doing the labor
that's the real hard work dude having a
good [ __ ] manager having a good
supervisor like
can make a huge [ __ ] difference and a
lot of work also the jobs that like
people in management
do are a lot different than the jobs
that the normal [ __ ] frontline
workers do
and the idea that any frontline worker
could just all of a sudden become a
manager is so [ __ ] stupid
political this doesn't address my
argument at all
do people learn better through doing
sure does that mean that you can make
any frontline employee a [ __ ]
supervisor and they'll just pick it up
and do it
no what's more a worker managed
enterprises are 40
more efficient than equivalent small
business or small enterprises on certain
point where they're
they're always more equitable too wait
then why aren't there more of these
then why aren't these popping up all the
[ __ ] time i don't understand
because it's harder to organize because
you need way more sources of small
amounts of capital i would assume
okay and that's where a capital owner
would come in and provide the capital to
make it easier to start a business
but it's not a co-op anymore well i mean
that's
i'm am i just am i just supposed to read
the book
okay okay okay thank you thank you
typically people do read books to
develop understanding if every single
time i'm presented with something it is
absolutely demonstrably [ __ ] and
then the fallback after i've shown how
it's [ __ ] as well okay okay okay i
know that everything i just said was
totally [ __ ] stupid but
trust me if you read this book there's
another explanation that actually makes
sense
i'm sorry if i'm like a little bit like
not keen to waste my time doing that
a lot of complex ideas take more than a
[ __ ] abstract or two-hour
conversation i understand
sure but if you say something and it's
demonstrably not
true over and over again and then you
retreat to okay well if you just read a
more complicated book it'll make sense
it's sound it smells like [ __ ] dog
do you not understand that um ceos
should make more than a thousand times
the frontline employee well why because
they're not worth that much or how do
you determine what they're worth
if they need a living wage what the [ __ ]
does that do that i just said
well because everybody is entitled to
the living wage okay but how does that
relate to anything to talk about
okay you're so dumb destiny you don't
even read a book okay you're trying to
understand really complicated things and
it's not just a two-hour talk you're
going to read a book
what the [ __ ] why didn't you just open
with that if you if you have no
arguments if you can't defend any of
your points if everything you say is
[ __ ] stupid just start with that next
time don't waste my [ __ ] time
just say hey destiny honestly this
[ __ ] economic theory is so [ __ ]
obscure
and so [ __ ] niche and esoteric that
you're never going to understand unless
you start reading just start with that
immediately
don't open don't barrage like a [ __ ] ton
of dumb [ __ ] [ __ ] stupid [ __ ]
answers
and then retreat to okay well just read
a book after you realize that everything
you've just said is [ __ ] stupid as
[ __ ] okay
we're we're getting to the capitalist
arc of my um
of my streaming career okay it's coming
up even more than
recently oh that looks like a oh that
looks like a personal attack to me oh
you know what they say
a good lefty
is a band lefty
to be fair explaining concepts is a
skill on its own it's why people second
teaching mathematics [ __ ] you know it's
true engagement loader translator is the
best
on twitter well sure but like when
everybody gives like dumb [ __ ]
answers it kind of makes me feel like
it's a [ __ ] waste of time i don't
give a [ __ ]
and the conversation just aren't
fruitful like when you say like a ceo
shouldn't make this much money okay well
okay chief what the [ __ ] is the answer
what do i do with that right if
everybody on twitter started saying that
a ceo shouldn't make so much money okay
wow what do we do with that what how do
we do how do we take that piece of
information
there's nothing positive that comes from
that like rhetorically nothing good
comes like literally nothing positive
comes from that
what if instead whatever instead people
spam [ __ ] like um
like we need to be pushing for negative
tax rates or we need to be pushing for
socialized health care
or oh okay well these are actually
policies that we can enact that will
demonstrably help people that will make
positive changes
in american society these are things
that are good negative tax rates seem to
be things that most economists support
um things like social healthcare
socialized cancer seems to be things
that most people support like these are
good policies to push towards
saying that a ceo makes a thousand times
much of a frontline employee especially
when that ceo is the leader of a company
with two million [ __ ] employees what
the [ __ ] am i supposed to do with that
piece of information other than get mad
like you haven't asked what policies the
guy would want implemented holy [ __ ]
you're trying to [ __ ]
i don't know who that guy is george
listen i understand that you're sucking
that dude's [ __ ] dick that you've got
[ __ ] 50 loads of this guy's [ __ ]
come boiling in your stomach but i have
like a five million [ __ ] dip [ __ ]
respond to me i'm sorry that i didn't
pick out like your one [ __ ] champion
lefty okay that just deposited his 72nd
load of the night into your [ __ ] ass
okay that i didn't respond to your one
guy that [ __ ] message me twitter i
didn't even see it okay i've got like
seven million [ __ ] [ __ ] lefties
that are all like spamming my [ __ ] with
dumb [ __ ] takes
okay chill holy [ __ ] destiny chat what
is a co-op
um traditionally traditionally in a
capitalist structure
you have a capitalist you've got
somebody that provides capital so maybe
like a business maybe like a restaurant
maybe like a grill maybe stuff like that
he provides something and then he brings
in other people to work for his business
since he owns a share of the business
the money that he makes comes from the
people
that work his capital right a co-op
means that
a group of people come together and then
they collectively cooperatively own
property instead of having a capitalist
come in and provide that capital for
them so cooperative's just a bunch of
people owning a business like employee
owned kind of
he's the only one who provided sources
the first sourcing link didn't have
anything to do with what the [ __ ] i was
talking about
and and and the second source was a
[ __ ] book okay i'm not gonna [ __ ]
read a book right now okay
and i don't even think he said anything
he didn't even like say anything he was
just like here's 17 links
you know not even neoclassical
economists make this claim right
unskilled work is really uncredentialed
work
and learning by doing occurs in all jobs
this isn't even a response to anything
i've said
i don't even know what the [ __ ] i'm
supposed to do with this learning by
doing i obviously i agree with this
what's more worker managed enterprise or
40 more efficient apparently there's
like capitalist structures that
are reinforced by our current system i
don't know how that's never been
explained to me if it is i'm probably
against it though because it sounds like
it would make for an uncompetitive
market
i'm generally against rent seeking
behavior but this is a [ __ ] link to a
book
okay i'm not reading this right now
sorry
here's another book
here's an article about [ __ ] jobs
which i don't know how this responds to
anything i've said but i probably agree
that there are [ __ ] jobs as well
this book being oh here's another book
and then here's another book
wait maybe this is just a paper
or book this is a book
here's another 655 page book
i don't care sorry get [ __ ] lefties
you guys are [ __ ] stupid as [ __ ] man
[ __ ] you guys are so dumb
you're so dumb i [ __ ] i don't even
believe you actually you know what
without even being educated
on the topic i'm gonna say no [ __ ] off
okay you should be able to explain
things
like i'm a reasonably intelligent person
if you can't make me understand it
and in several [ __ ] tweets like the
general idea and you've got to throw at
me like 10 [ __ ] books for me to even
begin to understand your argument you're
probably
full of [ __ ] okay
okay let me play one league game
i hate lefties i hate them all i hate
him god get him out of my [ __ ]
get him out of my audience get him out
where's
x kills me where's lol demar bring him
back
hey buddy saying lollips are done
without doing the due diligence reading
left series but cringy it's literally
like a high schooler saying lol i don't
need to learn calculus i'm never gonna
need it
okay but you realize oh my god it's been
so [ __ ] long
but i'm pretty sure that anything up
through like calc 3 you can like even if
like explaining like the actual [ __ ]
formulas or whatever might be difficult
like you can still explain like
mathematical concepts so that people
kind of understand right
like or we look at like derivation or
integration like even without
understanding how to do it you can get
like a rough explanation of how
your tweets are on fire
when whereas like when people say like
um like i can make you understand like a
rate of change or whatever
without you having to know how to do
anything having to do i could probably
make nathan understand a rate of change
without having to teach him how to
actually do calculus
but like when you can't explain anything
related to your [ __ ] lefty theory
without like barraging with 37 links to
different books
who do you hate more lefties or
right-wingers
well right now they're [ __ ] in my
community
there it is but now here comes the boss
destiny would literally rather have
hitler murdering jews in the streets
than kids advocating for wage reform
