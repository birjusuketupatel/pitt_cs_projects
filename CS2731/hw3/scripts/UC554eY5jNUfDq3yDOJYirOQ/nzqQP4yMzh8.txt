shut the [ __ ] up you're so [ __ ]
stupid why do people come in and do that
well actually 120 Fahrenheit is you
really it's not even really not bad if
you ever around me in real life and you
set your [ __ ] down and you turn away for
one second I read every single message
now you have to worry about like do you
just get up and leave or do you sit
through the rest of the class I like
guns it would be the same [ __ ]
arguments if you'd be using dividends a
sort of stock buybacks what the [ __ ]
what do I do if I'm trying not to get
fat but I really want ice cream listen
I'm trying so hard to lose weight now
and now that Molina's gone I can do it
you want to know it it makes it really
[ __ ] hard to lose weight you want the
honest the the brutal [ __ ] truth
having another person living with you
makes it really hard to control your
diet because when they eat they want you
to eat with them it's actually really
hard when I was in Europe I actually
like pretty explicitly like restricted
like my diet and [ __ ] I'm back to like
149 I was almost getting up like 155
again I think it was 154 before I loved
and I'm at about like 151 49 now this
month
we're losing four pounds boys I swear to
[ __ ] god I will be 145 by the end of
this [ __ ] month but like when you
have like something that lives with you
like hey I want to go get something to
eat it's like oh [ __ ] it okay y'all come
on get sunny - it's really hard to like
restrict how much you eat because every
time they eat you want to eat and then
if you ever snack whatever and then they
want to eat it's like okay [ __ ] yeah
like oh [ __ ] it's not good yeah I don't
know I think it's really hard I think
it's really hard to like control your
diet with another person unless you're
like 100 percent like on the same eating
schedule like some [ __ ] the ah man I
wonder if this is fake I'm actually more
likely to think that this is that this
guy actually faked this then twitch
actually did this because if twitch
actually did this this is real bad what
the [ __ ] this email I think he sent in a
thing asking why he didn't get paid and
why he was banned greetings we do not
pay out fraudulent revenue this is why
you have not been paid out do you not
notice how you have well over a thousand
subs but when you stream no one talks
then when you stream then when your
stream is offline you've heard this
reads like some [ __ ] that somebody does
type that
did somebody working on the support line
for twitch actually write this it like
this seems fake this [ __ ] is this
actually real whoever like if somebody
from twitch actually sent us that she
got fired and sued by the company Jesus
Christ dude apparently this woman's
entire [ __ ] family
I have invented this I don't know if
this is maybe exaggerated suppose this
woman's entire [ __ ] family got
murdered for accusing some Indian
politician of rape recent rape case
involving LM L MLA of une Eyal
I don't know how to pronounce this I set
in June 2007 a 17 year old minor girl in
the UH no district alleges rape by a BJP
MLA cold deep sangar for about a year
the girl's family complains the police
refused to even file an fi our family
goes to court persists with the case for
a long time April 3rd girl's father
badly beaten by MLAs Henchard's anis
stream is why I passed the Louisiana Bar
EMA police arrest father while ignoring
the girls complaint
girl attempts suicide outside the home
of u PCM yogi accusing him of protecting
the MLA girls father dies after police
torture police arrest four men accused
of assaulting the girl's father all
associates of the rapist MLA post mortem
report shows 14 injuries on girl's
father body in the you now case case
handed over to the CBI BJP lawmaker Col
deep sangar charged with minors rape
Allahabad GC ordered his arrest of the
MLA CBI files charge charges geet naming
mla as an accused a second charge keep
file three policemen and five other
people oh wait so this is Emily and his
brother three policemen have five other
people for allegedly framing the
anomeric survivors father the 18 of
August 20 18 a key witness to the
assault died suddenly
uncle alleges that you know siz poisoned
to death buried with no autopsy the
uncle of the victim was arrested in an
18 year old gun firing case
if I are what does f ir must be like
filing some case against the rape victim
her mother and uncle owing to
discrepancies in the date of birth of
the rape victim 28th of july 2019 a
victim is travelling in a car to visit
the uncle lodged in rey barely jail a
truck hits the car
the security officer of the girl is not
in the car the number plate of the truck
is smeared in black paint two of her
aunts died
the rape victim I think she's dead now
the lawyer is in critical condition the
police say the accident did not appear
like a case of conspiracy or intent to
murder so the father is beaten to death
the uncle's arrested the mother's dead
two ants are dead the witness is dead
the victim is in critical condition the
lawyers in critical condition the MLA is
safe under police security can you
explain why he is so [ __ ] it seems
like they're catching up but I don't
understand why India is so behind I
don't know anything about India I
thought I thought isn't the girl dead
yeah the woman who accused the Indian
politician of rape hit by truck after
father wait woman who keeps a
neighborhood rape hit by truck oh no so
she's not dead she's in critical
condition but yeah damn wait what
there's no way 50 people have contracted
Li contracted herpes after drinking Bell
defends Bell Delphine's bathwater do you
really think you can get hurt there's no
[ __ ] way that you could get [ __ ]
herpes Oh at bake rises from something
from being in the bath with somebody
that has herpes right do you think
pretty sure you have to make contact
with the sore right in order to do that
or contact with a part of the skin
that's currently shedding the virus have
you guys have our Benin showers where
there's gotta be like a plumber in here
can somebody tell me why like the
[ __ ] shower handle is this [ __ ] where
there's like this is the only acceptable
temperature and then like there's a ton
of like inertia behind moving the handle
so if you try to
move it a little bit you can't and you
push it a little bit more than and then
it like goes to the other [ __ ] thing
and you like die why why does this [ __ ]
happen it's so [ __ ] stupid nobody has
an air-conditioner in Germany but now
that it gets warmer warmer probably
ought to get them soon one thing that a
lot of people don't realize especially
in America I guess in a lot of in a lot
of warmer areas to close here to be
equated and more likely to live in a
place where everybody has a/c
however as temperatures are getting
warmer it sucks [ __ ] to live in an area
we are not used to it getting hot I
remember taking in a cola this a little
bit in Seattle apparently it's pretty
rare to have an air conditioner cuz it
just doesn't get that warm up there but
I think some of the temperatures last
summer we're getting into like the was
it like the high 80s in Seattle Seattle
high temp 2018 90 degrees imagine living
in an area that hot and you have no air
conditioner what is 80 so like up to
like what is this like 37 or some [ __ ] I
don't know ATF to see 27 I'm sorry that
is way too high 27 to 90 f2c 90 f is
alright without AC 32 degrees without
air conditioner [ __ ] that [ __ ]
30 see in Sweden right now yeah Molina
has been complaining yeah I've seen the
temperatures like highest [ __ ] it hit
116 and so call a couple times less
alright yeah that's cool though in
California we have a/c we're used to
having air conditioned right so it's
fine if it gets really hot but like
their plate I can't imagine living in a
place with no air conditioner where the
temperature is hitting like the like the
30s or in American units like the 90s
it's gotta be [ __ ] horrible
especially because I imagine in Europe
now you're gonna have to buy those [ __ ]
does your omaha's have a seat the
Midwest I don't know this is true not in
my experience the Midwest has the most
extreme temperatures in the world I
don't there's probably some place on
earth that has more extreme temperatures
I just haven't seen it yet but holy [ __ ]
the Midwest is crazy lowest temperature
all
aha 2018 no it's just dry the Midwest is
not dry absolutely not
time and date what the [ __ ] does oh one
/o one mean January first probably yeah
[ __ ] my breath wait this has to be like
with the wind chill there is no way that
the actual like temperature got this
[ __ ] low what was what was like the
actual why is it a new record low of
negative 26 Fahrenheit is this an maybe
this is in Celsius no wait maybe it's in
Celsius do you think no it says F this
is an Iowa this is in Nebraska 116 and
so cold isn't too bad even without a see
the average NP over 116 Fahrenheit is
[ __ ] hot shut the [ __ ] up you're so
[ __ ] stupid why do people come in and
do that well actually 120 Fahrenheit is
you really it's not even really not bad
for me shut the [ __ ] up dude it's hot as
[ __ ] what the [ __ ] are you you're so
dumb why the [ __ ] would you even say
that
like dude you're so [ __ ] cool like oh
my god you're so cool dude Wow 116 not
even a big deal for you man you're such
a brave powerful person dude god you're
so awesome [ __ ] off dude with morning
low air temperatures wind chill
temperatures range from negative ok this
was so at the start of 2018 in Nebraska
okay it was negative 15 to negative 26 F
okay and then in the summer it gets to
like over a hundred and it's humid as
[ __ ] the Midwest is the range of
temperatures is like insanely [ __ ]
brutal that's all I was trying to say I
don't know why we got into this too much
same in the Northeast who the Northeast
probably got some pretty extreme efforts
to I don't know how hot it gets in the
Northeast though does New York City
actually get over like 90 to 100 F like
yeah all across Europe there was a map I
saw a map like a week ago that was
showing the well was it this actually
they were showing the temperatures
across Europe although I think it was
hotter than this wasn't it it was hotter
than this way this is a map from like a
week ago
as Juliet is this July cuz the state
hasn't happened yet I don't know what
the [ __ ] - [ __ ] means how this is 2018
oh this is yeah I was never in Poland in
the summer but like holy [ __ ] I can't
imagine it being like in the high 30s I
don't know my daughter's easily turned
16 in for a couple months now it's been
constantly asking for a lock to be put
in her door she says it's to keep her
brother out who barges in her room every
now and then to bother her but I'm not
sure if the benefit would be worth
having a lock in place I don't like the
secrecy of her loose of her locking
herself in the room and I'm worried
she's trying to hide something from me
that you'll take the opportunity to lock
me out I admit that I've forgotten to
knock some time with what other than
that I see no reason as to why she'd
need a lock the way I see it it's my
house on Cilla I'm willing to have any
locks put in anywhere she's young
doesn't really know what she's asking
for this is this has to be a [ __ ] bay
post this is 100% got to be a [ __ ]
bay post it has like it has like all the
hallmarks like she has a little brother
that barges in i barge in my house my
rules
she's young and dumb it has like that's
literally every post on the till Derek's
ever and it's dumb when they think it's
a fun way you snoop through it or not
probably asking you to [ __ ]
everything I [ __ ] snoop every if you
ever around me in real life and you set
your [ __ ] down and you turn away for one
second I read every single message
instantly its instantaneously in my head
thanks for saving me from becoming an
epic red pilled gamer no problem dude
now I'm a wholefoods going vegan good
job take on cheap labor from places like
China
what if Nathan develops trust issues
listen here's what I'm gonna say okay
you shouldn't snoop okay I can snoop
because I'm an ascended warrior okay I'm
an ascended warrior I can snoop you know
why it's because when I snooped I'm just
interested in what's going on I'm
interested in the things that you lie to
me about and the things you not don't
lie to me about I'm interested in the
way to you present things to some people
no that was because I like that I like
having that information in my head okay
if you like to know [ __ ] and you reach
it like that [ __ ] it go for it I don't
mind if people snoop my [ __ ] if I'm in a
relationship especially now I always
sell it for hey do you want my [ __ ]
passwords read through my [ __ ] I don't
give a [ __ ] okay
the problem is snooping
is if you are prone to making up a ton
of dumb [ __ ] in your head or if you're
gonna start grilling the person on some
[ __ ] or if you're gonna sell like what
did you say then - then [ __ ] don't
[ __ ] sue shut the [ __ ] up keep your
[ __ ] eyes your own [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ]
off okay don't [ __ ] do that [ __ ]
nobody wants that [ __ ] alright
I'm William I'm dating somebody and they
want to read all my [ __ ] or whatever I
don't give a [ __ ] knock yourself out
but if you're gonna read my Shane be
like why did you say that to this person
why do you think [ __ ] get the [ __ ] out
of here you [ __ ] yank
that's my account now you don't reach it
anymore get the [ __ ] out of here
are you gonna be honest with him that
you'll snoop from time to time yeah I
probably tell him I don't think most
people I've been with mind me snooping
as much though because I don't usually
like I don't like judge like I don't
really care what I see I just really
interested me I never like I'll never
read something and like I'll never read
something and be like um why did you say
that about this thing why did you do
that right like I do that [ __ ] what's
the point of snooping in an open
relationship I don't know I just like to
know [ __ ] I like to read [ __ ] I just
think it's very interesting to see we
can't you never okay I've said this a
million times you don't really know what
exists in a person's mind right you
can't ever know you always have to
inductively reason it out so we have to
make probabilistic guesses based on
information we have the more information
you have the better you can understand
somebody so it's just it's very
interesting to me when I see the way
somebody talks to one person and then I
see how they talk to another person and
how they present the same story in
different ways it's very interesting to
me I like that I like knowing that [ __ ]
oh my god have you ever slept have you
ever fall asleep in class and then you
wake up and then there's a whole bunch
of new students around you and you
realize you slept through to the next
class and you're not supposed to be
there oh [ __ ] and now you have to worry
about like do you just get up and leave
or do you sit through the rest of the
class oh I have so many school horror
stories holy [ __ ] why would your teacher
not wake up at the end of class Oh cuz I
call you don't give a [ __ ] or my
teachers didn't give a [ __ ] I guess I
don't know I remember one time in I
remember one time I
what happened oh god I have so many
horror stories
I fell asleep what happened in high
school I had to get like I had to rely
on like really weird ways to get to
school because my dad had left to go
live with my mom so I was like 16 my dad
had left to go live with my mom I didn't
have a car yet and I lived like 30
minutes away from school so I had to
like hit up like my grandma had like
senior citizen friends I don't have to
hit them up for like rides to school
sometimes it was really weird sometimes
they were driving just got like [ __ ]
4 a.m. and I had to sit outside for like
2 or 3 hours until like the doors open
at 7:00 and then I could go in like
really weird dumb [ __ ] I remember there
was one day at school so I was always
tired at school he was just a probable
bunch of dumb reasons I was always tired
at school I remember one time I fell
asleep in class and then I woke up and
when I woke up I was like oh God like
I'm [ __ ] I slept through it the next
class here and I got up to walk out of
the class and I left and then I got to
the hallway and I'm like wait a second
and then I looked back in and I realized
that wait that's the class I'm supposed
to be it so I hope until I walk back and
I sat down Oh God and teachers looked at
me and I was like I don't know
yikes was IA good student in high school
[ __ ] no I was the guy have you ever
fallen asleep during one league stream
and woken up during the next I was a guy
who was in class five minutes early
every time because I was trying to do my
[ __ ] homework
weren't you a bully in high school I
mean I was a little kind of to some
people I shouldn't have been but I
wasn't like a huge ability I don't think
do you think we benefit from a later
start four days and less homework in
schools maybe you know the tactic of
covering the bottom few questions on the
worksheet with another paper what do you
mean like if a teacher's walking around
to see if you did your homework until
you like pull it out you kind of like
just hide it a little the ways you go to
not do homework oh dude I went through
so many I remember the dumbest [ __ ] I
ever did in school I've said this on
screen before so for some [ __ ] reason
I don't know why but I like I I think I
retain information pretty cool oh I know
why I'm sorry I have I developed like
the most important skill for school
because I played a lot of RPGs growing
up and that
reading it's like the one thing I could
do is I could read information very
quickly and then retain it and then like
regurgitate it in like my own way I
could do that really quickly and it was
just because I grew up playing RPGs this
is the only reason I like got as far as
I did in school I don't I'm so [ __ ]
lucky like that I didn't play like
sports games her racing games who some
[ __ ] because I would have [ __ ] myself
but the weight [ __ ] what were we just
gonna say oh you know the dumbest [ __ ] I
ever did in school so I always did like
I was in Honors English one and two and
then AP English three and then I did a
thing glitch four and then a
dual-enrollment English with my local
college or whatever when you get when
you hit AP English three the teacher
would do these really dumb things where
she would she would give us tests okay
so I wouldn't read anything
[ __ ] that [ __ ] okay the Odyssey the
Iliad Beowulf this [ __ ] is exciting in
movies it is the driest translated Greek
or Roman texts are so insanely [ __ ]
dry or Gilgamesh this old [ __ ] [ __ ] that
[ __ ] oh my god [ __ ] that [ __ ]
they're so boring
the honors English - [ __ ] was cool
because it was like do we read
Huckleberry Finn who was the guy that
called everyone a phony like that [ __ ]
we read those that [ __ ] and those shits
were like pretty cool but once we
started hitting like the classics like
the ancient classic texts yeah I catch
her in the Rye like that [ __ ] was cool
like that transition to the to the AP
[ __ ] oh my god it was so boring
Oh Frankenstein was okay that was a that
was an honors English - but Mary
Shelley's Frankenstein but once the once
it was once the AP English [ __ ] started
happening [ __ ] that oh my god it was so
[ __ ] boring
so forth so obviously for the first what
I do is you'd go to a website I don't
know if these still exist but it's
called sparknotes com well what the
teacher would do and I found this out up
to the first two tests so I did one test
I never read Fahrenheit 451 or 1984
never assigned to me in class and I
don't know never read him in school so
what I did was I read the sparknotes
right okay well this is the odyssey
we're doing chapters one through three
whatever
okay cool read the sparknotes that's
cool showed up took the first test
annihilated [ __ ] a nut I didn't know
was single
not even one and so obviously I realized
like oh okay I guess I [ __ ] up I must
have out in the wrong sparknotes and so
you know we got the next reading
assigned I went back I made sure this is
like the whoa this is like the [ __ ]
and then I went back and again
annihilated and then at the end of class
the teacher said hey a few of you have
gotten zeroes or like tens like 10% of
whatever unlike some of these [ __ ]
quizzes we shouldn't say [ __ ] on some
of these quizzes when I write these
quizzes it's not going to work if you
read the spark notes you actually need
to do the assigned reading and I'm like
oh okay
you're real cool so you know we did we
used three resources okay I will never
read this boring as [ __ ]
there was spark notes there was the
lesser known as little brother cliff
notes we bring that [ __ ] in and then
there was the spark notes extended
discussion okay so anytime I had reading
assigned to me I would read the spark
notes to get an overview then gonna read
the spark notes extended discussions to
see what they were talking about and
then we would go and we would read the
cliff notes and then those extended
comments - and I started passing those
quizzes I will never do that boring as
[ __ ] I'm pretty sure that by the end of
this [ __ ] class I had read more dumb
[ __ ] off of [ __ ] websites and if I
were just on the [ __ ] reading I
realized that - I was like 3/4 the way
and I was like I feel like I'm probably
doing more work than I need to this is
some dumb ass [ __ ] but then I tried to
open the [ __ ] book and I was like oh
[ __ ] oh god no and then Odysseus Claire
oh god oh no oh god oh man it's that
yeah it was the principle of the thing
you're not a pleb that dislikes
Shakespeare right my AP English for dual
enrollment final project was an
assignment - it was a supposed to be our
huge analysis of a Shakespeare play it
was like either a 25 or 30 page papers
the longest paper I've ever written in
my entire life and I wrote it over Romeo
and Juliet and I did not read the book
and I got an a on that paper
okay [ __ ] that [ __ ] mrs. Braman if
you're listening I'm so sorry I love you
I don't think that any of the teachers
like me know all I did was sleep in
class I was a horrible [ __ ] student
did you ever cheat on tests hell yeah we
had the [ __ ] the hand the side thing
like the [ __ ] like stretching oh yeah
oh yeah you had so much [ __ ] going on
and then you start to get to the more
like little like slips of paper whatever
that you would hide like either
underneath your underneath a watch or
you could kind of like write some things
a little bit in your hand like with
pencil led and you could kind of read it
but no one else really could unless they
did preparing cheat sheets would
oftentimes like help you remember the
material though like so if you actually
did like the time to make out a cheat
sheet you wouldn't need to and the in in
the AP chemistry course I don't know why
but we were allowed to use graphing
calculators for [ __ ] you'd store so much
information in that graphing calculator
because you could type [ __ ] into it
there was like a number but it was
there's like a notepad app or some [ __ ]
but yeah you'd start [ __ ] typing all
those [ __ ] chem chem formulas and
everything it that [ __ ] here we [ __ ]
ti-84 that was your best [ __ ] friend
on those tests holy [ __ ] yeah [ __ ] it
have I ever gotten caught cheating I
know I don't think I ever got caught
cheating thank God
do you still know the contents of those
old stories or did you forget most of it
I probably forgot most of it the Iliad
I don't even know what the [ __ ] was
about some people came to some [ __ ]
Beach to take over a town there was some
dude called Achilles who is like a
[ __ ] borderline God because his mom
dipped him in some dumbass these are the
Year Freddy's or some [ __ ] River and his
whole body was almost like invincible so
he was like the big dude the kicked ass
on the field there like a lot of like
little kind of gods that like fought
amongst the people but uh yeah
eventually he had a duel with Hector or
the sticks he had to do with Hector and
he kicked the dudes ass
he like put Danny put him on a cart he
like [ __ ] rolled him around the city
for like five days and then he got shot
in the ankle by some dude and died
I don't remember some dumb [ __ ] like
that Odysseus traveled all over the
place
did he go he went to like some succubus
Leon didn't lane he went to like the
underworld and I don't know I do this
[ __ ] is so boring [ __ ] that
did you read Oedipus Rex yeah that's a
really old one I don't remember that
either you see like travelling on the
road and somebody stabs on the eyes he's
like it's blind or some [ __ ] and I
remember that's so [ __ ] long you read
up my sermon I did read that one I like
that story of mice and man that was a
good one
well you identified as a gifted student
or something oh maybe I was in like a
ton of AP classes or honors classes but
I think it was just because I could read
pretty well what did you learn about at
European history I didn't do any of that
no a push for me no you ever do this
thing this is really weird I don't mean
to sound like an elitist by maybe oh
well you ever do this thing where you're
like in all honors classes but then you
have the classes that don't have the
honors class things like so I did a ton
of AP classes for a whole bunch of
[ __ ] math and science and [ __ ] but
for history I was smack dab in the
Normie [ __ ] class you ever walk into
one of those classes and see a whole
bunch of students and you're like who
the [ __ ] are these people I have never
been in a class of any of these people
my entire life you're like holy [ __ ]
this is like this is a de Norman class
like I can tell this is the Norman class
these people are holy [ __ ] you slept
through all that [ __ ] but that [ __ ]
that's how I felt when I got to college
that blew my [ __ ] mind
when I was a music major and I would go
into [ __ ] music theory classes and
people were doing there they were doing
their math homework outside of class and
it was some [ __ ] I did in my eighth
grade they're doing like quadratic
equations and I'm like holy [ __ ] what
the [ __ ] did woody public school kids do
for eight years what the [ __ ] is going
on here
that's my there's my elitist private
school take there you go my school
didn't offer ap do IB courses give you
college credit if you are taking AP
class you absolutely should if you have
the opportunity to take an AP class
[ __ ] do it oh my god it is so good to
get that college credit you will not you
don't understand right now how much
better your life will be if you can
[ __ ] knock out some fours and fives
on some AP tests it is so good holy [ __ ]
what math did you take in eighth grade
um the I think the book that we use I
always thought it was a joke I thought
that they just like righted on you to
make you feel smart but the book we use
something was just called college
algebra was like the book that we did
and so we did like a lot of algebra in
8th grade but I guess like getting to
[ __ ] in college I guess it's like
actually what they what they learn is
freshman's I know but I'm not sure I
think that like I think they start
fast-tracking you on math when you get
to like fourth or fifth grade at least
cuz I went to a private grade school as
well like I think they start
fast-tracking you on math as soon as you
hit because I started to notice like
even in fifth grade even in fifth grade
that you like start to show up in the
same math classes with a lot of students
even though they don't tell you even
though they don't tell you like oh this
is honors math I don't think I actually
say it but ap stands for Advanced
Placement IP is like international
Bachelor written or some [ __ ] I
don't know
Highsmith you took AP stats or calc lots
of calc stats was the one so you could
either take the dual enrollment calc
courses so like up to Cal PC and then I
think like diffic you or you could be
the GPA powder there were two people you
are the people that wanted to do the
math [ __ ] and then you had you had the
GPA patters and those are the guys who
took the AP stats course okay listen I
saw some of that homework AP stats
compared to the higher count it's a
[ __ ] joke okay if you take AP stats
at school you are a disgrace
get those valedictorian chasing [ __ ]
stat padding pieces of [ __ ] people that
take ap stats are the same people that
don't gank your lane and League even
though it's an easy kill because they're
afraid that they might die okay dope
stat padder's AP stats kids with the
original stat padder's
alright did you not have history Genet
and college um I probably would have but
like dude my college experience was so
[ __ ] I wish I had my notebook [ __ ] I
should have listened to my professor he
told me that I was never gonna make it
through college he said his schedule is
impossible and it was but it was like um
this is like what uh this is like what a
day would look like for me I I was my
college was [ __ ] don't do this is why I
tell you like if you can avoid working
in college don't work like or work
part-time or some [ __ ] don't don't work
full-time it's so [ __ ]
but like it would be like so I would
work until six to eight depending on
when the day shift [ __ ] showed up or
when we can catch up so like this is
pretty much like work and then sometimes
my first class would either be at 9:00
or 10:00 so I try to like sleep for like
an hour or two like in this time period
then I would have class from like 10:00
to like 10:30 or whatever and then I
would do I would try to do a quick lunch
and then I would try to catch like a
40-minute nap here then I would usually
have classes from like one two four or
one two five depending on like what
rehearsals or whatever I had set up oh
wait so this would be like class and
then I always had to be in to work at
either ten or eight if they called me an
early so then I would try to sleep in
this period before work this was [ __ ]
aids and then I did this for three years
no did it didn't work I mean like for
the first couple years I guess it was
okay but I started to get to the point
to where like like I failed I think
music history because I was just
sleeping through exams I just like I
would try to do my sleep here after work
and then I would end up missing because
I think music history was like 10 to
11:30 or like 10:45 to 11 or some [ __ ]
and I like missed this class I ended up
like missing tests and [ __ ] and I got
like [ __ ] hard in this class why even
go to class at that point did they take
attendance um I don't I think some of
them did the music history one did they
because he would do like a little mini
quiz every day they do get points for is
that why you quit or did you eventually
fix yourself well I had to prioritize
either work or school and I feel like I
was going to school for music at the
time and I was doing really well at the
casino so I feel like prioritizing music
over over like an actual like career at
the casino was a really bad idea so I
got [ __ ] I'll quit my good school
I'll work at the casino for a while and
then maybe once I've saved up more money
I can pursue like music again when I'm
like wealthier in the future what
happens when you got sick you don't get
sick what what do you mean gets sick you
can't miss work in America if you're
sick you just you you just you take some
[ __ ] ibuprofen or some [ __ ] or some
Tylenol and you're just going to work
and then go to school you can't miss
this you get [ __ ]
hahaha Jesus Christ what is this college
students when they get their first
salary where'd you go in for music um
cuz I really really really like music
what are these memes you're exaggerating
you definitely can miss a day um so for
me it was really hard for me to miss a
day because if I started missing like a
day or two of classes I don't have the
time to catch up that's the problem with
like missing a day is that you often
don't have like the free time to catch
up if you do it like if I started
missing homework it's really hard for me
to get the notes from somebody else or
even have time to do that and then to
study and like make up the work that I
missed and then for work missing days is
just really [ __ ] because like I was
the nightshift lead or supervisor
depending on when I was working in there
so like who nobody can fill in for me
right I think if I don't if I don't go
there like though like I don't even know
what would happen actually if I not show
up for work that night I don't even know
what would happen I don't know who they
could call in to do it how many hours
asleep you get on average I don't know I
try to sneak and sleep whenever I could
like if it was really slow at the casino
and I could like bust out like all the
[ __ ] side work by like 2:00 or 3:00
a.m. if I had like one employee I would
try to like sleep for like 2 or 3 hours
in the office and I just let them do
[ __ ] outside
was it a Native American casino nope how
was your health I have no idea how good
was the pay well I was working 60 hours
a week and my base salary my base pay
was like 15 an hour so I was getting
like what is like 20 to 50 an hour for
overtime which at the time was really
good when I was working at 15 an hour as
a supervisor the minimum wage was like
525 an hour it's like it was really good
pay for me considering I had like no
back runner whatever I'm like any other
type of work don't you think it's unfair
you had to do all that work I mean hey
you had suck [ __ ] of course yeah when I
worked at McDonald's I think my pay was
like 525 an hour and then even I got
raises up to like 565 an hour or some
[ __ ] we're just really against taking
out loans yeah I took out loans but like
taking out loans to cover like every
single part of your life and then to not
work on top of that as
hard can you I don't know can you can
you get that many loans maybe you could
but I don't know I didn't like enough to
pay for like all of your tuition all of
your books and everything and then also
enough to pay for like all of your cost
of living and everything for four years
I don't know maybe you could but that's
all damn that's a lot of money to take
out holy [ __ ] how often were you at your
apartment or whatever I'm not too often
but I said that's one of the reasons why
my relationship with my wife
deteriorated hardcore because I was
almost never home and when I was home I
was sleeping so I think she got pretty
resentful of that understandably so did
you have a crazy high libido back then
not really actually which is actually
really weird when I was in like high
school in college I kind of thought that
like I would be with my wife for the
rest of my life and I never really
thought about it much before I think I
wasn't until like my early 20s when no
no I started to something happen because
you're [ __ ] tired all the time hard
to [ __ ] when you're so busy
oh yeah maybe yeah I don't know being
like sleepy and [ __ ] all the time maybe
doesn't help why did you marry so early
in life it was the only way to qualify
for financial aid because otherwise you
have to go by your parents income so
even though I was like I've been
separated for my parents as I was like
16
they don't pay like my [ __ ] yeah
nevermind yeah but they didn't pay
anything for me but when I want to apply
for financial aid the FAFSA considers
you would dependent unless you're
literally like emancipated from your
parents is really [ __ ] say it you push
tell us oh no I just I there were like a
lot of people it seemed like I meant so
many people in college we're like I try
not to like the [ __ ] or complaint or
whatever but like when they'd ask you
should they know he's like oh yeah like
dude like I've been separated for my
parents for a long time to like the only
thing they pay for me is like my car
payment in my cellphone bill and it's
like okay
okay I don't know I got driving around
like my shitty [ __ ] thousand dollar
Dodge Neon that like [ __ ] falls apart
but yeah I mean anyway I mean it's a I
don't like to do the pity party thing
did you ever consider selling drugs yes
me and my wife were really close to it
we were going to we because we had a we
had a pretty a decent-sized closet in
our on the apartment that we had we were
gonna like line it with the foil and
everything and then buy like your huge
[ __ ] like 2000 watt bulb or whatever
we had a friend that we were gonna clone
the plants from somebody that Chris knew
yeah I got really close to pulling a
trigger on that but I think things
started to fall apart my wife and I
didn't have time to look into it as much
so I ended up not doing it yeah wasn't
your choice I remember you saying you
didn't want to live your parents I
probably would have been homeless before
living my parents i dude I love my
parents but I did I can't live with
those people the oh my god I just I
don't know how to I don't know how to
like make you understand what it's like
living with people that are so [ __ ]
high strung holy [ __ ]
I probably fall you're not speaking to
the ex-wife right no we talked about now
that I'm sure we're cool I'm on speaking
terms with almost everybody in my life
that's fine I don't think there are
people that are like so high-strung I'm
like this is the example that I always
give like somebody might ask like a
simple question like hey what do you
want to go eat and some be like oh let's
go to Buffalo Wild Wings and then
they're like okay finally
let's do it and I'm like okay you're
like you know that closes in 45 minutes
right and it's like yeah that's fine
it's like okay well if we don't leave
you know in two minutes like everything
is gonna be above a blonde it's like
okay wait well we can go somewhere else
if you want it's like okay well you
wanted to go to Buffalo Wild Wings like
I don't wanna make you switch and it's
like okay well then let's go to Buffalo
is okay but now it's closing in 40 it's
like wait why why the [ __ ] you guys
fighting over this pick another [ __ ]
restaurant what the [ __ ] is wrong with
you
like every like every [ __ ] decision
every [ __ ] plan every single thing
like would turn into a fight between in
that not like a fight like people were
so stressed all the time it's like dude
chill
go to [ __ ] IHOP it's 24/7 it's okay
calm down take a deep breath
holy [ __ ] that's just a Cuban thing I
mean my dad's not Cuban why aren't your
clothes - your siblings um I don't know
I'm just not a family person at all I
don't know I just was never close to my
family I guess I was just always off in
my own little world which one of your
parents was typically the antagonize er
um maybe my mom but I don't like to say
she was an antagonize it was never
intentional or like malicious they just
like it was just my mom is just like a
very very high-strung person I think
wage cut bucks
I have like five or six like brothers
and sisters scattered throughout like
different marriages and [ __ ] you keep in
contact with anybody siblings know all
of them picked up horrible financial
things for my parents I remember when I
visited my sister and her her husband
these guys are family of four I think
they make combined maybe 100k a year the
mom and dad both work full-time and they
bought a mansion of a house holy [ __ ] it
was huge and then I think they
foreclosed on that a few years ago cuz
they couldn't afford it everybody picked
up bad financial debt for my parents I
don't know why if you go and compare my
[ __ ] to all of my family members I look
like the poorest family member all right
like I have the smallest [ __ ] usually
the least cars um yeah that's pretty
insane you get bothered by family
members for money yeah I like I kind of
stopped doing it I guess I guess I feel
I don't really care I guess I really it
feels kind of bad but it's whatever it's
kind of irritating I guess like I
remember like my aunt like talked like a
lot of big [ __ ] because she was NYPD for
like 20 years and she would always brag
about like having all these rich friends
and she's like oh I've got this guy that
would pay me and she'd even use it like
make my mom feel bad sometimes like oh
I've got all these rich friends that
he'd lend me this money at the drop of a
hat blah blah blah blah blah but I think
I lent her like three grand or six grand
I don't even remember like three years
ago she hasn't paid me back whatever
dude I love my sister like $400 like
three years ago she never paid me back
feels bad man but hey it is what it is
it's your monthly rent I don't know I
think I said 20 and hundred a month but
I think it's actually Laura I think like
2,400 a month I'm not sure I don't
[ __ ] know it just gets taken out my
bank account every month how is your
tuition situation I what did I do
I think like five years ago I called in
and I said that I just gotten a ton of
money I think I owed like 30 or 40 grand
or something I don't remember the exact
numbers
but I called in and I said I'd gotten a
ton of money and that if they let me pay
it off all that I could like send them
like 15,000 to pay everything out and
then they I think we negotiated a little
bit and I said that like if I didn't pay
it off now I would like lose the money
because I'm bad with money and they let
me pay it off I think I would like 30
grand or some [ __ ] and student debt and
I paid like 15 and settled it all
somehow I'm good as [ __ ] amen brother
what was the rent for Omaha my mortgage
on the house that Rachel Nathan live and
I paid 1,300 a month that's not even a
studio in San Francisco now I guarantee
you that I could find a studio in San
Francisco for a twenty five hundred a
month [ __ ] show it's a lot of money
dude why do people like rent is really
bad in some parts of the country I don't
know why people try to make it sound
worse than it is like man if you want to
live in Seattle you were paying at least
five thousand dollars a month for our
studio probably the [ __ ] come on no
you're not you can find something for
cheaper that it's no really expensive
but oh sorry I thought you said 1500 Oh
fifteen or twenty five no twenty I think
my rent is like it's anywhere from 24 to
28 hundred a month or something it's
something like that
is LA extremely expensive or just to me
it's extremely expensive give a
two-bedroom no I have a it's a loft no
meme I pay 1,500 a month for my half
bedroom 100 square foot apartment in New
York it'll literally a closet I've been
looking for apartments to find something
cheaper no in a couple months when
Melina comes down I think we have like
12 days left that she can use this here
we're gonna look for apartments and in
the southwest south west of here near
like um near Beverly Hills it's 20
hundred not pretty good for what you got
I mean I think it's really expensive
it's twice as much as my mortgage on my
three-bedroom house in Nebraska I
understand was not directly comparable
but how do you not go crazy living two
people in that tiny apartment I don't
need a lot of space I just sit on my
computer all day I mean I don't really
give a [ __ ]
get off line TV about you deliver them I
don't know I've never like formally
asked I don't know if they would or
wouldn't but I would never I could never
live in a streamer house could you live
with messy people [ __ ] now all right I'm
ready for the psychopathy test success
is based on survival of fittest I am NOT
concerned about the losers I mean no I
want people to be
help everybody I find myself in the same
kind of trouble time after time hey yeah
we kind of do for me what's right is
whatever I can get away with hell yeah
boy I am often bored
um I guess but I try to do [ __ ] so I'm
not bored I don't know that's kind of a
weird thing today's world I feel
justified of doing anything I can to get
away with to succeed that's the way of
the world my dude if you're not doing
whatever you can and someone's gonna
[ __ ] you if I'm then able to pursue one
goal for a long time I think I generally
can yeah I mean I've been screaming for
10 years
I mean purpose in life is getting as
many goodies as I can't hate yeah boy I
don't find anything very far in advance
kind of depends making a lot of money as
my most important goal mm-hmm I was - it
would be playing league I quickly lose
interest and tasks so I start yeah
probably I let others worry about higher
values my main concern is with the
bottom line yeah kind of
always my problems to do the fact that
people don't understand me yeah but I
kind of understand they don't so I don't
know what I man what's the other thing
people who are stupid enough to get
ripped off usually deserve it come on
that's a mean way to think of things
before I do anything I carefully
consider the possible consequences yeah
we do looking out for myself as my top
priority hell yeah it is I've been in a
lot of shouting matches other people
that's my [ __ ] job and tell other
people what they want to hear so they
will do what I do and welcome to listen
man how could you do anything different
what else would you do to tell people
would they don't want to hear and then
get [ __ ] this is an obvious one this
is a give me
when I get frustrated I often let off
steam by blowing welcome back stateside
my dude
okay what does this mean like finding
that content for my enjoyment in your
enrichment like in boozing somebody I'm
not gonna like hit somebody to let off
steam I don't know I would be upset if
my success came at someone else's
expense
Plus man love is overrated amen I often
admire a really clever scam hell yeah if
I can you got that hustle I make a point
of try not to hurt others and pursue my
goals I mean I try not to
sorry I really do try not to I do I'm
gonna appeal to other people's feelings
okay maybe a little but we try not to
what neutral okay
I feel bad if my words or actions cause
someone else to feel emotional pain
I mean it depends on if they deserve it
or not right like do you enjoy it okay
sure I don't know you in her try and
grow her to sell something I wouldn't
lie about it well it depends what we're
selling sheeting it's not justified
because it is unfair to others that's
not it that's not why cheating is not
justified what the [ __ ] because people
could cheat against you and then you get
super [ __ ] right do we want to do we
need to change some of these answers the
answer is accurate and can they be used
for research sure which we only answer
Krim equestions for our research for
your results sure no I like guns
I gave I don't know this is a very
representative of the average gun owner
okay I like guns okay
I haven't killed anybody though I've
always taken a part machine user to see
how they work hell yeah I enjoy being
part of a loud crowd [ __ ] no I prefer a
variety to routine
hmm it really depends I have to stand on
a stone to reach tall kitchen shelves
how tall are we talking no I don't know
what this means like if I wanted to
reach like the top of my cabinets that
are like 7 feet tall yes I'll put a
neutral I am tall I don't think so
I decorate my things [ __ ] no I consider
draining the military yeah I want to do
these are real bad answers I feel like
this is gonna be used for nefarious
purposes I hit my head on low see how it
all is the average sociopath or
psychopath what the [ __ ] I give people
handmade gifts I actually do do this I
take lots of pictures of my activities
sometimes with certain people I will
I'll put a neutral I throw knives axes
or other sharp things oh I don't think
so I really like dancing [ __ ] no I jump
up and down in excitement I just like
it's doing that count
I uh I have kept a personal journal long
when I was like a teenager I drew out
new things hell yeah
I've studied how to win at gambling well
okay I think horoscopes are fun buck now
I've been very interested in historical
Wars I mean does it interested me I
actually go and read about it I wear a
blanket around the house [ __ ] is my
hoodie count um I know I know
neutral no I don't think so
I bake sweets just for myself [ __ ] no I
have I leave nice notes for people no
and then oh I left milena a little note
underneath her couch that said I love
you so that when I left like a day later
I was like hey look under your couch in
the nose the note does that count
so we'll say yes I have daydream about
saving someone from a burning building
probably at some point I think a natural
disaster be kind of exciting I mean yeah
would be I have set fuels aerosols or
other chemicals on fire just for fun
like playing just like playing with a
lighter count like everybody has done
this [ __ ] right I have burned things up
with a magnifying glass I tried to as a
kid but it was really hard to do he's
English in native language yes what is
your age thirty a gender male five foot
four 170 what is this 172 we use the
answers you've given for our research
sure
hi you have completed oh I think we're
good
your score for primary cycle but these
week I get is three point nine that's
like on a 10-point scale so we're below
half primary psychopathy is the
effective aspects of psychopathy a lack
of empathy for other people intolerance
or antisocial orientations hey listen
man
people deserve it yes score from
secondary think about this Cargill is a
three point four introduce the
anti-social a psychopath the rule
breaking and a lack of effort towards
socially rewarded behavior with two
scores is also a very suitable for being
plotted below the description how other
people are taking this test have scored
your score was higher than ninety one
hmm okay all right there's theis nobody
cares about nobody cares about meme
internet tests guys alright chill
psychopath ears how psychotic you are
right so high score on that test infers
how psychotic you are psychotic or
psychosis doesn't that mean you're
having like breaks with reality like if
you're somebody that experiences
psychosis doesn't doesn't that mean you
are perceiving events that don't
actually happen I thought that's what
psychotic means sociopathic and
psychopathic I think are kind of like
outdated terms know-it-all I think it
all falls under antisocial antisocial
personality disorder a SPD but it's
basically like how antisocial of a
person are you like there are certain
behaviors that you expect a normal
people to exhibit so things like
attention-seeking like or things like
making other people happy or being
perceived as being good in other
people's eyes or whatever Drive like a
lot of social interactions and then if
you're like very antisocial it's usually
a bad thing that shouldn't take an
autism test we did an autism test I
actually scored really high on that that
was pretty easy sociopath test I'm
pretty sure we can score whatever we
want on these like it's pretty obvious
like how they like it's pretty obvious
like how they go right are you
superficially charming and intelligent
well the yes is a sociopath answer the
Noah's not what is superficially
charming and intelligent mean I'm
actually a [ __ ] [ __ ] but I pretend
to not be a [ __ ] I guess yes do you
have delusions or other signs of
irrational thinking well I mean how
could you ever ant if I was if I was
delusional
I wouldn't think I was delusional if I
understand that I'm delusional that I'm
not very delusional am I like are you
overly nervous or anxious no are you
generally reliable depends on the thing
almost say no do you regularly tell lies
yeah do you feel remorse why would you
feel remorse its dumbest [ __ ] it's your
auntie sort of paper for no good reason
well no it's generally for a good reason
we're trying to get something do you
have poor judgment or feeling from
experience no we definitely learn you
pathologically egocentric and incapable
of love
sure do you experience emotions like
other people I guess not do you like
insight no you ever have to fake your
actions and responses to others all it
depends on how [ __ ] dumb the eye does
your partying behavior get out of hand
no do you make fake suicide notes no
it's just exciting a personal personal
personal maybe a little if you fail to
follow a life plan really capture a [ __ ]
am i a bot did I not click the thing
wait it doesn't scored for me
okay [ __ ] that okay
how hard is it the site good music like
this
it's pretty slow
[Music]
something like this would be pretty easy
I would think to say quite most like I
think like college-level players could
incite read something like this I would
say probably good college players
[Music]
well being considered hard high destiny
I lost my cane game [ __ ] you
odd rhythms I think honestly I think
that the original Mario theme I think
the original Mario theme depending on
your background I guess I'm like jazzy
stuff I think this would actually be
pretty hard to sight-read I think if you
had no familiarity with the source
material I think you I think you'd
stumble through those cold times we're
getting it maybe what does this look
like there cuz you got like triplets I'm
like dotted [ __ ] here right depending on
the time three Bom Bom Bom Bom I guess
that's not that bad
hmm maybe I don't know I'd be curious to
see like a really good piano player so I
read this without having any familiarity
with thesaurus but I'm not sure I don't
know but that stuff that we just
listened to it with a one before that
was pretty was super straightforward why
some music symbols pointed up versus
pointed down I've never understood that
because you typically you just don't
want to run it uh you don't want to run
out a space on your clef wow I don't
actually remember when it's when it when
it starts going up or down so like if
you write a G here usually the staff
will go up into where like the octave
would be like this is a G and this is a
G so I would go up to like halfway there
but if you did it all the way down here
would look really weird right let's see
C's go down bees are in the middle I
think bees go down is it must be a bee
that it switches right I don't know if
bees go up or down so like f like FG
would be like this C is definitely down
if I mastered I feel like a bee is down
it's gotta be right
bee goes down yeah okay he's like this F
is like this but yeah anyway yeah you
wouldn't you wouldn't want to write like
like you wouldn't want to write like
this a like going up here you would run
out of pages on paper pages on the paper
you rent a space in the power
you have a piano beside you can you show
I mean how am I supposed to show here
you write that down how does that help
you what okay no guy reads Super Mario
music
[Music]
I know athis is exactly correct but I
don't know if the sheet music he's
ridden he's reading slightly different
like that rhythm was incorrect right
unless he's reading something different
or I'm on our I'm misunderstanding right
it's just making mistakes well like it's
just it like something that is like
highly syncopated like this
Donna wait holy [ __ ] uneven I could
clevis so we'll just gonna no no no no
no no doing it like I've already this
we're no no no no no no no no no no no
no no no no I I think okay I can do it
because I've heard it this isn't a good
show I think that if I was to try to
sight-read a rhythm like that I think
would be really hard to do it to like
get everything like bah no no no no no
no no no no no no no no I think it'll be
really hard to sight-read something like
that I think it'd be very difficult
that was just my opinion this guy's a
really good panel here it seems like
he's having difficulty with it so
would you able to count out through them
yeah you could but like to sight-read
that would be pretty difficult let's see
like a really big background in jazz or
something maybe you'd be so used to
seeing all the syncopation I don't know
can you sight read the ghoul the ghosts
and goblins theme linked me the sheet
music I can try to like count it out but
I can't sight read it no okay so what is
the tempo like one two three two two
three wait that's too fast right wait
[Music]
[ __ ] it's real what is this song it's
not sea shanty - oh okay I don't know
what the [ __ ] this is there you go I did
the first three measures are you happy
oh I actually played sharps no actually
wait I played with so many guitar
players actually I can actually do like
sharp keys like easier now that I think
about it so but I but I still wanna be
able to sight read something like this
also double sharps one oh this is really
fast - holy [ __ ] like this one two three
four two two three four tempo 180
oh it's even get way faster one two
three four holy [ __ ] am I to understand
that you can't even read tempo
one two so doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
doo-doo-doo-doo-doo doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
maybe i don't know this sounds like oh
god I remember this [ __ ] ass [ __ ]
game this is like the hardest game in
the world growing up okay
can I just read this stock buyback thing
can we just get through this can you
guys stop distracting me
okay let's spread a little bit about
stock buybacks okay I read this thread
read a little bit of stuff around it and
this is where our new stock buyback
memes have come from okay
this is related to pharmaceuticals but a
lot of the principles generally hold
true very simple rule one so Row one has
post an explanation on why what you have
posted is a bad economics medication is
highly priced due to monopoly pricing by
pharma companies intellectual property
is used to justify incredibly costly R&D
for medicine so that in expectation
firms turn a profit given marginal cost
producing of drugs is probably near zero
the marginal cost of producing a pill is
trivial I suspect firms would not invest
if there is no IP to give them monopoly
pricing that's it that's why it's so
high the government can do things to
mitigate monopoly rents such as
negotiating prices on behalf of
consumers purchasing intellectual
property from pharma companies and
releasing it to the public to produce
etc share buybacks are not the cause but
there are good questions regarding
buybacks and dividends and the
investment if I should like stop and
explain something let me know I don't
know like what needs to be like
explained or not but I think we're okay
right okay are we good so far please
just skip this no cuz I want this to be
a foundation for our future discussions
because people are like bring up the
stock buyback [ __ ] a lot ALC brings it
up as well okay well stop next when
everything okay so the reason why
medication is priced high the reason why
it cost so much is because
pharmaceutical companies have a monopoly
on the patents that means that if you
invest money into research and
development to discover how to create a
drug you have the exclusive right to
create that drug and produce it for some
I think it's five years generally I
think for pharmaceuticals right so
intellectual property that means giving
you a patent on the drug that you make
that's just did the reason why we
justify that is because the researcher
development costs for medicine are so
high and a firm isn't going to invest in
the R&D for medicine if they're not
going to turn a profit so that's why
they need that they need that a patent
in order to do so because the cost of oh
is it 20 years I'm sorry 20 years my
five because the the cost of producing
like a pill is trivial compared to the
cost of all the Rd right given marginal
cost of pricing drugs is probably near
zero right so what that means is it like
if we were to say like like like this is
like the cost for R&D and like this is
the cost for like one pill so like the
marginal cost to produce like that one
next pill is like nothing compared to
like all the R&D that goes into it right
I don't that was the worst graph in the
world I don't know why I do that destiny
your argument doesn't take into account
of government at the national level
negotiated the drug crisis for its
citizens
that's why countries with national
nothing you say none of that has
anything to do with what we're talking
about you're getting way more
complicated than we need to okay destiny
not only that the demand for drugs is
highly inelastic meaning consumers need
to buy these drugs that has nothing to
do with what we're talking about right
now absolutely nothing to do that we're
talking about right now okay this is
very very very simple very simple stuff
okay chill okay
that's it that's why the cost is so high
the government can do things to mitigate
the monopoly rents so monopoly rents I
think that means that like companies try
to make a lot of money due to the fact
that they have a monopoly so the
government could do things to mitigate
how much money they make such as
negotiate negotiate inconsistently NHS
does or purchasing intellectual property
from pharma companies and releasing to
the public to produce etc
sure buybacks are not the cause with our
good questions regarding buybacks and
dividends an investment okay the law of
finance says that the price of a
security is equal to its expected
discounted cash flows when our cash
flows we usually say dividends but it
also includes buybacks or whatever
residuals you get when a company goes
bankrupt a firm that promises to take
money from equity shareholders and never
pay them back but of a stock price
approximately equal to zero so what this
is basically saying is that when you buy
a stock you buy that stock because it's
equal to probably your expected
discounters you like the money that the
company is going to make right or the
dividends that are paid out to you as a
result of owning that stock you wouldn't
buy a stock if you thought you were
never ever going to get paid back
anything from it right because you'd be
an equity share holder getting no money
from a company you would never invest in
that company right firms invest such
that the MB of a project equals the MC
of a project I think is this marginal
benefit and marginal cost rnd isn't
quite that costly though don't care dude
bug way too what doesn't matter this is
very simple okay firms invest such that
the marginal benefit of a project equals
the marginal wait that guy said this
marginal benefit equals you guy equals
the marginal cost of a project okay
firms invest optimally to maximize the
market value of their firm the
admittedly controversial queue theory
residual cash is returned to
shareholders shareholders either demand
this via voting or managers do this
because they feel they're expected to be
diligent stewards of shareholder capital
so what this means is that if there's a
project for a company to invest in and
the investment in that project the
marginal benefit is equal to at least
the marginal cost of the project
hopefully the benefit would exceed the
cost right that you would make that
investment and then the extra money that
you make is going to be returned to the
people that invest in your company
right destined to the song you put is
just one song it no it's playing this
playlist oh you think
chill just calm down chill everybody
calm down okay if firms invest cash with
a marginal cost is greater than the
marginal benefit then they're wasting
shareholder money that money could be
better used in other projects at other
firms and using cash for negative NPV
projects is wasteful behavior so that
means for instance let's say that I
raise a bunch of money and you pay me a
million dollars but I'm going to invest
I'm gonna invest that million dollars in
a machine that makes five hundred
thousand dollars well I've wasted all
your money no one's going to invest my
project they'll invest in something else
it's basically what this is saying this
is not how many politicians ranging from
Bernie Sanders and AOC to Marco Rubio
think of buybacks they see buybacks as
shareholder greed where shareholders
just want money and don't care about the
long-term they see buybacks as a way to
boost the price of stocks benefiting
shareholders at the expense of companies
wait this is an all holiday I don't care
there you go
first a short history
jaison's week published a simple
fascinating short article in The Wall
Street Journal about the history of
buybacks in short American politicians
in the public used to be extremely
skeptical of company's ability to be
good stewards of external capital share
buybacks were mandated in the late 1700s
on top of mandatory dividends
politicians were worried in contrast to
today that companies would simply
squander money this idea persisted into
the 19th century
that means the eighteen hundreds keeping
excess cash out of the hands of
companies was the goal only in the mid
20th century did this flip in the 50s
and 60s business professors and
politicians started to see vivax as bad
for companies and only for the profit of
shareholders today politicians see
buybacks is not in the public interest I
like this part because a lot of people
like what Sam cedar just did seem to
bring up this idea that like Oh buybacks
those always used to be illegal and it
was just Reagan that made them
commonplace now it's like well no it
hasn't always been like that so who's
right as as well demo demo demo durán
damodaran notes buybacks tend to come
from mature large companies consistent
with the idea that firms with few
investment opportunities buy back shares
buybacks should not impact market
valuation making concerns about
short-term increases in share price
ilusory on to a less ease point about
buybacks benefiting management is that
bad well buybacks raising stock prices
provides an incentive to not have CEOs
squander money remember this is the
historical skeptical American view of
the firm CEOs get more compensation when
they return excess cash to shareholders
thus helping resolve the agency problem
between managers and shareholders so
your agency problem here is let's say I
have a manager sorry I've got a manager
and I am and I'm a shareholder in a
company well what if he takes all of my
money gives himself a huge [ __ ]
salary and then [ __ ] leaves me high
and dry well [ __ ] that
guess what [ __ ] you're getting
paid in stock options so now you have to
make this company profitable you have to
make the stock price goes up because
that's what you're gonna get paid in
right so that's the idea of tying CEO
CEO pay to stock prices is to
incentivize is to resolve
this conflict of interest between an
owner and like like a manager I guess
right like a CEO and a shareholder so
banning or curtailing stock buybacks
would make it harder for capital to be
allocated efficiently in the market and
would provide opportunities for CEOs to
squander capital concerns regarding
lining shareholder pockets at the
public's expense is a historical anomaly
and largely misplaced ask yourself sure
Jeff Bezos who really squander pension
money by investing in pet projects or
should the retired firefighters and
teachers get their hard-earned pension
money returned to them so they can
invest in more productive projects this
is a little bit loaded but basically the
idea is like let's say I have a
retirement package and some of that
money is RIT is invested in Amazon right
well should if Amazon has the
opportunity to do a buyback and get me
more money back is that good or should
Amazon just be dumping a ton of money
into random [ __ ] projects because we
make it illegal to do stock buybacks
right how could one pharma company have
never ranked in bucket don't care okay
and then there are a couple people that
bring up responses in here we can read
I've noticed if he thinks it's France
blue that's whatever is it it is 100%
true that firms that return capital to
shareholders are not investing in their
firm the big important question is
whether or not the capital return to
shareholders could have been invested in
positive NPV projects or not simply
saying firms aren't investing isn't
useful the questions critics should ask
is do firms that return capital to
shareholders invest sub-optimally so in
pharma companies spend more on buybacks
than they do on research and development
as they do and as ases pointed out are
those private companies not investing in
positive NPV drugs how do you know there
are NPD drugs ready to invest him so
basically in this AAC video she's like
accusing pharma companies of just
wasting their money on buybacks but how
do you know that they have good projects
to invest in and they're just not
choosing to do so right these are two
really big things that I think have been
under discussed when people try to talk
about the cost of healthcare the first
is that any drug can fail at any point
in the development if it gets to phase
three and you sunk hundreds of millions
if not billions that may all go down the
drain and there isn't much living yet
that can be done to determine which
drugs will ultimately pass each phase
prior to the actual clinical trials this
is why Pharma stocks are pretty much a
coin flip around clinical trial
they make or break with little ability
to reliably predict which way it will go
the second is that if we remove those
patented centers I guarantee that
investments in new drugs will drop as
they shift to projects with better
expected value as of now the
approximately 50% of global new drugs
and new medical devices are developed in
the US and the US healthcare system is
funding that I'm not personally against
removing the extended patents but I'm
against doing so without a plan to
address what would almost certainly be a
decrease in R&D investments that would
lead to a decrease in medical technology
innovation somebody asks for a source
and the 50% of global new drugs are
developed in the u.s. so unfortunate
this is paywall this study breaks down
the country of origin of each drug out
of 252 new drugs over the timeframe that
they were able to they were able to
fully review 118 were from the US there
are some reasons to believe that the
proportion of drugs developed in the US
may have increased since the time frame
of the study mainly because the
proportion of new drugs developed by US
companies has gone up but that is not
nearly as comprehensive as the study was
in terms of actually showing where the
work was done for each drug for medical
devices I don't have anything to point
to that was just a statistic that my
biomedical engineering professor used in
lectures so I'm marginally trusted I
thought the criticism of the stock so
this is another common misconception
thing right I thought the criticism of
the stock buybacks by progressives were
in the context of the 2017 s tax cut
where a large portion of the money saved
from the tax cut was spent on stock
buybacks to the benefit of executives
and shareholders instead of employees
like the Republicans promised in that
context it makes for a fair criticism
tying the issue to drug prices seems
like an unnecessary conflation so the
problem here is that you would never
expect that to happen
that's just Republicans lying anybody
that says trickle-down as a lying piece
of [ __ ]
trickle-down is [ __ ] you like firms
aren't going to just pay people more
because they have more money that's just
not true we would never expect that to
happen yes Republicans lied but using
tax windfalls to return cash to
shareholders is still good as it frees
up excess cash to be allocated
everywhere cutting corporate taxes is
still good for long-run investment which
raises wages of employees Republicans of
course lied about the horizon of the
effect but I suspect they're mostly
correct as to the impact of these tax
cuts over time so maybe over like a
longer period of time we would expect to
see like like tax cuts maybe boost wages
maybe although I'm not I don't know if I
necessarily believe that I guess I'd
have to look into that but like any
short-term like huge infusion of
cassadee cash into a company isn't
generally just gonna be paid up to the
UH employees I think a couple companies
gave like bonuses in the last round of
Trump tax cuts but I'm pretty sure the
majority of the money was used towards
towards buying back stock I think that
came I'm pretty sure that that data was
released following hold on some people
in here brought up same similar
arguments that most economists think
that corporate tax is sucking you should
have higher wealth and income tax
instead actually is there an IgM poll in
that everything that I've ever read from
economists say that corporate corporate
tax is bad but that might not be I wish
I could find this I feel like I've heard
like corporate tax criticized so much by
economists that it's just a bad way to
tax money here's the article that the
Skylink tomorrow oh this guy Sykes still
responding these counted 3 hours old
holy [ __ ] destiny the economics of share
buybacks and that there may be a cure
but I feel the discussion of
pharmaceutical costs and losses in that
threat are at least 10 years out of date
I don't think that this guy I could be
wrong I think he's necessarily trying to
say like this is why pharmaceutical
pharmaceuticals are priced the way they
are the problem is that just that a
o'seas discussion here of pharmaceutical
costs is cringy it's like very very bad
econ it's just nothing that she's saying
economically makes sense
it's just cringy populist [ __ ] that
has no foundation in reality or economic
theory at all do you think it's
politically effective politically
effective at the cost of people
understanding like what's truly
happening doesn't seem like a good
exchange to me but she'll go ahead
warren said about buying back about
buybacks in the past no but like i don't
i don't know i try not to look too
closely i think that like my interests
align with a lot of progressive people
like Bernie Sanders are Warren just
because of like broad reasons but I try
not to listen too closely when they talk
about economics like when Bernie does I
cringe a little when we get into like
the protectionist should what did a OC
actually say again I'm sure okay so now
we can take our newfound knowledge and
then we can listen to what she's saying
about stock buybacks here right are you
familiar with stock buybacks I know what
they are
and what is a stock buyback it's when a
company decides to purchase shares of
its stock in order to drive up its stock
price so between those roughly ten years
four hundred and sixty five billion was
spent on research and development the
amount that pharmaceutical spent on that
same time to dry to buy their own stock
for the sole purpose of driving up the
price was five hundred and sixteen
billion dollars so they spent more than
their entire budget on research and
development on a tactic to drive up
their own stock price stock buybacks
used to be illegal in this country and
once they were made legal they were made
they were allowed and one of the things
is that when when a company buys their
own stock it drives up the price of
their stock and some has not talked
about is that CEO pay is tied to stock
price so CEOs right now are not
incentivized to invest in research and
development how does this all square
with the fact that pharmaceutical R&D is
funded by the public or should we keep
that part of the conversation or
separatist renders him the the
pharmaceutical R&D that private
companies do to bring a new drug to
market is not all funded by the public
not all pharmaceutical research and
releves funded by the public I don't
know where that idea comes from they're
incentivized to raise their stock price
so you know there's a lot of debate as
to what can be structured how whether we
can go single-payer whether we maintain
our insurance system the way that it is
how you make it more competitive whether
you don't cetera but I think one very
clear thing that we can see mr. chair is
that if we eliminated stock buybacks we
could reduce the cost outlays of
insurance company or pharmaceutical
companies by at least half when you
compare just research and development
and the stock buybacks alone and again I
just want to thank each and every single
one of you for sharing your stories
today because there's there is no reason
force for a drug as simple as insulin
which cost twenty one dollars in Canada
for a ten milliliter bottle to cost the
equivalent of a mortgage payment or
sometimes to mortgage payments and yeah
so like maybe maybe like insulin is too
expensive the spike buybacks and all
that should have absolutely nothing to
[ __ ] do with this right like so here
so this is the thing okay the fact that
stock buybacks are more than their
entire R&D budget is important no it has
nothing to do with anything if a company
is doing a stock buyback then the signal
there is that there's just not a good
project to invest in like that's that's
all that statement means like whether or
not you're spending more investing in
projects versus you're spending more
buying back your stock like
is her argument that instead of the
money spent on stock buybacks it should
go into R&D to reduce the drug price I
don't know I don't know what her
argument is I don't know if they just
think that the money should just be
thrown out on the streets or if the
money should just be given to the
homeless or if the money should just be
donated to charity I don't know what she
thinks the money should be spent I'm not
sure
Destinee stop being so disingenuous
I don't know why you dislike me this and
tell me to stop being disingenuous but
okay
I think she's insinuating it should be
spent on R&D no yeah but in this case
the firm hasn't identified a project
with a marginal benefit exceeds the
marginal cost that's the problem now you
might think maybe the corporation is
squandering its money or I shouldn't say
squandering its money maybe it's
allocating its capital in efficiently or
sub-optimally well hey there's it but
like bring that argument up right maybe
a OSC instead should get on Twitter so
like hey here are three or four new
drugs that you could be investing in why
are you just returning and hey and
actually every shareholder of that
company will love you for it like oh
[ __ ] hey you see you're right hey CEO
why you bein city dumbass don't just
[ __ ] buy back stock invest in these
projects make the company more
profitable but guess what like the funny
thing is that the way that she loads
these sentences is also like is really
stupid right so when she says that like
well hey there's it but like bring that
argument up right maybe a OSC instead
[ __ ] got on Twitter so like hey here are
three or four new drugs that you could
be investing in why are you just
returning and hey and actually every
shareholder of that company will love
you for it like oh [ __ ] hey you see
you're right hey CEO why you being City
dumbass don't just [ __ ] buy back
stock invest in these projects make the
company more profitable but guess what
like the funny thing is that the way
that she loads these sentences is also
like is really stupid right so when she
says that like buying back stocks is a
way to artificially increase the price
of the remaining shares okay investing
in more pharmaceutical R&D and bringing
drugs to market is also a way of
artificially increasing the price of
your stock I mean like if you invest in
more drugs get a successful drug to
market and sell it you also increase the
share price and understand like where is
the money coming from
for the buybacks are the buybacks being
constantly funded by insane profit from
overinflate so if that's what you think
then that's what you talked about right
destiny but wouldn't that be more
beneficial no no if there aren't good
projects well
hold on it would be if there were good
projects to invest money in but if there
are no good projects right now you don't
want a firm to just [ __ ] all of its
money into random R&D and [ __ ] all over
everybody that's invested in the company
your takes on rhetoric always seem
really shaky yeah I know but the problem
is that the problem is that like this
[ __ ] date nevermind you're right the
big problem is that some people in this
country are millionaires and it [ __ ]
everybody when you have a million
dollars it's like raping a four-year-old
in the ass every single [ __ ] day
that's exactly what it is every big
company should be paying $75 in our
minimum wage because Jeff Bezos has a
billion dollars and Arnold
Schwarzenegger [ __ ] is made and that's
what rich people do they rape people and
murder people and they kill the country
constantly and we need to lock all of
our borders up and keep all the money
inside the United States and we need to
keep all of everything here and then
like [ __ ] off dude my problem isn't with
rhetoric my problem is that a lot of the
times a ocz con takes are literal pants
on head [ __ ] stupid like she has no
[ __ ] idea what she's talking about it
a models the [ __ ] at a conversation if
you want to talk about problems with
pharmaceutical prices then give real
[ __ ] solutions maybe we buy the
patents
maybe publicly we buy the patents right
maybe a company invested ton of money in
R&D and then they make a new [ __ ]
drug that saves lives
cool maybe the government should
purchase that patent and then release it
and then everybody that's a good
solution if you want to do it right
maybe you decrease the the amount of
time that a patent lasts
I don't know there are other ways to do
it but to sit here and spew out your
[ __ ] [ __ ] econ takes because the only
[ __ ] oh [ __ ]
nevermind rap God okay let's play Kerbal
space program okay that's what I want to
do don't sit here try to justify
somebody like [ __ ] like verbally
diarrhea like [ __ ] [ __ ] things like
that don't make any [ __ ] sense
because you agree with the [ __ ]
conclusion it's stupid as [ __ ]
and it destroys any real conversation
that you can have you can outlaw stock
buybacks without any harm to companies
ability to give returns to shareholders
since buybacks can be used to manipulate
stock prices the onus is on you to show
why you an S it when you say manipulated
I never mind you said that a million
times yesterday and you couldn't respond
and you're still saying it again
everything is manipulating the stock
price what do you mean when you
new stock you are manipulating the stock
price when you invest in a profitable
venture and you increase the price are
coming you are manipulating the stock
price when you buy back some stock and
return capital Charles do you are
manipulating your stock price when you
make an announcement when you acquire
another company when you hire a new CEO
you are manipulating this that is the
most vacuous statement in the history of
all of mankind
manipulating the stock price literally
everything you do influences a stock
price here's a funny meme you never
probably heard of right let's see of a
company with a market cap of 500 million
dollars and you purchase some Sugar
Company for [ __ ] 20 million dollars
right maybe nobody really cares that
much about it maybe you buy the company
it's not that profitable but maybe the
hype around that purchase increases your
market cap by like 2% or 3% or whatever
right even though the company isn't
worth it you might actually increase the
total [ __ ] value of a company by more
than that little company was even worth
just because of the hype driven around
it oh wow look at you artificially
increased your stock price by purchasing
a smaller company like what like that
that statement doesn't mean anything why
artificially increasing your stock price
everything artificially everything
increases the stock price what do you
wear or decrease the stock price like
what do you mean destiny build a [ __ ]
bridge okay she did advocate for
government buying pharma patents okay
that's great that doesn't give her a
pass to say [ __ ] his [ __ ] about
economics now why the [ __ ] do you think
that's relevant but stock buybacks do
artificially alter your financial
statements for Iblees you're telling me
right don't tell me right now don't do
this to me she isn't making a single
coherent in well-informed point start
[ __ ] talking boogeyman like what the
[ __ ] do you think nice
I'll get on discord right now okay come
either sands of divesting and research
but hiking prices reasonably unregulated
in the pharmaceutical industry is you're
making a moral claim and an economic
claim I don't know she's trying to talk
about economics what what do you want
all right so a stock buyback does
artificially alter your financial
statements because when you reduce the
amount of outstanding shares that are
out there you inherently raise the EPS
for your for your stock right okay your
earnings per share okay so when you do
that versus when you give out a standard
dividend you are essentially
manipulating the EPS in a way that you
wouldn't traditionally do a few sugar
dividend right okay so there you go
you're what but what's artificial about
that because what do you mean when you
say artificial you're making when you
say artificial you make it's not like
they're playing some weird [ __ ] game
if I own it it's not a game if I own
some amount of your stock and you could
pay me either through issuing a dividend
or you can buy back some of your stock
and increase the value of my share is
either way at the same at the end of the
day you're returning capital to me who's
invested in your company equity is
completely different right well but that
has more to do with the tax code and the
way we tax dividends versus capital
gains than what the company's actually
doing that's a long view of it versus a
short view like when you do a stock
buyback you immediately influence the
EPS but your ROA is over a longer term
so like way to that last thing I want
time so like your EPS will will like
let's say you sell off you know twenty
thousand or you hold on one second
somebody donated a 512
okay wait all I'm saying is that those
numbers do not do not necessarily align
right your look your return on equity
versus what you're supposed ETS is your
earnings per share because the minute
you buy back the minute you do a stock
buyback you immediately impact your EPS
without actually returning those you
know that value to your shareholders now
like we everything prices their stock
increases wouldn't it not necessarily
not necessarily no that's another thing
that AOC got wrong
she says that by by buying back shares
you know you're there are they're
artificially propping up the value or
like somehow like increase in the value
but that's not accurate if okay if a
company has no those prices wouldn't
increase the company has 10,000 shares
of stock issued and it rebuy x' 5,000 of
those shares off the market right and I
was an owner of one of those shares that
I'm essentially being paid to sell my
stock back to a company right if I have
ten thousand if there are ten thousand
shares of a stock out there right and
the company buys back five thousands of
those right yeah everybody that owned
those five south thousand shares all of
those people that were shareholders are
essentially being paid cashed out for
their equity right yeah it's the same
thing it's almost the same thing as a
dividend kind of yeah except you're
completely selling your share right yep
so well no I mean I just don't
understand like what's wrong or
artificial about that I don't understand
that
like well it's just it it doesn't result
in a perfect alignment on your financial
statement right okay what are the
consequence of that what do you mean by
that well you just make your stock look
more attractive to someone who isn't in
the know necessarily right okay I don't
know anything about this but my guess is
that that's not true are you telling me
that a company can do like a big stock
buyback and then all of a sudden like
the whole market is tricked and and the
prices go crazy or what like this isn't
price no more
people can any1 can look and track a
buyback okay so then what do you mean by
it artificially like hypes your stock I
don't understand like like that seems
like something of them like these
financial statements are all public
stock buybacks are all public right all
this activity happens on the open market
so I don't see how this would like cause
like we're like what is the consequence
of this like my duderino I'm literally
ignoring everything you type you've
typed like dumb [ __ ] comment of your
dumb [ __ ] comment so I keep going oh
yeah okay so what Brett is saying like
you can make the same argument reverse
splits like where companies are like
increasing the amount of shares they
have available and [ __ ] - right would
you consider that to be like artificial
manipulation as well of like stock
prices or what like wait like a regular
stock split yeah I mean arguably this
it's the same thing I mean I don't
actually have an issue with this I'm
just saying it does result in like some
manipulation of the financial statement
like completely legitimate and they're
fine because ultimately like ultimately
when you say I just I have a huge
problem with that with those words when
you say like manipulation or you say
like artificial like I don't know whit
okay so because I'm really loaded yeah
so so I think something like organic
growth would be something like you come
out with a new drug you come out with
R&D okay and if you reflect that way in
the mark it like the stock that the
stock the value of the stock rises based
off of that huh or as I consider
artificial growth something like you
know you have a scheduled stock buyback
on X but I don't think I don't think
it's a stock buyback grows a company
like do you see like the market cap of
companies increasing when like a stock
buyback happens I mean you can see short
term investors like piling into
something and then that you know raises
the valuation and your p/e ratio I mean
even if that was true I still don't know
if I would agree that that's artificial
let's say that I have 10 firms that I
can invest in and I just saw that one
firm returned a whole bunch of capital
shareholders wouldn't it make sense that
people would want to invest in that firm
like yeah but it doesn't speak to the
overall health of that company does it
doesn't it if they're buying back stock
with profits from the company how does
that not speak to the overall health of
the company well because if they're not
using that cash for something else why
would you expect them I mean like that's
a whole different argument so if you
want to make the argument that there's
sub-optimally allocating capital you can
but like that's like that's a totally
separate argument right so like you're
basically say that you could say they're
making like an inefficient in like it
would be an investment in something and
they feel that you know their profits
are better utilized via stock buyback
right sure that's the idea in a perfect
world you're doing a stock buyback
because you don't have any good projects
to invest in right and I think that's a
perfectly fair argument sure so if I saw
a company was doing like big buybacks or
whatever and I see that they have that
that capital to return to people and
address to them I don't think that
choosing to invest in a company like
that is that's like an artificial thing
like I mean the prices are sad or the
market would would set that price
because people generally want to get
paid for their investments I think
that's a fair statement no yeah but but
you can't also just automatically assume
that the health of the company is tied
to the fact that they're doing a stock
buyback right no of course not I would
never assume that but I wouldn't assume
that a stock buyback is like a bad thing
either it's just a thing that companies
do like the idea that like if you're
doing a stock buyback it means that
you're wasting your money you're not
investing in new projects like if
anything I would expect the opposite
that there are no projects to invest in
otherwise I feel like the shareholders
would fire the CEO they really felt like
the CEO was [ __ ] them by doing a
buyback instead of investing in highly
profitable ventures I felt like they
would trash the CEO like that there's
that there's got to be something else
there right yeah I mean ultimately look
her argument was that she has issues
with stock buybacks because it you know
it raises stock prices in in a way that
she thinks is inappropriate or something
well her but she's comparing the cost in
stock buybacks to the to the cost of R&D
like she's pretending that like the
company could be researching and
developing all these new awesome drugs
but instead they're just giving it to
greedy capital owners right but like
ultimately she also doesn't understand
that you know the corporation has a
fiduciary duty to their share
sure and you know one of those is to
return profits to the shareholder that's
like a fundamental principle of contract
law I mean of corporate law I don't know
yeah
which is one of the reasons why CEOs get
paid in stocks now right or stock
options is because you want them to be
instead boys well that's the whole yeah
that's the whole like [ __ ] what's the
word I don't remember anymore the idea
that you need skin in the game basic
mm-hmm well because otherwise you don't
want um it's like moral hazard right is
that what it is where it's the idea that
essentially there's no risk type to what
they're doing because yeah you don't
want like a CEO to squander the [ __ ] out
of a company and still get like a huge
salary or bonuses and then just walk the
[ __ ] away and burn everything down and
[ __ ] the shareholder yeah the golden
parachute but they still have this yeah
I don't know all right buddy I love you
buddy
all right be careful wouldn't be better
for who she is and what she represents
to be arguing with the marginal benefits
the company get with stock buybacks are
not worth the disinvestment in R&D for
the public yeah but you're assuming that
there is deaths this is like the
fundamental problem I don't know I don't
want to do this a million more times
you're assuming that there are
profitable projects that the company can
be investing in but they're just not
doing it like okay we're doing car well
it's Kerbal we just shouldn't have done
a tax break if all they were going to do
was buy back stocks amen brother
I don't disagree with that okay
trickle-down is [ __ ] and when
Republicans want to cut the [ __ ] out of
all the [ __ ] taxes and expect that
money's gonna flow down to [ __ ] up poor
people that's some dumb ass [ __ ] nobody
disagrees with it well Republicans might
there are examples of companies using
buybacks to boost CEO pay despite
decreases in earnings why not just
outlaw it again and let them do
dividends okay then we would be having
the same [ __ ] discussion except
instead of aoc saying well last year
pharmaceutical companies spent 600
billion on stock buybacks instead of on
R&D she'd be saying well last year
pharmacy
companies tend to spend 600 billion on
dividends further than that rather than
pharmaceutical R&D they will be the same
[ __ ] arguments if you'd be using
dividends instead of stock buybacks
what the [ __ ] okay riperino cappuccino
cappuccino cappuccino my opportunity no
cappuccino cappuccino cappuccino be
careful hey listen you're being chill
I'm pretty chill but I understand I have
a ride at any point in time
