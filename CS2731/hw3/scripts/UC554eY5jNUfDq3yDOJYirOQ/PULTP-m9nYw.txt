oh yes there we are there's destiny okay
welcome i was just telling self a minute
ago so what we're gonna do
is uh two three minute intros um i'll
uh and then okay so we're gonna do two
three minute intros i'm gonna let
you guys bring up a topic we'll start
with her on the topics we'll start with
you on the intros
um and then after she brings up the
topic you guys discuss that then you
bring up a topic whatever you want
then you guys can discuss that and then
from there
uh you guys will probably lead the way
but i do have a few topics too
if it uh if they are required does that
sound good
go for it all right um so we'll start
with you
on the intros oh real quick so we were
talking about before you got here
uh nick fuentes just real quick this has
nothing to do with you guys discussion
uh but you did have a little thing with
him last night in sargon
apparently he was banned off twitch
people trying to blame you for that dude
no nick fuentes was banned off twitch oh
damn um
so i guess if you have any comments on
that or whatever
i have i have no idea why he got banned
i don't know okay
okay we i think we have an idea of why
oh i don't know are you friends with
twitch staff or huh
no i just i just have i have a feeling
that uh i have a feeling that uh that uh
twitch uh that twitter poll on uh train
wrecks is a
twitter account i think some people
aren't too happy about the results right
now and i think they might have
lashed out in a very emotionally
immature way
that actually makes a lot of sense
knowing how the entire infrastructure
around twitch
is is working and how many different
people are involved in banning channels
it totally makes sense that one person
saw a random poll on twitter
that got linked on the poll threads and
decided
what do you mean everybody massively
flags everything i i mean yeah
yeah i'm i'm sorry i mean you really
you do know you're talking to somebody
that you you know you're talking
somebody that's had multiple accounts
banned on twitter right like i don't
know i'm aware
okay yeah all right okay yeah so i mean
whether whether he got reported for
something
is one thing but getting actually banned
requires you to do something i don't
know if he's done something on his
channel or not that he got banned for i
have no idea
okay i just want to give you i just want
to give you a chance to respond to it
because
you know of course people are saying a
lot of [ __ ] sure yeah i don't know
i don't report people on on twitch
generally i might have for brittany
venti [ __ ] that [ __ ]
but otherwise no i don't usually report
people okay
all right um we're gonna do the intros
three minutes
uh let me go ahead and well hold on i'll
have to refresh it because i
accidentally started all right we'll
start with you three minutes
uh intro whatever you want to do with
your three minutes
uh and we'll start at uh destiny with
you right now
i just introduced myself or whatever
opening statement
opening statements i don't know we're
talking about hey i'm destiny i do
progressive politics
on uh twitch i would be considered
center right in europe i'd be considered
probably center left in
america socially i'm yeah progressive
i'm a big capitalist
um some people might call me a new
liberal people that get triggered at
saying that would call me a sock dem
um yeah that's all i got and then i do
video games sometimes
okay you did not use your full three
minutes all right
let me uh we'll give yourself three
minutes opening statement you can sing a
song as we were talking about earlier
you can
talk [ __ ] about destiny or you can just
do whatever you want with your three
minutes and it starts right now
uh i guess i um i guess i'm just
excited to talk to mr bonnell and uh
i do youtube videos and i guess i would
be considered anarcho-capitalist but i i
have problems with political
denominations i don't really know what
to say
all right that's good okay now we'll
we'll go back to you
uh soph uh you have the opportunity to
uh start the
the topics of discussion here this
evening uh
with whatever you want uh well i wanted
to talk about
destiny's views on uh child pornography
now you know he's stated that
he thinks child pornography being used
in a
uh therapeutical setting by obtaining
consent
from you know the the children depicted
i sort of wanted to talk about that
hypothetical
all right um fair enough destiny do you
have anything to say about that or
yeah i had a two-hour debate with a guy
called amos e where i defended the age
of consent because apparently nobody in
the skeptic community was able to do so
as part of that debate i almost asked me
if there was ever
possibly a good way that child porn
could exist and
i was made aware of some studies by
somebody that said that it's possible
as hypothetically as part of therapy it
might be possible to make people not
rape kids
by letting them use previously produced
child porn gathered with the consent of
the people that had already been made
from
um i don't know if this would actually
work there are probably better ways to
do it for instance like [ __ ] like
lolicon or making 3d child porn or
whatever the [ __ ]
would probably be better than using
actual child porn but that was the
answer that i gave at the time and
yeah as somebody who's generally in
favor of children not being raped it
seems like i guess if it works then it
works
well okay well but you also said in that
debate that
uh an argument could be made for
pedophilia if there is no
social stigma around it
um i don't
maybe in a totally different world i'm
not sure it's very hard to entertain
that type of world i mean you can make
arguments for
mutilating people that are alive in a
different type of world
well i'm well do you it's like what's
exactly your position on that statement
because it was unclear
why would i why would we discuss
possibly different worlds right now that
seems like a really weird
i mean we can so we can we can entertain
like different existences right now i
guess if you want we could talk about a
world where people
can't see or hear i mean i was just
mentioning that that's what you brought
up in the debate with
mosc yeah if you want to run through
that entire debate we can but i mean
like sniping out like one or two
comments from it
i mean what's the purpose try to make it
sound like i'm like pro pedophilia or
something i mean
you realize i spent that entire debate
arguing in favor of age of consent we
can revisit those arguments if you want
yeah well it was just strange because
you i don't you said something about not
wanting
children to get abused and you suggested
in that debate that
the only negative of that would be the
the stigma that the child would face
after not really that's one of like
several problems with an adult person
having sexual intercourse with a minor
person there's plenty of like
exploitative things that exist there one
of them is the stigma
that's carried with sexual contact that
somebody at an early age can't
understand
another thing is possible power dynamics
that cause one person to abuse another
who's not comfortable saying no
another is actual uh bodily harm that's
caused by a more experienced person
having sex with a younger person another
is potential stds potential pregnancy
there's like a myriad of issues
that all surround the problems with
older people having sex with younger
people
well yeah that's my position on that too
i just wanted to clarify
that um but with the
the child pornography thing there's a
few problems i have with that
hypothetical first of all um what
person would consent to having their
exploitation
distributed to pedophiles it's possible
that nobody would
yeah so then how would that
work exactly well it sounds like it
wouldn't if nobody would
yeah but you said that that was you know
i said that you would have to gather it
with their consent if you were to even
do this i don't even know if this would
work
but if you were to do it you'd have to
get their consent if you get nobody's
consent then you just wouldn't do it i
guess
to my understanding you defended that
hypothetical on several occasions but
no i don't defend the hypothetical on
several occasions it's just i have to
revisit the argument time and time again
because people like you will snipe like
one or two sentences out of a debate
where i defend age of consent to make it
sound like i'm pro-child porn which is
obviously a ridiculous position
like just the way that you're framing
this argument is hilariously stupid do
you honestly think i'm going to sit here
and say
well if you can't get it with their
consent you better just steal the child
porn that's made of somebody that's
already been abused
that's already probably traumatized from
their experience and that probably wants
to forget about it like every moment of
their life you really think that's the
argument that i'm gonna give
that's uh you're strawmanning me right
now i never said that
i know you didn't but you're heavily
implying it like well i'm curious what
did you think what did you think i was
going to say then
well i assume you would have said that
maybe you know some would consent to
that
well you but you just asked me if nobody
did then what would i say
what do you mean if nobody consented to
that then what would happen next
i guess the argument would end but you
can't
automatically assume that i'm implying
that you're like
you know endorsing the child porn
with no like just just i don't think
i've ever endorsed child porn i don't
know what you mean that's pretty low
exactly that
exactly i'm not implying that oh okay
well then yeah i mean that's my answer
if nobody would consent though then
obviously you wouldn't go any farther
okay all right
uh you guys got anything else on the
topic or should i kick it over to
destiny and let him uh
bring up his own intro topic let him
bring up his own i was just trying to
clarify his position on that
okay fair enough go ahead destiny i
thought
uh what do you have for topics
well i mean that was the set i mean i do
have a few times i didn't know i was
supposed to bring
i mean whatever we could talk about her
leaked blogs about like carrying
firearms to like kill muslims or some
[ __ ] i don't [ __ ] know
if that's that's the topic you want to
pick all right sure yeah do you want to
kill do you want to kill all muslims
oh no i don't actually can somebody like
the logs i just want to have the logs in
front of me so i can read exactly what
we said because a lot of people seem to
backtrack over what it is they've said
no i don't think you can read those on
the the i just want to i just need them
in front of my own eyes just so that i
know exactly what's being said and what
actually happened because there's a
million [ __ ] videos out there
everything i've ever said so now real
quick so are those logs uh
real or are those something that uh
somebody's made
oh yeah they're real i'm not gonna deny
that okay that's what i said okay so the
logs that i see are [ __ ] muslims [ __ ]
them all i wish an atomic bomb would
drop on the middle east already i
[ __ ] hate those blankety blanks with
all my might
[ __ ] pedophiles and child rapists i
wish there would be a hitler for muslims
gas them all
uh this will always be relevant doing
one of two of the following things will
satisfy my life destroying the pedophile
rings of
hollywood and killing a substantial
amount of the muslim pedophile
population
so now let me let me say that these
don't represent the views
of the proper door that was that was
quote not not uh not the
content of oh yeah so man so we got a
lot of
got a lot of hatred here for muslims
uh go ahead selfie you can uh respond
why am i supposed to like
defend my well okay well okay
i have a question for you then do you
think that
that was an idea i was expressing or is
that something i
endorse completely and seriously mean
why can't it be both what do you mean
why can't it both be an idea that you're
expressing and an idea that you
sincerely endorse
so so you do think that it's i sincerely
endorse that
i don't know it's hard to say i mean
reading this it sounds exactly like what
was in the manifest of the new zealand
shooter and he seemed to genuinely
believe it
you're actually trying to okay well wait
am i actually trying to work i actually
i read the manifesto i mean we can we
can talk about the similarities if you
want
okay but you're trying to
i'm okay it just seems like you're
trying to associate me with bren tarrant
and call me a shooter but i guess i
can't assume that
well i firstly i don't even know if you
could carry a gun like physically
firstly secondly
um i'm not saying that you're the same i
don't think you've actually killed any
muslims but the um
the ideology is very similar right [ __ ]
muslims we should kill all of them
etcetera etcetera right
you can only make that claim on the
basis that i meant everything i
said that is indeed true now is there is
the possibility that words have no
meaning and that you just type a whole
bunch of random letters and maybe these
are the ones that came out on your
keyboard
i fully admit that there is it's highly
improbable but that could be the thing
so would you like to take the position
then that you didn't mean any of what
you said here and it was all just a big
meme
um i would like to take the position
that it was a hyperbolic expression of
rage
rage against what rage against what i
saw
in the rotherham cases
and you felt the need to target all 1.8
billion muslims as a result of that did
they like all come together in support
of that or
i'm not targeting all 1.8 billion
muslims
okay that's strange because the second
line is [ __ ] them all
and the first line is [ __ ] muslim so it
kind of sounds like
you're targeting all of them but maybe
you were ineloquent here or
donald do you know what a hyperbole is i
do know what a hyperbole
is do you know what words are yes i do
i i actually do i'm using them right now
so so something like
i hate muslims might be like a hyperbole
something like [ __ ] muslims stop [ __ ]
them
all that's like a clarification i mean i
guess you could argue that everything is
hyperbole
um in which case i guess we could just
if you don't want to defend any of the
words i don't know um
no that's i'm i am defending them right
now i don't think there's not you're
backpedaling right now you're
backpedaling really hard
because you're telling me that i can't
attack you based on what you said here
because you don't stand by what you've
said it was just a meme or it was
hyperbole
it was hyperbole because i was really
angry i i i said
what i said because i wanted to express
my rage somehow
it's not a perfect articulation of
exactly what i think i mean to
to assume that i actually want to drop
an atomic bomb on the middle east is
kind of absurd well you didn't say you
wanted to drop an atomic bomb you said
you wished one would be dropped
but uh no i mean like you you expressed
rage against all muslims it wasn't just
the muslims in this particular case it
wasn't even just a rapist it was almost
because it was an exaggeration
okay i mean some people would call that
bigoted but i mean
you could say it's hyperbole i guess
well yeah that's the definition of the
word literally is when you expand hatred
to an entire group of people based on a
bad assumption
like all muslims are pedophiles or
rapists i mean that is the definition of
the word i know you're not a fan of
those but
uh we can we can we can skip all this
okay it's hyperbole sure thing so
what do you let's get to the meat of
what it is you expressed here yeah sure
so what are you trying to explain
what okay but
it's have you ever said anything just to
see how it feels or to
try to express an emotion that you
didn't actually mean because you were an
altered state of mind um yeah probably
i've said things like i would i think
like i'll kill all riven players or
something in league of legends
um but i mean like in the current
political climate at one i don't think
riven players are generally targeted for
genocide in league of legends even
though maybe they should be
and um i don't think that this is like a
big thing that's like sweeping the world
right now i'm not worried that if i
actually say something like this people
are going to start targeting riven
players
and i don't know if it's possible to be
targeted or to have like a targeted
hatred towards a riven player in the
same way it is based on somebody's like
religion or ethnicity
now let me ask you one thing and i'll
see this in the chat and i vaguely
remember this
i don't remember the exact quote but uh
zank
zank fappa by the way i'm going to read
the super chats here in a minute too
zankfappa says ask
destiny about bombing mexicans lol now i
do remember something about that
you saying something about that yeah i
mean it's another like one-liner that
gets like sniped out of a greater
conversation so i was having a
conversation with mr medicare and we
were talking about american foreign
intervention
and i made the case where i essentially
said something along the lines of like
we spent all of this time and money with
military intervention in the middle east
why don't we spend a little bit more
time like south of our border paying
attention to stuff going on down there
it seems like it would benefit our
country more
and somehow that got interpreted into we
should go and bomb or carpet bomb mexico
is the meme
i mean you can go and watch the debate
but yeah what can i bring up yeah
i didn't remember the exactly can i
bring up a point to that real quick
um what about your multiple statements
about
uh about political violence towards
people on the right
um my the statements that i've made is
that there are certain ideologies where
i believe it is probably
morally justifiable or most definitely
morally justifiable to take a physical
action against it
so for instance let's say that now now
real quick are you talking about
preemptive violence
are you talking about okay um so does
this
uh go towards your statements of uh
wishing to
uh excise all people on the right from
your country
um probably not that seems really
extreme and i don't think that all
people on the right would qualify for
this that seems like a
really broad brush um i might have said
that in hyperbole before
sure but again the difference being that
i don't think we're actually excising
people in the right
in america this isn't something that is
like actually happening whereas people
are
engaging in like targeted bigotry
against like muslims or other
denominations or whatever so for
instance i wouldn't make the same type
of comment against like gay people or
lgbt people
people or other people that have been
targeted for hate attacks on the rest of
the world
okay go ahead so if you're gonna say
something good you're sorry
you can you can say to kill all
conservatives and castrate them and you
wish they would be hanged just because
they're not targeted in the political
climate
because i'm pretty sure they are you
know like there's tons of articles about
how you know far-right extremism is on
the rise
uh in contrast to you know islamic
extremism
and so it's certainly targeting
right-leaning groups yeah so when i'm
talking about targeting i'm talking
about real problems it's not like an
article in wapo or the new york times
i'm talking about people actually being
shot up in mosques or
people that are actually being removed
or banned from entering countries or
people who's very existent sometimes
existence is threatened by certain
groups of like political parties i don't
think that this is happening to the
right
haven't like uh right-wing people being
banned from the uk
i think individual yeah individual
right-wing people
have been sure but i don't think not a
serious problem um
that's a really hard one for me to ask
or for me to answer
you're asking me to basically evaluate
the morality of another country's laws
um personally i don't think i think in
order to get banned from a country i
think you need to do something extreme i
don't know if just having like a bad set
of beliefs is necessarily
a good enough reason to ban some from a
country that's my personal belief i
don't think in america we normally do
that
um but i don't know if i could say like
well the uk should do their stuff like
this or australia should do their stuff
like this i don't know if i would make a
statement that strong
why not um because well because it's an
entire other country's like set of laws
i don't know if i can like prescribe
america's like views on freedom of
speech to every other country in the
world america tends to be
more in my opinion i i enjoy this i
think america is generally more
extremist when it comes to freedom of
speech
but i just feel uncomfortable saying
like every country should follow the way
that we do it
which i believe most of you guys would
too right you guys argue about
sovereignty and everything all the time
like
if you're from the uk and you want to
say like the uk should have more
freedoms people yeah then that's on you
but
i i feel it feels weird sit there and
make fun of it but i mean it's up to the
country i mean if they want to
yeah like like personally like if i was
if i was british i
probably wouldn't be in favor that i'd
have to see the particular people and
why they were banned from entering the
country
um but if i was the uk i'd probably be
like against that it's just it feels
weird as an american to say that other
country should change their laws i don't
know
i mean if i was there i would definitely
be against it and i'm going to sit here
and mock it i'm very
you know happy to be an american and the
freedom of speech is pretty
pretty aces i have to say but yeah i
mean if a country wants to shut all that
[ __ ] down i mean
sure are you in favor of brexit son uh
yes
okay so then you probably would also
feel uncomfortable telling another
country how to run their country right
that you'd be infringing on their
sovereignty
um well i would i would be fine with it
if every single person in the uk agreed
that freedom of speech should be limited
yeah cool so we have the okay cool then
we're on the same page yeah i mean if
that's how they right if that's how that
country runs their laws and it's a
democratically elected body of people
then it seems like most of the people
probably so you can sit here
at least in my opinion and i won't go on
too long because it's supposed to be you
guys but you can sit here
and say you know look at another country
what's going on there and say you think
that's wrong
and i don't think they should be doing
that while still saying they have the
right to do that if they want right
yeah well yeah again it's just it feels
weird to say like so it's a democratic
country they can do their own elections
and they can figure out how they want
um and i don't think they're violating
like a core moral principle of mine so
for instance if another country were to
say
we're going to make it illegal for um
you know for
for men and women to go to the same
restaurants or something right i'd be
like okay well hold on this is kind of
[ __ ] up like morally like at a
fundamental level
i'm really opposed to that but if
another country wants to change the way
they handle say like um
hate speech or political violence or
something like that well on these things
i mean
that's up to the country it's like if
it's a democratically elected country
and that's what the people want and
that's who they elect i mean that's kind
of up to them you know
all right let me read these uh rugel
mcmigdal says so if you're a good kid
don't worry about things
hicks and hammer says play nice destiny
ronson says don't know guys
i think soph is a very bad faith actor
quote
uh john smith says good job the timer
was a great idea
that really worked out really worked out
[ __ ] perfectly didn't it
eric harrison says destiny is a pedo
rake
uh god's plan says ask destiny why he
cares about responsible intelligence
science when he sees no responsibility
to continue the human race if they don't
feel like it
i'm sure so our responsibility to
continue the human race implies that you
are
somehow burdening your current existence
in order to be concerned with the
hypothetical future existence of people
that seems like a very hard
philosophical argument to make um
however scientific advancements benefit
the people that are alive today
so for instance like benefit
advancements in technology today benefit
me
today i get better cell phones better
computers better cars those are things
that are good now
um forcing me to change the way that i
live my life in order to advance
the human race to possibly help some
future unborn citizen
that's a that seems like a really hard
position to defend i'd be surprised if
somebody could do it
all right eric harrison says destiny put
the meth coke slash adderall down and
quit raping kids that was a little
spicy there nick three one nine one nick
three three one nine one zero says big
ups liquid richard shout out sean
ranklin
tsg says goodness so goodness soph looks
like your live stream with vintie to
prep for this debate really paid off lol
lol
armchair warrior says destiny stops side
tacking he always changes dodges
the topic if you ever think i change or
dodge anything or if i'm not answering a
question directly you can
i give anyone in here permission to stop
me immediately i will always answer any
question directly asked to the best of
my ability every single time i swear to
god if i ever
if i've ever not just stopped me i'll
read a few more and then we'll get back
hicks and hammer says ralphie wuss
moderate
armchair warrior says she said muslim
pedos yet destiny just goes off on
something hicks and hammer gay five
didn't say anything
willa aka bloody legend says tiny has
fapped to shadman's drawings of self
the packard goose gave a dollar didn't
say anything propane daddy says not a
fan of destiny but he is winning right
now will
says i'm coming from jlp and would
recommend that you both drop your anger
and forgive those who have wronged you
deal with unjust
deal with injustice with discernment not
anger or hatred life will improve
so much okay amazing amazing
all right so we do have a few topics
we'll start with uh online censorship uh
i guess that does
of course a big thing going i'm speaking
of nick fuentes he was kicked off twitch
uh there is a strain of thought on the
left and
i'll ask if you subscribe to a destiny
and you guys can go back and forth after
that
uh that you know shows like this one
although
i'd say we're mostly light-hearted on
this show but uh
uh you know right-wing people the
quote-unquote uh you know
members of the alt-right uh anti-trans
uh voices they should be taken off
platforms like twitch they should be
taking off platforms like youtube like
twitter
uh and shouldn't be allowed uh the
privilege
uh to speak to the populace through the
the medium of the internet uh what what
are your thoughts on that destiny and
and you guys can go back and forth
afterwards um do you want to leave so
for do you want me to lead
uh you can lead so generally my stance
on d platforming is as follows i don't
care
um what kind of hate speech whatever
people do but i do recognize that hate
speech can
lead to demonstrable harm to people um
the only people that i'm interested in
deplatforming are generally bad faith
actors
so for instance somebody like nicholas
fuentes i would generally be in favor of
d
platforming because he hides his power
level constantly um so
he is very clearly like i don't know if
he would be full alt-right i think he is
like very clearly like a white
nationalist very clearly subscribes to
evidence do you have to back up such a
claim with such gravity
um yeah here so i'll send you my tweet
recently
and then ralph i will send you a tweet
and if you want we can play through
these on stream
so here are three videos i've collected
of uh nicholas fuentes and this was like
two minutes of searching
um and the first one he engages in
history revisionism where he says it's
impossible that as many jews were killed
as they could have been in the ovens
and the second link he dog whistles
about race realism where he talks about
how black people are like pit bulls
and you know they commit most of the
crime and then the third question he's
caught off camera
um talking [ __ ] about how like [ __ ]
black people is the same as [ __ ] dogs
they're both like degenerate activities
um and this was in a response to a tweet
that he made where he said he's not a
white nationalist
can you uh can you post it into the show
links it's um
okay oh yeah
actually i'll go ahead and give you
where you can post in there too if you
have anything else you want to pull up
let me
you should you should be able to post
there now
yeah she already she already has it okay
uh so
should we play these or i don't care if
you want i don't really care i mean i
it's i mean i already know it's true
okay
if you want to play you can though i
mean they're all pretty short if you
want to or you can like times
whatever so they're tom stamped already
then right um i don't think they're
timestamps or well but they're like two
minute clips yeah
okay all right uh so there's the links
i'll go ahead and play it you guys can
play along i'll start with the
holocaust denial i suppose all right why
not
oh goody that's an appropriate offensive
to some audiences
use your throwaway account
damn it susan i click that i understand
and wish to proceed and does nothing
so uh but they know you're
below 18 maybe that's why they're not
letting you watch it the age on my
account should be appropriate
okay i'm not sure uh it pops up for us
so if you just want to
uh mute and listen uh off off the stream
okay i mean off the you know our stream
okay i'll go ahead and play it
uh i guess we're looking at some nick
fuentes
past comments and and i mean it's kind
of getting into where well we're talking
about him
you know if he wants to pop on too
that's i don't know it's getting there
but
okay let's but it was the topic you
asked how he could make these
accusations this is what he's
making the white nationalist accusation
based off of we'll play this right now
oh [ __ ] and that's not max says if i
take
one hour to time cookies and cookie
monster has 15 ovens
working 24 hours a day every day for
five years
how long does it take cookie monster to
make six million batches of cookies
i don't know that's a good question
certainly uh
oh no no it doesn't really sound correct
to me wait a second
it takes one hour to cook a batch of
cookies and you have 15 ovens
probably four different kitchens right
doing 24 hours a day every day for five
years how long would it take
you to make six million certainly
wouldn't be five years right uh the math
doesn't seem to add up there
the math doesn't quite seem to add up
here i don't think you'd result
in six million maybe two hundred to
three hundred thousand cookies
and i think the red cookie association
said something like that probably 200 to
300 000 cookies baked
probably and in addition you know in
this hypothetical i imagine that if you
took aerial photographs over the
kitchens
you would need to see certain smoke
stacks to release
the smoke from baking the cookies and
the smoke stacks would project certain
shadows
but i guess they're not visible in the
aerial photographs taking over the
kitchens
moreover if you look at the soil texture
it's really not deep enough for mass
cookie storage
underground um and so there's a lot of
things you know in the cookie kitchen
they say that the ovens
are wooden and they have windows on them
and they're not totally secure
and the ovens that they use they they
actually did sort of an
ad hoc use of that particular kind of
oven
even though they made a perfectly good
design for ovens for a different purpose
for de-lousing
i mean you know for something else so
none of it really adds up i don't know
it just kind of doesn't really make
sense this this crazy cookie analogy
uh you have to really you have to be
that's sort of an esoteric
uh story that's from cookie right you
wouldn't understand that if you're just
sort of passing through if you're just a
normie
so six million cookies i don't buy it
that's all irony i'm an irony bro that's
all irony uh you know i love and respect
everyone everything that the government
says is true
all right there goes the first clip uh
deep down
so then if you're not right if you're
not familiar if you couldn't catch on
like it's obviously a dog whistle fur
um one of one common form of history
revisionism is that people try to say
like well look if we do the math it's
not even possible that so many people
were killed
in the concentration camps like just do
the math it doesn't make sense bro it's
a really common thing
yeah so i mean there's always a
possibility that's a joke
that's a joke have you clarified with
him that that's actually what he
believes so in order to figure out what
any person is truly thinking we have to
engage in a process of inductive
reasoning we can't truly know right we
have to make a guess based on the amount
of evidence available so if you ask him
directly he's always going to say no of
course
however based on the totality of his
body of work he's made enough dog
whistles
that it's pretty obvious what's going on
here um is that fair for him because i
could do the same to you
and say that oh you're you're a
pedophile or something
no you really couldn't if you wanted to
do the same to me you would have to
intentionally misrepresent what i'm
saying by taking like one or two clips
out of context in order to do it
again the very issue that we started
this debate i think there's more than
one or two clips
no you'll never maybe i mean you can
make a lot of clips but you're never
gonna find a conversation with me
defending pedophilia
like i'm pretty big on like age of
consent and consent related things
that's why my two-hour debate with amoc
was me speaking in the affirmative for
the age of consent and every
conversation i've had about it has
reinforced that
you would have to be a dishonest actor
in order to actually come away thinking
i'm pro-pedophilia or anything related
to that
well you're using you know short clips
to
make your case for nick i mean this clip
here is like the totality of this little
analogy and this is part of a larger
body of work where he has
like continued to denigrate like you
know things related to the jewish
question or the jewish can i see that
larger body of work
the thing is i don't think i could ever
link you enough clips to convince
somebody like you
i see well so like for instance during
our chat yesterday multiple times he
made references to the idea that white
people are going to be bred out of
existence
it's also a very common alt-right
talking point um he would also
relentlessly talk about people in
hollywood or people that control
hollywood like goldman sachs which is
also a very common alt-right dog whistle
to jews controlling society
um he also referenced uh people's
strange allegiance to israel
which is also another dog whistle so
like i can't i mean truly i can't know
it's possible that maybe at the end of
the day
all of these things are jokes um but if
i were to go with like any sort of like
bayesian
analysis and try to figure out like what
is the probability that he's probably
anti-semitic versus these are all just
memes
i would probably fall on the side of him
actually being anti-semitic now real
quick destiny i watched that debate and
i don't believe i've
ever heard the words go goldman sachs
uttered
within that debate if if it wasn't gold
it wasn't wet are you sure that he said
goldman sachs or did
he say film executives no it was either
go
if he didn't say go i'm pretty sure it
was goldman sachs or was another big i'm
almost 99 positive with goldman sachs
somebody can if somebody in my twitch
chat wants to they can try to find the
clip but i'm like 99
positive it was goldman sachs so i
i just want to point out that all the
things you mentioned don't necessarily
make him a nazi they might
they might make him affiliated with the
alt-right but it's not fair to do
platform him on suspicions
oh no no id platform considering he's a
bad faith actor because he'll can he'll
constantly dog whistle these views
and then he'll like lie about it later
or he'll misrepresent it later or he'll
say he doesn't care about it later
whatever
i i don't think you can make assumptions
like that i mean then
truly you can't make any assumptions
about any person right you realize that
right
yeah but you when you make those
assumptions you use them to
take him off the platform and that's not
fair to him well i don't use the
assumptions to take him off the platform
the only reason why i don't like people
like that platform is because i think
bad faith actors don't contribute
positively to public discourse for
instance somebody like richard spencer i
hate using him as an example because i
don't know
sorry go ahead you can respond so
anybody who doesn't like make a great
contribution to
public discourse doesn't uh deserve a
right to their
speech no i don't care about well
firstly i'm talking about like major
political figures or larger figures not
necessarily like a random person on
twitter
but secondly no i don't care if you make
like a bad or a good contribution that's
a lot more vague
um so like for instance if you're
anti-semitic if you hate jews or
whatever and you want to talk about that
[ __ ] on twitter i'm fine with that knock
yourself out if you're a kkk dude
whatever i don't give a [ __ ]
it's when you start engaging in
misinformation or when you intentionally
obscure your positions or when you
engage in like you know like lying or
deceit or bad data or whatever that's
the thing that bothers me because i
think all it does is it muddles the
conversation
it doesn't help anybody or further any
dialogue or discourse well what's the
problem with it
hanging around if everybody knows it's
you know false anyways
because not everybody knows and not
everybody knows it's false anyways a lot
of people are kind of like deceived by
that type of stuff it's very effective
it's why people like him do it
i still don't think that's enough to
take him off the platform i think people
still reserve their right to free speech
and it's the responsibility of those who
participate in free speech to be well
educated
okay i mean that could be your position
but i disagree with it would you follow
that same position if let's say let's
say hypothetically so i can't prove this
but let's say that in a hypothetical
world i could i could um demonstrate
that if you allow bad faith actors to
run amok it actually does damage
discourse to the point that people are
making decisions
that they wouldn't otherwise that are
either worse for society or worse for
themselves
because they've been misled by somebody
in a position of political power
that is intentionally misleading people
would you still be in favor of it then
do you think it's okay
oh sorry you cut out for me would you
say um let's say you have a politician
that is intentionally lying about
something
he will say he's a bad faith actor and
let's say that in another world i could
show you
this person is actually hurting society
people are making decisions and they
wouldn't otherwise if they had access to
the correct information
do you think that somebody like this
should be allowed to just spew
misinformation from a platform even if
it's causing a demonstrable harm to
society
yes and who gets to decide what's
misinformation
um i mean there are ways that we could
do that that's a separate conversation
so if you say yes then my question is
why do you value freedom of speech
what's so important about that
particular value for you
people should be able to express their
beliefs and what gives somebody else the
right to
sort of like use force to silence them
it's a it's a thing
it's there's a difference between i
guess uh
the per the policies of companies
because that's the choice of the owners
of them but yeah sure we're not talking
about like legal or companies we don't
have to distinguish
that right now i'm just curious like why
is freedom of speech an important thing
to you
i understand that you're gonna like i
know you've said like well people should
have freedom of speech
but why i'm asking why is freedom of
speech so important because it's
important for everybody to get their
ideas out there and you
you start making you know standards of
who gets excluded
they will might be expanded to exclude
people who don't deserve that exclusion
okay so let's say that some people
wanted to go online and start talking
about how to build like the perfect
atomic bomb
and maybe a hundred or a thousand people
could come together and kind of put
those instructions out there and then
people figure it out and then they build
an atomic bomb and they destroy a city
do you think speech like that should be
protected
sure okay all right i disagree um for me
foundationally i think that everything
should serve
kind of like the common interest of
people at the end of the day um i think
that if something causes
what utilitarian that's the framework by
which i view more
morality yeah moral decisions is usually
a consequentialist one some form of
utilitarianism sure
but yeah i think at the end of the day
if something is causing a demonstrable
harm to people then that thing probably
shouldn't be valued or cherished
personally i fall on the side of freedom
of speech generally because i think that
it's usually good and i think that
people being able to express themselves
is good but i mean in cases where it's
not good then yeah i would seek to limit
that of course because i don't think
freedom of speech is more important than
people's happiness or the well-being of
society
um i think that's where we differ
because i'm more deontological about
that sort of thing
i think that people's rights should be
protected as long as they're not
infringing on anybody else's rights so
you have a dental logical
protection of freedom of speech you
think that that in and of itself is
virtuous and should be protected even if
it leads to harm to other people
yes do you think that we have a
responsibility to keep other people from
harm
um yes okay so let's say well here
i wouldn't i wouldn't want somebody to
be harmed and if it's a
if it's an actual violation of you know
their property or their rights
then yeah you need to intervene in that
okay so here's a question
property of rights let's say that you
have a friend okay then let's say there
are two other people
one of these people is giving
instructions to a third party on how to
kill your friend do you think that you
could try to de-platform this person or
stop this person through violent means
or do you think it would be against your
kind of like
deontological obligations to do so i
would i would get the the person that
they're targeting armed
and defended so that are they allowed to
take like preemptive action
especially the atomic bomb one is very
uh
unlikely okay well sure well let's go to
real hypotheticals let's say that you
have a group of people
who are in the united states whose
existence is threatened
by a certain regime okay let's say that
these people were brought here as
children unless they say that through
deferred action
um they're able to remain in the united
states that they register with the us
government let's say that there are
people that advocate for the forced
removal of these people from their
country do you think these people have a
right to defend themselves or should
they just accept the state violence as
is they
should defend themselves if they are
attacked okay so then do you think that
um like hispanic children in this
country that are here under daca have a
right to take up arms and and fight
against like the us government or people
on the right
because that's a pretty extreme position
i i don't i think uh
well if if it's all about if they're
actually like
being physically harmed and i think uh
it's a it's a problem with the state
because i um
depends on if the property that they're
on is
they have a right to be there
okay so then their individual freedoms
or rights are are subservient to
property rights or how does that work
like okay so how did they
how did they get there uh they were
brought here at an early age by their
parents
okay and and were did the did their
parents ask for permission to go on the
property that they're residing in no the
parents didn't
okay then they don't belong there okay
so you think that if somebody is facing
potential removal from this country
via something like daca um because
that's being revoked that person has no
right to defend themselves they just
have to accept that consequence
well yeah it all depends on if they have
a right to be on that property
okay let's say i know the hypothetical
wasn't clear before
sure well it's not hypothetical this is
daca in america today let's say that a
native american would approach it with
his tribe and he wanted to remove you
from the united states do you think he
has a right to do that
a native american approaches me and he
wants to remove me
yeah because he believes that you're in
the united states against any previous
like native american authority
well the problem with that is i don't
know if there's
good records on uh native american like
property holdings
i mean i think there's pretty safe
records that we came here from europe
and we weren't here before that
we took the land from the native
americans i know that's not what i'm
saying i'm saying that who
who owned what was not clear
okay um i mean i guess my
philosophically i'm against the position
of removing people from a country using
state-sanctioned violence who aren't
here through any fault of their own i
feel like that's a pretty bad position
to take and i feel like you can justify
well not state-sanctioned violence
because i don't believe in the um
the the i don't believe in the
state's coercion now the the thing with
the children is like they can ask the
it's not all up to their parents they
can ask the who's person property that
they are on
if they can be there well they already
did that's what they have well they
already did that's what daca was for it
gave them a way to be here
right they were registered with the
government they paid taxes they were
given a tax id and they weren't allowed
to commit any crimes and still remain
registered for the government
okay but whose property are they on
they're on the us's property with
permission from the united states
are they on are they on public property
or are they on private property
like public property hasn't funded by
taxpayers or oh we're
probably generally on private property
okay so if the house was
bought by their parents then they have a
right to be there this is not very clear
oh okay well in that case then would you
say that people who
um exist under daca have a right to take
up arms or kill conservatives if they
feel like that they're going to use
state-sanctioned violence to remove them
from their private property and deport
them from the country
if they're approached with physical
force then
yeah they should defend themselves if
it's on private property that they own
they cannot be evicted from it because
they own it
okay cool i mean i think we're pretty
much in agreement then
um well i don't know if i would go that
far that's a really extreme position
wait wait wait flamingo hold up let me
ask something so they're they're allowed
to stay on that private property but are
they allowed to venture out into
into public property and and use public
uh you know
infrastructure and stuff like that or
should they just stay on that
on that private piece of property they
need whoever funded
they need the um approval of whoever
funded that public property
which would be them right because
they're all taxpayers so
well yeah partially them but they need a
you know approval of the others to be in
that community and venture out on way
that's not how all private property
works private property doesn't require
unanimous approval from people that our
public property doesn't require
unanimous approval from every tax payer
for people
to go on it well are they fun okay if
they're funding it with that
with their tax money then they're yeah
then they can be there
also real quick i think it's also
important to note that uh destiny is
talking about
uh whether or not daca recipients would
be allowed to um
or would be justified in engaging in
violence against people who are
uh advocating for the enforcement of
immigration laws that would see them
deported
i think that's all well not the
enforcement of immigration laws the
repeal of an immigration law that
protects them
it's not an immigration law that is not
an immigration laws it was an executive
it was an executive order it was an
executive order that protected their
existence here it gave them okay it's
not
there's a very clear difference it
wasn't passing
are you not wait are you not recognizing
the authority of executive action okay
which one
which one which one which body passes an
executive order the president's
executive
legislative okay does it go through
congress no
okay uh do you see how that maybe if a
president
couldn't get his way in congress went
around congress
executive order that might not be uh
valid
obama himself had the right to to do
daca before he did it it's it's kind of
a controversial thing it's been
i'm sorry is this controversial or is it
settled on the supreme court
i just wanted i didn't want to interject
on this i just wanted to clear up the
language in case it was confusing
because uh soph was talking about
private property that they may have
purchased
okay sure so yeah i mean we can clear up
the language so the language very
clearly the president has certain powers
delegated to him
um president obama exercised this for
daca now personally do i think executive
actions have gone a little bit far
um absolutely but i mean the supreme
court has recognized it as being
valid they refused to hear appeals from
trump about it they took no action on it
so i mean it's settled
it is law i mean whether you don't like
the fact that it came from the president
versus
um congress or whatever or if you would
call it a law i mean it's something that
is
delegated by the president and it is
what it is can i ask you can i ask you a
question then um
do you agree with uh president trump's
uh executive order to fund the border
wall
no i don't even though congress approved
border wall funding
um we had more he had more of a
legislative mandate than
obama did to pass daca and you're
defending daca
no i don't think that congress approving
border funding is the same as trump
threatening to take the military to the
border to build his wall i think these
are two very different things no it's
not you
it's not the military using military
funding discretionary military funding
for the state of emergency which he is
delegated by congress to allow him to do
oh well i mean if that's something if
that survivor
yeah no no no no i agree i agree okay
if the supreme court settles it i don't
know if that's something that will go
through this right but if there's a
record settled something yeah then
people say yeah it's legal i would
disagree with the act itself but yeah i
mean
if it's legal it's legal all right let
me let me let me
sorry i'm sorry for derailing that i
just wanted to that's okay
and we'll get to another topic colonel j
says oh god hold on a sec
uh hold on one second flamingo uh toss
it to another question cause my computer
is literally about to cut out so go
ahead and talk for a sec
all right um so with
uh now that you know they specifically
talking about uh deportation so do you
believe that the uh
the federal government has a right to
deport non-citizens
i don't uh i don't believe i we have to
talk about this as if the state weren't
involved
well the state does deportations that's
that's the reason why i bring it up
yeah that's yeah so yes
okay but i i would i don't believe in
the state we have to talk about just
private and public property and you know
what
what property is uh up to the taxpayers
and what is private property
and uh the logistics of that all right
fair enough
do you have the super chats right yeah i
was i'm on my laptop
and i thought i had enough battery to
just do the show without plugging it in
uh and that final warning came up uh it
was about to just completely
kill the whole stream so i had to kind
of uh
go to the other room and grab the uh the
charger okay colonel j says who left
this keebler elf outside the treehouse
synack8 says destiny
you said the same thing about all
conservatives wanting to force them to
be deported or throw them into camps do
you have a comment on that destiny
um i mean i've said some things like uh
i've said some things in hyperbole like
that but i generally like immediately
followed up with like this is probably
not a good idea or
in a video game i'll say something [ __ ]
like that like i said like i have a
greater body of work that i can appeal
to that it makes it pretty clear that
i'm not usually in favor of killing
larger groups of people i don't think
the same can be said about somebody like
nick fuentes
however if i was called for so many
stuff wait what has nick fuentes ever
called for anyone's death
um not an explicit language um to be
clear though if i if i had to defend the
proposition that conservatives could be
forcibly removed from the use of
violence i do think i would defend that
argument though even though i don't
necessarily make it a lot
i think that there are defenses for that
i think noam chomsky said the republican
party is like the biggest threat to
security in the west right now and i
actually do share that agreement so
i probably would make that defense but i
mean obviously the pragmatic side of
that is really [ __ ] bloody so
uh victor phantasm says when is destiny
gonna pay that money yo he was caught
saying the
not not n word i don't know what that's
in reference i mean i know i think he
was talking about yachts
oh there are for some reason a lot of
people say that i got famous and talked
about two saying the n word all the time
and i asked somebody like if you could
like produce like a picture of me like
saying the n word while like as an
insult while playing a starcraft 2 game
i would be shocked because i
didn't do this um and i think i made i
offered like a thousand dollars
something that could
um i think the only time i've ever done
it is i've used like the soft day a
couple times like clearly as a meme
and then i think i did it once in a game
where i was referring to like the guy
was playing against his like teammate
got fired from a team but i've never i
just haven't called people the n word
not because i'm like a good person or
anything but because like um it's just
not part of like what uh rts players
said if i was an fps player i probably
would have said it a lot because they
tend to more
all right tim says oh go ahead self go
ahead i have a i have a question for
bonnell um
so if i said like this is probably not a
good idea after those discord logs it
would have been okay
um i mean if you walked it back
afterwards like okay like yeah i mean it
would it would definitely yeah change
the way that i would view it sure
if i walked it back and said oh i don't
actually mean any of this uh whatever
yeah suddenly but and then it would also
depend on like your larger body of work
too i haven't watched very many of
youtube videos but if all of your
youtube videos are constantly attacking
muslims then i probably wouldn't be as
likely to believe it
well so do you think what i did was okay
or not
um in this political climate right now
no i think that
attacking certain minority groups i
think is pretty scary um i don't think
it's a good idea to do it right now i
would argue if you're a public figure
that you have a responsibility not to
engage in that type of behavior
i don't i just don't see that because
it's you're it's
it just seems hypocritical hypocritical
to me you're
claiming it's the political climate but
you saying kill all conservatives i just
see that as
the same general statement general
attack sure so the difference that um i
guess progressives would call
between attacking certain groups of
people is that there are certain groups
of people that society sees as
vulnerable and there are certain groups
of people that society does not taste
vulnerable
so for instance i'm not really
comfortable making jokes about like say
women um because women's position in
society in some cases can be threatened
whereas
for men like you're never going to be in
trouble for being a man like being a man
um generally yeah except for some very
fringe cases so for instance we'll say
like um
things related to child custody suits
like that can be kind of scary
um maybe rape related stuff although
that gets into the woods drafted for the
military and died
um you kind of as i mean men
sign up for selective services we don't
have a draft in place right now though i
do agree with you that women should
sign up for the second service but right
now in the united states it's a full
volunteer military we don't have a draft
right now
if there was a draft though and the
draft was only on men that would be
really [ __ ] up i think
uh that would be really bad i would
agree with that um although to be fair i
try not to like insult like broad groups
of people based on characteristics they
have no control over so i try not to
make fun of like
all white people or all men or whatever
but i do think that the arguments
you have um yeah i probably have i try
not to but i probably have
but so justifying it right like the
justification is generally that like
larger majority powerholder groups
aren't usually threatened by this type
of humor or these types of jokes because
bad acts aren't usually happening
towards
them or there isn't like institution
yeah but conservatives are being
attacked
um in it well in an institutional way
probably not but
i want to draw a difference between like
conservatives what about that guy that
shot up the republican baseball game
that seemed like a pretty pretty big
attack there yeah
um i mean if stuff like that was
happening a lot that would probably be
pretty bad
um but but real real quick i i want to
draw it's happening a lot i don't think
it's happening as much as right on left
violence or at least not according to
what i've seen at least in the united
states i know we don't like to cite the
adl here if somebody has contrary
evidence you can
shoot me something different um but i i
think there's a difference between like
um i think there's interesting like
political positions versus like
intrinsic parts of your character
are you talking about these okay but
okay
islam is a choice what
religion is a choice um
maybe i don't know that's a really tough
one i'm not sure
it's literally a choice um depending on
the society or the community that you're
born
into um it could be really i think you
can make really strong arguments that
like
um like islam can be a very cultural
thing depending on where you're from
uh like like for instance if you're like
in certain parts of saudi arabia it
would be pretty hard to be like oh i'm
an atheist you know like yeah
yeah because you're going to be killed
if you're a child or a woman you're
pretty much being held
captive but um for certain oppressive
religious groups yeah
i would probably agree with that yeah in
yeah in middle eastern countries um
but generally in our countries it is a
choice
um yeah maybe that's i have a really
hard one with that like
like for instance like speaking english
is that a choice
you grow up with it yeah so exactly
right like but you can learn another one
you could but like you generally are
going to stick with the language that
you're born with because it's like so
heavily like a part of like everything
that centers around you i don't know if
i would necessarily say like political
positions
are are the same way i mean you in some
way you grew up inheriting political
positions but you can make a lot of
choices to change these
without like a substantial amount of
like dedicating parts of your life to
learn something different like you would
say another language
or completely abandoning and joining
another religion which for some people
is almost impossible
right because you're you're basically
shedding your entire community and maybe
sometimes even your family to join
another one
i think it's i think it's because a a
language
you have to learn a whole another
language if you uh
want to i guess leave english but with
islam
you can just leave islam and become an
atheist that might be
you know complicated with uh your
community and such but it's
it's definitely a lot easier and it's
definitely still a choice
um i mean i would actually argue i would
actually argue the contrary i think
that's a bit of a naive analysis of the
situation if i wanted to learn a second
language
i don't have to actually lose any of my
english friends in fact i could actually
even hide the fact
that i um that i know a second language
i could learn spanish and secret if i
wanted to or i could learn spanish and
then still practice english as much as i
want
if depending on how radical either the
sect of islam you're part of or the
denomination of christianity you're part
of is
it's not really possible to be an
atheist and hold on to that old
community of those old friends you can't
go to church every sunday you can't go
to like the church groups
you know on the weekends you can't hang
out with your family members like you
could have to excise quite a bit out of
your life in order to change
religions i don't think it's the same
with changing a language
i i still think it's a it's a choice but
it's still a choice though right
i mean but in that case like literally
everything is a choice it's an ideology
i mean you could you're choosing to to
stay in it right
yeah but it's a little bit reductionist
to say like that's a choice like i mean
technically all of you right now are
choosing to be poor because you could go
invest all of your money in the right
options and then become billionaires
overnight like i mean it's is that
really like a choice like i don't know
i think it's much harder to suddenly
become a billionaire than to
unsubscribe from an ideology i mean you
say that but for some people and i mean
like i can't speak to the people on this
call
i'm personally i don't give a [ __ ] i
left my religion but that's because i
don't give a [ __ ] about any of my family
but
if you're somebody that's very close to
your family if you live with your family
especially
or if you get support from them
financially it can be really hard to
just say sorry mom and dad i'm not doing
this anymore i'm not part of this
religion
what if you rely on them for funding for
college what if you like to see your
family on the weekends what if you've
got siblings that you're not going to be
able to talk to
what about your community that you've
had at your either your mosque or your
church or your synagogue these can be
really hard things for people to just
walk away from
well yeah i'm not saying that it's gonna
be an easy choice but it's still true
yeah it's not none of us said that it
was easy well sure but if it's a
difficult choice
then probabilistically speaking people
aren't going to make it if it's a very
very hard choice to make i'm not going
to fault somebody for not walking away
like i don't like i try not to demonize
people i used to when i was a younger
edgy [ __ ] atheist
but i try not to demonize people for
being christian because walking away
from your religion when it's such an
integrated part of your life that's a
really [ __ ] hard thing to do
and to be fair to destiny as a person
who was not very
growing up as a regular uh devout member
of his
church now i i could also say that uh
arguing it comes from a spiritual place
that's very hard to con
uh to say as a choice or anything just
as a person who uh is on the opposite
end
yeah i don't know it's still a choice
though yeah the pro so the reason why
that language obviously gets a
conversation
because when you say it's a choice you
make it sound like it's 50 50 right
that's why i use the stock thing like
technically you're making the choice
right now to not buy the right stock but
you're obviously saying well that's
ridiculous it would be like a one
percent chance that i would choose the
right one but i'm trying to say it's the
same for religion like the chances that
somebody would make that
choice is that's a very low chance it's
not just like a 50 50 thing like oh well
i'll either leave it or i won't
it's like i have to take into account
how much of my life am i ready to throw
away as a result of walking away
from my culture right which is what
religion being couldn't you make the
same argument for
like growing up conservative um to some
extent yeah you could if you're like
super buried in like a rural community
um the only difference i draw between
political ideologies and religious ones
but i will extend this to religion ones
is when your ideology starts to
influence the way you treat other people
so for instance personally i don't like
any religion i'm a very hardline atheist
but
if you practice in your community or
blah blah blah that's fine but as soon
as like let's say that you're a muslim
and you want to start
enacting some [ __ ] sharia [ __ ]
law like for non-muslims
nope [ __ ] you that's not gonna happen or
if you're a christian and you wanna hang
the [ __ ] ten commandments in a in a
courthouse nope sorry [ __ ] you we're not
doing that [ __ ]
um so if you wanna practice your
religion personally that's okay
political beliefs are oftentimes not
really practiced personally because you
go out and vote and your vote can lead
to demonstrable harm to people such as
daca people being forcibly removed from
the country
well to be fair though like your your
identity and part of
your religion is what influences your
political decisions
yeah it could be it's i mean i guess
maybe you could argue that it's
arbitrary where i draw the line
um but like as soon as you enter a
voting booth and you start making
decisions in the polls
that are actively harming other people
in your country and i'm and i'm a person
that believes that everyone in your
country should be protected
and even people outside of your country
should be protected i think you share
some responsibility there for that harm
that you do to other people
um if you're just worshiping in your own
town or privately or whatever and you do
that [ __ ] i mean
arguably there might be some harm that
comes from that but i'm a lot more
lenient on that like if you keep that
[ __ ] to yourself
all right uh i'm i'm not the leave
english thing i think i was muted but i
was dying whenever you said there's
something
i just uh want to say that we're not
like yeah it's a difficult choice like
being not a nazi in nazi germany was
hard like being not a communist
in you know soviet russia was hard but
it was still
like a choice you had to make and like
well like i don't fault people that were
nazis in nazi germany
[ __ ] dude i probably probably would have
[ __ ] been a nazi nazi germany like to
be real most of us in here would have
been nazis in nazi germany
like it you know push comes to shove i
don't know if i'm going to say like yeah
[ __ ] it i'm going to sacrifice my whole
[ __ ] family behind some moral truth
that i believe and being and
being an a religious person right i
don't know if i'm going to [ __ ] do
that um but being a nazi today in
today's world
i think it's pretty easy to not be a
nazi in 2019.
um i wouldn't compare the nazis of today
undergoing the same pressures as the
nazis in lake literal nazi germany where
you might be killed if you don't fall in
line with that political party at the
time
are you anything else so if you want to
raise something else on that uh score
i just i still think his choice so
all right uh let's see btim says destiny
you talk way too fast i don't know what
you're saying because you were talking
too fast i would guess you are talking
250 words per minute
uh sean william sean william george
buck uh gave five dollars didn't say
anything razia133
no says do not shield self destiny
versus soph
onion wizard says being targeted does
not give anyone a pass ever
sinak 8 says what about all those kids
with fully automatic smirks
the left try to ruin their reputation by
making them look racist
or well yeah that's a that's a good
example of that they're like they're
they're getting targeted as well to say
that they're that they're not a targeted
group is
is um i feel like when people start to
become targeted groups i think it's
really bad
um i i was always against that i mean i
don't really have a twitter log but like
targeting a group of [ __ ] high
schoolers for their political beliefs
was real [ __ ] stupid
um i agree with that i'm very
uncomfortable with the idea
of bullying or harassing somebody who's
in [ __ ] high school over their
political beliefs
except for you i guess because we're
having this conversation
but like that wasn't supposed to i'm
sorry i'm not like a 10 year age but
like in general like
i mean like you'll know this i'm sure
that you're a lot different now than you
were when you were 10 um and you'll be a
lot different when you're 18. the idea
of attacking a 16 year old over their
political belief is
real [ __ ] stupid and anybody that got
like hung up on that is pretty [ __ ]
dumb
all right now what about now this was
another topic i had that kind of came up
uh to me while you guys were speaking
earlier what about uh
using violence against uh quote-unquote
nazis uh
even even if you say they're a real nazi
agree to that is it is it okay to just
you know
walk up and crack them in the head with
a bad or something like that um so like
so what i would say so i don't engage in
this personally but the thing is i don't
belong to any classes that are ever
threatened in the u.s right as a white
person as a male as a straight person
like i'm never really like targeted as a
wealthy person like there aren't like
systemic things that [ __ ] with me
so i don't know if i personally would be
drawn to violence because none of these
things really threaten me
but let's say that the existence of you
in a country is actively threatened by
the existence of another political group
i mean i think that that person could
make a strong argument a strong moral
argument for having um
the the moral righteousness on their
side to like take violent action against
these groups of people preemptively yeah
sure
i think i think most people would not
those people i'm asking you and i'll let
self jump in
too on this but i mean is it okay i i
mean
when you say okay that's just like so
but i think yeah i think it could be
yeah
i think that most people i think i would
argue for you or
is it um well when you ask me
something's okay you're asking me with
respect to some particular moral
framework
i'll say yes yeah it's okay sure yes
okay can i ask you a quick question
i'll let you get in there let me go look
let's go ahead how can you defend that
unless
they were physically aggressed against
first if if they haven't actually
done anything to violate your personal
space
i you can't justify taking preemptive
action on them on suspicions that they
want to remove you um yeah so maybe this
is like a consequential thing but like
the waiting for the moment for them to
do it is absolutely nothing i mean as a
gun owner i know that this is dumb right
if i know that somebody's going to
if somebody is like walks across the
room they pick up a glock they load a
bullet into the mag they
slap the mag into the gun they're
lunging at you then yeah you can
take you know action but then the action
of them just being a nazi is not enough
well i think it could be i mean i mean
we could back up that analogy several
steps but if somebody is a nazi they're
going to be advocating for political
reform that is a direct threat to your
existence in the particular state that
you live in
i think that you could justify some form
of political violence against these
people yeah
can i ask you a question destiny what's
your threshold that would uh justify
this
uh preemptive violence um i usually look
at like um
like people that have like political
effectiveness so people that are like
rallying for certain political figures
if they've got like political
representation
um or if they rally for ideas that they
vote for that represent harm to you as
people i think that there are
justifications there
for you to take action against them i
have a question to expand upon that do
you believe
that so falls into these classifications
because i'm gonna
go out on a limb here and guess that
people in your twitch chat are saying
that she's a nazi
would you condone preemptive violence
against her um
okay that sounds really bad i'm trying
to sound insulting because it sounds
really intelligent i'm not trying to say
this but like i would be i'm very very
uncomfortable
viciously attacking young people for
their political beliefs
right like if a 15 year old were to come
up to me and say i'm a nazi and i hate
black people
i was like [ __ ] dude like you're 15 like
i'm not to sit here and like like
hold you like i'm uncomfortable when the
u.s tries like like adolescent people as
adults for murder i don't even know if
that's right like a 15 16 year old could
be tried for murder as an adult like
i don't know so like the no the idea
that you would enact violence on like
young groups of people people that are
minors at least in so far as the us is
concerned i don't think that's right
like these people
aren't even voting yet you know if soph
was if soph was
uh 18 years old would you yeah then it's
fair game sure
yeah once you've reached the age of
voting agent majority wait hold up
so if i were 18 and i'm still me and i
have my current beliefs you think it
would be
okay to enact violence against me um oh
i'm sorry this was under the assumption
that you're actually
like a nazi i i don't know what you're
believing so i'm watching off your
youtube videos
okay sure i would say that based on what
i've seen there's a high probability
that i would probably say violence is
justified yeah if i'm being honest based
on what i've seen but i could be wrong i
haven't watched enough i really don't
know but
okay you got a response go ahead
could uh mick fuentes be a target
absolutely yeah
so you can punch him uh i think i think
it could be more legitimately
claimed that you know he hates jews or
that he wants to expel black people from
the country
i mean i think you can inductively
reason out pretty easily what his
position is so yeah i think
he's never directly claimed that yeah of
course because that's how they shield
themselves from it you never directly
claim it that's the whole point of that
sort of movement right
yeah but you what if you incorrectly
assume
somebody's positions based on that sort
of line of reasoning
then you would make a mistake and that
would be a [ __ ] up
yeah that could likely happen when
you're making these assumptions about
nick fuentes
i mean it would depend on the totality
of evidence you have available to you to
inductively reason out what they think
with nick it's a pretty easy shot
um i'm not gonna like look at what i
don't think it is
i mean you might i mean if you want i
could spend tonight like gathering
videos and we could come back tomorrow
with 100 clips to watch although i don't
know if you'd ever be fully convinced
but like to give some credence to your
side if i see somebody making like the
okay symbol in public i don't think i
can walk up to that person like crack
them over there with a bat that's like
that
we're way way way far away at that point
right or people like um you know a lot
of like the dumb centrists that get
caught in were like oh well this isn't
like crypto fashion so this is just like
okay simple and whatever other pepe the
frog like i don't think you could attack
these types of people but somebody like
nick fuentes is way way way over the
line
into things like white nationalism or
neo-nazism
so you could just pistol what nick
fuentes i mean i think
i personally wouldn't because i don't
want to [ __ ] deal with the legal
system [ __ ] that but i think it could be
justified yeah
just because he says things that are
reminiscent of all right things does not
make him well no because he actively
advocates on his platform for white
nationalist beliefs that would directly
lead to the harm of people that lit yes
because you said he was dog whistling
only which is a way of advocating for
your political beliefs and bringing
people over yeah like lauren southern
does the same sure
i don't i don't think it matters how
much evidence you have against him i
don't think it ever
justifies you to have violence against
him just
by him saying something okay well i mean
that's what we disagree i mean i would
say that if you're a
person in the united states and i think
that your existence is threatened by
certain groups of people
i think you have every right to defend
yourself so
real quick then you just said that um
you would be very uncomfortable with
anybody
this was part of a targeted group you do
realize that there are people who
actively talk about engaging in
preemptive violence against people that
you're calling her right if she was if
she was 18 that there are
there are people within your circles
that would do this you
you do realize this yeah i'm sorry so i
mean i should clarify i kind of thought
it was obvious but like obviously i'm
uncomfortable with calls to violence
that are unjustified that i don't see as
being morally justified so for instance
if somebody says they want to do a call
to violence
for all murderers or something like
obviously i'm okay with that even though
i say like i'm not generally justified
with like
bullying targeted groups of people i'm
talking about like targeted groups of
people that have a trait that doesn't
necessarily make them worthy of
targeting if you want to target like
terrorists
well i'm probably okay with that right
yeah but
the ques the question i ask is because
you have a very hard time
gaining a set set of criteria in which
you would say that this person is
definitively blank but you're also
saying that it's okay for people to
actively talk against violence about
these people
and that they could be targeted right
all right let me okay let me let me read
these super chats and we'll get back
we'll take some callers here
you're setting a standard of you know um
things people say you know clips of them
saying something justifies violence
that can easily go wrong and end up with
a lot of people getting beat up for no
reason because some [ __ ] was made up
about them
that everybody believed and said okay i
guess we can go punch him because he's a
nazi or something
holy [ __ ] actually i agree with you 100
so i think we should de-platform bad
faith actors that spread misinformation
about people
for instance a lot of people on the left
will call some [ __ ] dude to nazi for
no [ __ ] reason because they made an
okay symbol i think those types of
people should be
platformed if somebody's going to make
accusations that somebody is showing the
tendencies of being a nazi
they should actually present evidence to
do so and when they fail to do so those
people should be deplatformed so yes i
am of the mindset that you could enact
violence against groups of people that
do hold views that are a direct threat
to the existence of certain groups of
people
but i also think there should be a
responsibility to make sure that you're
accurately conveying those views
publicly because like you said i
wouldn't want people to be misled
into thinking something that's not true
so do you think you're misleading people
into believing that nick fuentes is a
nazi
no i think i'm very accurate in that
assessment and
you know who says that your judgment is
absolute like what do you mean apps like
in regards to the absolute frame of
reference of the universe or
i mean no to to to him being a nazi like
i mean in terms of him believing in like
the jewish the jewish question or the
jewish conspiracy theories
in in regards to him you know he
believes in that because he constantly
dog whistles it and he talks about how
jews are
breeding out white people and destroying
society or making references to those
conspiracy theories constantly
i i don't i don't like he's not he's
for you you're basically saying unless
he comes out and literally says i am a
nazi it's not going to be enough for you
but in the real world that's just not
how people reason out their positions
you have to be a lot more nuanced than
that
so i don't think any number of clips
controversial clips can justify you to
you know punch somebody for their
beliefs if they didn't actually aggress
against you in the first place
i mean that's easy for you to say but if
you're somebody in the united states
whose existence is threatened by these
groups of people you might feel a lot
differently right
for instance if you're a transgender
person and you're part of um you would
be part of the class people that get
targeted by like jordan peterson fanboys
all the time right the ability for you
to exist in a state in the united states
where you can either perceive surgery to
remedy your problems
or where you can exist without feeling
constantly threatened these types of
people would say well [ __ ] i'm already
aggressed on
the idea that i can't do anything
against these people because they
haven't done anything yet that's already
not true these people are constantly
advocating against my existence these
people are constantly hampering my
ability to seek treatments
that might be people might be advocating
against their existence but it's not
actually doing anything no
no except it is in the united states not
deported but they might be prevented
from seeking medical treatment in the
united states there are still a lot of
bars for things like sex reassignment
surgery or hormone therapy that some
people argue
are much higher than other sorts of um
uh psychiatric remedy
for uh their problems so i mean like or
psycho-pharmaceutical as well
so i mean there are people that would
argue that right now their existence is
being threatened or people that block
the ability for them to have
equal protections as a protected class
like how many people got upset about
c-16 in canada how many people got upset
about the new york laws that protect
trans people yeah because that protects
free speech you can't compel speech like
that because it's an ideological thing
it depends on if you believe in
you know transgenderism well do you
believe in
hiring people based on their race
because in the united states race is a
protected class you're not allowed to
discriminate against hiring black or
white people these are things that we've
decided in the u.s
what exactly are you asking sorry so
like in the united states for i'm using
new york city as an example new york
city passed a law that said that
transgender peoples
fall under the same class of protections
as homosexual peoples um that are
persons i should say
so like a lot of people are against this
type of thing even though transgender
people would like it to protect them
from being harassed at a job
due to the fact that they're transgender
people want to be harassed on that
ground
so harassed or not be able to be
employed
i mean those can be one and the same
nobody wants to work for somebody that
can harass them on the basis of their
existence constantly
my position on that is um
it's up to employers to decide who they
want to employ
you can't regulate uh discriminate
discrimination laws in that way and
compel them to
employ people they don't want to employ
because it's their business and it's
their money
i mean i guess if that's your position
but i mean like would you be okay right
now if youtube killed your channel
because they didn't want female content
creators
yes because that's their choice that
it's their company they get
you know they decide what to do with it
okay i mean you're okay then with every
single
bright person that's been de-platformed
across facebook and twitter and
everything then too right
well ultimately i i don't want it to
happen but technically i am
okay with it like i i don't want it to
happen
but i think it can happen if that's what
twitter wants to do with their platform
or facebook wants to do with their
platform well for things that we don't
want to happen
if we think that these things shouldn't
happen don't we usually like aspire to
make laws to prevent them from happening
no i per i'm i'm talking about you know
the delineation between
what i personally think and what i think
you know people should have the freedom
to do
when it comes to twitter and facebook
they have the freedom to do
whatever they want with their company
personally i wouldn't like them to do
certain things but i'm not going to
prevent them from doing that because
it's their freedom i have no right to
infringe on
you know who they decide to platform and
d platform
okay i mean if that's your position it
just feels really weird to talk about
like i don't think companies should do
this thing but i also want companies to
be able to do this thing
that just seems like a weird position
for me i guess
what do you mean like like i don't want
twitter to d platform right people but i
think they should be able to d platform
right people just seems kind of weird
yeah okay
because it's their freedom like i you
know well i i don't want somebody to
create a community where they only let
in white people but they're technically
allowed to do that if they want to do
that because free association or
something like that
okay all right let me read these i am
way behind i'm going to read a bunch
right now the vol delinquent says is he
saying colleges
ain't against the right is that what you
were saying um
i mean reality tends to have a liberal
bias that's the saying right
um it's really hard to be educated to be
a conservative or republican in the
united states today i mean i can't help
the republicans with that
um real quick can i just say something
real quick dizzy in your chat said
destiny has claimed violence is okay
against white nationalists ask if he's
in favor of violence against black
nationalists when he says no ask
why if you're a black now i used to
fight with these people a lot on twitter
if you're like a nationalist of any
certain like ethnic creed that's like
advocating for the removal of anybody
else then yeah of course you can justify
violence against them
i think black nationalists can fall
under this if you're that type of group
sure
okay second okay um i just wanted to ask
in regard to the previous
uh argument like do you think that
you're if it's inconvenient to you you
don't personally believe in it that you
get the right to infringe on other
people's freedoms
um i mean it so so because of the way
that i view morality i don't
i don't hold like a freedom to be like a
deontological good like a freedom in and
of itself is virtuous so freedom is only
good and so far as it serves society
so if we talk about people's free
ability to associate with people i don't
think it's good for society if business
owners can discriminate against people
on the basis of like
religion or ethnicity so i wouldn't
protect that freedom in that case
i don't think it would be good for a
city to say like well we don't want to
hire any black people to work here i
don't think that's a good thing
just because you don't think it's a good
thing to society what still what gives
you
the right to you know uh control and
regulate their
decisions over their private property uh
it depends on how deep that question is
i mean theoretically i don't believe
that rights exist i don't i don't know
if anybody gives you that right i mean i
guess you could say
in another way it comes from god or from
natural law or some [ __ ]
uh but i mean like as a even property
i mean i believe that it exists what do
you what do you mean do you think people
can like own land and own things and own
companies and that sort of thing i mean
in so far as you can get a deed that
says that you own something or you work
or
other people recognize your ownership of
that thing right that's so do you think
it can be like
um destroyed at any time or appropriate
for the the use of society
i mean it can be or it should be or like
it like it would be a good thing for it
to happen
yeah it would be a good thing it would
be justifiable um
generally it doesn't seem like that's
worked in the past um
i mean i'm personally a big capitalist
i'm a big fan of private property so i
don't like the idea of the government
like seizing things
like trump would have to do for instance
to build that big wall along the
southern border
um so no i'm not generally in favor of
that type of like seizure of assets
in order to nationalize an industry or
something generally no unless there's a
really good reason for it i think you
can make arguments for it like say
around like um isps in the united states
maybe that maybe those things should be
public utilities because of the natural
monopolies that exist there but
generally no i'm not i'm not in favor of
that
how is it not how how can you make those
exceptions
uh just because they're convenient i
mean convenient is one way to say it but
serves like the public good it
would be the greater way to say it so
like for instance like i believe that um
i believe that markets exist and that
markets are real and so i'm a big
capitalist i like to analyze the way
that or i don't do this but academics
analyze where the businesses operate in
certain markets
sometimes there are things called market
failures so for whatever reason a market
doesn't function in a way that we want
it to
one reason this can happen is because a
monopoly exists so only one firm is able
to operate in any given city
for a variety of reasons for isps that
reason is there is a massive financial
barrier to entry for a market if you're
an isp and you establish somebody
somewhere you can [ __ ] over all the
customers you want because nobody's
going to compete with you in that market
same thing with like your public
utilities people don't have the money to
run 57 different
sets of pipes all around the city so you
kind of rely on one geographic monopoly
that kind of has to be controlled by the
public
because otherwise one private company
can [ __ ] you over and they have no
accountability since you don't vote on
their people like you do with public
actors
okay well that was a a long tirade but i
i don't think that can uh i don't think
property can be infringe on for
you know supposed public good because
it's really
it's subjective what is good for society
and i think it's a dangerous thing to
infringe on that and i don't think it
can be um can be can be done
and justified sure so let me ask you a
question um this is kind of hypothetical
kind of real world
let's say that you have one isp in your
city let's say that that isp
could probably charge you a hundred
dollars a month for internet and they'd
make fine money and they'd be okay
um but let's say they charge you 900 a
month for internet
because in order for somebody new to
come in and lay all the infrastructure
to set up internet they'd have to charge
you a thousand dollars a month to break
even
so the isp that exists there now that's
a private company they're gonna charge
you 900 a month
knowing that nobody else can come in and
compete but also knowing that they're
[ __ ] you over hardcore and you have
no recourse
do you think that kind of situation
should just be left alone or
um technically yes but i don't think i
would
allow that thing to happen there would
be probably communities that would
protect against a
monopolistic sort of thing like that by
having their own
you know um you know businesses of their
own where monopolies can't just intrude
and
jack up the prices well so some
communities actually do rally against
this by
voting to publicly fund their own
internet infrastructure that's actually
happened in communities across the us
before
uh if they all if yeah if they agree on
doing that and they
uh you know voluntarily donate to
support that thing then that would be
fine
okay do you consider like voting for an
increase in your taxes
to fund that if everybody votes on it or
a majority votes on it is that
considered like voluntary funding or
well if if the taxes are um voluntary if
they're not just you know
if you don't pay taxes we're gonna put
you in prison and that's the only reason
you pay the taxes
okay we're close we're okay yeah i'm
good
all right let me let me read these uh
there's a few on the stream jar as well
sib says y'all are watermelons
especially destiny anonymous says
why would you have a kid on with someone
who has endorsed cp is ethical
and had to flee his home state because
of an active warrant for repeated
i don't uh think that that's i mean
that's why i sent her
active warrant on my own that's why i
sent her that damn earlier i'm just
trying to slash well they said something
about you and your kid
like alex ah sometimes you incest with
your kid or whatever i don't know
that's kind of gross why do your friend
why do your fans think about incest so
much is that something that's on their
mind a lot
well the last time let's please let's
not let's i'm just wondering
it seems like a lot of people i talk to
are real interested in talking about
instances like everybody's looking at me
like
i real destiny i want to [ __ ] my sister
please give me the arguments to do it
that's what it feels like sometimes man
jesus
you talked about incest for like a solid
hour listen let's just not
psalm 87 says religion is a choice i
don't believe in god like the rest of my
family and none of them knows that
because i hide it from them
tell me how i'm wrong with that you're
not i mean if you can handle doing that
um depending on what form of
christianity you belong to it might be
easier to do that than others
um so for instance other people if they
want to leave their religion let's say
you're catholic they might be very
uncomfortable
participating in like the eucharist
during mass right when you walk up and
you eat like a little piece of
unleavened bread and then you take a
drink of wine they may be uncomfortable
participating in these ceremonies
because they feel like well if i leave
my religion i shouldn't have to do that
but obviously if you stop going up
during communion you're going to get
[ __ ] roasted oh you know either the
pastor's going to talk to you pastor
priest is going to talk to you your
family will talk to you people look at
you weird right yeah
well i think i think this a similar case
can be made for a conservatism it really
depends on
how your whole family views politics and
how extreme they are about that sort of
thing
um how easy it is for you to leave i
think both of them are still a choice
and both of them could
hypothetically be just as hard to leave
so i don't i
still think that's uh hypocritical um
depending on the setting that's yeah
that's kind of true
um something that a lot of people don't
know for instance a lot of people
demonize the [ __ ] out of every single
person in the kkk
but in a lot of places in the south
being part of the kkk was like part of
your like regional cultural [ __ ]
thing
now a lot of kkk people were real
[ __ ] racist and the kkk hit it a lot
of really [ __ ] up [ __ ] but there were
a lot of people that just grew up with
that and their family were part of it
they had to leave at a later point in
their life so
yeah i mean like you can make except you
can make arguments for being involved in
certain things
but i think generally there are easier
ways to leave like your political
affiliation than there are to leave your
religion um religion is like a very
deeply rooted thing that has like a lot
of like ritual and tradition that goes
along with it
generally political stuff isn't the same
you don't usually go to like a a
republican get-together every sunday you
know to talk about how much you worship
trump
um like you might with jesus or allah or
[ __ ] yahweh or whatever
okay um let me read these uh baron
nathan dean says destiny is such a
disguise delight
e.m dubois says uh self dear god don't
look up shadman mentioned in the other
super chat
nero 719 says i really hope the
watermelons get bred out of existence
toya says yahweh is the jewish one right
did i [ __ ] that up
people don't like it man we should just
like decide
everything by majority rule my dude uh
robert says destiny say
that's amazing and he did nothing wrong
i don't know if you want to say that's
amazing but amazing
huh amazing that guys that's amazing
jason brown 12 says ralph you ralph you
cuck
if it wasn't for destiny come on coming
on your show your show would be in the
gutter
have you forgot about my name miami
my me am i boy destiny on top
um well i do appreciate destiny coming
on the show for sure and i appreciate
your five dollars thank you
armshare warrior says blacks do commit a
ton of crime per capita versus any other
group crime reflects the origin of their
ancestors
um citation needed but okay yeah this is
super chat uh ron humperdink says how
can
des argue ethno ethical kitty blank but
not condone it personally but soph can't
argue
all uh all ms well not i guess he means
all muslims while not
personally condoning it
wait i'm sorry could you repeat that so
they're saying so he's saying how can
you make the argument
about ethical kitty porn perhaps or
whatever uh but not condone it
personally but so
can't uh can't argue uh all
muslims while not personally condoning
it i don't know that's just i mean i
so like the only thing that i would
condone is a course of action that lets
less children get raped that's the only
thing that i would condone and there
might even be better ways to do it i
don't even know if that the child porn
thing it was something that could exist
obviously there's like a boatload of
[ __ ] issues that would you regret
making that uh
that little assad there um no not at all
actually i think it's really interesting
to see what people attack me with
um like for instance when i got into
politics like two or three years ago i
kind of envisioned like forums would be
full of people like saying that i was an
idiot i was making like
fallacious arguments or my data was bad
but instead it's like a lot of weird ad
humming over like very niche positions
that i don't even hold which i think
says a lot about the people that attack
me so
all right let's see i'll go ahead so if
you want to see
you still hold it and like you know i
hold the position that i don't like
children getting raped yeah i don't
think many people disagree with that
yeah but you also said you wouldn't back
down off that
child pornography thing if it led to
less children getting raped yeah because
i don't like children getting raped
yeah but there's why are you saying yeah
but to children getting raped
if it was true would you be okay with
children getting raped if it meant to
get rid of some
child porn [ __ ] is that okay with you no
no i'm i was
well then we agree then we're not in
disagreement at all
let me speak because you're strong
manning me right now bonnell so
uh the studies have shown that it
actually
doesn't help with um kids not getting
raped and
you know there there could be a uh
increased recidivism
rate with that it's a it's mis mixed
results so i don't think you can
if it if you think that was the case do
you think i would still support it
um well if the original reason i
supported it was because i don't want
kids to get raped and then you say well
hey if you support this thing this might
lead to kids getting raped do you think
i would still support her do you think i
would say oh
well i support the thing that leads to
less kids getting great do you do you
support it
i i mean that first of all it's entirely
hypothetical and secondly i don't know
it's whatever the data supports whatever
leads to less kids getting raped
that's generally the position that i
support okay and the data says that it
it doesn't help with you know i mean i
haven't seen that but if that's true
then yeah that would be my position on
it i'd probably be against it
well i you know the production of it in
it of itself is a
ethical violation and i think
distributing it
distributing it might uh
you know encourage more production of it
i mean if distributing it encouraged
production of it then that would
probably be bad because that would lead
to more children getting raped because
that's generally what happens when you
make childborn so yeah
so that would probably be bad yeah okay
so is that what you believe
is which would i believe which one that
getting children getting raped is bad
that child pornography would not be a
good thing
i don't know i haven't seen whatever
data or studies you're suggesting exist
i haven't seen it if it is then yeah i
can link you them oh knock yourself out
i guess if you want
if i if i may interject the study was
your position on this
point was that you would um advocate for
the seizure of child pornography that
was already created and then in a very
controlled environment
have it being used for therapeutic uses
to uh
stop child molestation right
um hold on one second
you're not arguing for the creation or
the dissemination of child pornography
but the use of
seized child pornography for therapeutic
uses in a controlled setting um
i guess yeah so like this this would be
like the whole chain for how this would
work right
is you would get a committee together
you would take previously well first you
would have to establish that this would
even work
because there's a possibility that
showing people child porn just makes me
want to rate more kids in which case you
wouldn't [ __ ] do it because that
would be [ __ ] horrible so if it
doesn't work you wouldn't do it
initially
if you did think it would work then you
would get stuff that's already been
produced because you don't want to
incentivize the creation of new child
porn
because obviously that would lead to
more kids getting [ __ ] raped which is
bad so
you would do that and you'd have to
prove that already seized child porn is
better than say creating 3d child porn
or lolicon or whatever [ __ ] shadman
draws or whatever
because of those can be used why the
[ __ ] would you use real child porn and
then thirdly you'd have to get a
committee together that would assess
which people you could even begin to
approach
for asking um whether or not you could
use previously produced child point of
them in the scenario there's a chance
that an ethics board would never even
clear that
and even if they did there's a chance
that not a single person you would talk
to would ever even be okay with that
so i mean like there's a million this is
like an abs this is like a hypothetical
that is like seven worlds removed from
what exists right now
there's another hypothetical and
somebody brought it up in chat and they
said
just shooting pedophiles would probably
cut down on child rape but would you
argue for that
generally not just killing groups of
people is not usually something i'm okay
with no
i mean it would it would definitely
lower the rates of child rape though
right
yeah i mean it would but so would
killing all men
i i don't know if that's like a good
like that would reduce actually the
majority of violent crime around the
world is if we just killed all men
but i'm not really comfortable with that
so pedophiles who have offended you
can't kill them but you know somebody
who has uh
who might be a nazi you can just punch
them on the face in the face on the
street
so the difference there is that if
somebody's in jail they don't represent
a threat to you but if somebody's out of
jail they could represent a threat to
you
right so for instance
i mean if you're i mean if you're not
offending then you're not offending i
don't give a [ __ ] if you don't offend
right
as a utilitarian right i'm looking for
people that cause negative outcomes on
society you don't actually see that just
believes in nazism but doesn't actually
you know deport any
black people i mean if he doesn't vote
at all or he doesn't tell other people
that he wants to deport people then sure
i'm fine
the same way if you're like i guess if
you're like a secret pedo in your head
or whatever if you just jerk it to
lollycon all day and you don't tell your
friends how cool like lollycon or
pedophilia is and yeah i guess fine
whatever
if you want to keep [ __ ] to yourself and
your own head then that's whatever but i
imagine you as an ancap you have to be
on the same page with me as that right
you can't seriously think you should
legislate the thoughts that people have
no i i don't believe that i don't know
okay so if somebody has a thought in
their head and they never act on it or
never share it with someone how could
you ever possibly make something like
that illegal or hurt somebody for that
i that's that's not what i'm advocating
for i was just drawing the parallel that
you know what it
you know if somebody's a nazi but
they're not like
you know going out and killing black
people because they're black then
what gives you the you know jurisdiction
to just punch them
well i mean if there's somebody that can
cause direct harm to somebody that has
the proclivity to do so like they're
going out and voting they've
demonstrated that they will
i think that you could morally justify
violence against those people if there's
somebody that's like actively seeking to
harm people that's actively seeking to
harm children or abuse children i think
you could justify violence against that
person as well sure
yeah so that you know that would be a
pedophile who's like
viewing child pornography and that sort
of thing i mean i don't know if all
pedophiles are offending aren't
the majority of them non-offending i i
would have to look at the date on that i
don't know i'm not 100
sure on that well i was saying a a
pedophile that
was looking at uh child pornography and
you would have to look at the data about
that sure
yeah i don't know i don't look up
pedophile [ __ ] all the time i've
literally had one big argument on this i
don't know why everybody that talks to
me wants to talk about it
okay all right let me let me go through
these uh ear juice says thought i would
drop
past uh fast pass for today have a good
one at
everyone then he says hashtag gun wave
wizard said destiny you're a bad faith
actor laughing my [ __ ] ass off
uh or lmfao uh toya says the platforming
is for cowards who can't defend their
views imagine being
a debater who has to get rid of your
opponent to win just source
facts my dude internet tabs well the
problem with like
the problem with that argument isn't
like um so if you look at the way like
crypto people kind of like operate they
always operate in bad faith but they try
to take advantage of the
of the niceties of society um so like
somebody that is like you know hiding
their power level
is always going to thrive because there
are people that are like the centrists
or people like safa i guess
that will defend these people and go
like well hold on you don't truly know
that he's a nazi because they're hoping
that somebody like that is going to give
is massively giving them the benefit of
the doubt
so it can be really hard to attack these
people publicly because then you always
have the appearance of being an
extremist even though somebody could be
pretty blatant about it
because people in the center will always
defend these people this is why for
instance lefties hate liberals i'm using
liberal in like the broad like
liberalism sense
the reason why people on the left hate
liberals it's because when push come to
sub
shove they'll say that well liberals are
always going to side with the fascists
over the lefties because it defends
their
you know entrenched position in society
and whatnot and i think there are really
strong arguments to be made there
because that seems to be what always
[ __ ] happens
is that liberals are really quick to
jump up and defend you know fascists
because they think well they're not
actually doing things that are that bad
look at people like dave rubin or tim
poole or whatever you know sorry ago
okay uh internet tab says destiny is
still
seething about inductive reasoning after
being called out about it
in one debate you could quick response
to that if you want if i don't know how
it's been called out on inductive
reasoning but okay
okay dixie norma says destiny is
implying he's right but he isn't that's
why this is dangerous
e.m du bois says free speech is
important because ideas we accept is
true today like physics
where once punishable speech and must be
protected alan woke says destiny why are
you gay
all right because men are sexy i watch
too much game of thrones i guess [ __ ]
that must be where the incest comes from
too [ __ ] me huh says
how many times is he going to say bad
faith actors he's like a middle schooler
that just discovered the word [ __ ] and
has to say it 35 times a day
um how many times have i only said bad
faith actor like four or five times this
conversation i don't know you said it a
few times i'd say 10.
oh okay 10 sure i mean i mean we're
talking about deep platforming like
these are the types of people i would
stick to d platform so but okay
uh dad says miscegenation causes
demonstrable harm it is promoted heavily
destiny opposes this
that makes him a racist d platform him
wait what causes muscle harm
misogynistic what miscegenation what is
what the [ __ ] is that
miscegenation is race mixing basically
okay and that says
destiny dog whistles are you just
catching on define anti-semitism maybe
have a chat with owen benjamin i don't
actually like this
that would be really hilarious and i
hope you did talk to him and i hope i
get to watch it
toya says forget this debate destiny
let's go carpetball mexico and hand out

armchair warrior says you can't use the

need to go
synac8 says everyone's trying to conquer
and kill each other the indians lost the
war you can't bring up that issue to
modern times when no one
currently is responsible that was a
little
a little there uh eric wait wait wait
wait wait wait what was that again can
you say it one more time i'm sorry
they said everyone was trying to conquer
and kill each other the indians lost the
war you can't bring up that issue to
modern times when no one currently is
responsible
currently alive i guess um okay
i mean native americans are still alive
but sure but okay eric harrison says the
supreme court absolutely did not approve
daca at all in fact the supreme court
shot down the adult version of it so why
would they approve the version for
miners
i mean they've declined to comment on it
for i mean how many years they
haven't but they didn't approve it
that's two different yeah
okay i guess yeah okay i'll say they
haven't approved it but they haven't
like shot it down either they've been
playing they've declined to um
the last that i heard i think in january
of this year they declined to uh take it
out as a case
so no they declined to take it above uh
the appeals like they just they decline
to take it out of or
has to go up the appeals process okay
uh yeah they do that sometimes uh they
send it back down and let it go all the
way through uh internet tab says noam
chomsky also said which side would win
dip
uh armchair he also said he said noam
chomsky which i might start calling him
chomsky
uh isn't gator chomsky all right uh
armchair warrior says white left doesn't
realize they're in power the right
is on the fringe so the right should
have more rights according to destiny
uh elrond humperding says destiny that's
like a really common like narrative that
like because people on the right like to
victimize themselves a lot but i mean
most governors in the u.s are white both
halves of congress were
um not white i'm sorry most governors
are republican they're probably white
too
um both house of congress were
republican the president is republican
um i mean like the largest news network
right now on cable tv is republican
i mean this idea that like republicans
have no representation anywhere has
always been like
you know like on one hand republicans
want to snowflake and say oh we're not
represented anywhere but then on the
other hand they want to say well this is
the real map of
the trump versus hillary election and
then they show the map where like 99 of
like the land mass of the us is
republican
so i don't really know which it seems
like they just like kind of take on
whatever side depending on what they
want to complain about at any given time
well you could say if you minimized it
you could say that i
should be with your logic i should be a
protected class at my school because i
am a
um ideological minority
um if you actually face like real harms
related to that then
yeah although i'm no i'm still not
comfortable using that in regards to
like an ideology like a political tag
if we were talking about something like
an ethnic thing or like your gender or
like your sexual status or like your
religion i'd be more keen to that with
religion being the most
that i could be argued against there um
but for political ideologies i mean like
that's something that is much easier to
step away from than like
being a woman or being black or having
like a culture of a certain religion
well i don't think you can uh step away
from that at all but
your religion is still a choice just as
much as
ideology okay i mean i would i would
argue that your political ideology is
baked in from your own personal identity
maybe but it's generally a lot easier to
change your mind on a political ideology
than it is on on any of the other things
listed on your race on your religion
is it though because we just we just
talked about how uh religion
wasn't really a choice i would say that
the same goes to a political ideology do
you think that you could
ever like change your ideology to
support a uh
more right-wing candidate i mean you
could yeah
one it's a lot easier to keep it asking
you
when you say can like do you mean like
would i have my job or would i
personally ever make that decision or
would i lose my friends like what do you
mean in relation to what
do you personally believe that you could
change the way that you think in
the way that you think politically yeah
i think so okay
if you i mean if you go back and you
watch videos of me eight years ago i was
like a hard leaning libertarian like
anti-sjw gamergate bro
like literally like five or six years
ago so yeah i think you can change
all right um i'm gonna read through all
these i swear i'll read through every
super chat but i'm gonna take a couple
calls
um and if somebody wants to interject
oh and then also real quick also there
was the other important qualifier there
that like if you're causing a
demonstrable harm to people as
a result of any of your classes as well
i think that's a lot less defensible too
so for instance let's say that you're
islamic
but let's say that means that you have
to treat women in a derogatory manner i
don't think that should be protected
because you're infringing on other
people's rights as well all right sorry
i just want to bring that
that's so good you want to say something
so
well i just wanted to agree with that
that's why i feel like
you know they should it is something
that should be able to be attacked like
you know the the islamic law is
completely absurd
okay uh let's take a few oh wait i have
to turn him down
a little bit don't i okay uh
okay bulk bug and you're on the air uh
real quick you want to interject
oh am i on yeah i just want to say
bonehead bottle all his arguments are
based on
hypothetical situations that he pulls
out of his ass
where else would you get hypotheticals
from if not your ass i'm curious
all right um
by the way destiny do you want do you
want the uh discord link to possibly get
some of your own
viewers yeah that's fine i'm fine with
that too um no that's like i don't
i don't like circle drinks thinking okay
i love the i love the combat bring them
all in i'm not saying bad words and i
have to show them
some combat too though okay well look
um but one of the criticisms i've seen
people raise uh even in this stream
today in the chat and they said well wow
he's always using
hypothetical and to be sure you do use
hypotheticals a lot what would you say
to that
um hypotheticals are valuable because
they allow us to isolate what it is
we're talking about that's the important
part of a hypothetical
so for instance let's say that i wanted
to say like is um is is like
is sitting in a um oh [ __ ] i'm trying to
think of like why i would like a
situation where i would use a
hypothetical
um like if we think that like you should
take action against somebody because
they're threatening your existence right
like rather than say something like well
what about daca
where it's like okay well hold on is
daca there is part of u.s law
blah blah blah right these are all side
things that aren't really related to the
central question of do you have a right
to take action against somebody that
politically threatens your existence so
in that case i would invent a very
simple hypothetical let's say a group of
people was voting on legislation
to remove you from the neighborhood and
they were going to use the police to do
it is that right or wrong
right that's a really simple
hypothetical and now we could say well
hold on i agree or i disagree with it
and we've isolated the issue right there
if i try to bring it into a larger issue
like related to daca or related to white
nationalists well now it can get
sidetracked into a whole bunch of other
arguments they're not really related to
the central question like is this real
is this legal law is it an
executive order is it a law from
congress right that's why we use
hypotheticals generally
real quick hold up let me go let me take
let me take the college i'll let you
follow up
in a moment just just let me let me uh
scroll through real quick
uh atomic denny real quick you want to
interject
oh am i on yes oh hey guys
okay i had a question for uh destiny so
uh would it be i think we've all seen
ever everybody that listens is a fan of
the retort has seen uh these these
journalists these blue check marks on
twitter
advocating for a white genocide so
uh would it be okay for white people
to recognize these people on the streets
as individuals not as a group
and say well i feel threatened by their
existence i
i feel like they're threatening my
existence they're advocating for a
system
where i don't exist anymore would it
would those would it be justified to
attack
those blue checkmarks to those
journalists um
it depends on what you mean um oh sure
it depends on what you mean by
white genocide um if there are like
people that are unironically advocating
for this
um so like for instance in my community
i have a lot of [ __ ] lefties that
talk about killing capitalists i'm not
comfortable with that and i tell people
to [ __ ] off with that [ __ ] that larping
is like a [ __ ] lefty
um the thing is like a lot of the times
when people say like get
like get rid of the concept of whiteness
or white genocide or kill white identity
usually what they're talking about is
like getting rid of the concept of
whiteness so this is something that's
historically just been used to basically
exclude groups of people
like i've seen like for instance i'm
only saying this because i saw blaire
white tweet something where she was like
well look at this article saying we need
to get rid of white people
but when you actually read the article
what the person was saying well the
concept of white is very arbitrary and
it's only been used historically to
oppress people
maybe we should get rid of this concept
i don't think you should be able to
attack somebody because that's their
opinion on that
now if somebody is unironically saying
like we should kill all white people or
death to white people or some [ __ ] like
that
and they're like taking action to like
make that happen um
that that would be something i'd be
really uncomfortable with what do you
what do you mean by like getting rid of
the concept of whiteness
getting rid of like yeah what does that
exactly mean sure so somebody like
nicholas fuentes um made the argument to
me
that america was originally supposed to
be a white country but when we go back
and we look at what people meant when
they said white in the 1700s they didn't
mean white like
white like nicolas fuentes might be
right they mean white like anglo-saxon
not people that are uh germans or
spaniards or a lot of people that today
we were looking like oh that's a white
are like me right
i'm half cuban right but i'm white right
um so like historically it seems like
the concept of whiteness has just been
used to exclude groups of people
like we expanded the definition of white
to include um you know germanic peoples
and whatnot in early u.s history but
then we used that white thing to exclude
italians or irishmen
um and then later on we incorporated
italians and irishmen and we used to
exclude certain hispanic populations now
we include a lot of hispanic populations
so much so that somebody like nicolas
fuentes can be considered a white
nationalist
um but we don't include other people so
it just seems like the concept of
whiteness has just been used as this
like exclusionary thing
and some people say well maybe we should
get rid of that concept so
it should be completely abolished like
as if it has
no um use
um well i mean it has a use but just
that we more
less than it should be abolished because
i mean like obviously being white or
white
related things i mean are real in
society but more like recognizing the
idea that whiteness is a concept is
something that like
what it's been historically used for and
what it kind of leads to when you when
you like cherish white identity or
something
can i ask you a question follow-up
question to that destiny is there
any other way wait your mic is cutting
out you said can i ask you a follow-up
question destiny and then
yeah is there um is there any other
racial or ethnic group that can be
described deconstructed like that
other than white um deconstructed in
what way
just the way that you said like picked
apart well technically historically
uh this one wasn't even though it kind
of was or this one wasn't or when it
kind of was
can you think of any other ethnic group
that you're allowed to uh deconstruct
like that i'm not gonna lie
my history is so [ __ ] bad i i'm sure
there are examples historically but i
personally can't
think of it um yeah i don't know i mean
yeah racial identities can be really
complicated i don't know no i'm asking
is there any that you would be allowed
to in polite society to deconstruct like
that um
i'm having a hard time can you give me
an example i'm not trying to trap you
but if you were trying to like uh
deconstruct black identity or asian i'd
yeah what about it like could you say
that like asian identities been like
exclusionary or something by calling
certain people
um it's possible but i'm just like i'm
so not
i don't know the history of the regents
enough that people could be
discriminatory based on like identity or
something
um i i don't know enough i can't say
all right all right let's let's take
another caller um
cheesehead69 you're on the air on the
ralph retort uh you have anything you
want to interject into this debate
good evening ladies and gentlemen we are
talking about
all right i don't want to get into like
another like 20 hour [ __ ]
conversation hit me up with a question
what do you got
debating 14 year olds yeah i mean if i
don't then i'm
accused of running away from do i want
to be accused of running away from 14
year olds or debating them what's the
worst one no you're right you're right
no you're right you're always right dude
you're always right thanks i try to be
that's what i build my brand on it's
just i'm pretty not obfuscating i mean
but okay logic is what you are governed
by for example
do you disavow child pornography well
i'd have to see the data
well i'd have to take a look at a study
i'd have to get some uh
some kind of lab coat well we can't all
take our moral truths from god so yeah i
would have to actually analyze
things and think about them i don't just
read the bible for my moral truths
if you're able to do that and you're
satisfied with those answers that's fine
but for me personally morality what do
you mean from epistemology to normative
ethics and then you derive and then you
go apply to ethics from there where do
you derive your morality if not from god
from what authority we use a combination
of opera reasoning and then you select
whichever philosopher you feel like most
directly aligns with your personal views
on how morality should be determined
you have no moral authority you don't
know that morality is even real
i know it's just i know it's as real as
you do when you arbitrarily choose which
holy book you're going to draw your
morals out of that's
probably why you like uh you know you
endorse child porn
i don't really endorse child porn
although i will i it's very hard not to
comment on the irony here of a catholic
talking to me about the evils of child
porn
when not only the catholic institution
has been involved in the abuse of
numerous children it's also been
revealed that the highest levels of
catholic leadership have defended
the actual molestation and rape of so
many little boys so it's very
interesting that as a catholic you come
to me pretending you have moral
authority when those scandals have
ravaged the catholic church
throughout its entire history nick yeah
except the difference is the catholics
believe that pedophiles go to hell we're
against child porn unlike you
do you think all those little kids that
were being raped and confessionals cared
that those priests were going to hell
nick
there are bad people everywhere i like
the pivot on the question there nick can
you actually make it can you make him
answer a question or ask a question i
don't want to sit here and play games
with nick all night
i went to catholic school for 12 years i
don't want this guy that barely knows
his own religion to sit here and try to
[ __ ] doctor me on it okay i don't
need to listen to this that comes from
god which says
please make him all right let me know
when he's done okay let me know he's got
a question
[Laughter]
oh man dude if a catholic wants to come
out and talk about [ __ ] child rape
that's
that's like that's the easiest game i've
ever had in my entire life
it's the easiest game i've ever had in
my entire life
i'll wait for him to finish his diatribe
and then we'll and then we'll come back
i'm waiting for a message from ralph
i also love the i love the pivots on the
questions
feels so good see like in a 101 format
right it's very easy to hammer somebody
down when they're like if they don't
answer a question
if they are trying to divert into
another topic if they want won't engage
with you
or if they won't ask a specific question
right it's very easy i think i think
to now somebody like him down he's so
[ __ ] dishonest he's so slippery
we have our snake gloves on though
i see them talking right now i'm not
sure what they're talking about just
waiting for a message from ralph
go back in no i'll wait for them to
finish i'm not gonna let her
sit and [ __ ] let nick sit and like
preach his random [ __ ] catholic
[ __ ] to my [ __ ] audience is
[ __ ] stupid as [ __ ]
i like i said like i went to catholics
for 12 years i don't need a [ __ ] 22
year old guy to give me his
interpretation of [ __ ] scripture i'm
good on that
he's defending his racist [ __ ] now and
talking about your cp stuff you might be
there to counter it counter to the
killstream audience
i mean i think i already made herself
look bad enough i don't know how many
viewers they have i'm guessing it's
probably less than mine
um i'm good on that wait what is a wait
i would ask for a link to your stream
but i don't actually
want you guys to link it because i don't
want
wait how many viewers do they have 2500
yeah if i go i'm okay
they can do their thing for a little bit
getting into that uh i think nick does
have a question oh boy okay what is it i
really have a question i just
i just want to inform everybody i just
want to inform everybody
this is what he does it's like soliloquy
nick over here he comes on he gives his
little diatribe and then he pieces out
you didn't
respond to her engage with any of the
points someone else brings up i admire
it
yourself you're a very powerful i mean i
might as well be muted you don't respond
anything i say anyway right like i mean
at the end of the day it's the same
thing
you're very very i'll give you one
compliment your rhetoric is very
powerful you're very effective at what
you do i mean i
i admire it you you do do it well and
you want to know how i know that because
the final results are in from the train
wrecks tv poll
team right pulls ahead with 56 percent
of the vote
over team left so i just want to say hey
man that's amazing well you know what
they say man
if there is one way to determine moral
truth it's definitely internet polls
that get linked unfortunately
we all know nick the knife the king of
blood sports
it would have been so funny to see your
interpretation of the poll afterwards if
i would have spammed it to all of my
[ __ ] uh well you know those triggered
lefties linking it all to those lefty
communities
you sounded so calm earlier and then i
got in here and you like laughs
yeah cause you're funny as [ __ ] dude man
i have a wonderful time when you're here
it's very enjoyable for me to have you
in a one-on-one environment
how can i not how can i not laugh when a
catholic comes in here to talk about the
evils of molesting children like that's
one of the funniest [ __ ] topics in
the world my dude
yeah it's funny when you talk about
morality and you talk about child
pornography being okay
almost as funny almost as funny that
thinks that they have good views on
morality when they subscribe to
biological prescriptivism nick oh my god
imagine unironically taking naturalistic
arguments for how humans ought to act in
society and thinking you can actually
have intelligent conversations about
morality while also conceding that all
of it come from a [ __ ] book that's a
[ __ ] good one to me slippery nick
you're right you're right you derive
your morality from so-called
epistemology that's a lot more sound
than deriving it from a non-human
third-party source
non-human third-party that's a real
fancy way of saying a spooky [ __ ]
alien that judges you for masturbating
nick
i mean if that's what you want i to go
with
dude daddy this is really advanced
argumentation man but
anyway i just wanted to say man uh tough
loss tough loss maybe he'll get him next
you really think you lost that i thought
you did pretty good you're being really
hard on yourself
tough loss for you mr uh what is it 44.
oh on the internet pulp nah it's okay i
know it was linked around pull a lot i'm
not really too bothered by it but
thanks i heard you got 300 subs
yesterday though good job dude you're on
the road to 25k
i'm actually i'm holding out for you i'm
celebrating i hope your breakup with
allsup wasn't too hard
i know that when he left you actually
wait a second does that bother you
doesn't also have like a quarter million
views on youtube now is that does that
keep you up at night
oh what keeps me up at night is 56 of
the polls baby 434
000.
maybe you shouldn't have maybe you
shouldn't have burned that bridge nick
holy [ __ ]
i thought you were like a little bit
more politically effective that's really
sad well i hope that you guys make up in
the future maybe it'll help you boost
your channel
we already did makeup i had them on my
show a couple of months ago
oh [ __ ] you should try to get some help
from him so you could be a little bit
more of a relevant voice on the internet
rather than like the last like
hour call-in the desperation move like
when everybody else backed out like
reddit community yeah no you're right
you're a very relevant person when it
comes to like well i'm relevant enough
for you to tweet about me all day long
and then show up on random internet
shows to shout at me about catholic
theology
because because you're calling for
violence you spent the whole debate this
time talking about me on the ralph
retort
talking about me talking about you why
do you think i came on people are dming
me
apparently this tiny little guy is
saying that violin should be visible
people are damning
all this other stuff yeah all 150 nick
fuentes fans or however
they must be real allegiant i don't need
to see your dm that's kind of weird no i
don't need you slipping in my dm snake
i don't know what kind of i don't know
what kind of weird catholic [ __ ] you've
got going i don't know if you're gonna
try to milo yiannopoulos me on [ __ ]
dmz or some [ __ ] pedophile guy keeps
saying that like
somebody should hit you or something
talking really tough after you kind of
got like hold on
that's not fair nick you can't call me a
pedophile i didn't take my holy orders i
haven't been a priest i don't molest
children i got out of catholicism ten
years ago my dude i'm very against
molesting children extrapolated it from
what she said earlier
extrapolation yeah you're right i think
you're a pedophile so
well i mean that's are you like are you
like underage are you trying to get your
hopes up are you trying to like signal
me some [ __ ] or like are you
are you bi i just think you're a
pedophile okay well i'm glad your
thoughts are important to me i will
cherish them and keep them in mind
uh when i check your twitter all
tomorrow and you're still tweeting about
me i'm sure i'll remember you so
yeah okay you're a pedophile okay and
you're a catholic it's actually a worse
insult
because it includes the pedophy and then
a whole bunch of other dumb [ __ ] but
yeah
catholics believe people like you are
going to hell that's the difference
between you and
yeah and they also rape little boys and
confessionals so i'm okay with being
judged by catholics rapists
what you can't say all catholics are
people no but the institution of the
catholic church did defend the
molestation of little boys it's been
huge scandals sweeping the entire united
states
yeah yeah but you you can't make a
a huge sweeping generalizations like
generalization like that you said you're
generally against something like that
true you know what so you're right not
all catholics are rapists you got me
there
it's uh it's all it's all
inconsistencies
all in concern oh remember when i asked
you what was inconsistent about my
arguments last night
and you went completely silent i don't
think that happened actually no you're
right because you just keep on talking
and talking to talking but you never do
respond to my questions but that's what
i like about you nick you're real
slippery
um you accused me of being really
inconsistent arguments and then when i
asked you what kind of inconsistent
arguments i'd platformed you
i don't recall you asking that question
but i could oh you could check the vod
maybe i'm sure you don't you have it up
on like your tv
i'm sure you seem like the kind of guy
that gets off to watching videos
consistencies if you'd like me to answer
it no i'm good you already said you
didn't have any questions for me so
[Laughter]
uh you're fun destiny thanks i try to be
all right ralph who do we got who's next
oh real quick though i do have a
question for nick specifically because
there was one part
saw that didn't really get expounded
upon uh one of the things in your
opening statements was that you uh
stated that many people in online
right-wing groups generally have a low
tolerance for
talk of uh enacting physical violence um
what do you think about destiny being
uncomfortable with it but
seeming to tolerate that in his own
circles at least
actionable violence well yeah talk about
inconsistencies
you know the guy the other day we went
on this big debate for i don't know how
long the other day on train wrecks
and what was the debate about it was
whether or not there was something
intrinsic
to right-wing ideology about violence
and if you watch my show every night
not only do we not advocate for violence
we actually explicitly
advocate against violence every night
and after the christ church shooting
i said and then it's like every night i
say no violence we're trying to vote
we're trying to
get involved in political campaigns and
things like that so it's just hilarious
to me that destiny
and hassan try to make this case that oh
the right wing is inherently
we can extrapolate we can always the
logical conclusion
in my opinion of this ideology is
violence and therefore the solution is d
platforming and what does he come on
here today and say he says that
well people are doing harm and we can
say that nick fuentes is a neo-nazi and
therefore
we should have violence against him i'd
be fine with that i think that's a good
thing whatever
so talk about inconsistencies you know
and he doesn't want me to answer that
because he knows i'm going to bring it
up that's why he tries to
talk about slippery tracks sure so
there's nothing to answer here so first
of all this idea that
it's a i guess it's really plays well to
the audience to pretend that you're
against all violence is like a really
stupid position nobody ironically or
unironically defends this position
obviously there are forms of violence
that can be justified
um all of us in here probably for
example against pedophiles
sure um yeah for offending peno files
yeah sure we enact violence against them
by either locking them in prison or um
killing them right but
execution or whatever so yeah we agree
with that we agree that we can take
defensive measures generally everyone in
here probably agrees with the concept of
self-defense
um i'm merely expanding that to a
political realm if you feel like your
existence is threatened in the united
states then there are people that
definitely feel like they can take
defensive actions against it
um i don't think there's anything
necessarily wrong with that if you can
justify your position morally then it is
what it is
yeah but the problem with that is again
anybody can justify their own violence
i'm sure the crisis well then i guess
it's up to us to try to platform good
violence
yeah and i agree and that's you know
what i agree with you nick
i agree no it doesn't fall apart at all
but the difference is i feel like i can
justify mine
i can justify mine from a secular
framework so i feel like i can argue it
to other people that's the difference
between me and eunick if i want to argue
against somebody whether i think some
form of violence should be good or bad
i can do it from a pretty foundational
level without having to invoke any
spooky spirits that live in the sky and
watch me when i sleep whereas for me to
have any conversation with you about
morality or any sort of moral decisions
i have to buy into the concept of your
judeo-christian god to do it
specifically the catholic like version
of him
yeah that's obviously misdirection
you're getting away from the point i'm
sorry so your original point was whether
or not i could argue
um whether or not like how i can justify
violence that's the original point
and it's not misdirection it's directly
the central part of your point nick
your justifications all come from god
mine don't you know your argument is
wrong and that's why you're missing my
argument's not wait i'm sorry are you
telling me your arguments don't come
from god nick
i think you're misdirecting completely
how am i miss directing we're talking
about i'll tell you exactly why you say
i don't answer your questions no go
ahead and tell me how am i miss
directing nick
i'll tell you if you stop interrupting
me okay go ahead and tell me
thank you pedophile so the inconsistency
the inconsistency which i was talking
about is the fact that you say that
well technically hold on you told me you
were going to tell me how i was
misdirecting
wait wait you told me i was going to
talk about misdirecting nick why are you
talking about inconsistencies now hold
on
can you tell me how i was misdirecting
yeah yeah i'm about to okay
tell me how i miss directing please
thank you pedophile
okay go ahead book your next one okay
can you stop interrupting so i can sure
thing
thank you thanks see soph got to give it
to self she's really
here i can't wait for you to tell me how
i was misdirecting the conversation nick
okay pedophile i'm trying to get to it
if you stop interrupting me
again the misdirection comes from this i
point out if we're talking about the
original claim and where the
misdirection occurs
the claim is about the inconsistency
about violence so i'm telling you that
when you say that
everybody who thinks that they're
defending themselves is justified in
using violence
whether that's um people fighting nazis
or other people fighting other people
it's uh justified and we justify
violence all the time and whatever which
is obviously inconsistent if what you
were talking about yesterday
was that christchurch is this big
problem we have to de-platform those
people
so clearly that kind of violence cannot
be justified but just you say that
all kinds of other violence can be
justified based on self-defense and then
you
take this weird misdirection where you
start talking again about
you know morality with us which is a
whole other subject then we're talking
about
judeo-christian gods wait i'm sorry do
you think that morality isn't tied into
whether or not you can defend yourself
you don't think that morality is
involved in talking about self-defense
of course it's a broad subject okay wait
so are you telling me that there are
hold on let me respond to the original
point before you can i please respond
oh you're still going how about we take
this point by point nick are you scared
of going through your points one at a
time
i mean like you brought up enough there
to chat about we could talk about it
without you diatribing for 15 minutes
it's like you can't help interrupting
you can't help like well because usually
when i have discussions about arguments
i really like to go through point by
point instead of letting you say
55 million different things
yeah how about we talk about like the
point that you just brought up do you
think that all forms of violence are
identical or do you think that there are
different forms of violence they can
have different justifications
of course of course then what do you
disagree with about me why are you
saying
he says some forms of violence can be
justified while other forms of violence
can't be just right well of course i say
that that's only
reasonable to literally any person that
has any understanding about forms of
violence and you just admit it to
yourself so why would you attack me over
that that seems mighty inconsistent
that's a total obfuscation i'm sorry how
am i obfuscating
i'll tell you i'm about to tell if
you're okay
i mean i'm not a pedophile let me put it
this way there aren't any videos of me
being a pedophile there are videos of
you eating boogers nick so
for you to tell you mr pedophile okay go
ahead and tell me
so yeah so you say that well uh if i
perceive that nazis are going to visit
violence upon somebody else if i
perceive that a nazi is a threat to
somebody
well i can have violence against them so
again we're talking about standards here
you're talking about a non-state person
using violence against civilians you
know whether you
whatever you want to call it somebody
who has uh
ideas about demographics or fertility
rates this is a civilian person so
you're saying
i can act unilaterally against civilians
using violence preemptively if i feel
threatened
so i'm sorry are you saying that you
can't do that that in principle that in
principle is no different
than what white nationalist violence is
well except hold on
they are preempting some kind of harm
being visited upon them by immigration
then in principle there's no difference
and that's the inconsistency well sure
so the actual like
defense itself is not different but your
justifications for whether these people
are going to enact harm on you
is um this idea like you use a lot of
words that even you don't agree with
you're saying well this is horrible that
a non-state actor civilian can
unilaterally enact violence preemptively
against another person
if you're in your house and you have a
gun and you see somebody about to break
in and kill you
of course you would take violence
against them and guess what you're a
non-state actor
an acting violence against a civilian
unilaterally i mean it's the exact same
content how is it i literally just used
every single adjective that you used to
describe something that was yeah sure go
ahead and tell me go ahead
getting very angry i'm not angry at all
nick this is fun for me it's so much
easier to have you here all to myself
ah it's this is so much more
entertaining go ahead and tell me
please tell me please i it is very scary
to be in a one-on-one conversation where
i don't have to wrestle with sargon of
[ __ ] cod
go ahead and tell me how it's
disingenuous i'm going to it's
disingenuous because of course when
you're talking about somebody with
political violence who doesn't advocate
um violence or anything like that you're
talking about so-called nazis
uh you're saying that somebody should
commit violence against me and you said
that earlier
when i'm over here in my home not
bothering anybody you compare that to a
burglar who trespasses into your
property
breaking the law presenting immediate
harm to you no i didn't actually compare
it
i just said that you could justify forms
of violence where you have a
non-state actor who is enacting violence
unilaterally against another civilian
that's all i said i didn't necessarily
say the same thing
now i do believe that violence against
people like you could be justified
because you use a public platform to
spread a message that would lead to
violence against other people i think
that again could you say that part again
about violence being justified against
me i just want to get that for the clip
oh sure so i think that violence can be
justified against people like nicolas
fuentes who use their public platform to
advocate for violence against other
groups of people or
to advocate when do i use my platform to
advocate sure when you advocate ideas
related to like uh the jewish question
or advocate ideas related to race
realism yeah how is that direct advocacy
what do i say about that
i mean it's not direct advocacy and that
you're telling somebody to walk out with
a gun and go and kill somebody but i
mean there's a pretty
clear line between people taking on like
neo-nazi-esque beliefs and then trying
to excise people from their country this
is a neo-nazi-esque
sure how about the idea that white
people and white culture is something
that needs to be defended against other
foreign invaders like muslims that
should be shot up in their mosques like
the guy in new zealand did i think that
people like that are pretty demonstrably
coming from
the types of ideology that people like
you spread i think that's a pretty easy
connection
i don't think it's uh you don't think
it's factual the demographic change is
occurring
you disagree yeah sure demographic
changes have occurred all throughout
human history
yeah of course no no but that's not the
question you don't agree that
demographic change is occurring in
western europe
yeah demographic changes occurring
everywhere yeah of course okay so that's
a neo-nazis belief right
except i don't use that to dog whistle
for why these people should be removed
from any platform
i mean wait hold on nick how can you
simultaneously attack people on the left
we're saying diversity is our greatest
strength and then saying well hold on so
you admit that diversity is happening
that's not very consistent of you bigger
nick
well you're telling me that a nazi-esque
belief is the idea that white culture
must be
defended against invaders but you
yourself agree that white culture and
white people are being displaced so i'm
failing to see the distinction between
well the distinction is i don't
necessarily think a demographic change
is an inherent evil
i don't think that demographic change is
something that requires violent action
to
prevent because demographic change never
said that i've never said that
explicitly you're pretty sneaky nick but
don't worry
don't worry nick i watch your stuff i
want your stuff a little bit closer than
that but i mean you're playing well to
the audience
you're playing well to the audience nick
you're very slippery very
when have i ever implicitly advocated
for violence um i mean i would say that
calling into question the legitimacy of
the holocaust or
talking about how uh maybe black people
are more prone biologically to crime and
should be removed from society i would
say these types of things how does one
follow from the other i don't understand
how one follows from the other fight
how does trying to delegitimize the idea
that the holocaust actually happened in
an effort to get people to be more
critical of how jewish people are trying
to subvert western culture in order to
destroy white men
something that's so extreme that it
might actually call a person to violence
against these very types of people i
don't know nick i'm not sure
we could spend a youtube video exploring
it later maybe i could even have you on
as a guest later
we could talk about it i think that's
called begging the question begging
what is begging the question mean it
means that what you're doing is you're
you're sort of instituting your own
assumption
about uh about where you think that can
go rather than it's rather inductive
rather than deductive because what i'm
saying is not
when well i mean we can't we can't speak
deductively about any of this of course
we can only speak inductively about this
i mean i've never denied the holocaust
that's never happened oh no of course
not you never denied it out right you
only deny the accuracy of the reporting
you're very slippery and how you do it
don't worry nick i see how you do it i
totally believe everything that they say
about that absolutely everything
wow absolutely everything every part of
it though that's crazy
machines to roller coasters i walk
outside and i look over my neighbor's
house where they say they're baking
thousands of cookies and i don't see any
smoke coming out of her chimney nick i'm
not sure i wonder sometimes
well hey i'm a big fan of chocolate chip
cookies you know but i'm not really i
it's because it seems like when i watch
your stream all day you hate chocolate
chip cookies so i have a really hard
time telling that sometimes
one of my favorites one of my favorites
some of my some of my favorite foods uh
happen to be chocolate chip cookies
so i have actually never denied the
holocaust but in any case
you know let's say let's take a look at
what it is for itself
questioning the validity of certain
historical events to me does not seem
like a violent
action in itself i mean we could say
that the american revolution
was that truly a revolution or was that
a war of independence or
you know how could we classify it uh we
could look at a lot of historical events
and hypothesize about
numbers or qualitative things but i
don't understand how that in itself
makes it violence and that's that's what
you're feeling
well of course well of course i'm not
gonna be able to prove that to you yeah
sure i'm not gonna be able to prove that
too in a single conversation this is a
this is something that calls for a lot
more noise i mean i feel really dumb
because i'm explaining this to you but
i know that you know it and i know that
you play to the audience really well but
it's kind of like the same thing
regarding like race realism right if a
scientist wanted to talk to me about the
nature of intelligence does intelligence
come from genetics so it doesn't come
from environment um this is a very
interesting question
and it's not inherently bad now when the
totality of somebody's platform
is them advocating the destruction or
the removal of black people from the
united states and then they want to talk
about that question
it seems a little bit leading to me that
these are the types it's peculiar that
these are the types of questions they
seem to be most most keen on
investigating
there is a whole dearth of history that
you could explore but you seem to be
very fixated on the holocaust
and i kind of wonder why is somebody
more interested in this particular piece
of his history
that also happens to go along with the
narrative that they're pushing about
removing jewish influence from society
really makes me wonder why that's the
type of stuff you want to talk about
nick i'm not obsessed with the holocaust
i have 360 episodes of america first i
probably talked about that like
five times five times i don't know
interesting more than i've talked about
it's more than i've talked about
doubting the official records of the
holocaust but hey you know to each their
own i guess
i've talked about i've talked about the
great tragedy and how we have to improve
and always remember and learn from it
but in any case i don't know where
you're learning what to do a better job
next time nick what do you have to learn
some things in there you talk about
slipping things in there what did you
say about
like the destruction of black people
where are you getting that from you say
well
we can't talk about race and iq if our
platform is dedicated to talking about
the destruction removal of black people
where are you getting that from i don't
know nick you know i'm willing to bet
that if i go through all your videos
you're probably never going to
explicitly call for it huh but man
there's a sure is a lot of talk about
getting rid of violent demographics in
the united states that are contributing
to the destruction of
you know the western culture and leading
to ah yeah it's real fascinating sounds
like you don't have your evidence big
guy sounds like no it's just the
conversation is like a little bit more
complicated than what i could fit into
like a five minute you know soliloquy
for my stream chat
i mean you've done a very good job i'll
actually be straight up with you for a
moment if i can okay sure straight up
you want me to move the stream i don't
want to expose your
inner [ __ ] thoughts right go ahead
that's really charming
okay straight in a straightforward way
because i'm not i i don't believe i'm a
disingenuous person
my my vision for the country and this is
what i've been saying on the show for a
long time and you admitted that
you know you don't comb through my show
you don't watch my show i've been saying
this for a long time
the demographic change in the in the
united states and all these countries
is baked in like it's inevitable um you
know these things are going to happen no
matter what by 2042
white people are going to be a minority
in the united states and this is
depending on
you know what numbers you use a lot of
people have varying estimates
but the message on my show has never
been and therefore we
have to remove people or we have to i
explicitly say how
not only would those things be
impractical they would be immoral the
entire show is about
if we can recognize that groups are
different and we can recognize that
groups are interacting with each other
on an unprecedented
level and scale with globalization we're
going to have to take into account
some of these facts and how we govern a
multi-racial country as opposed to how
we govern a monoracial country
i don't think you can have the same
constitution that was created to govern
this
agrarian colonial british protestant
country in 1776 sure
in indiana governing uh an empire from
coast to coast
with uh 13 blacks and 13 asian sure can
you give can you give me an example of
something that would have to change
there the difference between ruling over
a majority white population and a
diverse one i'm curious
i'm not sure i'm i'm frankly i'm not you
don't talk at any point in the 360
episodes of white america now you've
never talked about
how you think things would have to
change we're gonna have a more diverse
society versus an all-white one what do
you talk about every night
i've said i've said and this is one of
the solutions that people have offered
is perhaps you just have freedom of
association which says that
if you have different groups which have
different characteristics and different
values and different cultures and this
necessarily creates perhaps conflict or
friction
if you're able to have freedom of
association and you're able to have
perhaps blacks want to organize in their
own neighborhood and whites want to
organize in their own neighborhood
then voluntarily people could separate
themselves out and that's one solution
that's been proposed
so you'd be so you'd be interested in
like removing protected classes from the
united states the idea that an employer
or a building owner no no nothing like
that well wait then what are you saying
we already have free association in the
united states
how do we not we have integrated schools
and you
i'm sorry you could just move to another
way you can move to another neighborhood
and go to a different school or you can
send your kid to a private school can
you not
sure you can but you can't look at an
entire community and say that well this
community is going to be for this people
and we want to have a vision for this
community
oh wait so you're saying so you do want
to remove protected classes you want to
say you should be able to build a city
and say like no black people allowed you
want to be able to discriminate
able to associate with who you want to
associate hold on i don't know why you
can't just answer that question
do you think that you should be able to
build a city and discriminate against a
certain kind of people so like gay
people or black people from moving to
that city should you be able to do that
i think everybody should be able to
discriminate against everyone else okay
so then you are
in favor of removing protected classes
from the united states i don't know why
you answered that in such a slippery way
earlier
so what other so what other types of
things i don't know it was slippery
because earlier you said you didn't want
to remove protected classes but now that
i've pushed you a little bit on the
issue now you admit you do want to
remove protected classes you think that
a business owner should be able to say
you can't work here because you're black
because you're a woman what's next are
they going to come after the gamers next
nick like
i don't know where that slippery slope
ends like that sounds real scary to me
i said that about residential areas i
don't know about businesses oh so you
think that so okay so if somebody made
an all-white city where all whites can
work you think that a black person
should be able to go over there and try
to get a job and they should be allowed
to work in that city
sure why not and the white business
owner shouldn't be allowed to say you're
not allowed to work here just because
they're black
yeah i don't think there are um yeah
yeah probably
the what if all the people in that what
if all the people in that city were
opposed to that because they built their
beautiful white
nicholas fuentes white approved
neighborhood and now they've got black
people no mexicans driving over
commuting to work in it you don't think
that would impact the people of that
community a little bit
i don't know that's kind of um that's
kind of further down the line i don't
know
it's all directly related to protected
classes these are why protected classes
exist is to prevent these types of
cyclical things
here's the thing here's the bottom line
okay what's the bottom line nick
i'm going to tell you and this is why i
think you're being disingenuous okay
nick
i'm going to tell you i'm telling you
honestly i hope you uh take it to heart
i'm ready
no i hope you understand that i'm being
sincere here because this is something
that again
this is something i talk about on the
show every day i'm sure there are no
there are no easy answers to this
problem i agree with that
the show the show is about acknowledging
that we are going to face challenges
moving ahead with this demographic
change and unless we can talk about
the prob the potential challenges the
potential downsides of what's going to
happen
it is impossible to gauge what kind of a
solution there is for example if i even
posit
you know that we have freedom of
association and you're right i think
there are some um i think there are some
issues with that i don't think that's a
perfect solution and it might not even
work out legally
um but but even an example like that
where i say well here's a possible thing
that has been discussed among people
like jared taylor among others
immediately it's so you want to move you
want to create this all-white beautiful
neighborhood and exclude black people
and and do you see how quickly it jumps
to that and so
i mean that's literally what you just
told me wait what's your you literally
just said that you want to create
beautiful all-white neighborhoods that
are allowed to
discriminate against black people did i
say beautiful all white neighborhoods or
did i say people should be able to have
freedom of association i think you heard
beautiful all-white ethno-state
neighborhood that's not what i said
i said well of course not because we
have to be very careful with what we say
but realistically if we look at the
status of capital that exists in the
united states if we look where most of
the wealth and the money is we know who
are going to create these types of
neighborhoods it's not going to be black
people and mass that are going to be
moving out
to wealthy neighborhoods and creating
their own neighborhoods right it's going
to be like it's going to be white flight
right it's going to be
white people taking their money locking
themselves in their paper but i mean i
guess that's kind of what you would want
next
in chinese but that's the problem is you
you automatically assume the worst i'm
over here on
and you would know this if you watch my
show probably every day
and i feel like i'm missing out on some
real good [ __ ] but okay see very very
nasty i'm trying to be sincere with you
i'm trying to be straight with you here
oh man that's so
strange why would i be nasty if you call
me a pedophile multiple times it's so
interesting i'm not sure
that was it must be the inner liberal in
me i guess you're kind of jumping in the
middle of the story after you said
people should commit violence against
so i think that's a little bit unfair i
mean i think i said violence could be
justified
can we wait can we summarize this too
like i didn't want to spend the whole
night talking to boogerneck again right
i got other things to do
such a nasty guy so this is this is
again what i talk about on the show
which is
demographic change is going to cause
problems
you don't have to be a white nationalist
to believe that you may even still be in
favor of demographic change
in spite of the challenges that it
presents but the problem is that in
society
people who present these challenges or
acknowledge them or discuss them
they're shut out they're de-platformed
whatever and we're not going to be able
to address them in a coherent and
optimal way
if we're not able to discuss all the
kinds of problems and i think
this is the what the debate was about
the christchurch shooter if the solution
is always we're going to attack and
commit violence against the people
discussing the problem
well okay lots of luck man we'll see if
this multiracial
you know whatever empire works out in
the next 25 years when you've got
israelis and palestinians and hindus and
pakistanis and
all these different groups working
together fighting for the same resources
and services
hey lots of luck you know we tried to
say maybe we should
try and talk about solutions figure some
of these things these things i mean if
you've ever been to a major city in the
united states before there are a lot of
places where this work really well
um i acknowledge that there are
definitely problems yeah really yeah
believe it or not you could go to like
it works really well man i mean san
francisco seems to be working pretty
well los angeles works pretty well like
are you joking man are you joking about
san francisco or there's [ __ ] in the
streets and needles everywhere
they're doing stuff about this all the
time and los angeles holy [ __ ] wait so
if there are any problems that exist in
a city
damn well you must really [ __ ] hate
white people then because holy [ __ ] we
should have a [ __ ] ton of meth and [ __ ]
all over the [ __ ] midwest it's like a
huge problem do you see the moving the
goal post
i'm not moving the goal post i'm just
saying that no other person in the world
if you would say like do you think that
places like san francisco are like the
tech capital of the world are very
successful places you're like oh well no
of course not they've got problems with
homelessness what an absurd assertion
come on
of course san francisco i'm not moving
any goalposts whatsoever
i said that these cities are doing i'm
saying that i'm saying that
you can go to these cities i'm saying
that you can go to these cities
i'm saying that you can go to these all
the [ __ ] in the streets nick have you
been to san francisco
believe it or not there are plenty of
streets that you could go to that don't
have [ __ ] on them i know that might be
hard for you to believe maybe you don't
go into those places maybe there are too
many brown people there you don't feel
comfortable i'm not entirely sure but
for the most part these cities are
working pretty well do they have
problems
of course now does diversity does
diversity as a whole
have a lot of problems that have to be
overcome absolutely i totally
acknowledge that
no it's not because the difference
between me and you is that at the end of
the day i don't say
hey you know diversity has problems i'm
not really comfortable with interracial
couples being
shown in movies right my prescription is
generally more hey diversity does have
problems let's figure out ways where we
can all get along with each other so
that we can live in a wonderful world a
world that could be so great that even a
man with the last name fuentes could
delude himself into thinking he would
qualify
for the very white ethnostate that he
advocates for that's all i'm
i just said that's a lot of straw man's
there he never said that
uh he's against having interracial
relationships and movies he's just not
comfortable with that being some sort of
agenda being pushed
and weirdly intentional that's true okay
yeah
i do think it's very weird when i say
when i see interracial relationships and
it makes me uncomfortable i definitely
don't think about that for half a second
this is the problem is i say well i'm
not in favor of white ethnostate and
here's why and you say why
i'm sorry i qualified white ethno
neighborhood it's not ethno states i'm
sorry i didn't speak there ethno
neighborhoods
okay i'll say i'll say for example yeah
i have a problem with interracial
relationships being promoted and you're
like yeah
this guy's morally against interracial
relationships which i said explicitly i
wasn't it's just
it's just so much different so wait so
so on that clip that got leaked were you
compared having sex with a dog to have a
white woman having sex with a black man
you don't think that's a little
different
i didn't compare that you didn't say
both of them were forms of degeneracy
the context for that i'll give you okay
sure what is the context i'm curious
so we were at the leadership institute
this was like last year this like gay
conservative think tank and we're in
debate
there and uh we were having a
conversation we were talking about a lot
of issues and i was playing devil's
advocate on a few and in this particular
one i was arguing my sincere position
okay and um and so she starts recording
me obviously to do a hit piece it wasn't
like
this was part of some broader
conversation if you watch the clip
oh that is really [ __ ] up i do i do
feel free there i hate it when people
feel me and i accidentally compare
[ __ ] black people to [ __ ] dogs oh
[ __ ] i hate it
no no but she films me and she says hey
nick do you think having sex with a
black man
is the same as having sex with a dog so
you say i compared it
which is obviously disingenuous it's not
like i said these two things are
comparable somebody said
an outrageous question which then i said
absolutely not
i said i think both are probably wrong i
would say both are probably degenerate
but they're not the same and then that's
a five second clip that was like a 30
minute conversation
sure why i'm curious why would having
why would a white person having sex with
a black person be degenerate nick
i i think it's i think it's something
that's bad for the children to have a
mixed race ideology yeah
do you hold this against your own
parents a lot or you look at the data
and i know you're a big fan of the data
if you look at the data about mixed race
couples and it depends on which um
which different combinations you look at
you'll find all kinds of varieties of
higher rates of things like mental
illness drug abuse
dropping out of high school um there's a
lot of problems associated with this
also higher rates of divorce higher
rates of domestic abuse
again it varies depending on which
combinations you look at and i did a
whole show about this i did a show about
this called
what's the deal with uh mixed marriages
or something on america first
and i did a whole 60 minutes saying
laying out the data laying out the case
because my ideology has always been
centered around the family this is why
i'm not a neo-liberal individualist i
believe that
you got to have strong men you got to
have good women you got to have children
and the mayor just have to be strong and
healthy
and so i my only opposition interracial
relationships comes from the fact that
it is not
the most conducive pairing that you can
have to to have uh
children that are going to have the best
possible upbringing so i think
there's all kinds of things which people
should not um
if there's incompatibility that people
should not get married if people have
different religions if people have
different political ideologies it should
be based on compatibility before
anything else but
i don't know maybe what if it was
possible that a change in societal
attitudes towards interrelation
interracial relationships might change
the outcomes of these interracial
relationships do you think that might be
possible
no no i don't see how it follows you
don't see how so you think that
the status of interracial relationships
today in america would be looked down
upon the same way that they would
a hundred years ago oh i'm not saying
that i don't okay so then it sounds to
me like we could as a prescriptive
action for society
say hey we ought to be a little bit more
endearing towards interracial
relationships like the ones that produce
both you
and me booger nick maybe we should be a
little bit more kind to those and maybe
the outcomes will be better because as
you
argued earlier when we isolate and
demonize certain groups of people
sometimes they end up being shitty
people or bad outcomes are a result of
that
which i do agree with the problem with
that thinking pedophile steve the
problem with that thinking is that it
presupposes that all of these issues
derive from
discrimination prejudice bigotry could
it simply be
that interracial relationships don't
work because different races might not
just
they simply might not be compatible
because they come from different
cultures because
there is such a stark racial divide in
the country now you're right maybe in
100 years
when we're all cappuccino-colored and i
know uh you know none of that matters to
anybody right
in 100 years we're all cappuccino
colored we're deracinated we have no
heritage or ancestry
uh maybe you can say that if there even
is mixing we can say that these sorts of
racial
uh differences will be so small and so
mitigated that it won't cause issues
with compatibility but
as it stands right now and we live in
the present time we find that these
relationships don't work out
so i i would be hard-pressed to look at
a child who's a child of divorce
and the divorce could have been avoided
if you found a more compatible partner
and say well you know we were just
trying to change society man we were
just trying to
we had this prescriptive thing where we
were trying to make um racial attitudes
better
uh and now now your parents are divorced
and now your life is
well i mean there are plenty of
interracial relationships with the
parents aren't divorced there are plenty
of
uni-racial relationships of of of
heterogeneous relationships i don't know
how you say it same uh same race
relationships where the parents are
divorced so it seems to me that
interracial relationships
talking about rape are you talking about
rates though okay so yeah so the rates
are probably the rates might be worse
for interracial things but to go ahead
and jump on the train and say that's due
to some
biological or genetic incompatibility i
i don't think i said bile i think i said
cultural
did you hear what i said did i say a lot
if you said cultural what does that have
to do with race
you don't think race has a cultural
component you don't think black hole do
you think that koreans do you think that
koreans that are born
in la are more similar to people in
south korea or other white people in l.a
well it depends on who their parents are
were they raised by korean immigrants
because if that's the case and they come
from a different kind of a home
oh cool wait i agree with what you just
said so it has nothing to do with race
it has to do with how their parents
raised them okay cool we're on the same
page
which is part of culture which is part
of right has nothing to do with right no
you just said it had to do it had to do
with if their parents
raised them in a cultural way which i
agree with but this idea that a korean
is intrinsically like
geared towards being a certain way or
that an african is geared up i don't
think i said that
oh wait what are we just saying hold on
wait what do we disagree with you are
trying to extrapolate things which i'm
not even saying nick you literally said
you literally said that it would be
better maybe if certain races were
together with other races
now you're trying to back that up and
saying maybe it would be better if
certain cultures were better with
certain cultures
obviously i'm not going to this is
called a modern bailly right you're
doing you're doing the old bait and
switch on me slippery nick i really
appreciate it
it is because if you would simply have
said with your argument
people from two wildly different
cultures probably shouldn't marry
i mean yeah that's pretty self-evident
well no that's absolutely what you just
said
i'm sorry that i kind of took it to a
logical conclusion but go ahead you can
try and rephrase that if you need to go
for it
such a nasty guy no it's okay do you
like this format better where we can't
actually see you so that you can eat
your boogers when we're not actually
watching you on camera does it feel
better for you yeah and you can uh you
can share screenshots of 15 year olds in
there
yup that's absolutely what i do all the
time nick that is exactly what you do
but anyway let me explain to you what
i'm trying to say i think you'd welcome
me talking or maybe you're
never good okay pedophile so what i'm
trying to explain here is uh and you
keep you keep derailing it with again
all these straw men arguments not
derailing it at all
mr actions you are and again with the
interruptions derailing here's the
difference
when you're talking about interracial
for example in america a black person
you know let's say a black person in a
relationship with a white person it's uh
it's obviously they're
coming from different races do you deny
that different races in america have
different cultures do you deny that
different races you know for for example
people from a different country from a
different race have a different culture
than people in america if they're raised
in a different home
so i think yeah well no well you asked
me a question
i'm not allowed to respond to the
question was that rhetorical i'm not
finished with my point i'm not oh okay
go ahead nick
gotta got a layer at least six or seven
more arguments in there go ahead you're
such a you're such a
piano that's italian by the way so
here's the difference
like for example i would say that i
wouldn't get in a relationship with a
southerner i wouldn't
i said this on my show before i wouldn't
say that like oh you know northern and
southern people should never get
together in the same way that i don't
believe that
you know different people of different
races should never get together but i
think generally
it's advised against because again it's
on the basis of compatibility
um and that's that's one part of it
that's one sure so i mean like what you
just said is like absolutely not true
though
um the idea that a race is intrinsic to
a culture if i were to ask somebody
um like hey you know or somebody would
say i want you to go out on a date with
my friend i go oh cool well you know
tell me a little bit about her and you
know they say like oh well she's south
korean
okay that doesn't tell me [ __ ] all about
that person you would have to say way
more i literally know
unless i guess i have like a fetish for
asians that doesn't really describe that
person at all
even when you go as far as to say even
when you go hold on booger nick go mine
for some nose gold okay well i get my
point out i know it's really hard for
you to let me finish a single point
even when you say earlier even when you
say earlier even when you say earlier
even when you say earlier nick that you
wouldn't date a southerner well what is
a southerner
would i date somebody from rural
louisiana probably not
what i did somebody that like lives in
downtown austin probably these are both
southerner kind of people but i mean
like these are very different people
they're both in southern areas now do
you mean people that live in rural areas
maybe when you say southern i don't know
nick it's really hard when people like
you try to say everybody of a certain
race acts a certain way
or everybody of a certain country or
everybody is certain well even implying
even implying that there are these even
implying that they're
nick says two people of different races
shouldn't date because they tend to have
different cultures
how could he possibly imply that there
are intrinsic differences between these
people of different races i don't know
nick
that's a real tough one for me maybe we
can spend a youtube video putting
together that train of thought because
man that's so disconnected there i don't
know
anybody could ever arrive at that
conclusion disconnected is complete
totally disconnected
not taking what i'm saying i must not be
it's just it's going right over my head
nick ideas
no no no no no it's the same thing that
left-wing people always do they assume
that
oh you're you're out to get people of
color you're you have these secret
beliefs
what i'm saying i think is really not
all that complicated what i'm saying is
that
people should get married based on
compatibility oh i agree with that sure
why do we have to talk about race with
that
race tends to be something that is
polarizing in the country obviously
obviously and if you look at it even on
politics what was it like 97
of black people voted for barack obama i
mean so so of course there is something
that is
cultural there of course there is
something that is perhaps incompatible
with uh with certain people so
i think that you're trying to make it
out that i think black people are
all the same and blah blah i mean the
these extrapolations you're making they
simply don't follow it's this
i mean it just seems like a bat when
you're willing to tell me right now that
there are
wait you acknowledge that a lot of
asians even specific asians like a lot
of korean americans or a lot of
vietnamese immigrants are different from
one another right you agree with that
correct then it sounds like it's
probably not a good heuristic to decide
whether or not two people should be in a
relationship with one another
as somebody that now lives in la i
probably have a whole lot more in common
with an la korean-born girl than i would
with a girl that lives in the country of
montana
or like like the rural areas of montana
or iowa
what do you have more in common with an
la born white girl than an l.a born
korea girl
probably right i mean it really did i i
would need more information to be honest
a lot of my friends down here are korean
that play video games all day that do
music all day
we even answer the question honestly
because no no no i don't i don't answer
because i don't have enough information
i know la girls down here that have no
interest in music that have no interest
in video games that have no interest in
anime
like there's no way that i can answer
that question you're playing dumb oh my
being disingenuous
nick if you watch my stream i hang out
with plenty of korean girls all the
[ __ ] time that live in la
these are people that i share a lot in
common with there are also some l.a
white girls that i hang out with but i
would need way more information to know
if i have more in common with an la
korean girl or an l.a white girl because
just that information alone tells me
literally [ __ ] all about the person
that's great yeah we're all uh yeah that
makes a lot of sense i mean
if you actually stepped outside of your
house every now and then maybe you'd see
it but i don't know maybe maybe you live
in one of those great white ethno
neighborhoods so you don't see a lot of
other people of color around you i don't
know
you're right you're right i know i am
now here's the problem is that identity
is something that's complex and we have
identities which have different degrees
of salience and you yourself said this
earlier on the stream you said that
identity
is a complex thing yep and so for you to
say that well
you know the idea that perhaps a black
person a white person having less
compatibility than a white person and a
white person
i think it's basically annoying or
rather ignoring the
fundamental assumption which is that we
have sort of these degrees of
compatibility
for example you would say that an
italian
and a spanish person come from two
different countries right two different
ethnicities
uh but these are both mediterranean
catholic european countries right
you would probably say that while
italians and spanish are different
you would say that uh an italian and a
spanish person are more alike
than an italian and somebody from china
somebody born and raised in china
because
you know again you can look at a number
of different factors but i think we
could both agree
that we could assume that on average
unless we're talking about an individual
and we have all the information this
person in china happens really like
video games and like they speak english
and they like music wait did you really
just talk this long to tell me that
somebody born and raised in china is
going to be a lot different than
somebody born and raised in america
yeah because do you think i'm gonna
disagree with this nick
literally you don't understand this
concept i don't i totally lost here
you literally started off saying
identity is a complex thing and now
you're trying to boil it down to a
racial identity you're full of
contradictions there nick
dichotomy nick added again slippery nick
trying to slip through the cracks of his
horrible [ __ ] arguments
you have to do this because you know
that you're wrong you know that
everybody i mean like
you open so like you know that people of
different races aren't compatible right
if i take somebody born in china and
compare them with somebody born in
america they're totally different
why do you appeal to geography there if
the race is so different nick this is
what you do
go ahead what do i do you say this
exactly
oh you really believe i would say i
would think that people in china are
different than people in italy that's so
reductive and simple
okay slippery nick and you you do that
you do that because you know that you're
wrong on the point why am i wrong you're
literally
proving my argument nowadays no that
that entirely validates that
no you're different races they are less
compatible than within race i'm agreeing
with what you're saying no i agree with
you
you're making my argument beautifully
for me in order to know if a chinese
person is a lot different than you
looking at maybe where they're born is a
really important way to determine that
because just knowing their race doesn't
tell you that much information
i totally agree with your argument nick
absolutely knowing where somebody is
born would give you a decent amount of
information about the things that they
believe
yeah yeah um cool all right do we have
anything else for alpha can we actually
move on to other callers rather than
some guy trying to
reach a couple followers for me or oh
leeching followers
i mean like i'm being honest i charge a
lot of money for this type of exposure
man you get a lot of [ __ ] for free right
now okay so you better be [ __ ]
grateful i'm a capitalist
i'm okay to deal with this [ __ ] because
i'm making a lot of money off it too
i'm not being honest with you man now
incidentally
incidentally do you guys be down for
something like this next friday [ __ ] no
no
no no no jesus christ have been a lot of
fun
yesterday and how long tonight it's
enough already i said the last time i
wasn't going to debate this guy when he
came out with a [ __ ] statistic and
that was the first
argument that he made he spent a whole
month compiling a google doc and the
first argument he makes in the second
debate is based on a lie
oh my god that was so painful we spent
two hours
before he couldn't admit that the hard
seller immigration act was the will of
the people
because he he claims that he has some
divine knowledge about what people
actually no [ __ ] i don't want to go into
all these arguments again i
already i suffered through that if
anybody wants they can i [ __ ] made an
18-page [ __ ] google doc you can
hammer through that [ __ ] if you don't
believe me
there is no way i'm gonna deal with
[ __ ] slippery i don't have the i'm
not gonna lie
i'm not the young man i was when i
debated you two years ago okay
it's hard for me to keep up with that
[ __ ] [ __ ] oh my god
your powers have doubled talking to
people like you i'm pretty sure and [ __ ]
it is actually worse for my health so
maybe you actually
maybe you get more powerful when you do
this [ __ ] i just get [ __ ] cancer
cells
good good are you wishing harm on me
no of course not i would never do that
why did you say good when you said good
you mean like in a virtuous sense so
it's good that it's uh that it's good
that it's good for my health
oh okay guys because we have all these
uh we have all these four foots all
pedophiles
gotcha good that's good so kind of like
it's good for catholic priests that rape
little kids as long as it feels good for
them like that kind of good nick is that
what we're talking about you can say
that but uh i
did say it pornography oh well you know
okay kind of hilarious how it's always
the deflection but
i mean everybody knows that you are a
pedophile and you do support
man it's so strange that all those calls
to the fbi all those internet hit pieces
man and for some reason they still
didn't catch me nick i don't know man
yeah i extrapolated it oh gotcha well as
long as you extrapolate i guess you
induction
it must have been all of those arguments
that i made against like actually having
sex with minors you know maybe all those
arguments that i made
i guess you were extrapolated from that
that i must be a pedophile somebody
bringing ethical child porn in your era
you're giving this immunity to
pedophiles but absolutely how did you
know that that's exactly what i said
honestly i'm okay you got me there i
thought that i privated the video on my
in my channel that was titled immunity
for all pedophiles i thought that i
deleted that video but you must have
screenshotted it before
that's my bad nick you got me again
there last night i did i get you every
time i got to the first half every time
i got you on train
okay ralph are we done can we please
dear god [ __ ] guys
all right thank you nick i appreciate
you uh stopping in man
yeah man thanks for having me sorry for
busting your balls i was like
i was well yeah earlier you know what
i'm talking about all right man have a
good one
all right take it easy everybody bye-bye
wow
okay i know some people in the chat were
were like ralph is he still
i tend to just sit back and and uh just
i mean you guys
didn't really need any help
you're the guest here yeah so what you
just like
obviously was trying to interject a
couple times
any thoughts on that i guess it was
almost an hour
yeah geez man well it was quite
entertaining and i think uh
nick articulated himself much better
than i did
uh yeah any thoughts on any of the
topics or anything you wanted to get in
there on that though or
destiny well destiny kept interrupting
and straw manning him
which i was displeased with god damn it
the lefties were right liberals liberals
will side with fascists [ __ ] me
i didn't want to admit it but i'm
watching it happen in real time
are you saying you're disappointed
that's not your mother no i mean that's
kind of what that's kind of what that's
that's one of the reasons why lefties
get so mad at me for being liberal in
the broad sense is that
lefties always say that in times of
great crisis liberals will always side
with
fascists to defend their own entrenched
interests and it seems to be true when i
watch
how people in the center will tend to
drift towards like more kind of like
like i guess like fascist thought
whenever they're threatened so
but to be fair destiny you will also
tolerate things when it's beneficial to
what does that have to do with what i
just said you said that people are
wait no i'm saying that you also will
tolerate things when it's beneficial to
you
yeah i don't think fascism is ever
beneficial to me i think that's a really
short no i'm saying but i'm saying
though that
you do tolerate people calling for
violence no i don't actually
it's actually something that i fight
with my wait hold on wait what kind of
time
so just in general like when i have
lefties i might this is really annoying
because i hate getting attacked from
both sides i do not tolerate [ __ ]
lefties in my audience
they talk about [ __ ] like murdering
like landlords and eating [ __ ] rich
people all the time
but you associate with people who do um
i mean i try not to i think the the most
left person that i associate with is
hasanabi who i don't think is like he's
like a reformist
and i don't think he's a foreign
socialist i don't i don't associate with
hard life people if you go and read my
subreddit my left community [ __ ]
hates me
because i refuse to talk to left-leaning
people all the [ __ ] time i get
roasted for them all the time like
richard wolf for all these people i like
it specifically do not talk to or
associate with these types of people
well i yeah but i messaged him about
something because
part of the thing that got some of this
ball rolling is that we played video of
uh hathan's discord and namely people
saying that soph should die because she
has a
a gab account would you and these are
people who moderate
basically how this whole thing started
there was a call on
um hassan's discord and they were musing
about would it be okay to murder soph
basically because
i mean so if if hassan himself so hassan
and me have had no idea
himself did not say that no no i'm just
saying that if hassan himself said that
i would call him out for it i do this
all the time me and him have disagreed
on a number of issues in the past and we
have gotten into big fights over things
um if he was actually doing this i would
have huge problems i mean i'm not going
to disavow another content creator
because of stuff that goes on in their
discord
i mean like if a song is like moderators
um i mean that's
pretty shitty if they're really doing it
i would say that's bad i wouldn't
tolerate
the i've got the audio if you want to
listen to it
i why would i want to listen i mean i
believe you i believe that people
probably said that
sure i'm i'm not saying i don't believe
that it happened i mean
but will you do anything to call it out
i mean i'll say right now
i mean i've said several times over this
debate and in the past that like trying
to critically hold
you know teenagers to their political
beliefs i think is really [ __ ] stupid
um and i would extend that these are
teenagers i think these are
no no no no no if i saw yeah being a
teenager that like saying that we should
kill teenagers for their political
beliefs is really really dumb
um but yeah i mean like if i mean hassan
is saying that apparently i don't know
what hassan did to his mods because i
don't keep up with everybody else's
discord
um he's saying he disavows his mods like
that's what he's saying but
there's still mods though okay i i can't
i don't know i really can't see anything
do you do you feel comfortable in
associating with people that are
tolerant of that sort of
uh talk going on in their communities
half of his community [ __ ] hates me
dog
i mean like if you watch if you watch
history i i just i just remember you
retweeting something along the lines of
if you're a content creator don't sit
back while your fan base runs wild with
racism sexism or
any other kind of [ __ ] you can time
them out you can ban them renounce them
or
not create content that enables them you
set the tone of your community which is
what i do yeah and i tell other people
to do it as well
so you so you wouldn't tell your friends
to do that yeah i mean i tell that to
them all the time but like i don't like
cupcakes
if they don't do it um then it's really
bad and i'll continue to roast them over
it and then if it becomes egregious
enough then i would cut them out
completely
but like for instance like that podcast
that we run last night with fuentes with
train wrecks
i think that he has a lot of problems
managing his community too those guys
break hard right
um and maybe hassan does with his
community as well but like i don't just
like completely stop associating these
people whatsoever i would continue to
call them out for it
because you you you cut communication
with a
small person in your community right uh
irish lady person
right okay uh now now i would just
assert though like
wait why do you think i did that uh
because he was sending creepy texts to
uh
people in your sure so this is like way
different this is something that's
happening one in my community directly
not another content
really he's platforming people that are
calling for the death of a senior girl
for having a gab account well yeah what
but the difference here i see that that
is a very serious thing no no i'm not
saying whether it's serious or not i'm
saying that the accountability for me
feels a little bit differently if stuff
is happening on my discord server then i
will police that content but i don't
feel comfortable policing other people's
discord servers i'll tell them what i
think they
are also on your discord server by the
way oh i mean if you point out that
people on my discord server are saying
we should murder a 14 year old those
people generally get banned if you
should any screenshots or whatever then
yeah i would ban those people like i
said like
and like and i'm not holding this to you
but like a lot of people on the right
will do this thing where they group all
of us on the left together so it's very
annoying sometimes when i have to talk
to people on the right
that are trying to make me answer for
crimes on the left and then when i go
back to my stream later everybody on the
left is like destiny you [ __ ] sell
out capitalist [ __ ] like you're not pure
enough for us like you sit there
no no let me say this that happens the
other way around too though
i mean it might but like i get hard
roasted by people in my poly like my
politics chat if you go to my discord
and my apology side
most of the people in there [ __ ] hate
me because a lot of my community is
[ __ ] lefties right now and i don't
mean that in the american sense i mean
they're [ __ ] commies and socialists a
lot of those [ __ ]
hate me right now and i'm trying very
hard to move them off of my [ __ ] [ __ ]
because i don't like those [ __ ] um
but like that's like
there is no like understanding that i
implicitly support like that [ __ ] in my
chat i don't like i come down very hard
on that [ __ ]
[ __ ] we don't even use like [ __ ]
and autistic and [ __ ] in my discord
anymore
and i try and i actually try really hard
here's something else that a lot of
people get pissed off i try really hard
to have like representation on my chat
too there's a guy called excuse me in my
community that people [ __ ] hate
and i have multiple conversations with
him there's there's another guy called
waldemar that
advocate to keep around even though he's
like borderline [ __ ] race realists
now um because i think that having equal
viewpoints represented is good so like i
really don't have this like extreme
lefty community where we all circle jerk
about how much you want to kill
everybody all the time
um yeah i just get annoying when that
but that perception is gonna be go ahead
so go ahead
how closely do you monitor your own
subreddit
um pretty closely ish i mean what do you
mean
uh well because there were you know some
threads on there that people were doing
the same thing
as uh in hassan's chat talking about
killing me
talking about um de-platforming me mass
flagging me on patreon all that sort of
thing
um i mean deep platforming or massive
flagging are different than like being
violent towards or like actually like
killing they also
they also were being violent i mean if
people in there are making like death
threats that i mean like
even if i didn't even if i didn't care
about it ideologically i would ban those
people because i could get my subreddit
in trouble right yeah
i'll always ban people like that that
are literally making [ __ ] death
threats and [ __ ] if you have links of
that of people making death threats
towards you and my subreddit you can
always shoot me that [ __ ] and i'll
[ __ ] ban him yeah [ __ ] that's creepy
as [ __ ] i don't know why the [ __ ] you
would do that to a 14 year old it's
really weird
but you'll associate with people that do
yeah no
i i generally don't but i might
associate with people whose people in
their communities do i feel like that's
just too many people
one of the people that was rationalizing
it was um izzy who i believe is
has been on your uh on your platform
before correct
i might have talked to izzy one time but
generally no i don't platform izzy
usually izzy is on other people's shows
with me so like on the raw show or on
the train wreck show but i'm also not
aware of is he making those comments i
don't know if they have or not
like like i said izzy was one of the two
mods in the
chat that oh sure okay
izzy was one of the two mods in the chat
that was doing sure okay now let me ask
you this i do think real quick
and then just to say i do think it's a
little bit weird that like i mean you
can argue that
these people did that it's really bad
i'm wondering if any of these people
would try to use the same hyperbole
argument that sof used earlier to defend
her comments about muslims maybe they
would maybe they wouldn't but
and by the way i just wanted to say oh
sorry hold on
let me ask you this now and i have a
couple other topics i want to do maybe
take a few callers and then we'll
wrap up but um now can you see why uh
or how we were talking earlier we're
debating uh the morality of you know
seeing nick fuentes uh you know get
assaulted or is it okay to beat up a
nazi can you see how that might
progress to killing your political
opponents
um it's possible sure okay
but but again like i do think that there
are like the thing that's kind of a
slippery slope right well
it's not a no no it's not a slippery
slope so like here's the problem okay
and i'm going to use the word that's
gonna trigger the [ __ ] out of your whole
audience and i'm sorry for doing this
right but when we argue about this we're
arguing from a position of extreme
privilege
or i assume you are at the end of the
day none of these things really bother
me like i'm wealthy i'm white i'm male
i'm fine no matter what even if [ __ ]
climate change happens i'll just move
inland i'll always be
okay because of my position in society
however right so we talk about like is
it okay to kill political opponents blah
blah blah blah right oh well that's
horrible we can talk about this as like
enlightened white thinkers
who doesn't really matter at the end of
the day however let's say for instance
you're a guy
who is finally able to leave their job
because the affordable care act gave you
affordable health insurance that
otherwise wasn't available to you
right so i've personally known people
that were slaves to their [ __ ] jobs
because they couldn't leave
because if they did they'd lose their
health insurance right so these are
people who are looking at like
potentially like the end of their lives
maybe they'll lose the coverage they've
purchased they won't be able to find
more they could actually face like death
or like severe bodily harm
diabetic neuropathy other sorts of
things right if somebody if you were
talking to somebody like this
i feel like you would be a lot less
comfortable saying well hold on dude do
you really want to be violent against
these republicans that are voting out
your health care when this person is
literally facing like bodily harm as a
result of their legislation
um okay so uh i do have super chats we
have a few callers i see britney ventis
in the green room too i don't know if
you want me to bring no
no i don't want to i'm scared i already
tolerated [ __ ] no
you can you can do it right here i don't
i don't want to tell like so
yeah i don't want to tell self what you
can do i'd rather leave before she comes
on like dealing with that [ __ ] is like
that's way too if fuentes was enough for
one night
okay um let me look at my
little notepad here uh president trump
good or bad for america i'll start with
you self
yeah i don't know well i i don't know
something i'm just kidding i'm not too
far into the um
uh into his policies i mean um
the wall would be cool
if it was instead just buying it and he
wasn't using if it if it was funded by
no nations instead of you know
involuntary tax money that'd be
nigh before the wall i'm not really for
all the you know pro-israel stuff
uh yeah that's that's that's as far as
it goes for me
uh destiny you can respond to that do
you really have to guess i mean
i'm not the biggest trump man obviously
i'm probably ideologically opposed him
on almost every single issue uh what's
the worst thing about trump
um ah the word i think the two worst
things that the republican party has
done
probably has to do with like our
relationships around the world
specifically related to pulling out of
the um
the json whatever the iran deal is
called um
the um whatever that framework was the
joint comprehensive plan of action
pulling out of that i think was one of
the worst things that he did and then
probably pulling the um the affordable
care act getting rid of the mandate
that's gonna cause it to collapse i
would say that those are probably the
two worst things and then maybe like
supreme court justices
all right uh now so if you mentioned uh
israel uh
and we i guess we could make this a
topic too uh
what what problems do you have with the
united states and they're supportive of
the israeli state
and benjamin netanyahu well the
there's a lot of unjustified violence
going on over there and i i don't really
um
uh support such a large amount of money
being dumped into
any other countries uh i guess
government
uh so you would be in favor of just
abolishing all foreign aid
yes uh what about you destiny
um i mean i'm not gonna go full
non-interventionalist like i would
expect software there's an amcap right
you typically
aren't a fan of foreign intervention um
i i think that america's like obsession
with israel is really [ __ ] weird or
at the very least i don't think we're
usually honest with what we do overseas
um i don't really think there's some
like grand jewish conspiracy i think
it's more that like america will be
fiercely allegiant to that people
to those people in that part of the
world um which is why we're alleging to
like the gulf states for instance or why
we were religion to like um saddam
hussein in iraq
um but yeah i mean my biggest problem
with america's foreign intervention is
that we're usually not honest about it
like well why are we here right yeah i
mean
israel is not about to be overran by
[ __ ] palestinians any time soon no
hamas has belongs going to change that
um so like yeah i don't know i i just
wish america could be more honest about
its foreign intervention and i'm not
generally a fan
of a lot of the violent [ __ ] that we do
overseas um because a lot of it has a
lot of unintended horrible [ __ ] that
[ __ ] with everybody
like for instance the 2013 syrian
refugee crisis
all right let me read these elrond
humperdink says destiny okay with a
woman fighting for him
then he says checks out uh victor
carbino says destiny asks sargon which
hadith collections he's read which have
you read destiny
[ __ ] no no i'll study [ __ ] islam i
mean read the quran [ __ ] that
uh regat says destiny sounds like a
total gaylord
nice fin fenrir hansa says
uh islam is not a language hail white
sharia
uh armchair warrior says islam equals
this is
way back i apologize for that armchair
warrior says islam equals choice you
could drop it anytime you want language
is not a religion the two can't be
compared
uh j says everything destiny is saying
about religion applies to political
ideology what would you say about that
um i i mean like you can make strong
arguments for it
this would be a really nuanced argument
so my general feeling is that
religion is something that can be
personally practiced that doesn't
necessarily have to impact other people
but i would argue that political
ideologies assuming you vote
necessarily impact other people so for
instance if i wanted to
i could practice some religion
personally privately and when i say that
private i still mean like with the
community and whatnot
um but i could still vote in ways that
don't necessarily harm other people
however if i'm of a certain political
ideology that votes a certain way
i could necessarily be causing harm to
other people that's what i would say is
the difference between those two things
but but i do agree that it gets like
pretty hairy between the two
and you could argue you could argue in
different ways for both depending on
how you practice your religion so for
instance um christians that practice
extreme form
of christian law or muslims that
practice extremes forms of like sharia
law
or buddhists that kill people or [ __ ]
jewish people that whatever christians
that chop off foreskins from dicks and
[ __ ] like yeah i mean like there's a lot
of people that could do bad things as a
result of their religion but i don't
think it necessarily is entailed because
religion is such like an
all-encompassing complicated thing
whereas political stuff can be boiled
down a lot more to like how you actually
vote at the end of the day you know
uh elrond humperding says born speaking
english is a [ __ ] example it doesn't
mean you don't choose to continue
speaking it every day you can stop
speaking your native language anytime
you could but i only i use that as an
i'm sorry was that it no go ahead no
i was gonna like the fact that he even
says that unironically like i it's like
anybody that's reasonable is like okay
well like
the idea that you choose to speak your
language you choose to continue speaking
your language that's pretty silly like
this is this is a heavily weighted
choice like you're very very very likely
to continue speaking your birth language
um and you're pretty unlikely to learn a
second one right depending on where you
live
all right uh mr man says if islam is a
choice why do they kill apostates
um not all of them do but i mean some of
them do i mean some christians have i
think it's more common right now
um because of the parts of the world
where it's practice where islam is but i
mean if you're into apostasy that's
pretty [ __ ] up i think
toyota says don't worry about the
westboro baptist guys they were just
born into it my dude lol nice to know
destiny supports the church
i mean like i think religion religion is
an important part in a lot of people's
lives the rituals associated with it the
community building all that it's
probably like necessary like for the
human condition i just i don't like the
theology part i think it's a real
[ __ ] stupid you get people like nick
that i unironically think they have
objective moral authority
because they happen to choose the one
out of 5 000 existing religions that
they think is correct i think that's
real stupid
uh now this is uh us there's a lot more
to read but um
this is a topic uh that i meant to bring
up earlier where are you
uh on the i'm sorry i've lost my train
of thought
what do you think about uh homeschooling
um that's [ __ ] that's a really
complicated one it really depends on why
you're doing it where you're doing it
and where the impact is like some people
homeschool because i think they can give
their kids a better education
in that case it's probably fine um some
people do it because they're like
against what the state
teaches and they're very conspiratorial
that's probably not fine
um if you're a good teacher it's
probably good if you're a [ __ ] teacher
it's probably bad like
it really depends you need more
information or i would have like a good
judgment on it
do you think people should be allowed to
homeschool in any like case
um that's uh that's a really hard one i
would have to think
my my gut is no i don't think so i think
we should probably have like
got like federal guidelines set for what
a student should be able to achieve
at a certain age like what common core
would say like by at this age you should
be this proficient in like reading and
math i would say that's probably an
important thing that should probably be
uh mandated by the federal government
i'll stand by that i'll say yeah they
should be
so you think they if they can't be
provided a sufficient alternative
they're required to go to
normal public schooling yeah yeah if
they can't pass the tests yeah
i don't i i i just i would disagree with
that
okay uh what do you think about uh
homeschooling in general stuff and
you can even tie that into uh you know
the current uh public schooling system
um i think it's a it's a great choice
it's a great alternative i'm personally
doing a
half homeschool half regular high school
program i'm going to transfer
to that next year to have more time for
this youtube type thing
and i think if you don't want to um
have your child be subjected to what's
going on in public schools right now i
think that's fair because
for me clearly just moving to california
there's so much political bias
in the schools that i don't think i
think the parents should have a choice
to opt out of that
do you think parents should have a
choice to opt out of things like
vaccinations
um well yeah
okay i disagree with that i think that
there are some things that serve the
common good well enough that we should
probably
mandate them at the federal level
because not doing so has the potential
to cause way too much harm in society
and i think that all of us
in some ways have an obligation to
better society so for instance having
like large swaths of people that are
totally uneducated would probably cause
a lot of harm to society much the same
way that having
large amounts of unvaccinated people can
cause a lot of harm to society
i think you can um i think just on the
on the scale that we're operating right
now with the state i think
you can't make these universal decisions
where everybody has to do one thing you
have to split it up more into
communities and certain people
would um make you know free association
communities where they have certain
policies like okay yeah we all agree to
all vaccinate our children and that sort
of thing
and people can divide themselves up like
that but right now people don't have the
choice to opt out of certain decisions
like vaccinations and have that sort of
policy going on in their community well
sure i mean but i mean we kind of
have to do that right like that's the
only way that a country can can
realistically work we have to
the integration from community to
community is really important
um this is why we exist as a country
work but you don't necessarily need a
state for there to be um
reasonable order well but you probably
need a state to continue
to ensure the existence of its people
right like i don't think if we were well
i mean like then
i mean like history shows right like
large empires large nations generally
can provide for and defend their peoples
better than
like just roaming tribes of people well
there's always you know private military
and i think
if there's a if there's scattered tribes
of people they're all going to
if there's a threat they're all going to
band together to fight for their freedom
together because it's all in their
interest to
maintain that freedom yeah but i think
that i think that generally
i'm making some broad statements here
but i think that people are probably
happier
not having to worry about securing
funding for a private military to defend
their existence
they're probably happy to just live in a
country where that's kind of a given and
then focus on like
what should i major in in college if
people want to choose to be part of that
government but right now they don't
really have that choice like if you live
in a certain place you are just part of
a government and that's
a given so well i mean like that's kind
of where we if people want that taken
care of
for them then that's their choice but i
don't want that to be you know
have to be subjected to anybody else who
doesn't want that i mean like
technically you could leave the country
and go and find some like unsettled
wildland or something i guess
yeah and i yeah i would want to do that
i'm interested in actually setting up a
micro nation in the future if i ever
have the funds to do that okay
all right let me read some more these
have ben notch says please define what a
nazi is
and then he says national socialist
question mark
uh i'm assuming he's talking to t yeah i
mean like
the the the phrase national socialist is
kind of vacuous
i guess like the actual ideas of the
party but i mean like my main tenants
today for when i see like nazis today
i align them maybe this might be
ignorance on my part but i kind of like
see alt-right and nazi as being like
incredibly similar positions
so you're usually bought into the jewish
question so for instance you believe
that jews are running society to try to
destroy the white man you usually buy
into things like race realism so for
instance you believe that there are
biological realities that describe the
difference in iq
between white people and black people
and then as a result of those two
beliefs you usually
advocate for some form of if not an
ethno state like a
like a a sovereign nation that can
protect its own peoples or western like
whatever however you dog whistle
uh let's see dan said bad faith actors
big brain destiny just made the argument
to d
platform himself dog whistles can only
be heard by other dogs so destiny is all
right
he [ __ ] got me dude that's
deductively true he [ __ ] dominated
the [ __ ] out of me
uh chip knight says because antifa want
to hurt me we should kill all of them
destiny wants to be dead he might not
admit it directly but i know he's
a threat and he says to the pyre with
him
uh i mean if some people feel like
antifa represents like a real threat to
their existence then yeah sure
the the arguments there that a
left-leaning person would say that an
antivirus would say well the right is
already practicing violence against us
so that doesn't change anything if you
want to practice like actual direct
violence it's more or less the same as
what's being practiced now
right people people on the left would
argue that things like the police force
for instance only exists to
further entrench the interests of
capitalists or whatever i personally i
don't agree with these arguments but
yeah they'd be fine with that
if you were to tell an antifa person
while a right-leaning person is going to
start enacting violence on you they'd
say [ __ ] it bring it we're already doing
it
assuming you're talking about like
antifa like maybe like in europe i don't
think in america they're that extreme
but there are groups that would say that
uh dirk lyman says destiny i don't
really think that you understand the
violence that you're calling for you
know nothing of war and would not be
ready for it
i i mean okay
have you ever been to war i mean i
haven't been to war i probably played
with a gun more than the people and the
average person in this audience has but
i mean
i know how to shoot i could do that um
that's all i got though but i mean no i
mean obviously i'm not ready for war
that's one of the
great privileges afforded to me by
living in a nation-state i don't have to
worry about being ready for war
constantly it's something that the state
takes care of me for i pay taxes i don't
worry about that [ __ ]
uh i see so so you don't want me to
bring inventi chats on my case about
that
you you're against that no [ __ ] like
like the last like three conversations
making a video about you i
know but it's so stupid it's all she's
like obsessed with this basically there
was one day where we were on stream
and she had me dragged in or i was i
entered a stream with her and like a
bunch of other twitch people
and then we got into some big argument
over the child porn [ __ ] and everything
she said was so stupid and everybody in
that argument
ended up siding against her which was
the opposite of me going in she thought
that they'd had all sided with her and
she's been so ass blasted by that
conversation that she constantly like
either tries to get me banned from
places
or is like bragging about like taking
down me with hit piece videos that bring
up clips from like eight years ago or
something
[ __ ] like it's just boring like i don't
want to sit here and like have her come
in and like [ __ ] scream and be like
what about the pedophile you're a
[ __ ] pedophile like it's just boring
to me like she can go make another
thing you didn't you did add home a fair
bit
oh yeah i did i admit that i did i did
and um
i think on other occasions you you've
advocated for her getting deep
platformed as well
yeah i have i do and i still do yeah i
think she's a very very uninterrupted i
think she's a very intentional bad faith
actor
i'll use that phrase again i think that
she deliberately lies or spreads
misinformation on our screen oh she's
also done like the pit bull thing too
remember the people thing i'm a chinese
she also has videos talking about how
horrible pit bulls are which is like a
dog whistle for like african-americans
right yeah
that's a real joke man okay
real quick did you uh did you strike or
did you try to file a copyright crime
claim against her video that she made on
you no i didn't but i tweeted it about
it she got real [ __ ] mad
i think i tweeted that but you've done
that before you can understand like why
people
um if people rip like all of my content
and for reasons then yeah i'll do it but
like for people to do like no but you've
you've done it on things that are like
objectively wait then why didn't i try
to do it wait why did why didn't i do it
why didn't i do it on the naked eight
video or like sargon's critiques
would you would you admit that
brittany's video was fair use yeah
absolutely in any in every sense of the
word for sure but like so is naked apes
hit piece on me that's one of the most
popular like slander pieces i mean the
internet or
like when sargon made a larger piece
about me yeah of course i i never did
like that you do have a history of doing
it so you could understand why people
might be pissed off that you might be
trying to [ __ ] with their money right
i mean that's like saying that's like
asking me if i'm going to drive like
into a store because i have a history of
driving
i mean like i i dmc it's like saying
that you have a history of dmca in
people
i have a history of dm seeing people
that like that straight rip my content
and upload it onto their youtube i don't
do it for people that do transformative
works
well you said that you've also done it
because it pissed you off well but
they're already like in violation of my
copyright i'm usually like pretty chill
like if somebody rips my [ __ ] because
they're making a fan channel or some
[ __ ] i'm usually like yeah whatever
that's fine but if somebody
you don't understand why people would
people would get upset about that right
understand why they can't like steal my
content and use it to just like
but you do you okay i mean i'm being a
little facetious
i understand what you're saying sure but
like i don't i mean i get to just yeah
i'm sorry i'm being an [ __ ] i'm being
really obvious um
i understand what you're saying why
people would think that yeah sure but i
don't do that i never it's just annoying
because i never do that i've never done
that to like a larger hit piece video
about me i've never dmca
videos like that i don't do that all
right
so i can't just bring it in for a second
what
no it's just going to be no it's going
to be so
dumb wait can you basically have some
differences no but we've talked about
everything we can i don't even know i'm
allowed to i'm [ __ ] where i'm at
right now like it's just i don't want to
[ __ ] do it i just
let's finish this up because i'm
supposed to see a movie like pretty soon
too so like yeah what movie are you
going to see
um pet cemetery oh dude okay
sorry i won't get into that but i heard
it was really good and i want to see it
okay all right okay so i know chad's
saying bring her in and i i do like
britney she was on this show just last
night
she can come in and she can talk all the
[ __ ] she wants as soon as i step out
okay
but i do have a policy and i know chad's
gonna raise me you know ralph's a cuck
whatever
uh but i do have a policy that uh you
know i'm not i don't
ambush or whatever if he says he doesn't
want her on
okay uh because i don't know chat
they'll they'll say what they're gonna
say
but you know people don't won't come
back on your show shelves
if she if she really wants to set up a
talk we can set one up for a future
point if she really wants to okay okay
yeah if she really wants to i mean my
schedule's open and i [ __ ] set this
[ __ ] up all the [ __ ] time
i like now i will say that it's very
funny right now that she is like
begging she's seething to get into here
and talk to me when when i tried to set
up conversations with her in the past
she would always dodge and say get
talked to my agent and maybe we can set
it up in a month even though like
everyone knows she has [ __ ] all to do in
her free time right
she would do that to me in the past but
now that she's been d platform from
twitch now that she's [ __ ] banned
from places and now that she has no
relevance on the internet she's like
[ __ ] thirsting at the mouth to like
hop on my dick i think that's pretty
funny that she changed her tune there
but
i don't know her youtube videos are
doing pretty well are they
and chad is really the one that's asking
for how many how many of you where how
many
how many views is brittany pulling a
month on youtube uh
i think the pokeman one that she made
pulled in uh
half a million views already her live
streams are actually kind of like
getting to like
1k mark i don't know how long she's been
streaming but maybe
maybe pretty soon we'll go back to uh
maybe pretty soon we'll go back to me
begging her to come on so i can get
popular again but
ah all right well maybe we can set it up
uh
sometime in the future okay uh nat said
destiny made the argument for
violence on the right or right yeah
that's not what he said but that's what
he meant uh commander lost jayhawks says
destiny the white spokesman of the
marginalized
nitrogen says if you're in that much
danger destiny then do us all a favor
and i won't read the rest of that part
did he tell me to kill myself
yes very blatant manner
a bald guy creation says the pill is
thick tonight mayor hawk
hulk hoke says youtube is already using
age discrimination against her she made
a video about it but she's not mad
right um the bastard says destiny
advocates violence against black
against black nationalists uh draven
williams says destiny reading nick
fuentes mind and assuming his true
intentions like all leftists that's
called ad hominem big brain
no it's called inductive reasoning it's
pretty basic you can wikipedia
i mean uh pinky culture says what does
destiny think of casual racism
um is that a term i'm not sure what that
means is it like microaggressions or
what does casual racism mean i guess or
just uh maybe uh maybe you use
words uh like the n word or whatever but
you just don't want to
like joking around yeah sure so the
problem with casual racism
um is that it can be practiced by people
that aren't necessarily racist this is
something i have a lot of trouble with
with a lot of progressives
somebody will look at somebody that says
like the f word like for gay people
somebody will look at somebody that says
that and they'll be like oh like this
guy's homophobic he hates gay people
like well
no a lot of the times they don't hate
gay people it's just a word they use
but it kind of like unintentionally
makes these homophobic attitudes more
pervasive
and so this is usually the reason why
like so for me like i try not to say
these words i i like i don't even say
like [ __ ] or autistic anymore even
though you still count on twitch
because i don't like there's a couple of
things like one if there is somebody
that watches me that's legitimately
autistic or [ __ ] i don't want that
person to think like oh [ __ ] like
destiny kind of thinks that like i'm
that bad or he thinks that i'm a shitty
person like i don't want somebody
watching me to think that that makes me
feel like [ __ ]
and then two if you're somebody that
hates these groups of people i want you
to feel like you've got like camaraderie
with me they're like oh yeah destiny
hates gay people too because i am
bigoted you know even if i don't use it
in that way
so that's generally why i advocate
against like those types of against like
racial speech even if
i say racial speech like racist speech
even if you're not racist at least
publicly because i feel like you have a
responsibility to not like
allow those messages to become more
pervasive and harmful in society by
empowering the people that are racist
i don't i don't see do you think people
should be the platform for using those
words nope
okay well then fair enough i was going
to say that i don't i
is there any actual evidence that shows
that just saying
um before book slurs for gay people or
the n word or something like that is
actually
um the problem is that like asking
asking for
asking for evidence like that it's kind
of like asking if there's like evidence
for evolution
like there is but it's a very
complicated conversation like
in order to get from it well it's i'm
not they're not the same thing but like
what i'm saying is like if i want to
talk about how like evolution occurs um
we we have to take almost like a
multi-disciplinary approach
from physics to chemistry to biology um
in order to actually get
to like the answers of like well how
does evolution work and it's the same
thing with like how does saying a vi how
to saying like uh like
a pewdiepie joke online lead somebody to
go and shoot up a mosque
well this doesn't happen right like a
person doesn't make a nazi joke online
like oh pewdiepie did the kill all jews
video i'm gonna go kill all the jews
right that doesn't really happen
like and most people should be honestly
admitting that doesn't happen but what
can happen is if you're part of a
community that makes a lot of jokes
that are derogatory towards a certain
group of people over time it's possible
that somebody could introduce you to
ideas that are actually negative about
these groups of people and you're more
likely to listen to those ideas because
they've already been normalized in your
humor
and then people that are more willing to
listen to those ideas have a higher
chance of being radicalized people that
are radicalized
have a higher chance of doing more
radicalized things like either being
overtly racist or eventually enacting
acts of violence against groups of
people
but like that whole conversation right
we could talk like for hours about any
single part of that it's a big
reach you know it's possible but it's a
really big reach and i don't think we
should
i don't think it's a big reason for that
reason because you know it's like how
could you
paint direct responsibility i don't i
don't think that it's a
i don't think it's a reach first of all
responsibility i agree is really hard
right
i don't think i would ever hold somebody
that says racist jokes as being
responsible for a terrorist attack but i
think i could say that you're
responsible not to create a culture that
pervades
harmful or hurtful attitudes that could
lead to people being radicalized
that could lead to racist attacks like
these are pretty easy things to avoid so
i mean like for me like why not avoid it
it's pretty easy for me
not to call people you know [ __ ] like i
can do that pretty easily and if i
if i do that and it contributes to less
people being homophobic well why
wouldn't i like i don't really need to
say these words i don't really need to
make like
homosexual people that watch my stream
feel like [ __ ] horrible or feel like
i'm ostracizing them or empowering
people that hate them you know
well i don't i disagree that it would
create that culture
and it's um people should it's just
language people should be able to use
those words if that's how they want to
express themselves
um yeah i mean i understand your point
but like um i
yeah i mean it's unfortunately like a
really complicated conversation like we
um i mean there are lots of frameworks
by which we could talk about this but
yeah i mean i do believe that like
i mean like if there are i mean it's
very rare that we find a person that's
like super racist all the time and all
their humor like they go on to pull
they make racist jokes about indians poo
in the loo [ __ ] the streets
um about black people blah blah and then
when you talk to them like outside of
that they're like oh yeah actually i'm
an egalitarian that i support equal
rights for all people i don't hold these
harmful attitudes towards any groups of
people right like the humor and the bad
thoughts often times seem to run hand in
hand and i think there's a reason for
that
um they could run it hand in hand but
there there definitely are people who
make those jokes and are still
egalitarian i mean i see that
all the time with gen z they've that
because they've been on the internet for
so long they can make those jokes and it
doesn't hold that sort of same weight
for them they still believe oh yeah we
should
like equal rights for everybody and yeah
i agree i'm one of those people i agree
with you like so like in my personal
life like
i make a lot of [ __ ] horrible dark
racist jokes like i do that a lot
personally
but that's around people that i know
personally it's around people that i
know don't have these types of like
harmful attitudes
however as a public figure when i come
out on my platform i don't know what
people think
right i'm not comfortable making those
same types of jokes out here publicly
because there might be people that are
watching me that do hold those harmful
attitudes or beliefs and i do think i
would be reinforcing them by making that
type of
by making those types of jokes or
engaging that type of humor
oh okay that that's your choice i guess
as long as you don't
think that people should be the platform
for that or hello
my d platforming is only for like like
hardcore bad faith actors other people
that i want to platform because i think
they muddy up the waters
uh iron marter says monopolies cannot
exist without government protection glad
you dropped the dead weight ralph
i don't know what the second partisan
reference to but thank you for the
donation
uh the first part i would say is is
definitely true uh snobby line says how
do you
how did you learn to speak so quickly
destiny um i've been doing it a long
time yeah
right just by nature uh blasey ford's
hippocampus says i'm staying up late
listening to jesse right now if my
meeting with my business
with business leaders doesn't go it
doesn't go well i'm going to need some
gibbs from y'all
i think that's a joke about the faraday
speaks uh guy
we did play this video on this show do
you think that guy's real
i don't know that guy is obviously
trying to get money dude yeah i was just
about to ask you if you thought he was
real that's what i was about to do
i felt really uncomfortable like calling
someone a troll or saying something but
i like
yeah i don't know man he's got like the
person when he was trying to squeeze out
the tears
in the video that's when i was really
like uh i don't know i hope that i hope
that he's genuine i mean i get a lot of
people that email me similar stuff that
i think are being genuine but
yeah i hope for the best so or when he
makes a video like
a week after his video goes viral thing
oh he made a video saying he's going to
reach out to local business leaders to
like subsidize him watching
destiny videos i was like yeah
i don't think i don't think any local
business leaders are going to fund a
principled neat lifestyle for him
there's just too much in there i don't
know
hold on i'm sorry are you preaching
against the yang gang my dude
hey listen listen listen excuse me i
need to focus
on the bag are you coming after my meat
bucks [ __ ] you better chill out
there
what do you think i guess we could
speaking of topics real quick
wait okay hold on to be fair i have to
leave like pretty soon i got like maybe
20 minutes
so or like even with my stream so i'd
say like i got like five minutes so give
me like a good topic here we gotta wrap
it up okay
because there's some people that have
been wanting to uh get in real quick
uh no i'm just gonna do yanking what do
you think about yeah
i have no opinions i haven't like
followed him at all nothing on yang gang
whatsoever i i know that a lot of all
writers love
him for some reasons but i have no idea
why i follow like richard spencer on
twitter and i see that he or my friend
does and i see that he like
likes and retweets the [ __ ] all the time
i don't know i don't know why this has
happened but um yeah apparently a lot of
alt-right i've heard that like the goal
is like all riders want to prop up yang
somehow popularly in order to bring down
like other left-leaning candidates to
weaken the platform i don't know if
that's true or not that's what i've
heard it's possible but yeah
and uh i guess i'll just kick it itself
do you have anything
that didn't get brought up i know that
the nick versus destiny thing kind of
took up a whole
a whole hour out but we still gotta wait
i don't have to say can we pull in
somebody real quick
his name saint thomas aquinas in the in
uh
i guess he's on the other voice channel
okay we'll pull him in real quick and i
think there's actually a
destiny fan in there too from when i was
yeah v spa
okay we'll do those quick calls and then
we'll let destiny go
um okay um st thomas go ahead real quick
hey hey bonnell you hear me yeah what's
up buddy
i have a little paragraph to say and i
have a question right at the end i'll
make it concise i'll keep it under a
minute
okay all right seeing as bonnell takes
the modern eminem
approach of speed equals quality to
debating i like to take him up on
something that i haven't seen anyone
else take him up on which is his use of
inductive reasoning as a euphemism for
his guesses of what ideologies people
that he doesn't like are subscribed to
because nick fuentes doesn't like
doesn't think promoting miscegenation is
cool and because he shared a couple of
poll memes
about the holocaust which he has already
clarified that he doesn't necessarily
stand behind
you're gonna flex your go team muscles
and let those words slither out of your
dirty [ __ ] pedophile defending
divorce having child abuse and leaving
your kid behind mouth calling him a nazi
and justifying violence against him
regardless of what he said i'll kiss
nick in his mouth like saint francis did
the leper
but you my friend are partners and good
friends with hassan [ __ ]
who believes prophet is theft that is
essentially the 14 words of the left
wing
that's some [ __ ] proud han or max
sterner would say so i could do the
exact same thing to you and claim that
because of evidence that i've decided
it's sufficient i can say that because
you think my property can be taken from
me for the greater good of society that
violence against you is justified
listen i might not be an 18 year old yet
but i don't think you'd have a problem
with getting [ __ ] by a minor in front
of an audience and if you think that
violence against people like me is
justified because i think a certain way
then i urge you to act it out i have at
least six inches on you by the time i'm
done you'll have six inches in you
underage just how you like it which
finally brings me to my question i
understand
i understand you have a problem with the
word [ __ ] do you have any uh do you
have any problem with the word [ __ ]
hey can you let's not do that come on
dog
let's come on dude all right
by the way my friend he got me i did not
okay um so yeah i guess we just didn't
know that to be honest
okay
i will say though it's very funny for
all the people that get mad at the
prophetess theft memes i haven't found
very many liberals that are able to
actually attack that notion
um i would say to bring that guy on and
actually have him defend the idea that
prophet isn't theft i'd be curious to
hear his defense of it but i don't know
if he could help himself from
not slipping out of [ __ ] word there i
would have liked to have heard yeah a
little more back and forth but he's he
seemed pretty far
oh i also would have liked to hear him
say how could you deductively reason
what a person believes i'd be very
interested to hear that there's a whole
theory of mind out there that would be
very keen on hearing how you could
absolutely deductively know what is in a
person's mind i'm very curious to hear
that as well
and as an under 18 person it sounds like
he sure does have the world figured out
so i'd be very curious oh but that's
also another thing he didn't listen to
what i said earlier
um i don't advocate for violence against
him because i don't think he should do
anything violent to kids and since he's
under 18 he's still protected he's still
got some it sounds like four or five
years to go
until i would actually advocate for
violence against somebody like that
all right very good so if you got
anything else um i don't know just that
i want
i want brittany on all right before you
go destiny i
i've just received dms from our good
buddy hassan
and uh he apparently is calling me a
janitor
and a sociopath he called me a pedophile
before for calling out his uh
chat and his moderator's very
sociopathic behavior towards soph
um now i just want to get you to
possibly speak on this because he
submissively defers to you in a lot of
things
uh hassan does not defer to hassan has a
lot much dude that debate
that debate that [ __ ] body language
that he had he was so
submissively different wait wait wait
wait hold on you realize that his
presence on my
like online dwarfs mine he's part of
like the young turks network right like
yeah and he
leeches off of your viewer base every
chance he gets dude come on dude he
wait doesn't he have a dude wait wait
wait wait we're not that naive dude come
on
it's not about i mean i wish you were
right but he has like doesn't have like
a half million followers on facebook
like three hundred thousand instagram
followers
like over a hundred thousand followers
on twitter or a platform a banned from
like
i mean like trying to get really [ __ ]
vague on twitch and he's
latching on to you for every cent he can
now i can understand why this
relationship would be reciprocal and
that's why i don't really fully expect
you to actually call them out because i
don't think that you would do anything
that would monetarily
disincentivize your possibility okay
hold on so firstly
if i wanted to monetarily incentivize
what i do i would be right leaning
because it's far more easier
i know i know that you keep on saying
that but
you keep on saying that but you still
won't call it out
you still won't say his leaching no
you won't call out him defending his
sociopathic uh
mods tendencies and defending it and
calling me a pedophile i mean i just
did but no i don't okay so like did you
did you really no no no hold on
you're like obviously you obfuscated and
said that if i was really in it for the
money i'd go on the right wing
i don't know man what's what's that
what's the top-rated podcast on patreon
right now
isn't it like the dick masterson one or
what is it ah try again buddy
trap house wait wait how much money is
traffic wait wait how much money does
chapman make
100 000 a month on patreon how many
people are part of the chapel podcast
that's true they do split it up that's
fair yeah wait no how many people are
part of it how many people are on the
dick podcast isn't it just him and one
other guy
yeah how many people are i'm asking
because i don't listen to chapel how
many people are on chat
four i think there's three or four yeah
i don't okay so like it sounds like
they're not like that far off each other
right they're making double what dick is
making i
math is hard but there you go they make
up over five times what dick makes but
well no no wait i'm talking per person
right if i have a podcast with 10 people
and we make 100
i don't know the number i don't know why
you're saying math is hard like i can't
do basic subtraction
or basic addition i don't know but
anyway well
okay wait hold on can we cuz you can't
say like 30 things okay like so again i
said this earlier i know that like maybe
people on the left you like to group
them all together
but this idea that hassan is like
hardcore like leeching off my community
like literally one of the problems that
son has a lot of people in my community
don't like him
so for instance if you go and visit my
subreddit yesterday there are literally
threads that like the la the most recent
threat i see is
destiny should use his power to
influence his community and make people
stop hating on hassan for [ __ ] sake
like that's literally like the most
recent post in my subreddit about his
son
so real quick real quick is it
appropriate for him to call me a
pedophile and uh
calling out this behavior okay okay i
don't know i don't hold people
accountable for like
it seems like he's defending the
behavior of sociopaths does it
the the the behavior i describe to you
would you not call
i you're asking me to come out and take
a strong stance on something that i am
totally [ __ ] clueless about
i don't think a very i i wait i took it
very well wait what stance did i think
is hypocritical
i would fully be uh i would fully be on
board to
go over the video with you and talk
about this in detail and then get a
thought out and detailed response from
you after that if you'd be up for that
but like i said i don't think you will
wait about what about him defending
sociopaths and calling me a pedophile
for calling him out
wait why did he call you a pedophile can
you tell me i don't know what the [ __ ]
you're talking about
because i was talking i called out his
chat um
uh talking about how much they wanted to
shoot self
wait somebody is linking me that you
have a video on your channel titled i'm
going to [ __ ] this 12 year old at vidcon
is this real
that's not on my channel
listen i don't know what the [ __ ] i
don't you're asking me to comment or
something i'm totally [ __ ] clueless
about it
wait a minute wait a minute i have no
idea dude i don't
i guess send me the link i i haven't
seen yeah i've
made absolutely no such video oh sure
here hold on one second i don't even
know
can i link things like in this channel
the shiller yeah yeah yeah
yeah or in the uh okay looking at this
i'm pretty sure this is photoshopped the
text looks better i i have no [ __ ]
idea like
but like oh that's your channel oh okay
never mind
okay i have no [ __ ] idea all right um
wait whose channel where is this from
now wait a minute no so the screenshot
is on my channel and then they photoshop
the text i guess i don't know if this is
from your community
okay okay yeah you're like asking me to
hardcore come out and take a stance
again no i'm not i'm
what i have recorded and see if that is
something that you would call
sociopathic
i don't that's so weird wait how about
like i can just like disavow the be i
don't know i would call something
sociopathic people call me sociopath
like what the [ __ ]
because i think you're i think you're
obfuscating and not no no
no no no no no i'm not obviously getting
like he would be behavior in your
circles because
again it might monetarily incentivize it
might be a monetary
um there might be a monetary reason
behind it
okay so you're telling me this and then
as soon as i leave
everybody in my community is going to
ask me why i don't call a behavior more
of right leaning people for instance
train wrecks or asthma gold or xqc whose
communities are very right leaning on
twitch
like i do this to everybody like i'm
pretty consistent here i don't go around
and i don't tell people hey
you're a horrible person um you know i'm
not going to talk to you anymore until
you fix your community i don't know
just retweet people telling other people
to do it well no i tell people to do it
all the time i think you should
but i'm not going to like defriend
somebody or like not associate with
somebody because i don't think they
police their community
i'm not asking you i'm not asking you to
disassociate with what are you asking me
to do
i'm just asking for you to call out uh
advocating for the uh
execution of 14 year olds for having
gabby i just did i already said that
fantastic yeah yeah you should never be
like bullying [ __ ] high school people
for their [ __ ] political policies
stupid as [ __ ] especially not calling
for their debt that's really weird yeah
bullying all right thanks also you never
said anything when nick called me a
pedophile like 30 [ __ ] times earlier
in this conversation but oh no i'll
fully call out the fact that uh
no i think that the pedophile allegation
is wrong although you did
you did say that like the morality of a
society basically if there was no
taboo against pedophilia that would be
okay it was that part
oh and that exact thing i said there
were there are like 20 different reasons
why it's not okay for adults to [ __ ]
children
we can go over those if i need to remind
you but it's not just because it's taboo
there's a whole host of reasons why
that's really [ __ ] bad
by the way there's somebody's mike's
crackling i think that's flamenco's but
i'm not i might be
i'm sorry but but i'll go ahead and let
you let you go destiny i do want to
