wow the man the myth the legend here he
is
how are you doing buddy ah doing great
just doing what i normally do
streaming video games how long do you
stream in a day
um i don't know anywhere from six to 12
hours depends on what's going on
jesus christ
all right how's it going i understand we
have some disagreements
yeah i think um for uh
to reframe i think it's fair to say that
um i you you probably want to talk i
noticed that a bunch of people
were um commenting about me wanting to
quote de-platform you i don't know if
you want to talk about that get that out
of the way
no that's a pretty easy because you'll
just say oh i don't want anybody to be
de-platformed and you said that in your
video so it's kind of boring i'd rather
talk about the political issues they're
more entertaining to me
sure yeah so the so in that video the
clip was forgetting all the surroundings
should you didn't get in any uh trouble
no that video was like six months old
i'm not sure why you wrote recently on
it but
oh wow okay maybe it just surfaced
recently then
it's posted on my channel it's not it
didn't surface anywhere just came start
tweeted and you noticed the tweet but
don't worry a lot of people piled in on
it yeah that's probably why
uh so your point is
that you believe political violence is
is good right
i don't know why i say it's good but i
justifiable yeah of course are you
justified
yeah that's fair you said i want i'm
passed to quote with something like i'm
past
just political discourse i'm for
political violence because conservatives
are ruining my country is that a fair
representation
yeah i think so sure okay so
why why to which part
well what do you think the violence is
going to do um
well i don't actually so this is here
comes some uncomfortable nuance i
generally don't advocate for like full
revolution that's like some communist
socialist [ __ ]
um i get pretty upset and i do believe
it can be justifiable but i don't know
if like going full like
violent revolution is necessarily the
way to go i typically don't advocate for
it usually when you hear me talk about
these things i'll say something along
the lines of like
um i think that uh violence against
certain political groups in the us can
be
like morally justified i think there are
groups of people that definitely could
justify it but i don't know if like
going full-scale revolution is the way
to go we might get to that point though
maybe sooner rather than later but
well i think we would probably agree
that there are cases for it
where it's the people versus the
government
no well i mean the government is by the
people and for the people in the united
states so it's the people versus the
people the government gets its power
from the people
okay so is there a scenario where
let's actually use let's use my scenario
since you did your research on me right
so this guy i can't give too many
specifics but everybody knows
the the gist right so this guy
in my opinion didn't like my political
stances and
attacked me for it in his mind he
probably felt like it was
morally good or right but it didn't help
his cause in fact it made my voice
louder
you know what i mean okay
yeah well that's my point is that
political violence
doesn't do anything good
can you can you think of an example of
where you know
two people you know assaulting somebody
over their political ideology was a good
thing yeah the founding of the united
states
the entire civil rights movement women's
suffrage i mean what do you mean every
major turning point the civil war
i mean in history has usually been
enacted on by violent conflict
okay so you're expanding your phrase so
you're saying you're talking about
when you say you want violence against
conservatives you're talking about
what wars i don't know if i wanted i
don't know if that would be effective
i'm just saying that i think it's
justifiable i think people need to be
aware of the consequences of the
of the groups that they support so is it
am i misunderstanding your point i took
your point at
as advocating for violence against let's
say the average conservative
um i don't think i would advocate for it
i mean that sounds like i'm ready to
take advantage of
marching on the street but but i think
that like i think that they should be
aware that that could be a consequence
of their actions
sure that the average conservative
should keep that in mind
i don't understand how that outcome is
good though or
so you're saying it's more there's a
moral argument for it what is the moral
argument sure so the moral argument is
that conservatives in the united states
are already enacting violence on large
groups of people and that for them to
respond with violence and kind is
something that most people would see as
a defensive measure
so for instance let's say that you were
one of the 800 000 daca people that were
facing deportation potentially under
conservative rule um that would be a
violent action by the government trying
to remove you from where you live or
let's say that you're somebody that's
going to lose their health insurance
because of the repeal
of the uh mandate for health care that
might be something that you look at a
conservative like what the [ __ ] you're
literally voting me to die
i think that these are people or people
that support these groups of people
could have like justifiable qualms
or or justifiable uh retaliations
against people that
are in favor of these types of policies
in the u.s
well what you're saying is pretty broad
i'm i'm seeing specifically
voters right i'm talking about voters
the average conservative voter yep that
if you're voting for people
that are depriving other people of their
health insurance if you're voting for
people that are depriving people of
their
ability to exist in the u.s if you're
voting for people that are
nazis or whatever or or extremely like
alt-right people or whatever
in certain areas that yeah the the
consequence of that vote could be that
other people could
could see that you were like a threat to
their existence yeah
hmm yeah i suppose you could justify it
to yourself my point would be that uh
it's not going to help your cause well
you're talking about two different
things
you're talking about the effectiveness
of the measure and you're talking about
whether it can be justified
so do you agree that you agree that the
violence could be justified
i believe yeah i would agree that
someone could justify it yes
wait then what do we disagree on i don't
think we disagree on that much that's
what i'm always trying to say like you
you got me as like some
ultra alt-right guy i'm not i'm well
i mean in your video you heard it much
more strongly you make it sound like
what i'm talking about is the equivalent
of violence against black people do you
think that violence against black people
can be justified in the us
i think making that i think i was just
pointing out that if you had changed
that word in this statement
people would not have agreed with you
well of course because you're talking
about two totally different things
like i hate people that rape children
really well if you changed people that
rape children to black people i bet
people wouldn't agree well of course
they're two totally different things
well yeah
an average run-of-the-mill conservative
though isn't
enacting policy as you put it yeah but
this is kind of the american problem is
that we do a lot of
dumb [ __ ] and and we don't seem to want
to take responsibility for actions and i
just don't agree with that anymore
um when you look at things like 9 11 or
you look at all of our foreign policy
decisions you know abroad
i think that it's time that as an
american i think you people need to wake
up and understand like hey the things
that i do have
you know repercussions there are i have
responsibilities to the people that i
vote in office because
what i do impacts people around the
world i mean if you stay home and don't
vote i guess i would have less of a
qualm with you but if you're going to
like
take the action to go to the voting
booth you're going to vote in people
that are going to act violent measures
against other people
then i think yeah you need to be aware
that there could be repercussions for
your actions i think it's totally
justifiable for people to take issue
with you up to like violent levels or
whatever i think that's i think that's a
that's not really a controversial
statement i don't think
i think that one could justify it in
their own mind and if that's your
argument
then when i say when i say one could
justify it i mean using
any conventional morality any morality
that people believe in like generally in
the west would have to agree with my
position
for instance if somebody's standing in
front of you with a gun threatening to
shoot you i think that
most people could justify taking
preempted defensive action against that
person most people would be okay with
that using any form of conventional
morality that people in the west believe
in
if somebody was telling a person to go
and kill you much the same and i think
they could extend that pretty easily to
people that support people
politicians that enact policies that are
a threat to your existence
for instance if you're a transgender
person you're in the military and you're
facing the loss of your job and career
um yeah or people that follow their daca
people for health care
yeah i think that these are people that
totally have have legitimate grievances
with conservative conservatives
well i think that it's unreasonable
to 100 endorse everything somebody
does in office right like i don't know
who i mean i don't really care who you
voted for right but like i'll just say
my
for example i've only voted i think like
three times
maybe maybe four and uh i voted on
different sides almost every single time
but it's not like when you vote in for
example obama that
because i voted for him i automatically
endorse 100 percent of everything he
says
i think that the majority of the
republican party seems to support the
majority of trump's agenda right now i
think that's pretty evidenced by sona's
popularity based on the presence at
rallies
based on the positions that a lot of the
republicans in congress are taking like
um yeah i wouldn't i wouldn't buy that
um well we voted for him but we don't
really like any of his policies i don't
think i would
back that oh well i can give you i mean
yes
an exception has improved the rule but i
mean i voted for him and there's a lot
he does that i don't
that i don't agree with i think most
people that voted for him at least let's
say the the group of people that you
might classify as reluctant
trump voters uh absolutely how could you
be a reluctant trump voter
well people that voted for him
viewing it as maybe the worst of two
evils in what way i suppose you could
say don't vote
you know what in what way is that what
wait in what way is the worst of two
evils or the lesser worst
of two evils well people think that way
yeah but i'm asking i'm asking you
specifically well that you just said
that is your stance how could you not
defend it well
anybody that drove down the street with
a never hillary bumper sticker do you
think that they were endorsing donald
trump exclusively or do you think they
were more voting against him
i mean when i mean it's a republican
president that's going to put in
republican supreme court justices i mean
it's
voting for a republican in office is a
pretty big thing i mean
what what is the what policy positions
or whatever or what did trump stand for
that was opposite to hillary that was
like worth
i guess voting for trump for over
hillary well i can't speak for anyone
above myself sure so for yourself
i don't think it's fair i mean i will
think i mean i think it's reasonable
i think we can agree that there are
people that voted that way are you
contending that people didn't vote for
trump because they thought he was less i
mean that happens in every election
sure but i'm just i'm curious what the
policy positions are of trump
that would be like well trump had this
really good thing related to this and
that's why i wanted to vote for him
because you might be able to find some
nuance there sure but like i don't think
that that nuance is going to be found in
somebody like trump
yeah well let me give you i can maybe
give you an example so
and this isn't me whether or not i agree
with her now but this is an example i
think
the uh pro
war versus protect home stance right
i'm not saying this was true or not
about hillary clinton but there's the
narrative that
she was kind of hawkish and and trump
was running on this well take care of
our own first
and that was one of the first things
that pissed me off about him is when he
went and [ __ ] bombed syria right away
after promising that you know he wasn't
going to do that [ __ ] anymore yep and
increase the drone strikes in yemen i
think more civilians died under like the
first year
i disagree with that wholeheartedly um
you know it won't be the first time a
polish politician lies but i mean i
think that's an example where somebody's
like well i'm not
i'm not you know wait so you're
surprised that the got you're surprised
at the guy that said that we need to
kill the families of terrorists
that that guy ended up being hawkish in
terms of foreign policy that was
surprising to you
totally unforeseeable i didn't say it
was surprised i said that it went
against something he said and that could
have
influenced voters people
you asked for an example of how does you
know how would somebody choose
yeah but i mean like there are literally
quotes i'm saying like i'm going to bomb
the [ __ ] out of him like he talked
extensively about bringing back
more forms of torture that he was going
to kill the families of terrorists like
i mean this is
pretty clear and all of it right you're
hyper informed though destiny you know
that
you're hyperinformed most people vote on
what one or two issues right
okay so it can't be the war issue it's
got to be something different
why well it's not the same one or two
issues for everybody i mean there are
people out there that still vote
based on abortion law when that's a dead
meme at this point
okay so you don't think that those
people should face any consequences for
the politicians that they vote for you
think that they're free of that because
there's one or two issues that are more
important to them
maybe voting on some issue is more
important to them than the rights of say
lgbt people or people that are here via
daca or people that are relying on the
aca for healthcare
well i think that everybody has their
own opinion you know their own things
that are important to them individually
to you though yeah for some people like
being able to live in the united states
or being able to survive
are important things for some people so
do you think that if somebody else
thinks it's more important that we have
some other position
that you should just forego your
interest in like your right to secure
health care
or your right to exist in the u.s where
you've been your whole life
well my point the point of this
conversation is to discuss whether or
not political violence would be
something i'd advocate for there and i
absolutely would not
because it's not going to change how
they voted and it's not going to change
anything and what you're advocating for
is
you want it against conservatives but
you know oh then that means that
it holds true for liberals as well yeah
but the argument is that conservatives
are already
well yeah the argument is conservatives
are already enacting this violence they
do it via ice they do it via legislation
um it's it's not like a thing that obama
deported a few people to my man
okay i'm saying so obama
they're all wait what does obama have to
do with this hold on wait that was like
eight years ago
i'm sorry yeah well he would be a
liberal candidate right
yeah but what do we why are we talking
about obama
i'm making the point that both sides of
the aisle do these things
but you advocate for only violence
against conservatives
okay because right now we're talking
about conservatives yeah maybe you could
have advocated for violence under obama
if we were somebody that was being
deported by obama back then sure i mean
i wouldn't disagree that okay so
right so your point is then that both
sides
you advocate for violence either way
then
it's it's it's morally acceptable for
either side of the aisle so you advocate
for violence against
liberals or democrats too then if you if
they're do
sure i think that there are consequences
to the people that you vote for right
now my
problem is that i think conservatives
are legitimately destroying the country
if if not the world
um so yeah i mean those are the people
that have calls right now but i'm sure
liberals could do it as well i say
liberals democrats could do it as well
sure
all right well so then i i think i would
i mean i don't agree with you but if you
if you view it that way
evenly on both sides then it's hard to
argue that you know i think
you the argument that someone could
self-justify violence
if they believe their life is in danger
that's a true statement
i i don't think that enacting violence
is going to change anything i think in
it it gets it undermines what people are
trying to do even
if in that moment you feel like it's the
right thing to do
well i mean like right now health care
is being defunded in the united states
um daca recipients are facing possible
deportation transgender people are being
kicked out of the military
um i mean like this is violence that's
happening right now
well i wouldn't call getting kicked out
of the military violent
really being forcibly removed from your
career you wouldn't consider that a
violent action of the state
i don't think so i don't know maybe i
don't know if i like the word my problem
is with the word violence i think if
you're in the military
i can see an argument for providing them
some sort of payment or allowing them to
serve their country i don't have a
problem with
uh trans folks being in the army if they
want to serve their country they're
good by me there are arguments for it
that i've heard but you don't think
somebody removing all of your income
and forcing you to change jobs that's
not that's not like a form of violence
you don't think
i don't know if that's what they're
doing are they removing their income or
are they paying them out
and retiring they're being kicked out
they're not being retired at full
benefits they're being basically kicked
out of the military if you're a trans
person you're not allowed to serve
anymore there's some i think like 10 000
trans people or whatever
well i disagree with that i wouldn't
call that an act of violence though
i would hope that they would be
compensated if they're not then i
disagree with that um
i think if you accepted their service at
a time then you have a
responsibility and a loyalty to them
just because the law changed today
you should back what you uh what you
agreed to at the time
okay so would i advocate for them going
on the street and
finding someone with a mega hat and
punching them no i would not
i don't think that does their cause any
good and i don't think it's gonna change
any minds
in the mega hat person in that scenario
that's that's
what do you okay so going back to the
trump thing what what policy positions
would you support for him that would
make it more important than
say daca people or healthcare people in
the united states
protecting this country and getting out
of foreign wars
i would rate that higher personally yeah
it's less military spending more
effort on taking care of problems at
home
that includes immigration right includes
people here
everyone needs more assistance than what
they're getting and i believe we're
wasting a lot of money
playing world police and talked about
why
okay and then trump well he didn't lie
he talked about raising the military
budget he talked about killing all sorts
of people he wants to bomb the hell out
of him and go in and rebuild everything
like
um i yeah i don't understand how you
could vote for a republican expect less
military funding i don't understand
um
well there's being duped i mean every
president of all time has
has lied and almost never delivered on
anything well you're not there's being
duke and then there's a guy like dipping
his dick in chocolate and saying like
come eat my candy bar like this is not
like a dude like
if you watched literally any speech or
any debate we weren't talking about
obama
no if we if you can literally watch like
anything related to trump and it's not a
duke
um but i guess if you're just not like
informed at all on the issues i guess
this maybe makes sense or i don't know
where you can get your news from but you
possibly think that trump was going to
decrease the military spending
or pull us out of foreign wars i don't
understand well he literally said that
he was going to do that if i remember
correctly
i mean i'm not going to your chat is
more adept at googling but i'm pretty
sure i remember him saying that at one
point whether or not it was true
whether or not you think anyone's stupid
for believing that doesn't change the
fact that he did he did say it you know
okay well after the i guess after trump
has revealed himself for the great
deceiver are you gonna vote for him
again in a year
in 2020 it's unlikely i'm not sure who i
like right now
um i mean i'm hoping that we get some
more reasonable candidates
out there but i don't know there's
nobody i'm i'm really in love with right
now
and uh sell me on somebody i should be
um i don't know how about our
how about our bernie boy uh
he's a little old i don't know isn't he
just like a few years older than trump
i think right maybe just a few i'm not a
i was i was uh initially i thought
bernie would have won
in uh 2016 easily
if he didn't uh make the decision that
he did
i think he probably wins that election
maybe i'm wrong
but now the problem is rerunning and
rerunning again
people just kind of get it's like do you
rerun hillary no you know
bernie's already had his chance twice
now i'm not sure that he's
he's the guy bernie's 77
trump 72 in five years i mean he could
be a one-term guy
get in there and legalize it i'm i'd be
for
gotcha um
well i yeah sorry it wasn't uh very
fiery this is a
you know not a close home issue but i do
i do well everybody seemed to like want
to make videos about me getting banned
from twitch or whatever for some video
from six months ago because i have the
absurd position that political violence
can be justified and it's one of like
the coldest takes i've ever given like
it's super basic like
anybody with it has even the slightest
understanding of any political theory is
going to be like well of course
obviously like political violence is a
reality that everybody faces
at all points in time so i was just very
curious how everybody seemed to have
such a strong opinion about it but
nobody wants to talk about it and then
when i do get the chance to talk people
about it they usually back away from it
almost immediately
i like the entire country was founded on
political violence and a lot of the
turning points in our history have been
brought about because of political
violence yeah i mean i think
we don't disagree on that i where we
disagree with is
you know taking it to the streets
between citizens
uh i i don't believe that i mean i've
made my point on that
uh you know i don't think that
you should you know so i'm clear and you
already understand my point is like
i don't think you should be banned from
twitch for that and it's also easier to
make a point
in a 10-minute conversation than a
30-second twitch clip
i didn't know i didn't know uh keem
headed out for you
okay
why wouldn't you have gone through the
effort of like just finding out where it
came from like you
because you went through the effort of
making a 15-minute video on this but you
had no idea where it even
well the statement itself stands alone
in terms of comparing it to
terms of service and freedom of speech
which is what i was trying to talk to
talk to talk about you know what i mean
but you just said that having like a
longer conversation about it makes it
sound a lot different than just a 30
second clip
well twitch doesn't care well then why
am i not banned
i'm not sure well i mean i think twitch
does have a bias
don't you agree then why have i been
banned before
what were you banned for before the
f-bomb i think yeah and then i got um
i mentioned something about uh cuban
people and political violence or
whatever because my
for a conversation with mom um and then
i made a joke about a friend about
bombing like
his family when we were playing league
of legends and i got banned for that
well that's i mean that's pretty spicy
the the
the r or n bombs are basically auto
bands
these days i think on twitch uh the
other issue i don't know
i know that i i don't follow your many
bands
i mean i'm glad you're still here i'm
glad you aren't banned but uh
hopefully you don't go in the streets
and and attack people just stick to
making out with other dude's girlfriends
okay i saw that clip going around i said
why is this
what is happening um i just like to you
know live my life
yeah yeah i get it you're a single guy
whatever yeah
all right what how do you feel about
wait what do you what's the problem with
agender robots and apex legends
agenda robots yeah why are you so mad
about this
this is a common i mean this is a common
critique that i get
and i think it's fair my problem is
never in
their existence it's
just in the way that it's marketed and
and
used to like you know buy walk points
that's really
all i ever critique on i've never once
said they shouldn't exist i only have a
problem with how
shit's marketed or pandered and how
should it be marketed i'm not gonna
lie i had no idea it was an agender
robot until i watched your video
yeah and i i mean it doesn't matter to
99 of people that play the game
wait then why does it matter enough for
you to make like multiple videos on this
stuff
that's because what i do man you what do
you do you create content too
about issues that i think commercial i
created cookies
because cookies are good but this is
just my live stream i mean i put out
like [ __ ]
50 hours a week of live stream [ __ ] but
in terms of stuff that i upload to my
youtube like usually i do things that i
think matter like that's what i would
make videos about or things that i think
are important to talk about so i mean
like if you're gonna shout out like a
constant stream of videos decrying
the lgbt whatever [ __ ] people in
society i think it would be reasonable
for me to assume
that oh well this person thinks it's a
big deal are you telling me now that
none of the videos you put on your
channel or things you care much about
well i don't think you'll find a single
video in a thousand videos where i talk
about
having a problem with lgbt people i
never have never
i've never said that i never have any
issues i mean you literally have videos
where you're like why do i have to watch
gay people kissing in comics
well that's a pretty reductive i'd have
to go back and look at the actual video
i make three a day
you know i think that some videos are
more important to me than others
i think uh and i'm here telling you
i i don't have any problem with agenda
robots
i don't have any problem with uh you
know
gay people in video games or in real
life um
i only make fun of poke fun at
corporations that basically stand on
that community for marketing which is in
my opinion what they do
they don't really care i don't think
corporations really care about
about these issues i think that they
know that it gets retweeted and it gets
positive press that's my opinion
sure they do it for money but that
doesn't necessarily make it wrong or bad
well that's only my only point though is
that just reminding people that they
don't really care
i mean if it's a net positive okay fine
but i'm still gonna laugh at them
when they do it i don't have any
problems i mean you do more than laugh
at them like in that video that i saw
you talking about the
gay people in the comics you're like
when i see this it makes me want to
throw up
i i mean like yeah i mean i'd have to go
back and look at the video that sounds
pretty spicy for me
oh man i'm not saying i didn't say it
i'm saying no the problem is like in
this conversation now you are like the
most like
conceited or not conceited you're you're
like very um
protective very like kind very careful
with your words but then i watch like
videos that you make
and it's like small boob like women are
destroying the [ __ ] world it's like
you're so much
no but it is like you realize like this
is the kind of [ __ ] that you like that
large like that video that that
professor dude made or whatever right
like this is what you do right you rile
people up to get them to go online and
to [ __ ] all over people whatever and
then at the end of the day like you come
back like oh well i don't really care
much
about this stuff like do you not think
you have an impact on communities online
or do you just not give a [ __ ] or is it
maybe it's just all the money for you i
guess you don't really care about any of
these issues at all or
i don't really care about the money i
have a day job um i don't plan on ever
quitting my day job um
i cover things that are trending
um i don't yeah but it's with this like
cancerous like
like the same thing no [ __ ] is this
weird anti-sjw take where like
the women's and the gays are like
destroying everything and it's like this
huge crisis that like gay people are in
media or women or in media or that women
don't have huge boobs or whatever like i
don't know it's like
well it's okay to not like my content
man it's not about not liking your
content
i think you do a demonstrable harm to
the public discourse i mean the ideas
that you spread like cause people to act
in ways that i think are horrible
um or or serve as a detriment to society
it's not just i don't like your videos i
think they're really bad like on like a
virtue level not like they're
shitty videos i mean they're okay videos
in terms of doing what you want to do
with the videos
but i mean advocating for violence is is
not a problem
no because that coincides with the
particular values
wait that's like saying that like if i
come into a room and i say i hate all
gay people
and then i also come to the room and i
say i think you should be able to kill
somebody who's a nazi and you're like oh
so you're okay with killing people but
you're not okay with
hating gay people well yeah of course
these are two totally different things
i mean you already agreed with me about
the political violence thing so why are
you bringing that up
we agree that i no we agree that someone
can justify it to themselves yes
wait what is justified to themselves
then when i say justified i mean like
using any conventional like moral system
that most people in the west would
adhere to
so not using some crazy [ __ ] [ __ ]
that most people would understand that
like political violence is justifiable
i don't know what you mean by justify it
to yourself that sounds like a really
circular way of saying nothing at all
no somebody can feel like something's
justified let's say for example
your family was murdered and then you
arrived in court
and uh killed the
alleged uh whatever uh perpetrator
right that person believes their act is
morally good or justified
but it's not okay okay okay so let's say
that you are somebody that lives in this
country under daca and let's say that
you know that a bunch of conservatives
are going out to vote
for politicians that are going to try to
remove you from this country do you
think that those people
will be justified in your eyes as
enacting forms of violence against
people or no
in their eyes is that sorry i was like
using your moral system with these
people
i'm sorry using your moral system would
these people be allowed to do it are
they just supposed to sit and take it
hmm well i think they're still breaking
the law and i don't think they're
providing anything positive do you think
that laws equal morality
what's that do you think is law and
morality the same thing or
i'm only asking in terms of morality
okay so then why are we bringing the law
they feel i'm not asking what they feel
i'm asking under your moral system let's
say that i was going to take a vote
let's say tomorrow all of us got to vote
to remove you from the united states
you're going to be forcibly kicked out
and deported to some country you've
never been to before
do you think that you would be justified
in acting violence against those people
that were voting on that
no i would not okay so then do you
believe that the people in south africa
all of the white people who are having
their land taken from them and killed by
black people do you think that it's okay
that they should just have to take that
why does their color matter because
that's what's going on in south africa
right now a lot of it is
centered around rays
um
i don't think it makes their actions
correct but
i can understand why they would feel
that way
okay so then it's not so then if
somebody well i mean it's a real life
exam
everything i'm using right now is a real
life example right it's very frustrating
to me because like
you're you're saying that these are
extreme examples but these are people's
lived experiences
right now in the united states right now
in the u.s there are people losing
health insurance because the aca is
being defended
right now in the u.s that has health
insurance
nobody's preventing that well that's
but they could purchase it on the open
market like i do and i assume they might
not have the money to purchase it on the
open market and no i don't buy it
anymore because i don't have to it's not
about whether it's somebody's fault it's
about whether or not somebody should
have access to health care
wait you don't have health care no [ __ ]
no
come on man you got to have that you
never know at least carry major medical
dude
i do that [ __ ] that's a lot of [ __ ]
money my dude 500 bucks every six months
for major medical is what what i um i
guess a couple years ago what i paid
that's just for like er visits okay well
the cheapest [ __ ] that i had available
me was like 300 a month so
yeah yeah i did only major medical at
that time which was basically like
5 000 deductible and then if you end up
in a car wreck you know you don't go
bankrupt
think about it but anyway yeah i think
i'll clarify my point and that is that i
don't believe
enacting violence on on other voters
based on the results of
something their elected officials did is
productive
or good or right because you don't know
what their if they even endorse that
opinion or not once they've cast that
vote
um i don't know what power they have to
disagree or change it
in these extreme scenarios where
somebody's coming with
you know guns to steal my land i suppose
i would have to agree that you you
should be able to defend yourself in
that scenario so
okay so what about conservatives sending
ice to like deport you from the country
if you're here under daca
but there's not it's not just
conservatives the government con
exists of more than just conservatives
sure but conservatives are the ones that
are talking about getting rid of daca
not republicans
or not democrats right and the democrats
have the ability to
prevent that from happening well they
might
now i'm not sure because trump is the
president
what they yeah they can
i mean trump hasn't gotten dick done
they're doing pretty good job well
i mean i'm pretty sure that uh daca came
via executive order so i can be revoked
to be executive order i think they're
fighting um
i think they're fighting that in the
courts now i think i'm not entirely sure
okay but um also yeah also republicans
still have
uh the senate majority in the senate too
so although i don't think that matters
but not really i guess regardless i'm
just looking at looking at the
philosophical idea of it
this just doesn't i i don't know if
you're just resistant to agree because
of the implications but like this seems
pretty basic to me
that if i lived in this country my
family lived here now and i've been here
my whole life and i don't know any other
country
and there's a group of people going to
vote on somebody that's going to
forcibly remove me from this country and
eject me into another one i've never
been in before
like it doesn't seem that extreme to say
like hey you know
i might be justified in in acting forms
of violence against these people that
doesn't seem to be like that extreme
i just yeah it does though to me it
seems so crazy to
you know some 80 year old woman your
next door neighbor who voted for
somebody you don't like you go punch him
because you're like well that person did
something i don't like that's not the
person you should be
you don't think it's a little extreme
that like hey the government is going to
show up and at gunpoint
forcibly remove me from my house and
kick my whole family out of this country
you don't think that's pretty extreme
too
it is i i wouldn't support that either
but i also said it's happening
nanny next door could do anything about
it other than just take your
punch or vote differently yeah
but your attack on them isn't going to
cause them to vote differently well of
course i mean
as a means to change people well i mean
i mean political violence has worked in
the past to get people to change their
minds on [ __ ]
right a lot of the civil rights movement
was based on that kind of stuff
i doubt it was the violence that
perpetuated it though
i mean i'm pretty sure most my history
is real [ __ ] but
i would be shocked if there was a
history major that was going to come and
disagree with me
that most major movements in history
have been enacted on on the backs of
violence like violent
violence is typically how things get
done in terms of like major shifts and
like
people's either legal systems or the way
that societies view things or the
organization of countries like
and i'm pretty sure the civil rights
movement is not an exception to that
well i'm not sure in the civil rights
movement though if they were breaking
down the doors of people that voted the
way they didn't like and beating them up
yeah i'm not necessarily advocating with
police i think
i mean i don't think you should be like
breaking into people's houses i don't
know if that's the type of political
violence i'd be talking about but maybe
things related to like people always
freak out about like anti-fat rallies
or or that type of stuff might be a
little bit different
yeah i don't i don't support what i
who's the other side of the antifa the
other ones
the um who's the ones uh that always
show up again
with the stick guy uh i don't support
either one of them i don't support
throwing trash cans through starbucks
windows i don't think
it makes you look bad and i think it's a
net negative for what you really want
maybe these antifa people have
truly good desires you know but
ultimately what's going to reach the
news is some crazy mass person
throwing a trash can through a window
and people are going to not want to be a
part of that
yeah i don't necessarily disagree which
is why i don't personally advocate for
violence i don't think it's i don't
think we're at that stage yet in the
united states where people should be
like violently attacking people
but i mean like it bothers me that
people don't recognize the violence
that's currently right now being enacted
on large groups of people in the u.s and
they act like it doesn't happen
and that if anybody suggests that the
opposite could happen that all of a
sudden that's a horrible thing
yeah i don't know if i i don't think i
disagree i mean i probably disagree on
the
application the word violence but
you know i don't think that it's good to
uproot people and move them from their
home
you know if if my if you're talking
about immigration
you know i think the best way to
approach it is you know if they're here
they should stay
i i don't think it makes sense to be
deporting people at this point i mean
if you want to really fix it you stop
the influx and let the people stay there
already here it just it seems like a
waste of time and money
um but you know and i can see if you are
here
you might view that as violence but i
think the best thing to do is
we have another election coming up what
do you think what do you think trump's
odds are i would say
55
um i mean i don't know it really depends
on
what happens between now and then well
sure
i suppose so so so then we don't
necessarily disagree you do believe that
most people using most conventional
moral systems you could justify
political violence against certain
groups of people
like conservatives in the united states
that are voting for you to be removed
from the country
i don't well i think they could they
might be able to justify yes i don't
i'll put it that way is that a fair
enough way to way to end it i don't
think uh
physically attacking somebody for the
way they voted is gonna change anything
not necessarily change anything but it
could be justified if somebody let's say
if somebody goes to the polls
and they literally single justified yeah
so they're a single-issue voter they
said i'm voting because i want you
kicked out of the country
that somebody could like enact violence
against that person
and be justified in doing so you think
that that would be like unacceptable
like oh yeah sure like
i understand that yeah i think i would
agree that
they i just don't think i would justify
it but that doesn't mean they wouldn't
have a case for it
is that a fair way to put yeah i guess
sure
i wouldn't do it but certainly some
people would agree with their actions
and uh hey chat sorry i made you wait i
do
i gotta dip but uh okay have a have a
good stream man yeah be good
i'll uh i'll uh i'll keep an eye out for
that next
sure thing
that's almost as bad as boogie
i don't i it's i don't know how to like
i don't know how to do this
i'm not sure we should have i don't know
what to do when somebody like squirms
and weasels out of like everything
they've
said i don't know like how to i don't
know how to do that like
like this guy will make like the most
strongly worded youtube videos
and then when you try like okay what do
you think about this like wow i mean
i i don't know about anything i don't
really care about that i don't really
care about that i don't really care
about like well what the [ __ ] do you
care about like the checks you get from
[ __ ] google adsense like
uh
well never mind i guess like we were
never gonna debate about the sjw videos
so it's fine that we didn't go hard on
that i guess but the um
and we i told you at the beginning i
said i'll probably bring him over to my
side of political violence and he
totally 100 agreed with that so [ __ ] it
i mean i can say that one i don't care
[ __ ] it dude
um i don't think that the conversation
is quite as black and white
as i have presented it um i do think for
instance like let's say you do have to
vote between like
let's say you have to vote between like
hillary and trump unless you've got a
foreign person who's facing potential
violence due to the foreign policy of
the u.s right
um whether you vote for hillary or trump
you're probably supporting that type of
foreign violence right i do think that
some of these issues can get a little
bit murky
um i guess like what i'm what i'm just
when i'm more
hopeful of although like arguably like
the reason why these politicians exist
in the first place is because of like
how americans like look
at um at like these issues it really
really really bothers me that people
think there are no consequences for the
way that they vote i don't like that
people think that way i say americans
i'm sure this applies all over the world
but like if you support
if you support an institution that
enacts violence against groups of people
i mean you should be ready to receive it
in kind um i i don't think that you
should have this idea that you're
somehow free of free from consequence
because you vote a certain way
like um i don't know like i look at [ __ ]
like 9 11 like so much differently now
when you look at the massive amount of
dumb [ __ ] the us does in the middle east
like all the [ __ ] time
like like when i hear people complain
about like middle eastern terrorism
against the united states especially
[ __ ] related to isis
right like i i just i imagine like the
pikachu face like what the [ __ ] like i
mean like
like is this really that surprising like
i mean
you should probably be ready for [ __ ]
like this you know it's a natural
consequence of your actions
um yeah i don't know it just it really
bothers me that people seem to think
that
um it really bothers me that people seem
to think that
your voting has no consequences i'm not
sure
does justine think uh violence against
communists can be morally justifiable
like i guess people think about like
eating [ __ ] like landlords and [ __ ]
all the time yeah probably
but um to be so to be clear um i don't
know if it matters because people always
quote [ __ ] out of whatever all the time
anyway i don't think that we're at the
point in the united states yet where you
should be going around like punching and
killing people like that's i don't i
think we're way way way far away from
that
um i don't think that you should um i
don't think that you should like uh i
don't i don't
advocate people say advocate for
political violence i don't think you
should advocate for political violence
um or or violent violence uh like like
going on like punching and killing
people and shooting up stores and
shooting up the government i don't think
that's good i think that it does more
harm than good right now
and we might reach that at some point
but yeah i don't i don't think i think
that i mean like our institutions are
still
existing in the us like we can still
vote and whatnot but
destiny what would be a line in the sand
for you um
i guess like at the end of the day i'm
still a consequentialist so i would be
looking to like effect the greatest
amount of change um and i don't think
violence right now gets us there you'd
have to be like everybody would have to
be on board with it or something right i
don't know
what do you think the u.s has done to
the middle east before 9 11 that
justified it without googling oh [ __ ]
dude i don't remember i read the um
at one point i'd read um there were like
three big
they're called fatwas fatwa i don't know
how to pronounce it f-a-t-w-a-h i think
that bin laden had written and half of
it was like some weird islamic [ __ ]
and then the other half detailed like
pretty specifically
like events that the united states had
been involved with oh is it fatwa
um that the united
was st um i mean
i i mean like it's not like it's a
mystery i'm pretty sure you can google
these
um um
yeah a lot of people were upset about
things related to the first gulf war i
mean a lot of the stuff that we do in
the middle east is kind of like picking
sides on an issue and then supporting
certain sides
you know like on one end we fight sunni
extremism when we go after isis on
another end we fund sunni extremism by
ally aligning ourselves with the gulf
states i mean we you know we dismantled
the iraqi government that we propped up
because saddam helped us
um and liked us and then we went in and
we removed him and then we [ __ ] the
whole government up and then we
basically
let isis more or less come out of that
like i mean
oh yeah the iranian coop you can't
choose to be a minority but you can
choose to be a capitalist
why would communists hating capitalist
and eating the rich be okay
to do violence against them
um well because if you're a communist
talk about conan is stealing it with
somebody [ __ ] or whatever i don't know
[ __ ] that [ __ ]
get the [ __ ] out of here i got the point
of bringing south africa do you think
further these talking points about how
white people are being targeted could
give it legitimacy
oh i don't know i just like to bring it
up because i know that um people freak
out all the time like oh white people
have been killed in south africa which
may or may not be true i don't know
enough about it but
