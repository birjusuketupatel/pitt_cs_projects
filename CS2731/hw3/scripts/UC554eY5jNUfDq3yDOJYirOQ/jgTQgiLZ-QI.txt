all right boys it's time
joining me now is hassan [ __ ] uh he is
part of the cyt network he does
breakdown and and now a new show agit
problem uh hassan
uh welcome and uh listen you're on
because uh
you said uh some things that a lot of
people including myself find very
offensive
uh you did not say it on the young turks
network you said it on your own twitch
channel
um uh one at a time and have a
conversation about it in the past when
conservatives have said offensive things
um i have said that uh they should keep
their job and we should have a
conversation about it i said it about
megyn kelly don is in russia
oh he's saving him and so here we are
i'm living up to what i said about
conservatives and progressives were
having a conversation
so uh you said america deserved 9 11.
did you mean that
no obviously not especially considering
the fact that while that is a very viral
quote that is going around currently
if those people were at least even
remotely charitable or
cared about the actual truth of what i
was talking about they would understand
that
within context i was simply referencing
foreign policy decisions and are arming
of insurgent groups
in the region and our efforts in
destabilizing the middle east
have a direct consequence a boomerang
effect rather if you will
uh in in causing 9 11. of course
every part of what i advocate for is
against violence
i i abhor violence i think it's awful
and as a matter of fact
i was very frustrated with the fact that
dan crenshaw
a person who uh four times voted
nay on on bills that would stop
arming saudi arabia uh he voted no four
times on those bills
uh it would would turn around and talk
about
uh the necessity for endless violence
and that uh this
simply was happening because these
people
this simply was happening because of uh
because these people just hated us
they hated us because they hate us i'm
paraphrasing but
i thought that was awful i i thought
that that was horrific
and uh in that moment i
said i thought at the very least i was
saying that
you can draw a direct line basically
that it was a consequence of
all the things that we have done in the
region this is not a controversial thing
to say
which is precisely why i followed up by
saying what why are you guys getting
upset at me there's a live chat there's
a back and forth conversation on twitch
for those of you who are unfamiliar said
why are you getting upset at me
nothing i'm saying is controversial
implying that i didn't even understand
immediately why what i was saying was
uh so outside of the balance of reason
considering that uh
hillary clinton has had a similar and
correct opinion on this
talking about how we did fund al qaeda
okay
and and numerous other
academics on both sides of the political
spectrum so when you're talking about
one of the causes of uh 911 being
american foreign policy it's not just
chomsky donald trump
getting abused by a brutal and
unapologetic dictator is how commies
feel at home
nice thanks bud they're saying americans
deserve 911 is a completely different
statement and one that's wrong no i
didn't say americans deserve 9 11. i
said america deserves nothing
but that's well maybe you can chalk it
up to english being my second language
or whatever you want to chalk it up too
okay he has to never okay listen
i love assad okay but there are a few
things that he needs to never say again
okay
one he needs to stop pretending he's
poor okay he's almost a top one
percenter when it comes to income
okay so that that whole idea of like
being poor and being like the little
streamer blah blah blah that needs to
stop immediately one
two this esl take this english second
language take
no come on this is like comically
this is like comically dumb okay this is
not a good take
don't do this do obviously if i followed
that statement
up immediately with well we're still
continuing to fund the the nation state
responsible for this
and we act like they are our greatest
allies when
that kind of arms sale uh and and
i understand the overall policy point
you're making assad but
saying it that way is clearly wrong
because at least people are the
impressions
i should have used more precise and and
better uh use of the language there i i
it's
it's messed up that i that i would even
uh
give the opportunity are you the man
because i think you are the man
try to morally grandstand on an issue
like this
when they have uh they are
100 responsible for all the bloodshed
that has been caused
uh even some other outlets in the
mainstream media are also
culpable in this circumstance look three
thousand people died
and that's terrible that is a horrific
event i've covered this issue
numerous times i've covered the
politicize the the way that
media has politicized it in the way that
politicians have politicized this issue
numerous times there's a
article i wrote two years ago on 9 11 uh
on i will donate 50
to hassan stream tonight if he cuts off
uh jank when he tries to interrupt him
i'd be like
wait a second and this is crucial
i'm sorry i'm gonna post that you guys
can go check out if you want to
understand
exactly what i mean these are the same
people that
justified an illegal war in iraq these
are the same people that
normalized this same kind of violence
and that's precisely my point is that
uh especially a congress person who
who suffered like who who sacrificed
personally and and is now using that
sacrifice
to to in a very civil fashion albeit
uh justified endless warfare is
abhorrent to me i know that i was i know
that i was inappropriate
i understand that which is precisely why
i took action immediately as soon as i
realized like oh
this is going to be misconstrued i don't
want this to be weaponized
i don't want this to be uh i don't want
this to offend people
i immediately stopped i don't care that
he said it but the news articles are a
bad look for the left
i deleted the the vaude the video on
demand
and and i continued after that to
so you deleted it before any right
winger wrote an article about it or not
of course
of course of course because look
i talk about uh nazis
crypto fascists uh and the alt-right
quite frequently
uh i am uh vocally in defense of a lot
of the
uh a lot of the things that they oppose
okay anti-fascism being the primary
thing
which is precisely why i have a lot of
people who are waiting
sniping like looking to snipe comments
out of context
in exactly the same fashion that they
did um
last night and take it up the chain of
command as quickly as possible and
escalate it into a situation where
i have thousands of thousands of people
very publicly talking about how they
want to brutally torture me and execute
me
all right guys listen [ __ ] okay if you
can clip me out of context
i would love to go like toe to toe like
mark dice on this
i think you can make compelling
arguments for like
um wait hold on how spicy do i want to
make this take hold on let me think for
a second because i don't want to get
banned for twitch
i think that there are i think that like
because of the type of american foreign
policy that america engages in
i think that there i think that you
leave yourself open to
a lot of crazy [ __ ] that it becomes
very hard to complain about um i don't
think that people
like if i could talk to [ __ ] that mark
dice guys when i tuned it out but if i
could debate like a conservative on some
topic
i really don't think i don't think they
could i don't think they could actually
win that argument
um i remember that um remember when we
had like the violence against
conservative things
i think that that that um that arc
lasted all of like four debates or
whatever
when conservatives tried to come on and
like debate that and they fell apart
like immediately like
every time like it was obviously it was
the easiest to defend taking the world
um
but yeah okay
all right yeah which is weird but
whatever i got you so
look to me that's monumentally important
that
you misspoke and that you did not mean
that if you meant it it would be a
totally different conversation
you pulled the video immediately showing
uh in my opinion
that you didn't mean okay but by the way
now there's a whole series of lies
saying that you support al qaeda and
terrorism
when when look i this is really
important because
the point you're making technically the
america's kind of sort of
supporting al qaeda now right in syria
or we were i mean a little bit kind of
wasn't wait wait where is yankee wasn't
um weren't they working with the fsa am
i crazy
[ __ ] i don't remember
is dan crenshaw is
voting yes to saudi arabia and funding
them
and saudi arabia has funded a lot of
that terrorism i'm going to get to
the comments uh you made about crenshaw
which are also
offensive and important yeah but on that
front it's the
i'm not wrong in saying that that's the
uh the point they're making is the exact
opposite of what you were actually
yeah the question i would ask is this if
i
am supposedly a fan of all of the
terrorism that is ongoing around the
world or a fan of al-qaeda
as uh some other youtubers who have a
gigantic platform of put it
then why would i be upset at
uh the the government's decision to
continue
uh funding these groups or why would i
have been upset originally at the
government's decision to fund these
groups
and then why would i be upset at the
fact that we are still continuing to
fund
and supply arms to the saudi arabian
kingdom
which then happened to find their find
themselves in the hands
of al qaeda this is all factually
correct information this is all
well documented uh like the the arms
that we have sold
to saudi arabia at this point and they
are the number one
uh country that buys the most arms from
us as donald trump put it
and as reagan put it back in okay i
guess since we're like not friends
anywhere whatever i can be like pretty
honest
one of hassan's big problems when he um
when he when he has these like debates
is
he he's very bad at engaging the person
that he's i think debates conversations
he's usually like really bad at engaging
the other person with what they're
actually saying
um like one of the things i notice when
a son speaks is it feels like he has
like he has a lot of memorized
like kind of lines that sound really
good and what he does is like when he um
when he gets into an argument he tries
to find how to work in these lines as
much as possible it kind of reminds me
of um
in high school when um you have to do
like research and they'll say like oh
like you need to do um
where they're like oh you need to work
in like seven spot quotes into your
paper
and then when you're when you when you
read like how like the student actually
applies the quotes you can tell that
they were just trying to like work these
in in any way possible
um but yeah i i noticed that um i
noticed that a lot that when it's honest
conversations especially like on the
rash royale
it almost seems like he's trying to find
a way so that he can slide
remember marco rubio in the republican
debate when he short circuited
it feels like that like he's just trying
to find a way to kind of slide into the
uh to the old talking points that he has
which which sometimes works really well
he's hitting like a really strong
rhetorical point that he's pretty
familiar with and if it's relevant but
other times like i think like in this
interview i don't think it works as well
because it sounds like he's constantly
trying to pivot away from what he said
um rather than defend it like it feels a
lot like what about obama
what about bush what about like that
like that what aboutism
um i only plays well in some
circumstances i don't think it plays
well here
in 86 uh when there was additional
criticism
against selling armed saudi arabia why
would i criticize that
if i'm if i'm in support of al-qaeda
they're also the number one purveyor of
terrorism and that's why we fight
against the saudi government
progressives do all right uh so now
let's turn to the comments you made
about dan crenshaw
yes so and and you
oh god i guess an attempted satire
uh made very crass comments about the
eye that he lost
in afghanistan uh so first of all
uh at least everyone is assuming it's
satire including
dan crenshaw i'll quote him in a second
was a satire
yeah i don't think that the mujahideen
are actually brave
that was simply a reference to exact
john rambo 3 first and foremost wait
really that's uh no way you're gonna
backpedal that hard you wouldn't say
that like free
i'll say that that's not an edgy take at
all i think most of like the kind of
like the resistance or freedom fighters
or whatever
[ __ ] i'm sure isis has done some
crazy [ __ ] brave [ __ ] and fighting
against like the syrian army and the
isis army and the currents
the auto fill to the left in the
crafting table when crafting more than
seven redstone
okay and i'm sure that um and i'm sure
the mojo had dean have had brave
fighters i'm sure that [ __ ] i'm sure
that everybody involved in like that
kind of like um
like armed conflict has done like a lot
of brave [ __ ] that seems like a weird of
all the things to backpedal from
um but i mean i guess if you're kind of
like
foremost very famous reference the john
rambo 3 that featured
uh this movie is dedicated to the brave
mujahideen soldiers of afghanistan
uh and on top of that it was a reference
to the fact that
ronald reagan also considered them to be
brave when he was arming them when he
escalated the arms
that were when he increased the amount
of funding and training at arms and
stinger missiles that we
were giving to these groups that then uh
branched off and became the taliban and
became al-qaeda
uh so my point was hey we're doing the
exact same things that we have done in
the past
over and over again at what point will
we go
you know what maybe we should stop
meddling in the middle eastern affairs
maybe we should stop funding insurgency
groups
that we consider to be allies to
ourselves and then get surprised when
they turn around and use those weapons
against us okay stopping the bloodshed
so i understand that and i
agree with that point unfortunately i
think that what you said was
horribly counterproductive and offensive
we'll get to that in a second i want to
at least show you guys what uh some of
the things that crenshaw and hassan said
i had on twitter so when you let's go to
graphic 203 here
so no i'll get the cranshaw in a second
uh 203
that's reagan meeting with the
mujahideen that's the reference that
hassan was making and put on twitter
the ref 202 is the reference to the end
of rambo three or whatever
this film was dedicated to the brave
music fighters of afghanistan we did
fund them
yes they were fighting the soviet union
at the time that's obviously important
context but yeah but we did have bloke
you want to know some real
sad [ __ ] you want to know some real sad
[ __ ]
i don't know when i look at people who
are critical of the u.s funding the
mujahideen
you know like we're sad now because
these people grow up and [ __ ] 9 11 us
or whatever but i bet lefties are mad
because we funded people that fought the
soviet union
i was going to tweet that the other day
but i didn't feel like jumping on that
[ __ ]
back when they turned on us now dan
cranshaw i actually thought was
uh actually took it really well he went
on laura and groom's program today and
had
a lot of things to say about hassan and
the young turks
that i don't necessarily agree with but
he has acknowledged throughout
that of course it was satire here's his
tweet he said hassan
seems to confuse improvised explosive
device with some sort of
uh with some weird terrorist fantasy and
of course he lost his eye in an ied
explosion
sorry for triggering you assange you
know pete davidson stopped trying so
hard he repeated that on the laura
ingraham
uh program uh today as well and um
look i think that i disagree with dan
crenshaw's policies but in
regards to any um didn't you um didn't
the u.s
uh fund uh fun bin laden initially to
fight the ussr
so this is not true um this is a meme i
think i've even said this before but
apparently this is not true like the usa
um funded um the mujahideen which like
later on led to groups being created
that bin laden was later affiliated with
but it's not a fair characterization to
say that the united states funded or
trained bin laden
um directly or whatever that's like
that's that's not a fair statement
that's not an accurate statement
incredibly crass and offensive joke you
made he's
handled it like a champ i agree i agree
i think he i think he uh took it like a
champ i would not have expected that
considering
like i said the overwhelming amount of
commentary that i've received so far on
the
on the issue is uh uh just very public
uh displays of trying to uh kill me and
fantasizing about murdering me or
whatever which is fine it's part of the
job i understand
um having said that however i have to
make one note
okay service does not guarantee
uh respect it should not i'm sorry this
is the exact same kind of
jingle this is the exact okay so i would
be really careful here
so in my opinion i think that
service always gets respect for your
service
so if you're gonna tell me that like you
went and you served somewhere or some
[ __ ] and you got you lost like a
[ __ ] leg or whatever
i don't give a [ __ ] about your political
opinions i don't give a [ __ ] about you
know
whatever [ __ ] but i mean if you
[ __ ] served and you did that [ __ ]
i'll [ __ ] respect that like i'm not
gonna sit there especially me i'm not
gonna trash your like military [ __ ] now
if you start trying to use your
the fact that you're a vet to like win
an argument or some [ __ ] well [ __ ] you
but um i think that like i think that if
you like if you overseas or some [ __ ]
your purple hearted up and you got like
[ __ ] or whatever like i mean
you gotta give a guy like respect for
their [ __ ] service right um
now that doesn't mean you have to
respect their political opinions or
whatever but i don't know attacking
somebody over like
like an injury sustained like overseas
um
probably probably not a good probably
not a good man
does that only extend to um nice
linus does only extend to people that
saw combat no i mean a service injury is
a service injury right if you get
injured in the service to your country
whatever i think it's all
even non-combat come on guys i don't
think that matters that much
exact same kind of sentiment that leads
to uh the
the the militant attitude that the
united states has
if you have served and then on top of
that
are are using that service to continue
sending
uh like loads of young men and women
overseas to die or to come back home
uh and and fail to reintegrate into
society
just exclusively for the profits of the
military-industrial complex
then no you don't deserve uh respect by
virtue of service
i'm sorry well haas there's a giant
difference right so
i don't agree with john mccain's uh when
he was live he's war-mongering right his
policies were
terrible but i do respect that he stayed
in that
prison or war camp yeah so this is
basically my take on it and they said
you can go because you're the son of an
admiral but he stayed with
his fellow soldiers uh public
disagreements on the way i've uh talked
about john mccain as well
yeah and so saying i disagree with dan
crenshaw's policy is one thing
making that incredibly crass joke i mean
how do you not see that
it's counterproductive did you think
that americans would say oh my god
that joke is so funny or
counterproductive
that's when you hear that word as a as a
lefty what's the song
what's the kill bill song or whatever
where the [ __ ] [ __ ] what am i thinking
of does anybody know what song i'm
thinking of
i'm pretty sure it's like a quentin
tarantino song or whatever right
like like can you not see how most
americans would say
the sirens i don't know what the [ __ ]
it's called but his eye injury
would be offensive and then stop
listening to you oh the clacsons
wait is that the song
or no that's just you're describing the
sound what's the name of the [ __ ]
quentin tarantino song
it comes from some older tv show oh yeah
this
isn't it a bad look for us
oh [ __ ] okay if i uh if i
considered what uh the the popular thing
to say was going to be every time i said
something
i probably wouldn't be advocating for
the things i believe in the final note i
will say is this
okay you've got five minutes to respond
be uncivil
and advocate for the morally righteous
cause which is anti-war and
anti-imperialism
bringing our troops back home uh ending
the unjustifiable and unnecessary
bloodshed
then be incredibly polite
we should respect murderers who sustain
injuries in their conquest to murder if
you equate like the average like soldier
whatever to a murderer i don't know what
i i mean
you're too far gone for me to talk to
you hey cap brother and asap i guess
an incredibly civil and talk about uh
ongoing genocide and and uh refuse to
acknowledge it
and even worse than that vote in favor
of the government
in favor of the country that is
continuing that genocide with our
weapons you can be as civil as you want
yeah if
if you had said that on the tyt network
i would have pulled that video
uh i think it's offensive it's over the
top and i understand you were trying to
do satire but i thought it was a
terrible job at that and
and i get why people are offended by it
so look uh
what we do here at the young turks is
unlike any other network
we have wild significant disagreements
and i know that that bothers people
and and so
i have aired our disagreements on the
issue of russia
and almost every topic that you can
imagine so hassan and i
disagree about the that satire to say
the least
uh but i what i don't want is people
walking away thinking that he actually
meant uh the the misstatement on 911
uh and and he did pull the video to me
that's a huge evidence that he realized
right away that it was wrong
uh and look um
that this is a talk shows are
a fascinating and hard situation
they're not like a blue collar job
they're not hard in that sense
uh but that's why in the past uh i i've
said nbc shouldn't fire megyn kelly etc
because when you i mean you on your
twitch channel you work
talk for like four or six hours in a row
that was a that was from a six-hour
broadcast yeah
14 seconds from six hours
60 seconds instead of the 14 seconds
they would understand exactly what i was
referencing
and exactly what i meant it still would
be wrong look
the words i used were were not the best
words
i understand that like i said over and
over again
i get that it's not it's not good words
um
the the joke stuff we can have a
disagreement on
yeah we uh obviously have a disagreement
on on
this style but ultimately my points have
always been throughout my professional
career
and in my personal life and still to
this day the exact same
obviously 911 was a horrific tragedy
three thousand americans died
okay seven thousand troops have died
since then in endless wars and if you're
spending all of your energy getting
upset at me
because uh i i think that that is
abhorrent and awful
maybe you should spend your energy
elsewhere and realize that those who
justify that endless bloodshed
don't actually have the best interest of
those
young men and women at heart all right
uh i want to make it does your take on
the respect
the troops situation apply only to
troops fighting for our
side or do you apply that to all
soldiers to be extreme
should we by default respect people
wounded in combat fighting for the nazis
yeah i mean i would say so um but i mean
like i understand that i don't wait real
quick what am i what do i push to
automatically i skipped that one
donation hold on
use the auto fill to the left in the
crafting table crafting 107 redstone
blocks
where the [ __ ] is auto fill
or is this dumb [ __ ] speaking about a
mod
or do i do shift left click like that
okay [ __ ] you
wait why doesn't the show call blocks
oh weird
um i'm not a big fan of saying that like
individual nazi soldiers were evil
um or that like that or like i don't
know i just i think it does like a
disservice to understanding
like the the psychology of like how
people end up in that position to
pretend
that like some groups of people like
somehow like the entire german like
armed forces just all those people like
were just evil people i think it does a
disservice to understand like how these
types of ideologies form
and where these people come from and i
think that if you view it that way they
end up missing a lot of what could
potentially happen in the future
we did that at nuremberg oh yeah [ __ ]
number i don't care
oh actually wait a second did we do that
at nuremberg i thought at nuremberg
didn't
we hold um weren't the leaders held the
leaders of the camps and the leaders of
the people held more responsible than
the actual people running them
all all i remember i could be wrong all
i remember from nuremberg is like the
actual like
leaders that are what is evil then if
not certain ideologies that's the beauty
of it there is no such thing as evil my
dude
evil and good are just two categories
that people create because it makes them
feel more comfortable in their world
when they can categorize people they
disagree with or people that do things
that they conceive as horrible as evil
people
that's the reality of it mate
uh uh representative crenshaw was not on
lauren groom's program he was apparently
on the daily caller
so no it doesn't matter either way look
uh it didn't happen on our air but
uh uh again uh i i think it was uh wrong
and uh if if representative crenshaw
wants to come on here we would
be very very happy i would love to ask
him the question i would love to have a
conversation with representative
and because people keep saying that i'm
afraid to like address him in person or
something i'm not
i would love for the opportunity to be
able to have a face-to-face conversation
with representative dan crenshaw
and ask him directly to his face why he
thinks it's okay
for the united states to keep selling
arms to the kingdom of saudi arabia
and then have those arms turn around and
get
uh it transferred over to the hands of
the uh
the al-qaeda the last thing is it's guys
no matter where you are on the political
spectrum it's okay to disagree
i think we've got to keep it within
bounds and so
any comments about dan franchot's injury
i think is out of bounds
uh and and i think his service was great
it doesn't mean he's right about policy
but
but we got to give people their credit
and and he risked his life and he lost
his
eye and and for that uh i think uh
obviously the country was anybody who
served a debt of
uh gratitude the tyt plus app is now
available on ios
and android download to get more tyt
content
damn
you can recognize that about nazis and
still not respect them no i mean i guess
maybe it comes into like a um
maybe it comes into a uh like a
semantics debate or whatever
that contradicts what you said about
dessert americans america deserving and
eleven if nazi soldiers aren't held
responsible for their ideology then why
are american
then why are american civilians i'm not
saying that people don't deserve to be
held responsible
i'm just saying that it doesn't really
make sense to i don't like the idea of
calling people
evil i i think that i don't think it
i don't think people work that way i
don't think people well i mean i could
be wrong but
i don't think that people are like born
evil and like
that just happens to some people like
i'm pretty sure that there are a set of
environmental conditions
that will produce predictably like
certain types of people always
um and i think it's good to be aware of
that that if you
like if you sexually abuse a child leave
them in a [ __ ] up household
have them get abused and bully the whole
life probably a way [ __ ] higher
chance that a person like that grows up
and becomes like a [ __ ] serial killer
in fact isn't that actually even pretty
common
and like a lot of like the crazy serial
killer things like john waycy
john wayne um gracie [ __ ] like like in
all these [ __ ] seo killers like
usually some really
[ __ ] up [ __ ] happened um like in their
past and it's like
now not to say that like that excuses
the behavior i still think you can
hold people responsible that makes you
feel better whatever dumb [ __ ] that
means right but like
i think it's worth like understanding
well why do people do the things they do
and they just write it off like oh well
some people are evil lol he's like no
uh ironically enough there is actually
um
a really good oh boy here's the full uh
the full day of reuben arc
there's actually a pretty good um i was
really surprised ourselves there's a
really good
jordan peterson video on this um
uh where i don't remember what we
watched um but it was basically like um
did it have to do with the nazi soldiers
or something or was it some serial
killer or whatever
where um he basically starts off where
he was given some case to review he was
looking over some case
and he saw that it was obviously like a
really horrible person and his
you know his first thought was like oh
well this guy's really horrible but then
his next thought was like what would it
take for me to do this
and that's always a really good question
to ask yourself right like what would it
take to push somebody to a certain level
i don't think it would take much
um but like you see people write people
off as evil all the time like look at
these horrible evil
like illegal immigrants that break the
rules and they come to america and they
don't respect our laws
and it's like okay sure but like if your
family was starving or at risk of death
like what would you do
right i would do a lot more than [ __ ]
crossing a [ __ ] border if i thought
that like
my son's life was in danger or like my
family's lives are danger like i would
do way more than that like without even
[ __ ] thinking about it you know
does that make me evil um you know i
don't know but
well not i don't know i don't think so
everybody says that they have like
they don't like climate change and blah
blah blah but when you actually pull
people on what they'd be willing to do
about it the [ __ ] support for that
[ __ ] drops to [ __ ] nothing it's
insane
