wait hello hello yeah what's up hi
hey what's up hi lily hi mr mullin
how are you i'm good how are you i'm
good mr milton
i'm i'm real good all right you said i
could rent right
there's this friend i don't know like
sometimes when i hang out with them
okay and i just don't know
why like what did he do to you i just
sometimes like okay so this thing with
my friend right he just doesn't know how
to give genuine confidence is he short
he's
a little on the shorter side yeah uh
shorter side people are like usually
like really testy and like can't
ever like function in society but yeah i
don't really judge people based on their
height you know as long as they're you
know nice and polite but this
friend just has a lot of trouble giving
compliments and sometimes
it affects my self-esteem a little bit
especially when he
makes these jabs at my appearance
sometimes i don't know why he knows i
have like self-esteem issues but he just
does these jokes anyway
do you know how i should talk to this
friend um i think you should just cut
that front of your life honestly it
seems like they're too toxic to like
hang around
okay i'm actually i'm genuinely curious
do you ever think do you ever get
worried that maybe you're like taking
things on in your friend that aren't
necessarily his fault like maybe he like
crushed the [ __ ] out of you at a game
that you said you would hustle everyone
at do you ever worry that like maybe
you're letting other things
impact your view of him like their ego
is so
high it's impossible to talk to them
normally like any little thing that they
do they expand it and they act like
they're [ __ ]
god but they're not you know we're all
humans right they have no humility
i think that's the problem and it's
really difficult to talk to someone like
that i don't know
for me personally i usually function
better alone so um i don't have a nice
name so you think i should just go like
solo yeah i think you should i'm gonna
get yeah i'm getting the dang games

don't i don't get invited today okay

subnautica looking like a product of sun
rapping all day just [ __ ] go
oh my god that was
[ __ ] fire i thought i saw somebody
slide downstairs but i'm looking for him
that's me
so typically when we play these games
rna just try to call out where the
people are and then i'll kill them
pretty much instantly
sounds like you and me in pubg except
instead of calling them out you just go
there's a guy don't use his name just
kidding what are you
[Laughter]
i'm a little nervous he should be i
should be yeah
he should be because your actions have
consequences steve there's no lethal
consequences okay everybody chill out
really good sensor dog thank you did you
really waste a sense or die
look at how mad he gets i feel like if
we were driving around and you drove
your car into like a [ __ ] house and
i'm like dude what the [ __ ]
like look at how mad he is right now
that is not the same
driving into a pothole and then saying
like oh look at how mad he is that's an
apt comparison
