wait i have h bomber guy on the line
right now and i wanted to talk to him
and i think this would be an interesting
opportunity for you guys to meet as well
what do you think
yeah i mean we talk on skype but yeah
yeah go for it damn you talked on skype
dude all right never
like we message each other but like we
never have anything to talk about so i
never actually have had like an actual
conversation with him before
i don't know how to [ __ ] bring
someone into the conversation add
friends to the dm
i guess right if he's friends with you
yeah uh
yeah i'm friends with him dude friends
but we're so much more we're lovers oh
he's got the stream on in the background
how awkward
oh i'm hello what's up buddy
hi i'm just playing how to strike and
watching
watching hassan make him a mess of his
life oh well uh was that how you spent
two years
was that your new year's night so yeah
no to to finish off that story and and
steve i i assume you saw
uh some parts of that already on live
stream fails but to finish off that
story we went to like this
super [ __ ] clout youtube party which
i tried to get uh destiny to come with
me as well too but he was like now [ __ ]
that
uh you know and understandable uh
that you didn't want to do that radical
self-reliance i get it
um but yeah we went to that party uh i
don't know if you guys are familiar
there's this like
big youtuber named ricky thompson who
apparently was a fan of mine
uh and i i met him there and and the
girl i was uh
trying to hook up with was like very
very uh interested in
in and meeting him like she loves them
apparently so
i got to be able i i got to like flex
very quickly
and and i think that really helped
salvage the the insult situation
um but yeah but you know good times all
around
i ended up spending the night watching
and finishing the first season of bakke
um the remastered uh japanese version
of bakki the wrestler very good i highly
recommend it so
so that's that's what happened guys nice
now congratulations on what sounds like
an amazing night yeah it is the worst i
don't talk to girls about elliot rogers
especially when you don't know them that
well
when they walk into your house they're
like what the [ __ ] are you doing like
why are you
why are you sitting in front of two
monitors like screaming
yeah what a loser who would ever do that
jeez yeah what the [ __ ] dude i know
it just sucks it's a it's the worst
women don't understand me
um this is why gamers are the most the
press class this is why the gamers are
the most oppressed minority
finally you're finally doing some truth
saying you do this lefty lib [ __ ] [ __ ] a
lot but finally i'm hearing you know
i know yeah right it's you're more
receptive to my message now
yeah now i dream a dream of a future
where the hunter killers of the
terminator
world are used to destroy gamers jesus
christ
yeah dude pretty bold statement from
somebody that defends the star wars
prequels
the british [ __ ] they're [ __ ]
wait what happened he his micah does he
just got i
literally muted the mic while yelling uh
for comedic effect it wasn't very funny
no you got to do the exact opposite dude
h bomber guy you got to do the exact
opposite
in twitch if you want to be funny you
have to like really you have to deep
throat your microphone and scream into
it that's usually
that's usually how a lot of twitch
streamers do it from whatever's
it's incredible what mike is that is
that a blue uh baby bottle
blueberry of course yeah what do you
mean of course what is that supposed to
mean is it a pedophile joke you're
already going for the low blows
it's one of the expensive ones debate
dude in destiny incest is not morally
wrong debate me
holy [ __ ] that was incredible
oh my god but um anyway
holy sh that's what i that's what i
should do next time next time i have
girls over and i'm [ __ ]
uh i'm here and mr mooton's on the line
i'm sure he'll bring up
hey so son what are your thoughts on
incest like can we talk about that
because that's because i want to blame i
blame myself
for having uh brainworms but i also have
to blame
mr mutin for saying for turning around
and saying hassan are you an in-self
in front of the in front of the live
audience and also in front of the girls
and i had to [ __ ] double down
causing me to double down on the on the
meme
do you really have to double down though
i really
i i had to dude i had to i had to
[ __ ]
i had this he chest moved me dude like
kind of like how he he chest moves you
right the layers of irony that you were
trying to exist on don't work with
normal people like you you have to have
a basic knowledge of what an enceladus
before you ironically identify as one
otherwise it's just
you come off as a nightmare person i
know well i yeah
i had to be like hey you should watch
this contra points video like let's sit
down and
and let me describe this to you
perfectly um by the way steve do you
want to play blobs is that what's going
on
yeah uh okay where are you i saw you
earlier you were doing an irl stream
um were you getting ice cream or
something i got
i was jealous because i love ice cream
and and no one ever invites me to get
ice cream with them so well if you want
to take the 30 minute drive down here
come
dude i mean you never asked dude you
never ask maybe
maybe i would you know okay i'll keep
that in mind
anyway um it's not like it's not like i
have any female partners that i'm uh
i'm hanging out with any time soon so uh
most likely
most likely i'll take you up on the
offer god dammit
i'm so lonely dude holy [ __ ] uh anyway
you'll have to excuse me by the way it's
2 a.m and i've just eaten a bunch of
grilled cheeses so i'm
i'm i'm the same man is coming
wait uh age bomber guy what i wanted to
say was and i don't know if uh destiny's
seen your latest video on the flat earth
but it was excellent dude i can't
believe you could
you can uh patch together a [ __ ] 45
minute video essay on flat earthers but
it was great
thanks and uh originally even way longer
like it's it's one of those things where
like it's a done topic like people know
all about it
but the more you look into it just the
deeper it keeps going
because the people who are into it have
to have to justify all of it
so it's just like yeah it's it's really
fun i recommend
i'm shocked that you didn't go further
into like the anti-semitism element of
it
because like with all conspiracy
theories it somehow always goes back to
like
uh the nasa people are are actually all
jews
and that jews control nasa and they're
doing this like and they're hiding
uh the truth about how how the earth is
flat
um and and there's no reason for why
they're doing it it's a world domination
of course i think
but oh yeah oh wait for why jews are
destroying stuff you go a little deeper
and then they're like oh they're not
even the real jews the real jews are
like an ancient race that died out and
these are pretending to be
also it's it's like a whole it just
keeps going
yeah well if you don't want to look at
the actual problems
uh which was your your main like point i
think in your video towards the end not
to spoil it for anyone
but i but i almost i completely agree
with the with the thesis
um if you refuse to acknowledge the
actual economic problems even
even capitalists such as uh steve
bonnell ii here
uh agrees with um uh or at least
acknowledges a lot of the issues with
our current economic structure
if you refuse to see that as a problem
then you have to like find these
mythological reasons as to why
uh you feel a lot of anxiety or why you
feel like your your economic
opportunities are
are not as um i mean you don't have the
the same kind of future afforded to you
that your parents gave to you basically
well
yeah it's it's it's basically like
if you if you manage to get a tiny piece
of systemic critique then you can
you can trick people into following you
almost anywhere like steve bannon
opens a lot of his speeches with like he
talks about the global financial crash
which is a very important thing to talk
about
and then you know 45 minutes later he's
forgotten completely about that it's
talking about how great capitalism is
yeah markets to do it again so i did a
video with uh three arrows on this a
little bit where we briefly talked about
this but i feel like it's it's almost no
different than the way that
um national socialism started where it's
like i feel like uh nationalists
or or at least fascists understand uh
intrinsically that their their
message needs to reach out to a broader
base and in order to do that the vehicle
to do that is usually left-wing populism
which is ironic of course um because
like the supposed left wing of the
united states like political
uh realm of political discourse refuses
to acknowledge left-wing populism
uh and instead says stuff like no
everything is totally fine
and you know we can do like minor
reforms here and there
and that we should have affordable
health care instead of free
healthcare and it'll be totally fine
whereas
uh you see people like tucker carlson
and steve bannon like actually pushing
forward
uh left uh left-wing economic populism
in an effort to
push for uh nationalism or at least
white nativist immigration policies
which are
which is what they want
i don't know i'm turning on uh black ops
by the way
are you i am right now it's free with my
with my like
gamer monitor but i i don't think it's
as tall as like 40 gigs
i've never played i've never played a
call of duty games since like two
well yeah um they're the call of duty
games are
are punishing if i'm gonna be honest but
it's fun it's all right
wait h palmer guy you've muted yourself
oh i do that um i make loud noises my
keyboard's loud and i don't wanna
make noises on the stream i'm still here
yeah i just
the thing i hate about call of duty is
that like i feel like everyone's 12
years old and they're really good
and it absolutely punishes me um but i
have to keep up appearances
and make it seem like i'm a gamer so i
have to keep playing
also this is the only way it's the only
way i can get steve to hang out with me
otherwise he just
refuses we need to come up with i need
to come up with a debate topic so i can
appear on
steve's stream and you know more than 20
people can watch my stream
i've come up with a list of topics for
them to debate and they're all like a
bunch of [ __ ]
yeah what do you uh
what would you what are you guys at odds
of i don't even know what your like
politics are i don't know i don't know
frankly like i i i've seen enough
debates that i like i feel like i know
steve's politics but i've i don't
i've never seen the part where he sits
down and says to him i've always just
seen the part where he destroys someone
who's much
obviously more wrong like so i'm not a
good fit
i mean you're an actual lefty right
aren't you um
kind of like i i have trouble with i
have trouble with labels as
every you know every weird on the
internet does this i'm sorry when i say
lefty i mean
are you you're anti-capitalist right
well yeah i see myself as a critic as a
critic
of capitalism i guess but uh yeah but i
feel like even steve's a critic of
capitalism not the
i mean yeah the fact that you advocate
for uh massive
social safety nets uh and and like true
equality of opportunity means that you
understand that that capitalism is
failing to provide that as they say
but when i say anti-capitalist what i'm
saying is i feel like there are some
people that believe
that fundamentally capitalism is um
the exploitive properties of capitalism
are just not not savable there's no way
to make capitalism work it's just by by
definition it's always going to be an
unethical exploitation of the worker
no well partially i mean part of it is
like
then what is capitalism is it the
exploitation specifically is it the
entire system
is it the concept of someone else having
the means of production and other people
not having it like well isn't
that's the problem that's the big part
of capitalism right it's not necessarily
the market part but the fact that a
capitalist will own capital and then
laborers are brought into that capital
to work for the
business owner now yeah yeah but and
then the problem becomes
like i i'm not the sort of person's like
here's my ideal future world
and also let's dismantle all of this um
i guess i'm more of an incrementalist in
a sense i'm very much like
here's a couple of changes that will
make the current system work better and
if those things actually work then
surely then maybe there's a next step
and but
how we go from there depends on how
those things are implemented yeah i mean
in that case i would 100 percent
be that yeah i see myself as i see it
myself as pretty hard left partially
because
everyone who's not as left as me
identifies me as very far left and at
that point i'm like well okay
fine sure i guess um
which i guess is why people like happily
call bernie sanders or
um cortez like super far left is because
you have
the carsons of the world saying oh
they're coming they're coming to take
away
everything you know tear your society
apart
brick by brick and then eat them or
whatever so then by that point you have
most people who are like
center center left saying well in that
case they must be really far left well
to be fair for american politics bernie
is pretty far left
oh yeah by the standards of american
politics yeah but yeah
not not that not that far i don't know i
i live in a country where
you could technically call the
conservative party socialists because
they they
support social systems in fact they've
put a surprising amount of money into
mental health stuff
wait where are you where do you live
again i live in the uk okay
docs dude it's over he just docks
himself get him boys
get the heretic get the socialist
um yeah i don't know i i
this is a point of contention for a lot
of people on my stream as well this is
something that i try to
this is something that i advocate for
especially in the united states is that
people that range from where destiny's
at which is
firmly social democratic uh and and not
a believer in like a free market
enterprise right destiny like i don't
think you
i don't think you you operate under the
false notion that like oh there is such
a
thing as like the free market uh you you
get it as a theory you understand it
yeah well but the thing is the
disappointing thing is that even like
even a staunch libertarian
should acknowledge these things the
problem and this is i'm gonna there's a
hardcore no true scotsman thing but the
problem is that like most of the
capitalists or whatever like the charlie
kirks or whatever
uh that defend capitalism don't like
understand even the basic economic
theory like
like any even again like even the
staunchest libertarian would acknowledge
oh yeah market failures exist
oh yeah externalities exist oh yeah like
the free market can't literally solve
every problem if it's not accounted for
in any market structure right
but but for some reason in america
people are just [ __ ] crazy so i don't
know
yeah also people wanna they wanna have a
person they can point to who speaks so
generically they can't
disagree with them about anything so you
get people going you know capitalism is
good and then everyone goes yeah
yeah and then and the left is that as
well but like the standards have slipped
so far that i can make a video where i
say racism is bad and people like holy
[ __ ] the reformer is here or whatever
yeah i don't know anything you know most
of my politics are predicates on the
fact that i know i should trust people
who seem like they know better and
i should just fact check them it's
because i have no idea what i'm doing
wait for being honest but going back to
but going back to everyone's uh
uh policies here or everyone's personal
politics here
i feel like we are all on the on the
same side
uh politically especially when it comes
to u.s politics
because we all acknowledge the the um
the inherent failures of capitalism to
provide
uh certain things mainly even at the
starting point would be like equality of
uh yeah yeah
like only creating i'm not equally back
i'm sorry equality of opportunity holy
[ __ ]
there is i have so much tremendous lag
of course
because of my socialist internet
um or because of oligopolies in the
united states obviously not to make
everything political but
um i guess the uh the difference is like
i mean i don't even mind
calling it whatever the [ __ ] it doesn't
have to be uh it doesn't have to be
called uh
real quick can you run over here it
doesn't have to be what
i'm fighting two people oh [ __ ] i i only
have um
sorry i'm trying to get a gun there's no
guns in the back house
okay i found the gun all right i'm
coming oh nice lag
i've insane lag too [ __ ] terrible no
please a son just go kill him oh you're
lagging airman
yeah i'm lagging like a [ __ ] but
where were they upstairs i have like my
frame rate is
i have 25 fps dude i'm operating at 25
fps like there's no way i can't even
like i'm going to get killed before i
even acknowledge there's a person in
front of me this is so terrible
you play counter-strike gage did you
play cs go or what i play cfo
like badly um i use the the bad guns on
purpose
uh i'm bad at it oh i've just i've
opened both of your twitch chats and now
i can monitor them
ask hbo h bomber gotta get caught now my
guy well he said it's like
it came through with my graphics card
but it's like 2 20 a.m so
i'm probably gonna go to sleep but yeah
but you started streaming and when i
thought oh cool well i'll brush all
these crumbs off of my bed
yeah well i'm glad i'm glad you came on
the chat cause i've been meaning to i've
been meaning to talk to you and i also
uh i know that like uh a lot of um a lot
of my fans a lot of destinies fans are
also big fans of yours
and uh they always they always want us
to link up so this uh this worked out
perfectly
who does the uk guy vote for is what
they're asking you um
i'm gonna be voting for the labour party
uh of course
uh wow you wouldn't what a disgusting
anti-semite you are
they seem like they might eventually win
yeah obviously jeremy corbyn is the next
jesus
like he's you know he's a reformer jc is
in his name he's being crucified by jews
he's like perfect you know he's the
ideal
damn um sorry that's that's that's the
one
a joke i workshopped and knew i could
never put in the videos
i didn't actually
was the corbin [ __ ] about him being
anti-semitic was that actually true were
those like quotes
no no no like the the association is
is ridiculous as well like uh jk rowling
kind of exposed the lie by being
accidentally anti-semitic herself when
you know she found comments by him
talking about the bankers that destroyed
the world which is the thing that
actually happened like
the financial crash was real not for
billionaires
but it was real and she was like how
dare he say that about jews
which is you know oops yeah this is
something that
but but there is to be fair there is a
lot of anti-semitism that exists
in in uh uk politics from what i
understand like more so totally yeah
like
the [ __ ] thing is is like you take a
single look at it and you're like oh
it's everywhere
and there are left-wing people who like
have yeah disappeared from politics
because they've said something and like
thank god they're gone but it's it's
[ __ ] up um
but a lot of like people have been
trying to push corbin as oh he's a
secret
ira supporter he secretly loves uh
sharia law or he doesn't bow enough to
the queen because he wants
you know it's just it just it's so
continuous that at this point
if he was literally an actual
anti-semite i'm curious if people would
be capable of believing it because it's
like
they have tried to smear him as one when
they had no proof so if any ever did
come up like
how believable would it even seem which
is a bit worrying because i would like
to know if he is
but he doesn't seem to be but yeah he
he i mean he's like uh fairly uh antis
i mean i wouldn't even say he's
anti-zionist but he's definitely a very
critical of of uh the israeli occupation
and all that so it's not like
whoa don't mix those two things up
because i'm about to be anticipated
i myself am not because i am also a very
staunch critic of the idf and netanyahu
and the israeli occupation
so are you i'm going to yahoo was part
of the um he was uh he did that [ __ ] too
where he made up that [ __ ] about um
about iran having nuclear weapons right
uh part of the uh
[ __ ] what the yeah
oh there's two people in the [ __ ]
house
uh corbin was in like if you can just
survive i'm coming
sorry go ahead i've lost
i just remembered the um the sort of
left-wing jewish group that he
associated with uh this was before he
was an anti-semite
um before that was the smear the current
smear was that he hung around with the
wrong
jews because he went to like a cedar
from really left-wing jews and they were
like
how did he do that he's a political
radical it's like he just can't win but
i i'm i'm not the biggest fan of calling
right now because like
basically now would be the time to go
the labour party is now the anti-brexit
party
like that would be that would be it the
tories would be absolutely smashed
instantly at this point if everything's
falling apart you're just gonna grab the
mace that's all we gotta do
and instead he's like no no i'm pro
brexit so it's basically that's it like
no one
no one likes anyone in in any party
anymore and it just it sucks
so yeah [ __ ] how are you ready for that
no deal brexit
oh yeah i can't [ __ ] wait you know
you know i i
was in a really good relationship a year
and a half ago with someone and we broke
up because
i didn't want to move to america you
know what because it seemed worse it
seemed like we were going to undo brexit
or it was going to be okay you know i
deeply
regret that now wow wait you thought
that they would have rolled it back
i was fairly certain we did the roll it
back or we'd figure out a deal that
wasn't absolute [ __ ]
and it hasn't we had another election we
got we got the same party in again but
with even less bargaining power they
gave
billions of dollars to the shitty shitty
irish party like it's stover
um so i don't know i'm gonna move to
wales or something
um yeah cause i was gonna say there's no
way you can you can't i don't think you
can ever
do a referendum and then walk the
referendum back like you your country
would [ __ ] fall apart
they're talking about like doing another
referendum
that's so ridiculous we're considering
we can repeal article 50 which is the
actual thing that
causes the leaving process uh the
referendum isn't legally binding we
could
the government could if they wanted
though you know they would lose an
election
say we've decided not to do brexit [ __ ]
you they could do that if they wanted to
but you know no one's you know no party
would would go i mean like you're
basically saying [ __ ] you to the direct
will of the people i feel like you'd
have a really hard time
like maintaining integrity you would be
but most people who voted brexit like a
ton of them have changed their minds
and a lot of them also because they were
like
yeah they were like like it's or they
died i mean that's their
fault i mean that's that's how democracy
works i mean you voted on it as [ __ ]
like
i just i'm really uncomfortable with the
president the idea that like you vote on
something you don't get the result you
want so you just kind of keep voting
until you get
like it just feels a little dirty you
know i i i do see
i do see your criticism there but i
don't agree with it in
practice because um that means if so
well
the thing that gets to me about it is
the way the rhetoric suddenly evolved
uh you know in the the weeks running up
to the election up until day zero it was
here's all the ways it's gonna be better
here's how great it's gonna be it's
gonna be great immediately
and you know let's let's fund our nhs
with all this money we would be giving
to the uh to the eu
and then day one when it passes it was
like oh we we all knew we were in for a
hard four to eight to twenty years
of economic downturn or we might have to
privatize the nhs
yeah but like the pres maybe this is
just because i've spent too much time
with the worst of humanity but like what
you're giving me right now are
criticisms of democracy not anything
particularly referendum what you're
basically saying is people voted on
something
and people are just [ __ ] stupid and
now they're like oh [ __ ] like but the
real result [ __ ]
[ __ ] democracy we we really just need to
do this thing and we'll vote as many
times as we need to for people to not be
dumb about it
what i'm really doing is criticizing the
sort of the underpinning ideology is
uh people wanted people to vote yes in
the referendum for all kinds of [ __ ]
reasons that fell apart under
scrutiny but then the day after it
suddenly became
exactly what you're saying which is to
to to execute the will of the people
but this is like politics 101 like
everything
the thing the thing is like or every
pro-brexit person in britain now who
wants to see it done
once it done because the people said
they wanted it done two two and a half
years ago because a very slim margin
said they wanted it
and that's fine i understand like they
voted for it i get that
but what's interesting to me personally
is
the specific thing that the the argument
is no longer that we should do it
because it's good
it's that we should do it because we
managed to get a slim margin to be duped
into saying they wanted it two years ago
and that's interesting to me because
surely if it was good then
it'd be obvious what we should be doing
right now but instead it's like
theresa may is fighting as hard as she
can to not give up
even more things to the eu um and
also maybe the irish troubles will
restart again you know minor thing
um i also kind of dispute that you need
to you can only ever have one referendum
on something
well i mean like the real answer is that
you should never ever ever ever ever
ever
ever have important things up to a
referendum that is beyond [ __ ]
that's the real answer but i mean once
you've done it oh yeah
by the way unironically has become more
of a tanky
i think than than even uh i have over
the
house at a tanky position no because
like you have a more of an authoritarian
perspective
then like that's anti-democratic yeah i
mean yeah
[ __ ] the people could you imagine people
talking about like putting the fed under
oversight could you imagine us voting on
our [ __ ] monetary policy
democracy but people should have as
little say
no no don't misquote me i don't believe
in democracy okay sorry go ahead
okay oh jeez i believe in democracy but
okay that's good but no one could vote
um i no
look let me let me just let me just put
it really quickly
i think that we all understand and we
all believe in democracy as long as
uh we have an educated populist that can
make smart decisions and are not
susceptible to misinformation
that is very easily spread as
demonstrated by the trump election in
the united states and
also by a brexit uh we now know that it
is much easier to just [ __ ] lie to
people
and and and and i guess haven't we
always known that are we really just
figuring this just manipulate democracy
to achieve whatever kind of ends you
would like i mean we're saying this like
we're just discovering this but i mean
like
i i mean yeah i'm not just discovering
i'm just saying like it's
demonstrable like it's a demonstrable
failure now more than
it was before i think arguably some
scholars argue that that's part of the
strength of the american system is that
like people always complain that our
government is very slow and inefficient
and can't get anything done
but in some ways it's built like that
that you want processes to be slow
because if they could be changed quickly
people would [ __ ] things up really
[ __ ] quickly
which i don't know i think there's some
legitimacy in that
yeah plus like there is a need
especially in our modern landscape to
boil
very complex issues down to binary yes
no hello friends
answers like you see that in australia
with the referendum they had on
gay marriage where you could where like
in the election
the the split was the labor party would
have just legalized it
and then the liberal party would have
then had an expensive referendum on
whether or not
it should be legalized and of course it
passed like pretty solidly
uh because when it's a binary issue it's
very easy to solve and
a bunch of uh journalism outlets
especially online got behind the
referendum for gay marriage
but none of them got behind the party
that would have just done it because
that would have been too political
it has to be boiled down to this
specific yes no thing one kind of um one
interesting phenomenon that i've kind of
observed that's kind of shitty
um is that one thing that sucks is it it
feels like we actually
solved so many of the easy problems in
society
like when we take what i'm right behind
you you left the ak in here
on me spot on me
wait are you running away from me yeah
um i i i i i didn't pick up the swot for
you oh i thought you said there was a
squad on you
no no no no no okay yeah just loot i
think we're here alone
um but it sucks because it feels like
we've picked up or we've solved like a
lot of the easy problems
it's like when we think of something
like sorry wanna what
bowie knife yeah hell yeah that's right
where i'm at
so when we look at a problem like racism
um like
you know like we probably probably
shouldn't hang people
probably shouldn't like enslave people
like those are like pretty easy things
oh [ __ ] first person person person
coming but when you talk about things
like um like
got him nice trouble i downed him but
there's probably gonna be a homie too
watch out when you talk about like a lot
of the more discreet ways that things
like sexism or racism kind of manifest
itself in society
um it seems like these issues are so
much more difficult to tackle right
um so you get like the um the sargon of
the cods
yeah sorry i'm just fighting a guy he's
right next to me oh my god
oh come on dude
sorry i thought you're ahead of shooting
you get like the sargon of akkads in the
world who are like uh you're like oh
well you know sexism is solved because
there's not literally somebody telling
women what major they can or cannot
choose you know
don't you know that we had a black
president yeah
well i guess i mean i'm going
going back to the h-bomber guys
by the way yeah like probably the
biggest sargon fan he always talks about
how liberal he is and stuff so
he's a classic he's the classic kind of
liberal uh
the best yeah a liberal from when uh
you know people could and and should own
slaves from that time that's that's the
kind of liberal i like
like the kind of liberal who's like no i
want to be a liberal but also with
with uh slavery
but like with all of the modern
trappings that came from opposition to
wait for sargon of akkad
the the joke is that classical liberals
uh say that they're the true liberals
but ironically they uh they refuse to
acknowledge more progressive elements of
classical liberalism
and they only focus on classical
liberalism
at like superimposed at the time that
classical
liberalism uh was was uh created though
the irony there is that a big uh
chunk of the foundation uh of classical
liberalism at that time
while uh albeit more progressive in
comparison to other
uh schools of thought at that time was
would be still considered very
regressive now
because they were liberals at a time
when people could own slaves
and a lot of them didn't even have an
opposition to owning slaves
so that's the that's the joke is that
oh good the joke is better the more you
explain it i feel that's why i that's
why i personally am subscribed to the
young turks
wow wow typ8 the left is eating
itself alive again there it is boys do
you see that
this is why destiny hates to call
himself a leftist dude he doesn't wanna
he doesn't wanna
my god i can feel another genocide on
its way
holy [ __ ] whoa yikes
but to go back to the issue of people
not voting the way i wanted them to
um i do i do agree with the idea that
like if people voted for it we should
basically do it
but then the question is how do you how
do you decide
if this thing is what the people wanted
for example you know people vote brexit
does theresa may then get to go oh well
i did i did this and that's what that's
it
um man you got to be for example oh
sorry go finish go ahead
when we went into the european union uh
we went in without the will of the
people and then
once we were in and we saw the
opportunities and the deal was laid out
we then voted on whether or not we
stayed in uh and everyone who was alive
at the time
that we went that we were going in saw
the obvious benefits and it passed
pretty well i think it was one of the
largest margins
ever i hope i'm remembering that
correctly so now i feel it's a bit like
let's say we had a referendum let's
let's use
hillary clinton's favorite um comparison
uh let's say we had a referendum on we
got we wanted a pony and then two years
later uh
theresa may came back and said okay we
have a large horse with three legs
um the people should at some point get a
chance to weigh in on maybe that's worth
giving up
uh half of our economy um
yeah that sort of thing so man i don't
know i disagree so much
like like a matt like what if we did
like um what about like social
uh healthcare in the united states like
if we pass that and it ends up like
not working or whatever do you do you
say well wait we changed our mind
i'm [ __ ] dead again dude i got you
dude
well surely one of the founding
principles of democracy is that people
can change their minds if minds can't be
changed then why vote on anything
well but like you haven't even left the
eu yet yo right
that's true yeah we can just see the
edge of the camera coming because if you
guys were to have a referendum so
like this is just kind of like
politically like if you would have a
referendum on rejoining the opinion i
think that's 100 fine
i'm just like i feel like there are so
many these aren't like
unique i know other people bring this up
better than more eloquently than i can
but like the idea of just like
re-referendum
something that like you've got a bad
result on oh [ __ ] oh god i'm [ __ ]
dead again dude i'm dead this time
[ __ ] just i was feeling myself
in a corner
that just seems like so wrong the idea
that you could just keep taking votes
and then say like well people were
misrepresented to in the first vote i
mean that's true of literally every
single thing
ever i mean even the aca in the united
states uh barack obama said for instance
like oh well you'll be able to keep your
own doctor and that wasn't true in all
cases so i mean like
do you refer you could re-referendum
literally any single thing you wanted to
over and over again for any number of
reasons it seems
oh yeah but we should re-referendum this
one because it will destroy our country
if we don't
yeah again but you're literally saying
and again like first of all for the
record i don't know what you think i'm
horribly [ __ ] anti-brexit it's the
dumbest
i totally agree that it's going to be a
massive [ __ ] [ __ ]
but i mean it's different like the
difference here is the difference
between
like saying oh on principle there should
just be one and then we do it and then
it's fine
and the the practice of we voted on a
deal we voted on the idea of leaving
the steal for some isn't even leaving
and for most is just an awful way to
leave
and everyone wants to drag their heels
on it because it's bad you know and i
agree
i agree with the principle you're
getting across here but i would like to
not leave
uh and [ __ ] it that's you know at a
certain point
having principles goes out the window
yeah i agree but then at that point
i've given up on having any principles
whatsoever yeah no and i agree with you
and if you're
not to like i'm not trying to like nail
you in a corner anything but what you're
essentially saying there at that point
it's like
you don't necessarily think that
democracy is important as a principle
it's more a means to an end and that end
is achieving whatever your political
ideology and it is and insofar as
democracy will deliver the results that
you're okay with
then that's fine but as soon as it
starts to run contrary to that then
democracy gets thrown out very quickly
right
so why not just say [ __ ] it and be a
[ __ ] populist you're a totalitarian
[ __ ] that [ __ ] [ __ ] democracy well
all politics is about securing power
uh for whatever whatever uh not
necessarily
so like a classification 100 like a real
big like classical liberal will say some
[ __ ] like oh well you know i you know i
defend your right to speech even if i
have or i'll die for your right to say
something even if i
that there are people that do believe in
like those principles yeah very very
rarely and also
even then they they shut the [ __ ] up
about the other side of the equation uh
more often than not or
even outright you know i agree i agree
i'm not gonna disagree pragmatically i'm
not gonna describe but i'm just saying
there are people that do believe in
these things as a principles in and of
themselves
right and when you present yourself with
saying like well i'm a big believer in
democracy
that's cool but if you say like well but
now i got a really bad result so [ __ ]
this [ __ ] it's like okay so then
democracy
was just a means to an end and that end
was securing some economic or whatever
prosperity of your country that's more
important than the form of government
right
well the the sign is the state's social
media
specifically on purpose and that's one
of the many freedoms
in our society is we have the ability to
say a thing that we want to happen even
if there's no
practical way it can happen yeah and
some people agitating for us to not
leave the eu
uh are i think in their right minds to
do so and also should have the right to
do so
even if it means throwing out the
results of a referendum that most people
have voted yes in
uh changed their minds or died um
yeah i guess they could they're just
like this is this is one of the many
sort of i guess checks and balances is
like
now everyone has to actually live with
it's the difference between this is an
example
when um for the last 20 years people
have been jokingly saying when margaret
thatcher dies i'm going to throw a
[ __ ]
banger i'm going to throw a party it's
going to be great it's the difference
between saying that
and actually throwing a party when a
human being dies
like that there's a line there um in the
sand
and for me that's the difference between
wanting to leave the eu and actually
[ __ ] doing it
damn it yeah i understand i understand
your position i just totally disagree i
mean it will be disastrous and maybe
it's like um
maybe yeah maybe the well i mean i would
agree if you would
say [ __ ] democracy and say [ __ ] that
system but no i'm
i'm pro i'm pro-democracy uh on on
principle
yeah well would you but you see
democracy and practice well but that
means you're not pro-democracy and
principle in principle there's something
that you value more than democracy there
is something you expect democracy to
deliver you some value that you
cherish more than democracy itself right
happiness
and and prosperity and i already i
already ate my grilled cheeses so i can
die happy now regardless
of what happens so like here so here's
an example something that i would say i
value over um over happiness right
so i think right so i think i value um
i'm going to use liberalism
in the classical liberal some sense i
value liberalism the idea of being free
and being able to choose what you want
to do
over being just happier
so for an example of this let's say that
you could definitely be causing you to
be happier
without getting to without getting too
me into it right let's say we take a
look at women's place in the world right
let's say that women um let's say that
we can run scientific studies and women
are by definition happier uh when they
stay at home when they don't work et
cetera et cetera et cetera
um even though that happiness might be
true
that you might be happier by doing that
i still think that in society we should
let people choose the things that makes
them happy and give people the
opportunity to choose things that might
not make them as happy
um that so i in that case i would truly
value that that freedom of choice over
just like
being happy there and then much the same
like i think that somebody that truly
cherishes the idea of democracy would
say
even if people vote themselves into
ruins if democracy is something they
truly value then that's just you know
one of the things that could happen for
democracy
but but i think if here's the place
where we differ you know you talk you
talk in principle
you tend to care about people's right to
choose things but
then when they've made one choice their
their ability to reconsider ever doing
it in future is taken away and you try
you can't redo this vote after though
yeah but i mean
i wanted to jump off a cliff i wouldn't
drag them off but the promise
your mind that you've done the thing you
first decided even if it tanks
a [ __ ] nation like no let people have
a second referendum just
let's just make sure it's a pretty good
analogy
it's not it's a horrible because now
what you've essentially said is no
referendum really matters because you
can always do another one
right like this is one of the principal
um criticisms massive because people are
allowed to change their minds people are
to see a deal that's
grown and changed massively over two
years and say oh hang on maybe we maybe
we get a say in this thing that we said
we wanted that is now vastly mutated
into something else
like that's what democracy is isn't it i
mean what big political action won't
change or mutate into something
different over
like every big political thing is always
going to do oh well then oh and your
argument is that we should then give up
on democracy because sometimes it
doesn't go well
well i know my argument yeah i would say
you should never referendum anything
like this but if you are going to
referendum it if you if you walk back
that referendum then none of your
referendums ever matter because you
always have the opportunity of just
changing your mind and they don't walk
you back on it that we're having a
second vote on a vastly different deal
than what was the case two years ago
yeah okay i i see i see i see your point
i do see your point
i'm like i'm like i'm like 60 40 against
it but i do understand what you're
saying
and pragmatically honestly like it's so
[ __ ] bad if you leave the eu that
i can be a little this is an example i
would make is um
when i commissioned an artist to do
something for a project in my work
i will say here's the thing that i that
i kind of want you wanting to do
here's a vague thing yeah okay cool here
then we have the actual conversation
about what we
know about the quotas and how it and how
it works and
what we're going to do and then we
actually decide if we're going to do it
there's there's like a there's like a
level of back and forth and we are now
at the level of back and forth where
um the the european the um
the british parliament get to actually
vote on whether or not the deal goes
through which originally the government
didn't want to even have to do that
where like people like our parliament
should have a say in whether or not we
believe as well like they should be able
to vote on whether or not the dealers
except
well well now you know
i mean i don't think they should be i
don't think parliament gets a say in it
if you're going to referendum something
else
right like the question but what you're
doing then is giving
is giving uncontested power to whoever
happens to be in charge when the music
stops and it's time to do brexit and i
think that's that's like
literally territory i mean that's what
you voted on though i mean no i mean
the referendum was a non-legally binding
piece of paper saying
do you want to leave or remain yeah and
within the purview if you want to give
unlimited power to whoever happens to be
prime minister when david cameron
inevitably
quits i mean everybody that's how the i
mean it's not like any of this changed
like that's
how it was always going to be right like
you guys didn't know if you would have
voted on a referendum with a deal in
place then i mean that would be
different but you voted on a referendum
to leave and that was with nothing in
play so i mean anything could have
happened right that was all
part of what could have happened no
oh god uh someone in your if someone in
your chat destiny is kicking our asses
h-bomb is almost as dumb as hassan
holy [ __ ] oh a lot have so i used to
don't listen don't listen to anything in
jesse's chat they're all [ __ ]
i used to be a hardcore libertarian so i
have something these chat
destiny [ __ ] kicks ass i have some
right leaning people okay
don't suck up them don't give them don't
give them any encouragement dude do not
do that trust me
clearly someone dumber than me i'm
kidding okay fine yeah no no do not do
not [ __ ] give them any encouragement
i promise you it will be
nothing good i do think one of the cuter
one of the cuter arguments is the idea
that um
okay well you voted to brexit but now
you have to have another vote on how to
brexit and if nobody settles on that
then you just don't
which but i don't think the eu is going
the current system is if no one settles
on that then we have a node
i know deal brexit you know everyone
dies and
may's current thing is you have to vote
yes on my shitty deal because if not
well i guess what
so which is an amazing argument to do uh
you know to play chicken with the entire
country's future
but
you want a 3x scope i have one sure
um right on me oh i've already got one
there may say
all right you have a bot that tweets out
your links to your instagram
yeah since i'm [ __ ] permanently
[ __ ] banned from twitter i gotta pimp
the [ __ ] out of that instagram
get with it h bomber guy even i have one
of those holy [ __ ] i thought you were
i was i was reading your chat i wasn't
talking to destiny oh yeah
ushanka down an enemy 200 meters and
then clean him up
place in the top three yeah i'm never
getting that [ __ ] okay use five perks
i can do that placing top 15 with the
ritual bowl okay
we got that we got that voice i'm going
to hold a referendum at my house to
watch anime and then when the referendum
passes
i get to pick the anime and no one can
veto me
that's what we voted for
listen man i just want to say that i 100
fully
don't use your comedic timing and skills
on here okay i fully support everything
h bomber guys said
[ __ ] democracy people are [ __ ] stupid
okay that's the will of the people
we don't watch goblin slayer okay that's
what we voted for
getting real edgy now i'm sorry i
haven't actually watched any of it and
people keep asking me for a take it's
like well why would you waste your time
watching it if you think it's gonna be
bad like
oh i think people want your take because
of the big [ __ ] like rape scene in
the first episode or whatever
oh geez yeah that's probably why people
are bugging you for it
oh wow
well now i have to watch it i have to
have a take
damn definitely i'll take behind let me
tell you i am still don't
don't take any advice from this guy
don't listen to destiny he just leaves
his [ __ ] teammates behind his [ __ ]
dude
all i have is you i have been watching a
lot of judges for me
do you do you not like it do you like
anime i don't know you don't like fun
oh no i do like fun anime i don't the
only reason i don't watch jojo
honest to god is just because the fan
base is so [ __ ] cancerous it makes me
never want to watch
oh yeah yeah one of a friend of mine who
everything he recommended
to me and it totally took someone else
forcing me to get into it for me to be
like oh yeah cool this is good
maybe i do see your point there i had a
friend who was really who would like
just recommend me any music
pitchfork happened to recommend highly
and it just put me off of
the idea of music for so long and i
regret it because
now i'm into all kinds of good music
like the destiny soundtrack
i was just gonna say i only listen to
the music destiny makes with the
saxophone now
shut up you're
no yeah i wasn't talking about oh yeah i
forgot that it's no i was talking about
i was talking about
steve bonnell the second and and his his
works
they're very good i wasn't even being
sarcastic
i i i played your uh your was it ocarina
of time or whatever
like you've done like an 11 minute um
song i i use that as an outro sometimes
without asking me that's my [ __ ] [ __ ]
that's my copyright
you mca me [ __ ] i [ __ ] will [ __ ] you
holy [ __ ] you
so many days your channel will be
deleted and he didn't act on it and then
act surprised when his channel
oh [ __ ] i didn't realize i wasn't even
in the [ __ ] stupid app yeah i don't
think he actually read that or i don't
even know if he knows how to read it's
funny because he actually tweeted out
the exact warning and then was like wait
what waited it out and then
it was like wait what yeah i do wait who
tweeted what out
basically sargon of akkad i so i dmc had
four videos off of his [ __ ] because i
[ __ ] hate that guy and he ripped my
[ __ ] and i [ __ ] hate him with a fiery
passion because he's so stupid
but um he he tweeted out a picture of
like the things saying they were dmca
and at the bottom of the picture it said
if you don't respond to this within
seven days your channel will be closed
and you just tweet out the pictures like
oh well i can't believe it doesn't even
save me and then in seven days
he started to freak out dude like what
the [ __ ] my twitter account got just
like deleted
or not my twitter my youtube what people
are shooting up at the
at the sky or from the west yeah
he started to freak out and um and he
was saying like oh destiny must have
dmca
videos that were already taken down
whatever the [ __ ] that means
um and then yeah and then and then
everybody's like dude you like the
picture you tweeted out said your
account was gonna get shut down like how
are you acting surprised about this it's
very [ __ ] weird
so we don't know we we don't know if
sargon of akkad knows how to read or not
yet right now
he does he's just pretty dumb yeah i'm
not settled on it yet
it's just a boomer memes account given
given flesh
yeah wait what do we think about louis
ck did i ask you already uh
destiny i mean he's
he's kind of going the reactionary route
i don't know speaking of boomer memes
that's what i that was that was a segway
that was very good
i got into louis ck uh when he was good
it's you know it saved me the heartbreak
of watching someone turn out to be a
massive piece of [ __ ] i just never cared
i mean he's his comedy also really good
this is a bad scanner he'll
he'll be okay oh yeah he'll be fine i'm
sure i think he's
i think he's like fully gonna lean into
the reactionary [ __ ] though people
are shooting again oh [ __ ] oh behind us
behind us oh [ __ ] i'm dead
like directly 150 uh 130 140 150 that
vicinity up
up nope cleaned me up
ah [ __ ]
no no to the left yeah he was shooting
from over there
did you get him going to chat the car
and crack says louis ck will go on ruben
that's a pretty good prediction
i think he's already following um ian
miles strong
so louis ck is
oh [ __ ] you're dead
holy [ __ ]
ian miles chung oh my god oh apparently
that's a fake louis ck account okay
i fell for it i fell for a trick i got i
got owned online [ __ ]
oh yeah oh yeah someone created a like a
fake louis ck account yeah and then was
like
oh [ __ ] like [ __ ] i gave up like uh
you know you can't make everybody happy
so i'm just gonna pee myself or whatever
the [ __ ] and he was just like
oh man we got 11th place wait i got so
easily owned just now
yeah it's really easy to it's really
easy to do that
update your g-force drivers i'm not
going to do that right now also it's not
my g4 drivers destiny why am i getting
[ __ ] 25 fps dude
what is going on this is a very cpu
intensive game
and if you're trying to stream and play
at the same time on one computer it's
going to be real hard
yeah that's what it is right because
currently it says my slobs is taking up
only 9
of my cpu um
which means that it's your processor
that's throttling it's a normal thing
with pre-assembled computers they're
weak on cpu as destiny says
you were getting decent fps the other
day i was oh [ __ ] i unlocked the
character i unlocked the older
uh the older guy
when's the last time you rebooted yeah
that's not gonna help you
this is a 1999.
my setup is okay except i have this
problem where i like if my
internet i live in the woods so my
internet occasion just hiccups and stops
for a few sec
it causes it to just completely [ __ ]
itself and not work
it'll just like crash
destiny all things considered that
someone in my chest asking
when it's when it's not okay for destiny
to not follow through with brexit
when is it okay for the uk to rejoin the
eu if they vote for it
do they just have to start out the eu
stay out of it do you have to wait
another 30 years
like last time you know there was a
referendum on whether or not uh scotland
should leave
the uk and they want to have another one
you can agitate for whatever you want
it's politics
i think uh yeah i mean i'm leaning more
and more towards uh
like a second referendum i understand i
understand destiny side on it saying
like well
what what difference does it make then
like why was there a referendum
in the first place it kind of like
destroys the concept of referendums if
we're just going to have
uh counter referendums over and over
again until we get our sides uh
um perspective across but yeah
it's well in that case you position it
as a more new one
now we have a deal in place is this the
deal that we want to go with or do we
want no deal or do we want
uh no brexit we should make better
refund among the actual options that are
now available to us
i think it's trickery but i agree with
it where are you dude
yeah [ __ ] jump out sorry i was not
watching does anybody have this thing
where sometimes you're
um i don't know i use a google pixel but
like your android phone sometimes the
autocorrect is like literal jesus and
sometimes the autocorrect is literal dog
trash
excuse me i have a i have a disgusting
capitalist iphone and it's great
wait really i believe that don't ever
[ __ ] chase me
little [ __ ] boy i show it and i show it
in the video i use it
i think it's the video about brexit
hassan where are you
i'm in the maze i'm gonna die i saw some
there was too many people for me to
[ __ ] go out and run into the middle
sorry i saw i saw i saw an australian
self-help guru
you're like right throw out your phone
and make it push them
i thought you were [ __ ] kidding you
legitimately have a flip phone okay
that's cold
wait really yeah
great taking pictures i just have to use
my imagination
just remember forever yeah i don't know
oh [ __ ] english guys cryptic command
uh i made from a guy i'm uh
i'm a pro i'm a former pro fighting game

um yeah i'm ready when you're okay okay
cool one two
three holy [ __ ] 16 minutes
just nice nice
okay i go to the hospital and i walk in
to the front main area because i don't
know where to go i don't know if they
brought her to emergency i don't know if
she's been already
if she's going to be admitted to the
hospital i don't know what's going on
how serious this whole situation is
i have no idea obviously that's the time
panda got taken hospital yeah fly eagles
fly shout out to my eagles fly who just
did
a uh just subscribe to the channel
actually thank you fly eagles fly i
appreciate that
um so i walk into the hospital there's
an information desk
it's completely empty there's no one
sitting there you can tell there's four
chairs no one there i guess because it's
sunday
no one works at this hospital or
whatever so i'm looking around i'm
pacing back and forth what do i do who
do i talk to finally i find a phone
it says lift this phone for information
okay i pick up the phone
hello is this the who's this can you
help me you know my girlfriend
i think she's in the hospital somewhere
and they're like oh okay what's her name
i give her the name
okay she's still over an emergency so go
this way and go to emergency okay
would have been nice if you know there
was a [ __ ] human working instead of
me having to find a random phone that
was hidden in this hallway
so okay i get uh i gotta go
through this lobby i go to the emergency
so again i walk to emergency now there's
a line and i'm like well these are
people who are hurt what do i do so i
get in line but i'm looking around
i wait in line for like five minutes and
i realize to my left way over here on a
tiny little
wait wait a second can you meet your mic
for a second just first little sign he
said
visit your check-in i'm like wow
if only there was a big [ __ ] sign so
everyone would know where to go when
they walked into this hospital and said
this
tiny rinky thing sign you can't even see
from the front door so if i get out of
the line i'm in i go over there
talk to a security guy you know kick
makes a copy of my license checks me and
says okay she's down there she's in room
228 i said so what's the deal he says
well it says here
you know she had a another anxiety
attack well not another because they
don't know that she's had him in the
past
she had an anxiety attack um apparently
they you know she's drugged
and she's in this room awaiting a doctor
to kind of co either come in or whatever
i guess the doctor's coming to coming
into
to check her out or no no actually take
that back
he said no he didn't say that he had
told me there was a doctor that was
checking her out or something like that
i was like okay
so i go i walk through i go all the way
to the to the back of the emergency area
where they've got her in a room and i go
in and she's conscious but she's kind of
loopy you could tell
they did somebody drugged her or
something because she wasn't no panic or
nothing you know no anxiety or nothing
she was just like oh like loopy like
this right um
so i you know obviously say you're okay
you didn't fall you hit your head or
nothing right no
just you know she happens it sucks
because it happens every once in a while
and now this is the worst one she's ever
had so maybe that she has to go see you
know her doctor and and try to get some
kind of thing to take care of it because
the bottom line is the anxiety attacks
they suck the reason they suck is
there's really no way to cure them okay
um there's things you can do like for
example you could try
a certain kind of breathing or um
if there's someone who's like constantly
has mental issues and is having these
problems they could go on an
antidepressant but that's not the
situation here the situation is every
once in a while she just gets one
and now it's like a tizzy you gotta try
to calm her down right um
now in this case they drugged her so she
got drugs you know she was woozy or
whatever
so i sat there with her and i i'm not
even kidding we're sitting here waiting
wait i said what are we waiting for she
says i guess they told me that there's
going to be a counselor
that's going to be coming in and talking
to me about this and what happened or
whatever to make sure i'm all right
and then you know i can't i can't we
can't get any further help or diagnosis
until this counselor comes in
okay all right so
we're sitting there and i look down and
on her unless she's in you know she's on
a hospital gurney or whatever sitting
there in the room
on her lap is a brochure i said what's
this i pick it up
finance how to pay finance i'm like
you're in the emergency room
like you're they already gave you a way
to pay the bill
and i'm looking at it like imagine if
you were here you had your arm chopped
off and your
arm is [ __ ] splitting blood before
they start suturing it do they hand you
the payment brochure first just to be
sure you could [ __ ] pay
i couldn't believe it i was like if that
was me and i was sitting in an emergency
room i'd be [ __ ] offended that they
would hand me this up front like that
seriously i'd be like get the [ __ ] out
of here with this i'm insulted that you
hand me a payment [ __ ] plan already
i mean this is ridiculous i couldn't
believe it okay i couldn't believe
it so we wait there how long no let's
see how long did we wait
let's see people could take a guess how
long did we wait did we wait
10 minutes no did we wait 20 minutes
did we wait 30 minutes no do we wait 40
minutes no
50 minutes no do wait an hour no an hour
goes by
no one's come in no nurse no no
counselor nothing we're just sitting
there doing nothing
and we're like well what is this is are
you are we even aware of what's going on
here
and you know at this point she was
starting to get hungry because now it's
like around the time that we would
normally eat or whatever
and we're like god this is no good now
we're gonna we'll be starving we have to
figure out what's going on
so i said okay let me leave and go find
someone so i leave the room and i walk
down the hallway and there's like a desk
at the end of this
emergency room hallway and i you know i
saved the girl there oh excuse me you
know my girlfriend or you know is over
room
28 and you know she just had she had a
panic attack they drugged her
and we need to know what's going on
we're wondering is there a counselor
coming or whatever because we're in the
dark we're just standing here we're not
even sure what's going on and the girl
literally looks at me like this and says
i don't know and no one here knows
anything
i was like wow
what great help right but she says so
go back to the room and press the call
button then a nurse will show up and the
nurse will be able to tell you
what's going on okay i couldn't believe
it i'm making it up she actually said
that to me no one here knows anything
okay this is great i know you're loving
this story i'm loving the story
okay so then i go back to the room
i tell the analyst you're gonna have to
buzz to find out what the hell is going
on here
so she buzzes and we wait and we wait
about five minutes it wasn't too bad
nurse comes in woman she says what's
going what's wrong what's going on
atlanta says well no she's so groggy she
barely talks like ah nothing i just want
to know
what's happening here is you know are we
waiting for a counselor or a doctor or
whatever
and the woman looks at us with like a
look of scorn
right a look of score and she's like
you've only been here like an hour and a
half and we have other patients and i'm
like
what kind of [ __ ] place is this
like you're gonna talk down to the
patient who's been waiting an hour and a
half and no one's coming to tell her the
status of what's going on
and she asks and you get angry and i'm
like what the hell
so i said listen i said we're both
hungry she needs food she hasn't eaten
today
so the woman says okay i'll go get you
some food so she leaves
she comes back with a turkey sandwich
it's like turkey on
on rye bread with a piece of lettuce and
a piece of cheese and like a packet of
mustard
and a couple saltines and a apple juice
and like a little
the apple juice looked like it was like
a yogurt cup i've never even seen apple
juice stored like that before
and a string cheese now leanna hates
string cheese and leanna wasn't
super hungry for like a sandwich so she
ate some saltines good she got something
in her and she there was water there to
give her water she didn't want the apple
juice
so he gave her the apple juice or
whatever all right um
so now we wait again we're waiting and
waiting so anyway oh i forgot to tell
you before there's a legislation the
counselor is coming you just have to
wait
you have to wait because there's other
people here i'm like wow thanks
how long did we wait for the counselor
what do you think did we wait an hour
and a half
yeah well longer than that we wait an
hour 45 minutes you know okay maybe we
had
two hours yeah no longer
almost two and a half [ __ ] hours we
sat there
okay waiting for a counselor to come
into the room
the counselor was a elderly woman you
could tell she's probably in her 60s
white woman
comes in with two pieces of paper okay
she comes in
hi how you doing are you in pain no
that's good
uh are you still you're still having
anxiety no that's good
okay oh they gave you some drugs right
yeah okay that's why you're calm that's
why you're woozy it's because you're on
the drugs
so here's two pieces of paper explaining
what anxiety attacks are have you ever
had an anxiety attack before
and i'm like so
they admitted her or they'd admit her
they bring her into
the emergency room they administered a
drug and no one even asked her when she
would brought in
anything at all they had no basic
information whatsoever about this thing
she'd been sitting for two and a half
hours
she might have been having a life
crippling anxiety attack where she's
gonna [ __ ]
you know lose her mind and be mentally
loser lose her [ __ ]
and she comes in did you ever had an
anxiety attack before
she's like yes uh are they usually like
this
well you know i have one but this is the
worst one i've ever had
oh well do you have a doctor
yeah a primary care physician yeah
well we recommend that you go see your
doctor then i'm like
oh my god are you [ __ ] for real
are you [ __ ] for real okay then she
says
so you know there are different ways
that we can help
with with stuff like this primarily
what it is we recommend you don't take
any drugs at all you just wait it out
okay now obviously just waiting it out
doesn't work in the situation that liana
was in to the point where they called
the paramedics the paramedics
recommended drugging her
so this woman is obviously a [ __ ]
buffoon okay so then she said
so typically you should just wait it out
but you know there's other ways you
could do
if it's something that happens all the
time then you can do anti-depressants
and that's a long-term medication but
since it doesn't happen all the time
with you
usually we just have this kind of an
emergency pill
where if he ever has a bat you have a
bad attack you could just pop the pill
almost like an epi pen it's like an
emergency issue where you have an
allergic reaction
you pop yourself with that epipen and it
solves the problem so same thing here
you have a problem pop the pill right
and it'll cure the problem or whatever
um but obviously but we don't recommend
you do that all the time because as you
can see you are tired and loopy
and you don't want to be that all the
time right and i'm like
this is the most like stupid what's the
word i'm looking for
patronizing woman i've ever heard in my
life she's given zero useful information
whatsoever and we waited two and a half
[ __ ] hours for her
okay by the way i'm not done yet but i
want to give a shout out to
uh smart weirdo 95 with a 2 000 [ __ ]
here thank you smart weirdo 95 he says
i've been watching for entertaining me
over designers year
thank you very much smart weirdo that's
very appreciated 2 000
is awesome and obviously he's the
cheerleader like two dollars for him
like i was the top donator okay so nice
she literally says okay well i'm done
see you later and she starts walking out
the door i was like whoa
whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa what's
gonna happen now are we
still staying or are you going to get a
doctor
what's going to happen here and she says
oh i guess i'll go talk to the doctor
and then she leaves
all right
american healthcare ladies and gentlemen
what a great system we have right
so guess how long that we waited guess
how long that we waited folks
um about another 20 minutes i would say
about another 20 minutes we just sat
around doing nothing
so now for a grand total we've been in
this place for almost three hours
okay almost three whole hours finally
who comes in the room the doctor right
the doctor comes in and says oh
let's you know let's see no the nurse
comes back in the same nurse that gave
us the sandwich
oh well we had your blood pressure
monitored this whole time your blood
pressure looks fine everything looks
good she turns off the machine she says
okay you can go wait that's it so you're
not gonna prescribe a medication
you're not actually gonna do any tests
you're not gonna do anything that we
just waited three hours all you did is
you gave her a pill
which you could have [ __ ] done and
just left her
somewhere she was no reason for her to
come to the emergency room whatsoever
because they did nothing they didn't
actually help her in any way because i
just give her a pill
so we wasted over three hours in this
emergency room that was it we
was it and then we're actually we're
like shocked we're actually shocked that
this is it this is the whole
treatment that we got so we're walking
towards the front of the the hospital
and there's this area here that says uh
if you are
my girlfriend what's the word discharge
you have to stop here
so we stopped there and the woman and
she got and she looks around the corner
says hi she said
well did the nurse give you the
paperwork that said what you're here for
and we're like yeah here's the paperwork
about
anxiety okay bye see you later
that was it so three hours in a hospital
in an emergency room area
nothing whatsoever useful was done
whatsoever to lyanna
the the drug that they gave her to help
her was hour or an hour earlier
that's american health care now by the
way i guarantee you
i guarantee you we don't know what the
bill is because we don't have it they're
going to mail it obviously
i guarantee you it's going to be like a
thousand bucks i'm not even exaggerating
i guarantee you that bill's going to
[ __ ] show up
and it's going to be anywhere between
500 to a thousand bucks i guarantee it
because she has insurance she actually
is covered in insurance because
uh she's already under the plan of her
mother that's
that's one of the things that obamacare
actually helped with is that allows
people who are young enough to be
covered up to the age of 26
under the health insurance plan of their
parents so she's still covered under her
mother but i guaran
i guarantee you i guarantee you we're
gonna get a giant bill in the mail
for nothing for a pill they could have
just handed her the pill and said 80
for the pill or whatever but instead
they had to bring her to the [ __ ]
hospital and they did nothing they
literally did nothing to help her
and now she's gonna get a giant bill
so there you go isn't that a great story
ladies and gentlemen um
isn't that great i mean it's just such a
great american healthcare system
right so now she's zonked out she's
sleeping you know in the room because of
you know everything she's still on the p
the pills i made are all loopy or
whatever
so i mean we did on the way home i
stopped and we got food we got grabbed
like chicken sandwiches and we just ate
them and now she's sleeping so
so that's what happened unbelievable
like
oh my god the thing is i know if this
ever happens again i'm telling you you
are not allowed to bring her to the
hospital no
no you get no permission to [ __ ] do
it you can't give her a pill you wanna
give her a pill give her a pill
and that's it because you're just gonna
waste our time again you didn't help us
at all
what a [ __ ] i thought what i thought
when they said counselor i thought they
were gonna have like an
actual psychiatrist or counselor come in
and talk and let's talk maybe maybe i
can talk
talk it out and help you with some of
your stress or your issues or maybe
something
talk through that could help you so that
you can get it without stressful leave
then it doesn't happen again
that was the biggest joke i've ever seen
in my life she could have been that
woman
could have been anyone that would have
been the [ __ ] janitor that just
walked in who knows because she had no
knowledge besides what she had on a
piece of paper
and by the way the article and this is
not even exaggeration
the article they brought in about
anxiety was from 1996.
a 21-year-old outdated article from the
mayo clinic about anxiety
oh my god
i'm sorry ah have i not seen this before
what an incredible [ __ ] what did it
what an incredible uh animation this was
though
it was yeah
sorry i've been getting on hassan don't
waste my [ __ ] time
what get on black ops you [ __ ] i'm
waiting for this to [ __ ]
