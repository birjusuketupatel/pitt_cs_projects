what do you got
holy uh i mean this is my first
time on here someone
just but uh yeah i i just wanted to say
for starters thank you because
you i know you've probably heard this a
lot before but you kind of saved me from
the whole
uh i guess you could call it like the
alt-right rabbit hole kind of thing
sure where you know so so like uh it was
like in 2016 trump had just been elected
um i was pretty upset because i was like
how the did we get this dumbass
elected
um because i'd always been pretty
left-leaning but i was still susceptible
to this whole uh
like there was this very there's like a
very starting level
kind of uh very digestible
starting point to this rabbit hole i
guess you could say um like the first
one i ever watched uh you might have
heard of he's called chris raygun
you know very yeah he's she talked
online
yeah yeah i mean he barely is too like
it was it was like uh
pretty digestible content like there
wasn't anything disagreeable there was
just like hey look at this
look at this crazy feminist um and i
started to just get like pulled down
that rabbit hole
um and i see this like you you change
that because i ended up watching the
jontron debate and i
you know that's the one a lot of people
kind of had their minds changed with
um but what really got me uh was
last or yesterday night seeing the soap
debate
um so i'd actually watched uh her
content back in like 2016 when she got
popular because it was like so funny
yeah 11 year old little girl saying
a lot um
and i honestly don't buy that she didn't
mean what she said in those league chat
locks
um and i know that oh yeah no 100
oh yeah hold on i'm sorry i'm sorry no
no no oh okay oh my god i'm sorry i
don't maybe i should have been explicit
here
i absolutely think she meant what she
said in those chat logs heard
pretending that it was hyperbole or
whatever was so dumb
i have very decent amounts of evidence
to like guarantee this
so like back when she first started
making videos there was a bit of a
scandal
that her older brother was the one who
wrote the scripts for these commentary
videos and where she was saying you
know pretty yeah a lot of people
are saying that's the guy that she
dragged in that dropped the environment
on me
right i i think so yeah when watching it
um like i've been trying to get my
my friend cindy into this whole like uh
watching you and he's like really
getting into it
uh because he was never really into
politics um i immediately called like
that sounds like her brother and
there's even a
uh a log of um of like a post on twitter
of her brother
uh praising the new zealand terrorist
and saying
this guy's a hero and all that so i
100 think that
uh her family probably has some pretty
alt-right beliefs if not her like
older brother as well as her and i i
look at this kid
as like kind of a tragedy because it
seems like this is what
uh it seems like this is what happens
when you see like a really young child
raised i'm like i know this is gonna
sound cringey
uh not exactly like kind of the overly
edgy kind of like
uh meme culture i guess you could say
like the like over the top like
edgy for the sake of being edgy part
like i have no doubt she
dabble in 4chan i mean i don't know
where the whole anarcho-catholic
capitalist thing came from i mean that's
like a pretty commenting meme right if
you want to like
yeah i guess i never got to that point
at least i mean
i mean i was close i guess if i was like
a big like iran fan and all that
i mean hardcore libertarian and
anarcho-capitalism are probably fairly
close to each other you just need a
gentle push
yeah i mean it seems like that you got
the libertarian libertarians
love trump it seems like that one video
where
steve crowder got completely owned by
that one kid yeah
careful though that's like that's like a
tea party libertarians or whatever not
like actual like political
but yeah i know yeah so i
i do um i do youtube a little bit and
i've been wanting to get into politics
because i see this happening to a lot of
my
fan base because i i have a pretty
decent fan base and what i do
um is mostly minecraft content on the
server
it's the old it's the oldest server out
there it's it's like it was starting
2010 no map resets
and the whole thing is you're allowed to
hack uh there's
oh my god actually um this is super
ironic not ironic a weird coincidence i
don't know if you were the one that did
this
does 4chan play on your server a lot
it's it's a server that was heavily
advertised uh on 4chan in the early days
in like 2010 so the
environment like the whole freedom of
speech no banned speech thing yeah
leads to a lot of these like it's it's
like the the chat is basically alive for
champions
yeah essentially somebody i think
emailed me like six years ago
they were like dude if you want to get
into minecraft you should play on this
server
and i think it might have been the one
you're talking about where like the
whole like they said like when you spawn
in like the middle is like just a
massive crater there's no rules
on the server like anybody can do
whatever the they want it's like
this crazy combination of like mayhem
and like unmoderated or whatever
that's it yeah okay oh yeah okay so
somebody actually emailed me this was
like literally five or six years ago
they emailed me suggesting me to play on
this server so that's just interesting
that you're
the person i guess that runs it or no
no no no that's not me i i literally
just make youtube videos oh okay okay
you're just trying you're just
describing that
okay okay okay gotcha okay yeah so like
yeah it's a good server like if you're
into minecraft and you want to just have
like
like uh no uh plug-ins no mods or should
just like complete vanilla experience
it's a good it's good because there's no
map resets in the community
like everything is all like word of
mouth and um which is cool but then
there's also the
the fact that with no freedom of speech
or with no
um restriction to speech you see a very
large
um like it's very foreshady obviously
it's a live 4chan board in chat
and so a lot of my viewers
um are obviously attracted to this
really edgy kind of like edgy for the
 of it kind of thing where they they
watch a lot of these skeptic youtubers
and stuff
so i've started making uh politic videos
that are a bit more left-leaning
i made a video calling out notch and
this is they got a lot of
 because notch was just not you know
i i imagine you sweet sorry
i'm not just like a literal
white nationalist white supremacist oh
yeah
i'm really crazy yeah yeah
so i made a video like hey guys i know a
lot um for those of you who
disagree with notch on this you know he
doesn't own the game anymore try to
enjoy it because i do have a lot of
transgender people in my community and i
didn't
and they all play minecraft and i didn't
want like it's got to be hard being a
transgender person who loves minecraft
and seeing the creator
favorite games saying like that so
i kind of want to make a video on that
and i got a lot of hate
and i don't want that to kind of
discourage me from making this political
content
so i don't know i feel like it's
probably
a good idea but then there's also this
like overwhelming
it seems like if i if i were to pursue
this and i've been getting my friends
into it too like
personally in my personal life um trying
to get them into like
i've got one of my best friends cindy
watching your debates
i kind of just first watched the jesse
lee peterson one
good starter um there's like a lot of
hate
like it's it's starting i mean i i get
that's what's to expect but it kind of
makes me think
how prevalent are these getting
do you think like how how prevalent do
you think these uh
sort of like all light i guess you could
say opinions are getting among
younger people because it seems like the
whole feminist ruining our video
games it seems like it's getting like to
be a really popular idea
like really well accepted as far as like
people that like um
it's hard because like we're exposed to
those types of communities so much more
i mean i'm sure it's not as popular as
it seems but
i mean you'd have to get like pulling
data and whatnot like that'd be like
really difficult
i like because obviously if you spend a
lot of time on certain reddit uh on
certain subreddits on certain youtube
comment sections you can feel like holy
 like almost every kid is
but then like if you go to like
different other types of videos it'll
seem like nobody is i don't know like
what the actual like numbers end up
being it's really hard to say
yeah i i look at it and i know this
probably isn't the perfect way to
get your uh to get like a a scope of it
i look at you know the the big content
creators who have like an insane amount
of popularity they look at your
armored skeptics your showing heads your
lauren southerns
those they have massive amounts of
support you see like
ben shapiro getting featured on meme
review
yeah that's that's what got me the most
hate from just like my friends and
when i said um
i i'm gonna unsub from pewdiepie after
that shooting and him like making a
half-assed twitter post and not
like saying hey these uh
actual like there's actual nazis in this
community and i
i'm and i know they like to say well
that's guilt by association you know you
can't uh
be blamed for the people in your
community and it's like well no you can
you can speak out against people who you
see watching you did it with like uh
when you said hey if you're
crazy ass eat the
eat the rich communist who watches me
 off you know
so it's like um that that's something
that that he could do and when i
when i came out about this i had a lot
of hate because the whole like subscribe
to pewdiepie thing and it's just yeah i
don't know it seems like even the
biggest
uh youtuber you know following lauren
southern and like
uh stefan molyneux these like great
replacement people like
really extreme like that's not
that's not uh
yeah that's that's not a that's not just
memes and that's not
like like just conservatism that's like
conspiracy level
uh racist you know like borderline
race realism kind of stuff so
not borderline i mean like just crosses
the line
oh yeah i mean if you believe in in the
whole great replacement thing
i'd say race realism is pretty close
behind and it's
it's kind of frightening because it's i
feel like at this point
when i watch a content creator like i
find it a youtuber especially like when
you see those um
those meme like those youtubers who like
make these really high quality like meme
edits of things
uh it seems like a lot of them are like
in this uh community
um very like they're friends with the
skeptics like i think dolan dark is one
of them he's like
really good buddies with like a lot of
the um the skeptic
uh youtubers and it's just like ah like
you never know like which one of these
like especially with like lieutenant
which one of these like content creators
i like to watch is gonna end up coming
out as like a
white nationalist on themselves you know
oh
can hell yeah the jontron thing too i i
i spoke out about that and a lot of my
friends were like come on man jontron's
not uh cool
you know he was i don't think he
knew what he was talking about and i'm
just like
look at the clip he he was saying you
know it that
white people are going to be a minority
and it's just
i don't know i do what do you think is
is going to come in
in the future do you think that this
whole like they're calling it bread tube
like the left leaning
uh side of youtube do you think it's
going to kind of
explode the way the skeptic community
has maybe yeah i think it will i think a
lot of people
kind of got bored of the skeptic
like it seems like a lot of the people
that we're doing a lot of that having
commentary have kind of off a bit
because like people are getting a little
tired of like the
triggered sjw um so maybe like the
left-leaning stuff will explode for a
little while and then i'm sure we'll get
a swing back like later on but
yeah yeah i'm i'm just like
i don't know i had more that i wanted to
say it's just i'm a little
i don't know why i get uh i i tend to
ramble sometimes and forget what my
original point was but
at the end of the day yeah uh soph or
lieutenant corbis as many people know
her
definitely met those things she said
yeah for sure 100
and i know like a big argument that she
kept making was like well you can't no
you know why you keep saying nick
fuentes is a uh is a nazis
he never said kill black people or
something
it's like well it's 2019 no actual
neo-nazi or whatever is going to come
out and say okay let's kill all the
black people
no they're going to dog whistle and and
say thing
and you know what is someone supposed to
get from a video where he says
um black people commit the most uh
violence in the united states and
well white people are going to be a
minority in uh
by what was it 2025 2050 i don't know
uh like what is like a racist person
supposed to get from that right
like i mean i don't know yeah i mean
i'll i'll uh
i'll let you get back to it man it's
been nice talking to you uh i've i'm
i've been watching you for a year and i
stabbed a couple weeks ago so i do plan
to keep it uh going keep up the good
work man thanks buddy i appreciate it
all right have a great day man uh al
pacino happiness cappuccino al pacino
thanks a lot all right have fun peace
