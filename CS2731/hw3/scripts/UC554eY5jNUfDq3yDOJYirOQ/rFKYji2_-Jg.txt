hello can you hear me oh i can hear you
now what up
um hi uh so like i'm a small political
youtuber
uh and i want to change your mind on
abortion you think we can do that uh
my i can't really have a conversation
about it right now my opinion is pretty
influx on a couple things but yeah go
for it i guess if you want to sure hit
me up
we'll be approaching it from different
angles um
so the first thing i want to do is get
some things out of the way i want to
make a disclaimer
that we're going to be talking about a
touchy issue some of the arguments that
i provide
clearly reflective of what i actually
believe but are simply provided in the
interest of strengthening the argument
or furthering the debate
okay okay um so i
i support the right of the legal right
of a person to get an abortion because
on a societal level we fare better
economically and criminally if
pregnancies can be planned for
yeah i agree with that i was thinking
you would disagree with that that kind
of just ruins everything now
[ __ ] well i'm [ __ ] i don't know how much
you've heard but i'm pragmatically i'm
very much in favor legally of abortion
if for no other reason than because it
literally can't be regulated like if
somebody really wants to get abortion
you can't stop them from doing it
so it seems even dumb to force it like
that sorry
[ __ ] well we can talk about the
philosophy if you want sure
philosophy is a little bit harder to
break down because people tend to be
it's it's subjective
yeah a little bit yeah of course what
philosophy is because their moral
systems are subjective right
yeah okay so where we both struggle is
the ethics of it when is it okay to have
an abortion and why
um um
i think the question should should never
be whether or not a fetus
is a clump of cells because we are
columbus cells i don't think the debate
should be whether a fetus is a life
it is a life um i think the question
should be whether a fetus is a person
and if it is a person at what point in
development does it become a person
you you you believe in the moments of
conception right yeah because that seems
to be the most consistent time to define
like your existence the the beginning of
your existence yeah
i would now why why would you say that's
your so actually
i've broken down what i think makes a
person a person into a person um
by several points and i want to see if
you agree with this or not okay that to
be a person
in a technical sense a person should be
alive a person should be viable and a
person
of being absorbed into a social contract
um
alive yeah probably yeah for sure
um viable what do you mean by viable
by viable i mean capable of surviving um
outside of a loom with or without the
aid of technology um
capable of surviving outside of the womb
i feel like
we're kind of begging the question if
that's our
if that's included in the premise do you
think because if because i mean you kind
of like win the argument de facto if i
accept
that because obviously a fetus by
definition can't survive outside the
womb right
i mean i would say that a violation of
any of these tenants in terms of
philosophy could revoke personhood
by that criteria it's not considered
dirty human life um here's
um i i feel like um so i feel like when
you say viable
i feel like you're that you're using
that as a proxy for something else so
let me ask a question to find out
um so like if a person has to live on
dialysis you wouldn't revoke that
person's personhood even though
they need technology to survive right
well i mean capable of surviving
with or without the aid of technology
sure um
so it's so is it really just because um
they're a fetus or does it have more to
do with violating the autonomy of the
woman that you're like kind of like a
leech of or whatever or is that more
that the
thing that in terms of the viability
argument
it's a little bit of both um but i think
generally we
already accept that there's a difference
between a fetus and a born person
in terms of what makes them a person
well i would argue that you demonstrate
this sure go ahead god
i only hear your argument or i was gonna
say my argument against that is i would
say that like um
that it has to be something more than
that um because if we take somebody
that is born um and we take them like
five seconds prior to them like
breaching i don't think that most people
would be comfortable saying like this is
absolutely not a person and then at the
moment of birth they become a person um
so i would argue there's got to be
something
more different this is why we usually
draw lines for like third and second
trimester stuff
but uh sure but you can you can actually
extract
a fetus from a womb and it still be
capable of surviving as
as a fetus like it could still develop i
mean at this point it's a person
um and i think c-sections like it not
all pregnancies actually result in live
birth
and you can still have a baby out of it
sure i guess yeah sure and then in that
case like whether or not you're
in that case like this is kind of weird
too these these don't necessarily
invalidate your argument i'm just here
curious to hear your defense with them
so like in that case you can argue that
your personhood and some in some cases
is actually defined by the technology at
the time then as well right
that like if you if we lived in a world
where you could where you were viable at
one month then then a two-month fetus is
very easily a person
but if we lived in like prehistoric
societies or some [ __ ] like you're
literally not even a person until like
almost after you're born because who the
[ __ ] knows when your viable are going to
survive right yeah
once the chord's been cut then you're
like a person yeah okay
um and this was what i talked about like
with the issues with uh moral relativism
and how it
our standards for what makes a person a
person change over time there was a time
uh when black people weren't considered
people in the same sense as white people
so
figuring out that point's important but
i want to propose a thought experiment
if you'll allow me
okay i'll allow you
to demonstrate to you and to most people
who are watching that we don't consider
a fetus a person
um at the moment of conception and we'll
use
this is an example let's say that we
have a petri dish
it's a petri dish with a fetus
developing in vitro
and we also have a living breathing
child that's already born in a crib and
there's a fire that breaks out and you
can only save either the petri dish
or the baby which one do you save and
why
um so um
so i'm uncomfortable with these examples
for a number of reasons but the most
pressing reason is because it's in my
interest to lie to you in order to win
the argument
um because so i've actually heard this
framed a different way
um i mean in answering yours i would
very easily answer that i would save the
baby just because i know 100 that it's
already born whereas um
isn't it like up to 20 percent of women
miscarry in the first trimester it's
it's a very surprisingly high number
most people don't even realize that they
just have like a heavier period they
didn't realize
oh just before like this 25 weeks
survivability is just generally a
question
yeah but i mean i was proposing this
question because if you believe that
life begins on a moment of conception in
fact let's let's even take it a step
further
if you save the the petri dish with the
fetuses in vitro
there's a 100 guaranteed survivability
of them
now which do you save um i mean
guaranteed
a chance of survival you're really just
like
weighing one or the other i don't know
like what you i mean i'd probably maybe
the petri disc
because it's easier to carry out i mean
the way um i understand what you're
getting at the way that i hear this
thought experiment um
done before and and a little bit more i
i think to
strengthen your position is usually if
if there's like a burning building and
you could run out with one living baby
versus 50 petri dishes that have like um
embryos in them which would you choose
that seems to be like a more compelling
version of this because now you really
went yeah
um well we can go with that but it would
never be a contest with me i'd save the
baby every time because i think
exactly yeah and then someone in my
position would have to say
i would save the petri dishes because
it's 50 lives and even if some of them
don't make it like statistically
speaking you're saving more than one
life absolutely right yeah
um and i guess i would argue that the
petri dishes would be more compelling to
say because you've got like 50 unique
people there
as opposed to the baby which is just one
unique person yeah or
one person um it's it's actually
interesting when people like
comment that they're going to save the
baby because it kind of implies that a
person is only a person based on
geographic location
uh which which is it's it's an odd um
self-defeating ideology
wait what do you mean by that get
somebody who's pro-life that says
they'll save the baby instead of the
petri dish then they're basically
seeding that they've made a decision
that
one is a is more of a person
in a technical sense than the other and
it's purely based on geography
what do you mean by geography i mean
that if the petri dish is not
is in a petri dish and not in a a
pregnant woman
then it's it's not a life saving i
understand
sure yeah i can understand that yeah um
so actually i'm curious then um how do
you feel about physician-assisted
suicide
um 100 in favor assuming that like the
under reasonable circumstances i'm
assuming you're not going to ask me any
dumb questions like what if someone
tricked the guy into killing somebody
like if a person wants to end their life
then they should have the option to
do that i think it's like you're one of
your greatest controls i think of
yourself is a decision to end your life
i don't understand why you would ever
take that from somebody
you have a right to death and you have a
right to life but wouldn't the right to
life necessarily
like you wouldn't arrive at a right to
death unless you had a poor quality of
life right
i don't know if that's necessarily true
it would be something that would be left
up to the person not evaluated
externally
i would in general i would agree with
you that the person's perception that
their life isn't worth living
has it outweighs any desire to live yeah
so in general i would agree but i don't
know if i can make that as an absolute
statement
um because everybody's tolerances are
different or something right like yeah
sorry okay good different but i mean do
you find it unique that you can
we could morally justify ending another
human being's life on the basis of their
their life quality but you we couldn't
morally justify ending the life of a
fetus for the same reasons
no so this is why i draw the distinction
um what you're talking about is
physician-assisted homicide
which i think is different so like for
instance like i'm in favor of somebody
making the decision to end their life
if they want to i'm not in favor of
somebody else making that decision for
them
right i think that's that would be a key
difference between like abortion versus
somebody saying okay i want to die now
right suicide is a choice that's
generally undergone by an autonomous
person capable of consenting that
decision and then a fetus is not
where do you fall under the terry
schiavo debate you remember terry shiva
that chick needed to die a long time ago
that was [ __ ]
horrible i felt so bad for that but how
do you reconcile this
because she's [ __ ] she's dead
oh she's brain dead she's physically
alive she's got a family saying
delicious were to be kept alive and
a husband saying her wishes were to die
how do you roll on that
i did i don't think it's comparable to
fetus at all like a fetus is a person
that is in the process of growing and
becoming a person and has potential to
terry shiva was dead 100
um like i considered death at brain
death to be death like you can keep a
body of light
i don't know how i imagine you could
keep a body life indefinitely no um if
you transplant enough organs but like
once the brain is dead you're dead
that's what i would consider death
wouldn't have a problem with abortion if
a fetus were likely to be brain dead at
some sort oh yeah no no
and and i would go farther than that
like if the mother's life is at risk i
would argue that abortion is totally
like even morally if i would if i was a
moral person i'd argue
that like yeah even morally you can be
okay with aborting somebody if there's a
chance of the mother dying even if it's
not 100 there's a chance of the motor
dying just because the mother's life is
guaranteed to be there and
uh fetus is always iffy and then yeah
there's like severe
um i don't know where i stand on things
like severe down syndrome or something
like that
um i don't know i'm a little bit i don't
know i could be swayed either way on
those but if the fetus is like
irreparably brain damaged or something
too
like that child in the was it the united
kingdom like that child
was probably needed to be destroyed as
well because that dude was [ __ ] way
[ __ ] dead
state making the decision over the
parents yeah but
like i don't see that as the state
making the decision it seemed more like
the state was acting as a representative
of the child who had none because
obviously parents
you know own children um and i think in
that case it was important for the for
the state to intervene because the
parents were [ __ ] crazy
gotcha um to be really clear let me just
for like two seconds because i know
people listen and have political
opinions um from my understanding
that child was super [ __ ] dead like
its brain was literally [ __ ] mush and
there was no
indication that it was going to get any
better that it was going to get worse
and worse and worse another i wonder if
there was a mitochondrial disorder or
something
crazy that was like turning that kid's
brain into literal [ __ ] mush
and the idea that even if they had a
magic pill that stopped the disease
progressing at that point
that child was already beyond [ __ ]
brain damaged um
yeah sorry okay yeah so that that's why
i was in favor of the state stepping and
it's
like yo like you need to unplug it like
this is really i guess because we
believe in ethics generally in society
this is really unethical yeah
okay destiny doesn't understand the uk
situation i've been coming at all link
me something that disagrees or [ __ ]
off yourself you stupid [ __ ]
i need i need you to give me a source
that just disagrees with what i said
because i there were two different um
neuroscientists that made like
published like there was a published
statement talking about the state of
that
child's brain and that child was beyond
[ __ ] that child's brain like half of
it was literally [ __ ] mush
and they were trying to like
indefinitely prolong this child's life
waiting for a literal biblical miracle
to bring this child back from the grave
that even if they'd managed to 100 cure
the disease which there was no even
inclination
that they could do that that child was
still beyond brain dead forever like it
was completely [ __ ]
so if you have like something that
disagrees with that that doesn't come
from [ __ ] breitbart i would love to
see the link luke davis because i know a
lot of you centrist dumb [ __ ] like
hijacked that issue and turned it into
some freedom of
whatever [ __ ] but it wasn't that
child was beyond [ __ ] dead from
everything i was aware of
okay i'm sorry single-payer healthcare
fear-mongering
yeah yeah pretty yeah oh yeah yeah
because it was like because because all
the conservatives were pretending that
this was a death panel that they're all
look they're gonna kill your children if
it's not worth it came alive which is
[ __ ]
okay i'm sorry i got way off on that
okay go ahead
um so here since we're talking the
ethics of it would you say it's
unethical to bring a
life into a world that is more than
probably guaranteed to be in a life of
poverty and crime
um i would disagree with that it kind of
sounds like anti-natalism
um is it unethical to have a child
knowing that it might have a hard life
no we're we really have to go on the
antenatalist road here though if
we do this because the way that i would
justify that is that even most people
