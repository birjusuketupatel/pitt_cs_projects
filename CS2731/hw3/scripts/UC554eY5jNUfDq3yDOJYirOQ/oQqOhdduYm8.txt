we need to ask some locals dude i don't
know what the [ __ ] to do excuse me
i'm not from here what is there to do
around here
damn [ __ ] believable damn unfucking
real dude
unfortunately act like a ten but she's
really a three dude exactly on [ __ ]
unfucking real dude
when she act like a temperature really
maybe she just didn't want to talk to
you damn
what the [ __ ] i saw that video
where i got ignored and i saw how uh oh
[ __ ] i i saw the opinions that you said
i'm just here to say
that no you're wrong do you think that
if you're walking on the street do you
think that you owe
everybody the time of day when you're
walking by them i don't think she owes
me the time or day but that's what
you're acting like
you're acting like that she's being a
[ __ ] dick though she's being an
[ __ ] and that's not cool
but do you think that like if you look
at out you in public when you're hanging
out with a couple friends and you do you
have like a gopro on your head or
something and you're holding your phone
out i
had my ipad up recording uh i mean like
i guess like
this is my point of view and i guess
there are like no women in either of our
audiences but like you just want to
[ __ ] go home
i don't see the big deal of just walking
past have you ever had somebody try to
engage in a conversation when you didn't
want to and then you start doing it it's
like impossible to leave like
what do you mean i'm not going to hold
her down dude we were on the busiest
street in the city there was people all
over the goddamn place
i'm going to hold her down right there
in the goddamn middle of the street what
are you talking about i mean if you
don't want to be a part of the
conversation you could just walk away
that's what she did and the fact that
your friend like made that comment
afterwards made it sound like all of you
guys were salty as [ __ ]
like what you're saying now like oh that
[ __ ] was ugly as [ __ ] that [ __ ] was
ugly as [ __ ] why do you care if she's
ugly as [ __ ] i thought you were just
asking for directions why are you even
bringing up how she looks like
because i was never gonna be like yo
baby
i'm not gonna flirt with some ugly okay
but she doesn't know that but she
doesn't know that but she uh yeah
you know i mean she gotta know she ugly
come on uh if people just do that for
the rest of their lives and so you got
your phone don't even ask me for
directions and by the time 2020 comes
you know what we're going to be living
in
a [ __ ] matrix where everybody just
walks around face down looking in their
phone okay [ __ ] i'm just going to ask
siri everything and then put my dick
inside my thumbs it's the only dragon
[ __ ]
i feel like you're extrapolating a
little bit like what do you what does
people in the chat think i mean don't
you
i don't want to why would i want to take
other humans you can but you
but you could but you're presenting me
false dilemmas you can talk to other
people and still not want to give a
random [ __ ] on the street directions
when they're
when you don't feel like it like you
don't have to do that that's all i'm
saying i'm like a [ __ ] creature to
her
she didn't want to talk to you that's it
she's not even a human to her she's
[ __ ]
she just didn't know it's not above you
why are you turning into such an ego
thing what the [ __ ] where's your
self-esteem at dog she just didn't want
to talk to you that's it
no she's a stupid i had this one
conversation on twitter
with this uh tram vestite woman
or something i said that it was a guy
because it had a penis do you want me to
argue about the legitimacy of
transgender people i i feel like this
isn't an argument that
it's kind of beautiful i'm just saying
if you have a penis you're a man
is that correct or is it not i don't
know dude there's some crazy
[ __ ] going on now i don't know dude i i
feel like this conversation isn't very
fruitful i
i don't think budget is going to come
from this but i'm just trying to uh
i don't know man just prove that i'm a
better debater than you
hold on real fast i'm curious what does
lgbt stand for
hold on right now lgbt lady gaga
billy tip listen i don't [ __ ] know
there are two worlds
there is the world as you wish it to be
and there is the world that you live in
okay you have to accept that both are
two different things and you can't treat
one like the other otherwise you end up
delusional
right so you're basically pretending
just because of the reality that you
live in
because you like like that's like me
saying okay i want to uh
you know i i don't know i hate football
but i pretend like football's all my
friends like football you know what i
mean
no that would be like saying i don't
like football i wish no one would like
football
but i understand that there are a lot of
people that like football that would be
the comparison there
destiny you don't make any sense you
know that do you think that the world
would be a better place if everybody was
in better shape physically better cardio
better
strength if everybody was healthy in
this world then
there would be an overpopulation problem
and then there would be like
like money money will make the world go
ground what makes the most money in this
world
the [ __ ] like medical industry dude
if you take that out of the way where
the [ __ ] do you get the money from okay
so you think that the world is a better
place when a lot of people have issues
with obesity and
healthcare-related [ __ ] no that sounds
weird but there would be more com
competition it'd be a more competitive
world and the more complicated i don't i
can't i can't win it you got it dude i
can't i can't
i don't know what you want me to say
dude i think that you're like reaching
like really hard now so then shouldn't
more people go and murder each other so
that like funeral homes and [ __ ] could
stay in business
don't you think it would be better why
not why not no it's not that's not the
same
you're saying that it's better than that
a lot of people are unhealthy because we
don't want to have more competition
for stuff no no because murder is
illegal being unhealthy is not illegal
it's different
think about like this i'm a conservative
i'm voting for trump
[ __ ] but there are some
conservatives that are voting for
hillary just because they don't like
trump how could you hate trump
but you're a conservative they're not
really that you're not really
conservative at that point in time
anymore
i feel like you're everything that's
wrong with like partisan politics in the
united states
do you know what conservative or liberal
means can you tell me that a
conservative
is somebody who uh well i mean i just
said it dude a conservative is somebody
who
who believes in personal responsibility
limited government and you know some
markets and like [ __ ] they you
know [ __ ] like that homie what you mean
yeah what was what was the last part
though traditional world values and a
strong
national defense
okay i found the site i found the site
here you go so this is what you were
reading why wouldn't you just tell me
why wouldn't you just tell me that this
is where you got the definition from
so you would let me [ __ ] you if you were
a woman uh i don't i don't
maybe listen if i had an online quiz for
you to take it's 36 questions do you
want to do it for stream
what is it what is this test it has to
it has to do with your ability to uh
socialize
destiny what do you think this is i'm a
professional at socializing somebody
please link the test and chat
in fact i went to a psychologist when i
was younger
he told me that in fact i don't have
autism
i don't know whoa whoa i didn't say
anything about autism if i failed a
socialism test
then wouldn't that make me have some
form this is only a measure of empathy
we're not talking about autism okay
well if you have no empathy you're a
psychopath no you have no empathy or a
sociopath and these are terms that
aren't even recognized anymore so
sociopaths and psychopaths are basically
no they're completely and totally
different
which wordpress describes what the first
adventure is thinking or feeling
[ __ ] uh that's the
tests like these are stupid they don't
mean
anything what is this guy's face
supposed to tell me it's literally
just his eyeballs you cannot understand
what somebody's thinking based on his
eyeballs this has nothing to do with
empathy at all this has to do with
reading body language it's completely
different what do you think
empathy means dog empathy is when you
can feel
other people's emotions and what's one
of the way to understand how other
people are feeling
body language just take the i just try
your hardest just
this guy looks like he just saw the
biggest [ __ ] dick in the world he's
what the [ __ ] dude i don't know sorry my
my internet's just getting all [ __ ]
[ __ ] right now that's okay dude good
thing that test doesn't require very
much bandwidth
let me see here [ __ ] oh my god this
stupid so how many did you get right
dude how many
i got 28. but don't worry about my score
i just want you to take it destiny what
does the spirited mean
that thank you the spirit it isn't like
downtrodden or upset
kind of having lost enthusiasm and hope
despondent
i don't even know what that means but
it's the only one that matters
despondent is like kind of like hopeless
like tell me how many times you've read
the dictionary i just read it again
before i came on to debate with you so
you didn't catch me off guard
i believe this is this is kind of crazy
i believe
that every everything in this world
should be accommodated
for the stupidest people because
obviously the people who are smarter are
going to understand
and then people who are also the
stupidest will still is equally
understand so that means that everybody
that's capable of understanding more
just misses out on everything
it's not about the world we're volume in
you can convey more information using
better words than just using the same
four or five letter words over and over
again
you're literally just saying the same
definition of a word but it's not the
same definition
different words in english language have
different connotations to them like they
mean slightly different things that's
why we have so many different synonyms
for things
give me two examples um that person is
kind of lazy
versus that person is lethargic he's
[ __ ]
lethargic dude laziness and the word
lethargic are literally the same but no
but one can
come but one is different than the other
one conveys like a deeper sense of dread
smarter makes it sound better
but it doesn't really mean any anything
else differently
you're talking about dumbing down like
all of everything because some people
are too stupid to understand some things
i think that you're i think your stance
is objectively wrong i don't even think
you can be subjectively correct on it
like be honest with me are you down to
raiding another guy
are you are you are you straight or are
you bi um destiny take a look at me
maybe
maybe if you cleaned up a little if you
shaved your face maybe i would consider
you
but am i a pretty attractive guy even
without the eyebrow
well unfortunately i'm a big personality
dude so and we disagree a lot of things
so i'm not sure though
typical hillary supporter yo yo what up
i got the score yeah i saw dude
19. maybe that girl could see the 19
written on your face and that's why she
didn't want to talk to you guys what
does that mean
i'm sorry dude but you have terminal
watches my train of thought is is [ __ ]
up because i thought i was getting ddos
it's not fair
i mean because like honestly dude like
i'm it's not the night dude i feel
i have severe autism i love you bro
[ __ ] [ __ ] so much dude
like not even a gay way just a really
super straight way
yeah man it's been nice talking to you
bro we'll talk again all right dude well
good luck with your stream man i hope
you find out that one thing you're
savannah i'm not autistic dude come on
but i'll talk to you later dude all
right dude i love you be careful all
right listen dude [ __ ] be careful
i'm not gonna do my helmet and [ __ ] no
dude [ __ ] it just
in general like just be careful in
general yeah okay yeah they're [ __ ] i
got a
concealed weapons permit don't worry
about me do you really yeah
where'd you go you took the class and
everything firearms permit yeah yeah i
just i just say concealed weapons permit
to be cool for people like me that
actually do hold ccw
i would appreciate it if you didn't
identify that's kind of some stolen
valor [ __ ] right there dude you realize
that right no it's not do what the [ __ ]
you saying homie i said [ __ ]
theo weapons permanent some people don't
[ __ ]
[ __ ] try to rob me and [ __ ] in the
road tell me what you mean the whole
point of having you could say weapon
terminator so that people can't know
that you have a gun why would you tell
people you have a ccw that defeats the
whole purpose of happening i want
people to know that i don't really have
it so i pretend like i have this they
don't [ __ ] with me how do you own a gun
do you know the
four rules of owning of like handling a
firearm what do you mean what rules
your [ __ ] your video keep that
[ __ ] loaded when somebody breaks in your
[ __ ]
breaks in your [ __ ] house you [ __ ] it
ready to go i don't see this [ __ ] on the
test what you're talking about well
that's because there is no test suggest
you have a firearm permit this
you didn't take a test they just ask if
you have any felonies that's a test dude
it's not a it's not a that's an
application
questionnaire and a test are two
different things i do i'll talk to you
later dude
all right dude all right i love you dawg
i love you dude i'll show it
media free speech stance i've ever heard
in my life did you just call him bankuta
i don't know what the [ __ ] is
