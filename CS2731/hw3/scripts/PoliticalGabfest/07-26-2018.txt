oh and wasn't a flight what hippocampus for july twenty sixth two thousand and eighteen
pay with cash edition i'm david wild the battles euro i am currently recording john dickerson phoebe if this morning in new york hello john record you oh you are oh yes well secret then
in cash but no a check or no cash no no no no no i'll pick up pay with cash
and have an air time to the new haven hello
hello not secretly recording yeah connecticut the two party consent state i think you're right though i'm totally sure you know i just never turn on the tape recorder without asking permission to seems like the wrong thing to do yes it does on this week scared first michael cohen secret tape and what
if anything it means
then a trump indoors conservative wins the g o p primary in georgia and sets up the most exciting governor's race of twenty eighteen than a truly does mall stand your ground case in florida plus we will cocktail chatter
michael cohen present lawyer this week released a surreptitious and cryptic recording of a conversation between him and then came in at donald trump for i think september twenty sixteen in the audio recording which was probably legal under new york law trump appears to be going along with a plan
and to pay one hundred fifty thousand dollars
to the national enquirer to buy from the national enquirer rights but the national enquirer had recently bought two a story to the life story of karen mcdougall a woman who claimed to have had an affair with trunk shortly after it gave birth to their son in two thousand and six that it's very soap opera it does not appear that trump ever pay
this one hundred fifty thousand dollars
so not clear to me at least what cohen is trying to accomplish by leaking the tape
john based on what you heard a new thread is it clear what is happening on the tape or it's not clear i don't think it's terribly clear what's happening on the tape other than that donald trump who's spokespeople previously said he knew nothing about it and in it that that he knew nothing about this arrangement is heard on tape
intimately discussing and coordinating the details of the thing about what she said or his spokespeople said he knew nothing so that is that's clear enough
one that one of the reasons is difficult to figure out what's going on is they've clearly had a previous conversation he understands the code words that cohen is using the president does because the conversation without any previous knowledge would make no really no sense at all because cohen is saying i'm going to set up a company first of all about just stepping back one
or sentence it's a very relaxed conversation about things like setting companies making a hundred and fifty thousand dollar payments if this were a new information or a complete out of left field
attempted extortion you would imagine many other people would think what's going on what he means set up a company like you'd be a gatling gun of questions none of that as there really what we don't we don't really know it all of the things that the president knows that his head whether he there's no question there is no i didn't hear any evidence
one where the other about whether he agrees with the underlying charge which is to say is he arranging the payment because he knows this is true and he wants to make it go away or is he arranging the payment because it's extortion it's totally untrue but he doesn't want to fight it because it's september twenty sixteen and if a story comes out
it'll be damaging so this is just it's a big sunk cost for him i couldn't tell any of all of that and then there's other weird he seems to be on the phone with somebody else at the beginning which is somewhat interesting the washington post
has some speculation about that i don't think it's only it's worth being highly speculative when we don't really know but
he has another side conversation the middle of it so that all contributes to the fuzzy and us and we'll let them pay with cash line what did you guys did you guys think that was clear are not clear what i was gonna ask you that that was basically my question of about ask you which i am asking way because they both have years
well
well okay so there's the there's the question of is trump same to pay with cash that's number one question number to question is if he is in fact same to pay with cash what are the legal implications possible legal implications of that so look i'm not an ideology just and order that exposed month that you can lead to an allergist from
studies hearing
studies hearing okay like you take your kid to an ideology if you're worried that my know why i joined her nadal adjusted it's they listen to this i mean i think out
just the term i would just using a term to imply somebody who's not learn on time and suggesting that we have to have a medical degree in order to just listen to this day what i'm saying is i did not done forensic analysis on this very cursory to me it doesn't sound like he is saying don't pay with cash but now but i
but beyond that i don't really have an opinion also isn't the big issue whether this is a violation violation of campaign finance laws and whether he pays with cash or pays with barter system or drachmas or whatever that's the issue at hand not this side issue of cash versus credit rain well except that giuliani said that trunk were saying don't pay with cash
ash and is not at all clear that that somebody said so in the same but it in fact that one more timely right but that's less important than whether this is illegal and he can be prosecuted for it true that dog the skating and lying if i mean just on the lie scale it there's the big lie which is that he didn't know anything about it but i'm interested in your take heavily on the campaign finance
challenges i mean i don't think that it is in itself evidence of a campaign finance violation and because as you said we don't know where did this payment got made should they be like closely looking into this yes absolutely they should be you know one question is whether even packer and that national enquirer and american media to called i
it's time and my heart rate and and american media incorporated were acting in their press function or doing some other thing which could be and now he called campaign donation and i certainly think that this whole catch and kill arrangement if it was for the purposes of how
paying tramp when the election looks like it could be a campaign finance violation whether trump south contributed to that immediate happened that's trickier you have to know like have to follow the money and then i think the hardest part for prosecutors is going to be intact how are they going to show that the rationale for killing catching and
telling the story was the election versus sparing champ embarrassment or you know helping him and as marriage i know the we are not doing ourselves any favors here because we're talking about this as the first topic of conversation but i must say that this story is strangely uninteresting to me this
it doesn't tell us a single thing that we don't already know about him we know he's an adulterer we nobody pays people off we know that he a shady finances
we know that they were plane close to the line on campaign finance stuff to begin with it's not to say that it's not scandalous and immoral and disgusting because it is but it doesn't is not scandals in a more on disgust me in ways that we weren't already aware that he was scandals and moral and disgusting and so it's sort of like
it feels to me like something which were spending a lot of breath on and is is not adding to the to the common stock of knowledge and a world where i think when you allow your time when you have audio tape of a have something like this that makes it slightly different because you hear him talking about a thing they said he knew nothing about
so that's another other things you have you don't i mean sometimes you have his own audio tape that he contradicts later when he's audio tape player like things he says at a press conference but
but i think that changes that a little bit is the kind of fact that this was recorded in secret and the biggest point of course is what it means for the legal case which is that his fixer the person who taped lots of phone conversations whose job it was to manage these kinds of things and who given the tone of this conversation obviously you did this enough
so that they had a kind of shorthand for how you make things like this go away if the guy you employed to make things go away is now has now turned against you which is of the context in which this came out than that so that's a big deal because he's got the keys to the to the kingdom and those keys actually aren't even in his hands anymore they're in the hands of prosecutors
so it isn't enough if this is the best he is god that's good well we know you know that you know on who the hell are and or what michael cole and decided to do next and whether what he is really doing is fishing around for a pardon
is going to be super significant in terms of the legal on investigation i also felt like this having the tape was part of a week of on trump asking people not to believe what they were seeing or hearing and to believe him instead and i know that this also is finale or the lying and
playing and stating of falsehoods but it was just a head spinning week for that
you know
face accord application comes out explaining the carter paid surveillance and it completely contradicts the devon nunez republican version of what this face application was based on and supports the democrats interpretation and trump says the opposite and there were other examples
that the sweet and i felt like we were back in the moment
right after the inauguration of the pictures of the crowds and being told to believe something that was not what nationalist front of in front of our eyes on so i guess you can say that's nothing new either because we did know it but at the time that seems trivial and increasingly it's just flake part of the core
on approach of this presidency
same john
unlikely to be something that will move home recent a significant way
perhaps helsinki good given that what should
what should the media to do with this and also watched the public do with the story
there's so many other things that are happening but the terror of stories sort of attacks on obama care of an endangered species act threats against iran there's a lot of there's a lot of both substance and and smoke going on with this particular story what should we as citizens and we use media do with it well i think you should come around
those things
we even though you can't cover all those things even though depends it depends the venue right i mean so we met we just in what we do every day we've mentioned all those things except for maybe you'll go with the obama care
thing and
you mentioned it but then don't
don't dwell on it except to the extent that
i think there's a moment a i think one should always take note when when the president is caught simply saying something that's that on true you know where they words the situation is this start i think i should always be something that we flag and so we don't
i think well this is just the everyday this is the everyday thing so i think it's i think it's useful to do that i think it is it's also interesting just as a part of this larger drama the but i think in this narrow the venue i think actually the monuments ruling that came down on wednesday the the judge decided
i think is this right emily for the first time basically defined what the monuments clause means the president justice to party those aren't were arguing that it means essentially a straight up bribe and the federal judge decided know it can mean essentially what what those who brought the case the attorney general's of maryland in d c or what they
i think it could mean which is basically foreign countries
doing business with trump hotel for the purposes of trying to gain favor with them in fact that that's going forward is a huge deal a in and of itself the be again
to the extent that michael cohen is a is a can opener into a hidden part of the trump world the mayans clause case could be a can opener into the finances of the trump organisation a much of which have been hidden by the president great point yeah
how do island was great it it does feel like it's real significance i mean emily
just lingering on that for a second i'm know if you'd looked at it legally but what is likely to happen with that case going forward to in the administration will appeal it
the ninth circuit i mean the dc circuit somehow but what will happen i think is actually in the forest arquette because the cases in maryland and yes it's going to go right up to the far circuit and not be an appellate court ruling and i assume this case going to the supreme court and the question will be whether it goes right away and this kind of you know pearl
seminary pre discovery phase or whether it goes back to the district court and discovery happens and then it goes up which is a huge distinction in terms of you know the kind of financial information disclosure thomas just talking about what's so interesting is that we have this part of the constitution that's never been interpreted before by the fat
courts until we're going to have a very historical inquiry about what the framers intended at the time this is truly an original list question in terms of interpret the constitution and the judges argument that and an argument must have meant something separate from bribes because otherwise
what's the word doing there since the meaning of grind was commonly understood at the time and the framing that seems kind of common sense all i haven't studied it seriously so maybe there's a counter argument i'm not thinking of but it's pretty interesting slate plus members get bonus segments on the gap
most other sleep pod casts you can become a slate post member by going to sleep dot com slash gab first post them this week
we're going to talk about a very sony and flip plus topic
question is would we all be more productive if we work four days a week instead of five of a weirdly for john it would be like if we worked six days a week and seven
you know john john adams said i'm day and a week instead of eight yeah
john and like to imagine a hypothetical and any it's going to god complex get as close to sign up and here

the gubernatorial primary or the run off this week camp had started his campaign with a deportation bus tour
he taped an ad in which he pointed a gun at a teenage boy interested in dating his daughter he proposed to round quote round up criminal illegals and his pickup truck
and he coast to victory over casey cake old lieutenant governor camp was the secretary of state of georgia cagle lieutenant governor camp one upon receiving the president trumps endorsement and also upon benefiting from cables stumbles
op here both bumbling and scheming a series of secret tapes this a secret tapes week
and now camp will face stacey abrams in the general election stays here to win the democratic primary earlier would be the first black woman governor in american history is shaping up to be a fantastic and fantastically interesting race emily
early polling has this race even slight edge to camp but it's so early in the hell knows but how is it even possible to to envision a democratic governor and a state that has been quite bright red for the past twenty years
phil stacey aprons has this really interesting
theory about a path to victory and i don't like i've already disclosed fast bragged about the fact that i know stacey from law school so you know her theory is that there is this emerging majority in georgia of young people and women and people of color and they are underrepresented in the electorate
look at the percentage of than in the state versus the number registered to though it's too low and if they were registered to vote and they voted they would have the power to carry this race and fill seats he has been working for years on a project to register people to vote in georgia and for the kind of crazy underlying
themes and best as you said like totally fascinating race is that can the secretary of state for jar well as the person who was purging the roles and blocking a lot of these radio stations are going through and really making and just much harder for people to vote in georgia so the underlying dynamic and these questions about
voting rights and how you register people and who they are and what kind of rules the state has to follow it courage people from the roles those rules in that fight could determine the outcome of this race and i really hope they talk a lot about that because that in itself is an issue i think that
democrats in particular could raise up on in two thousand and eighteen and twenty twenty and this question have access to the ballad
i only read this one place and i don't know whether it's correct but it it
also have suggested that abrams who set out to register hundreds of thousands of people have only managed to register forty six thousand people still the and that's because can rape but that's all in large part because camp was not accepting a lot of these registration applications there's been a lot of litigation over this going into the jar to court
it's a tangled web that this story on and so that's all part of it right but just going to the electoral possibility so i think african americans are about thirty seven percent of the georgia
electorate and abrams presumably well when overwhelmingly ninety plus percent which means she needs about thirty percent of the white vote with my back of the envelope calculation and maybe even a little bit less and yet it's very likely she won't even get it which is just incredible to think that the democratic party
among white georgians are so weak that it would be as low as that we will i think this is my it's going to be really interesting that the republicans have a candidate who is such a model of the champ era and whether what a fact that has on the white vote there's also this question of to turns out how many more
people get registered at whether that has some impact on reshaping that democratic electorate
john are you what's your sort of like immediate ted you think it's too early to know how this race shapes up well i
i do i like
it's one of the fascinating races out there in another thing that makes his race fascinating to me is that both candidates are really interesting to watch kind of outside of and separate from from georgia
and so it's the kind of thing where something they camped does it's already happened but will will potentially reverberate outside outside the state and obviously that's why we're talking about abrams his approach to to i guess when i'm interested was connected to that is the extent to which values and identity are wrapped up in the all
these symbols now in ways that are a part of trump but also separate from trump and how that plays out in the gubernatorial race so national senate and house races you can kind of you see a little bit of a closer connection to donald trump it's democrats take over the house can investigate the president they can best gays and and
castration they can clog up the actions of his administration to advance a kind of national democratic message the senate obviously has extraordinary power with respect to judges and so forth so you get the you get the understanding that action between trump and the candidates the into the gubernatorial race and the issues are different there's no there's no real relief
russian ship in the ways i just described on the other hand
when a candidate plays to these identity
issues the way can certainly has with guns and immigration
it is it does it have a power that essentially does connect him to what donald trump has created and an energy he has created in the country and so is he able to access the same trump base the same trump feeling and that's one of the things that will be interesting to watch in this which is going to be different than
we've had in previous some in previous elections were gubernatorial races can kind of not be connected to the national message there's this phenomenon
i first became aware of maybe two years ago called rolling coal and know if you to remember this which is that people who basically conservatives who hated no environmental movement and this country created trucks which spewed as much pollution as possible and it was to create huge amounts of black smoke coming out of
or truck and it was people were thrilled about it never took great joy and it was it was really just to troll liberals and troll environmentalists by doing that
feel like what's happening with the republican party is just rolling cone and kind of political levels that if you look at what camp is running out abrams has a very substantive campaign i mean there's there's a strategic out part of l a tactical part of it around registration but it's like there's a lot of substance there's a lot of policy positions that are interesting and she talks about a lot around
around education in particular
for camp there's nothing it's it's it's an atavistic it's symbolic an atavistic it's just it's all this merry christmas crap that's respecting our troops were going to round up illegals that pointing a gun pointing the gun it is it's weird the way it is it has become it is
evolve into just tribal symbolism
and i gotta hope i mean maybe maybe i'm wrong here that it's certainly there's a huge portion the electorate that's going to vote that way because they are republicans they believe in what republicans do and also because they respond to this this dog with line but at some point the lack of have any
substantive positions are is going to come back to haunt republican republican politicians i wonder though if in democratic politics
policy carries us some of the identity weight and that those appeals and the republicans i do which is that democrats like to some democrats do anyway self identify as serious policy government workers make government efficient so that it can help the maximum number of people i met that sends an identity message to democrats in a way
that i'm not saying that the motivations you're doing it are the same but that it may have v ultimately a similar effect
with democrats
yet and i think democrat there's there's an identity
the strategy my democrats to around a lot of civil rights issues and marriage equality and which for mere human rights issues and so i feel it but they do have that same kind of identity component it it feels on the republican side it feels particularly backward looking an empty and just about fucking
with liberals slow yeah and isn't imagines and imagines this hostility like who is it that goes around nobody goes around saying don't say merry christmas nobody goes around disrespecting our troops that's a completely conflicted
illusion and yet it becomes this thing that people talk about him obsess over and make bill campaigns on the
two two things in connection with that
well three things i guess so
right
whether donald trump indoors as a candidate or not is i think doesn't have much power i think if a candidate is seen as mark sanford was as an active agent working against donald trump i think that can hurt people but donald trump saying yes or no
much power that has been a candidate who mimics his appeals to fear
think can be successful and what they are successful in part in doing adam hamilton a pastor wrote a methodist pastor wrote a great a book that's just out which is great about living in in fearful times and one of his one of his arguments is that in politics trump has
so freaked people out about the rising crime rates that it creates a national anxiety that's that's not verifiable by the facts and but if you keep everybody hopped up it has it may have a political benefit and this that clearly seems to be what campus trying to do final point on your you're rolling coal
which reminds me a little bit of the expression on the lives and trolling which is what paul ryan said the president was doing by saying he was going to revoke the security clearances of previous intelligence officials is doing something that is basically just to make your opponents exasperated nick
hayley and the un ambassador gave a speech to young conservative high school students in which she said you know owning the lives might make you feel happy might make you laugh mean me please you to do things just to make the other side uncomfortable and embarrassed but that's not the right way to behave that's not the right way to persuade anybody of anything and it's not
no sign of leadership so that's interesting because that's not exactly the strategy that the president she works for or a number of people like camping in georgia that's not the strategy they're pursuing however there are still some republicans do you think that's the the dead end strategy for the party ultimately am just going back to
the point you made early on about secretary of state they're just been extraordinary amount of of
incompetence and negligence involving georgia and it's voting systems
significant evidence that secure data was left exposed as left exposed even after the state was warned about it
that voting systems couldn't be compromised that there's like passwords
available camp has dismiss this there was i didn't follow this exact it it seemed like there was a lawsuit filed and as soon as this lawsuit was filed the state wiped the servers that contained the relevant data for the lawsuit
yeah it was a it story started a new yorker by to help her in the start of was not yeah i mean so what mechanism is there maybe there is none to it's to me it's kind of surprising to see the secretary of state yeah but doesn't matter that are voting systems are compromised it's it's february me it seems weird that that that that isn't something
secretary of state even a republican secretary of state democratic secretary of state green party secretary of state isn't up in arms about it feels like a basic part of the job
i mean yeah and luck there are many and secretary of state of all parties and persuasions you see the way you do end there are good reasons for that by there is another kind of greed is state secretary of state right now
like in the mold of chris kyle back in which you're not thinking about it that way you're thinking interns perhaps of part is an advantage or if you wanna just like take on can't rush now at face value what he said the data was he was preventing federal and cheers and he was refusing to let
you know there be any kind of help from the federal government at a time when the obama administration was in power analysis excuse for not accepting the help of federal election
officials or just like dealing with this in some way that seemed like it would be about protecting the integrity of the system as opposed to
letting it be so vulnerable i hope that he gets asked a lot of hard questions about that during the campaign because it seems dangerous and increasingly dangerous based on what we know about you know how the russians are trying to influence the two thousand and ten elections i mean now we have dan coats you know trunk
one of his main security people saying we have red lights flashing and this example of camp leaving these vulnerabilities in the system and then wiping it clean rather than investigating and and fixing it just seems like really kind of mind blowing in that context

so let's turn now to a tragic and appalling case in florida where sheriff this week declined to push forward charges against my draco after he killed more keys mclaughlin a convenience store parking lot to emily the case with people behaving badly an overreaction then a man ending up murder
in front of his children so talk a little bit about what happened while there's a very brief surveillance video clip of this altercation so everyone can watch for themselves but on a woman named britney jacobs of was in her car with her little kids and she was parked in a handicap space outside the store and michael j came
her and we can't really can't hear what he said but presumably told her to move or complain that she was in the space and granted that mom in her boyfriend marquee mclaughlin came out of the store heard what was happening when over at a drake that and pushed him and it's a hard place straight guy falls on the ground
blocked in takes a step backward i think and drake of pulls out a gun and as mclaughlin is backing away drake and drake i shoot ten
and he died in front of his children as you said and the notion that florida stand your ground could mean that the shooter that draco could face no charges at all i think we're all trying to figure out
it seems like this just can't be the right answer at least to me so i'm only actually to a moment where we can all take a restful two minutes when you give us an incredible position on three really interesting legal concepts and now merge to an ancient ones a duty to retreat
i'm a castle doctrine and now a third one and that has overtaken them a distinctively american one called stand your ground so tell us about each of those right wall so
you know traditionally we have a in the american and british law a jamaican law comes out of we have really strong notion of self defense if someone's attacking you
and you think they're about to kill you are really hurt you you're allowed to fight back
but we also have what's called the duty to retreat and so the notion is that you don't wanna world in which people in a kind of vigilante like self police force way
we act aggressively when they're being threatened if they don't have do we also have an exception to that rule that comes out of british law called the castle drops much to tap just talked about which but if someone threatens you they come into your home and threaten you then you don't have a duty to retreat and you can kind of understand that too because there is
the idea that you know in your own home you shouldn't feel attack that if someone enters it they've kind of lost the right for you to have to get out of their way or move back to avoid confrontation what florida has done is take this step further and now effectively you have no duty to retreat anywhere so this parking lot
became michael drake as castle and effect and let the law says is that the person who's using deadly force the shooter has a right to do so if he or she reasonably believes that using are threatening to use the force is necessary to prevent death or great bodily harm to himself or others and so on
that's the standard in the law it's caused all kinds of problems for our florida prosecutors florida police also tend to really hate this law because it has escalated conflict all of that said as misguided as a thing could take and removing the duty to retreat in public is i also think that the sheriff in pinellas county
any is just completely i'm misinterpreting the lot here because it appears from the video that mclaughlin was backing away and so the notion that drake felt like he was an imminent risk of death or bodily harm i just don't see that on the video and see and to meet so to me it just seems like an even broader interpretation
of this stand your ground law than is necessary
know it's he did not have a reasonable fee or that moment my own earnings healthier weight and when this has gone on tv he's talked about this sort of subjective fair he's basically said well we'll take a says he feared for his life but like that should not be the standard it should be what a reasonable person have feared why isn't the stand your a defense rather going to read
not a charge shouldn't be something that you can
into you're charged with murder and you use that as a defense company which prevent to charge the beginning let's agree that is not how the law works in florida and i don't remember if this is in the statute or it's based on how the court for interpreted it but instead what has happened is that the state has to affirmatively prove that
that you did have a duty to retreat so the burden of proof here goes to the prosecutor as opposed to you a starting out as a defense after your charge that's part of the problem could john one of the extraordinary things about standard around is that it has gone from not existing of two thousand and five season
florida passed a law to both and to twenty five states have been a burgeoning was staying around more why did this happen why is it been so relatively easy for the and are a bit concerned about hours to get these walls
well because i don't know the fate the full picture of it
i about to the the details of the case because i want to get your murals take on move on as the racial makeup have been different of the participants
whether the rulings would have been different
but i think that it's become a
the growth of concealed carry as a
has a movement has been very successful for second amendment advocates throughout the country it has had and it's now obviously coming up is a potential federal issue with
concealed carry reciprocity legislation that sponsored by john corner and others
so this is this is a part of that and it's a part of legislators who believe it advocates from me and or a who and other groups that that are promoting it and it's a part of the connection and over tiny out of the previous issue which is it's a way to signal the voters that you are over
you are tough on crime that you are supporter
gun rights you know their ways you can say i'm a supporter of guides but then you can say and i want concealed carry and i won't stand your ground it's another way to show action on a core issue for an active set of voters
who have shown that they will reward you if you act on their issues and obviously reward you with votes but also reward you with money yeah i think that's totally random in that has been very effective it not just defending existing gun rights but pushing for more of them and nice stand your grandma's the energy has lobbied heavily for and alec the american led
slate of the exchange council which on laws help right wing conservative lawmakers draft laws and pass legislation they've been a big back or obese stand your ground laws that's why they're spreading actually leads me to do i thought was wonderful pizza know i can remember who wrote it but making the extremely persuasive to me
point the standard ground walter anti conservative that there was no problem with the law is constituted we had a hundreds of year history across two continents of duty to retreat and castle doctrine being the way jurisprudence worked
it was the basic legal standard
there was no evidence there was a crisis of people getting killed and threatened out in parking lots because because there was no stand your ground laws and instead legislators go ahead and passes entirely new standard which invites all kinds of crazy behavior and the result he was in fact that homicide rates go up there all kinds of escalated and cow
authors and it's it's went again as a conservative person with a small see it just pisses me off it makes me furious it's like you had a system that worked relatively well that was a had been tested by hundreds of years of history
there was no obvious problem that it was causing and yet people go ahead and change it because it allows them to score political points and death results and mayhem results and also racial injustice results it's it's infuriating but go to the racial component of this so emily there is pretty strong
so we didn't mention this but drinkers weight and mclaughlin the victim is black and there's pretty strong evidence that it's much easier to make a stand your ground kind of case and you get you get much more leeway if you're white and you kill someone who is black than the reverse right yes air is
evidence think that and it's really really distressing and and makes you feel like even apart from that just wrong had a nes of these laws for the reasons you are saying they are associated with higher homicide rates i mean amazingly even in this moment where across the country homicide rates are coming down
down florida is is significantly so that's correlation not causation but it doesn't look like a strong sign that stand your ground laws are making people safer so there's that whole kind of public health argument and then there is this problem of racial bias and the way that it plays out in the system and for mean there's a real parallel here with the death
penalty where you know whatever one's feelings are about morality or immorality at the death penalty the way that we apply it is racially biased and it means that you know black people who kill way people on or especially if there's a victim no matter who did the killing that's when
when we impose the death penalty and similarly here it just seems like these stand your ground decisions to declined to prosecute come about when you have a black victim it's interesting to me that almost nobody not even conservatives are really defending greater people think people are same
conservative line and seems to be the sheriff is misapplied of the standard because
used the point you made an anomaly which was that he did not have a reasonable fear and to the sheriff who has misread the law nobody is sort of same yeah drinkers drinkers in good shape their way and the state's attorney and the prosecutor fuck analysis counting could still come in here and bring charges and i mean that's what i'm hoping will happen but yeah
i mean i know when i watched this video i just the idea that fight over a parking space could turn into a lethal shooting in front of children in like broad daylight just seems terrifying so maybe that's why you're having trouble finding people defending issued although actually
went to europe is john
people behave in a polling ways around parking spaces and around handicapped parking spaces in particular it is something that works people up
really an to an extraordinary degree i mean mclaughlin and jacobs who parked in the handicapped space apparently without justification like that's an asshole move you shouldn't do that it's the wrong thing to do and and
sets people off i will actually i bet there are a ton of murders that take place over parking spaces and i know there are tons of angry confrontations that tape was overcome partner places because i get angry confrontations maybe i don't think there are a ton of murders and also can we just like make sure that you are not veering into victim blame
aiming because i am sure you don't think this person deserves to die hard time when i die but course no one deserves it
and clean toilets
the record i don't have the money saved i mean the drake is somebody who had confronted people over this very handicapped parking space before i'm just saying that in fact that people behave really badly around parking places and it causes it sets people off people people have a sense of ownership over parking places and so if you think that's a space on but to take summer
takes that people get agitated about that
the handicapped parking place and
the way it represents a kind of protected space and then you'll see people violating it that causes people to be aged i'm not at all
of course
seeking to examine and phenomenon and in
and but john i'm in now you know i think you're right about the conflict ever parking spaces yes people get as your site also john i feel like you are somebody who you are great analyzer of human behavior under stress in situations that require decency so what is the yeah well it's like road it's like road
rage i mean it's a it's a it's like the most a cute or one of the most acute ways line cutting road rage in which we kind of the general houses of sosa
yeah the general and just an airplane behavior perhaps like seat reclining in the injustices the larger injustices that we all feel outraged about
wherever we come from
kind of oh distilled down into a sharp pointy thing coming right at us
and feel like is part of what happens in these cases i think also i saw some very strong reactions to greedy jacobs who was interviewed afterward saying either i had to park wherever i want that sentiment
a mistake yeah this was subsequent to the shooting of them
of her boyfriend
so that did not win again even from people who would feel embarrassed if anybody suggested that they were blaming the victim nevertheless were incensed to hear her say that so i think you're right
david that this is some i mean in some ways this may fall apart as i say it but here we go to the extent that the starbucks confrontation and we talked about a few weeks ago is that starbucks became the location for a lot of other huge massive societal things that we don't know how to wrestle with very well and so that it was more the
what happened in that actual store it's it's a lot about the societal currents that just happen to appear in that store and i feel like your point about parking lots and these spaces
is kind of right
and it's sort of a surprise to me that there isn't more of this let me ask you this question about
i was unclear if the sheriff was sort of saying sure i would charge this guy but my hands are tied in other words was she was it's sort of i don't know i'm mean there must be a word in the law for this which is you we just have to follow the rule of law even though we all think it makes no sense because you know
laughlin mclaughlin was clearly backing up in the video and and he was backing of the way it looked to me before draco pulled any weaponry i mean that's pretty fighting fans and a it looks like he pushes him and then he immediately starts backing up
so anyway yeah i mean he did say something like i don't make the law or something that absolved himself and responsibility and but but because he seems to me to be making the wrong call it's hard to not see that as a paper thin excuse especially because he also pointed out that a few
atkins elapsed between the shove drink a fine to the ground and then the pulling out of the gun and shooting suggesting any even the sheriff said it gave him pause that because there was that space and time navy drake i didn't feel like he was you know under imminent threat was like he was undermining his own rationale
and the moment in this way that with quite odd right
let's wrap it there

it was good a cocktail chatter
when you are having a cocktail
one of your party and when he bows on what are you going to be chattering chattanooga
this is a sad when and i say about that but several years ago i wrote about this incredibly tragic case in which on
baby got very sack and
ended up having seizures you know throughout his life and the cause was mysterious and his baby sitter at the time whose name is treating munoz was accused of shaking hands and went to prison and to me it looked like a case in which the evidence that this was shaken baby syndrome
is really disputed treaty was not a native english speaker and when a social worker question her she described jiggling the baby on after he collapsed and that spanish word got translated as her confessing to have shaken the baby which does not seem to have been what happened but
in any case it was this case that went to try and lead to a prison sentence and all of the appeals that her layers failed or denied so now trading munoz is finally getting out of prison but she is not an american citizen she's from peru and so she is eligible for tea party
asian and because she has a felony conviction once she gets out in august it's entirely likely shall be deported and so this woman who may well have been wrongfully convicted and spent years in prison is going to be separated from her children on her family on and sent far away to a place where she hasn't lived for many years and the only ram
left is a pardon request pending before the virginia parole board and governor north i'm in virginia and to the utter frustration of treaty munoz his lawyers the parole board said they were gonna look into it and then it turned out to the parole board investigator had a conflict of interest and the case just seems to be sitting there with no and paying
any attention to it
it really seems to me that governor north adams people should at least take a close look at this since munoz was convicted there have been more convictions overturned in more questions raised about on about shaken baby syndrome in terms of whether you how easy or hard it is to tell that it's a cause of the child's injuries
obviously nobody wants children to be injured and that's a very scary thing but there was a kind of very righteous push to blame the last caregiver have a child when a child had abusive head trauma on the medical opinion around that has been shifting but not necessarily in a way yeah
that has helped this particular woman
i'm just looking at least some german happened to be on the wash and emotional story same that story don't know his attorney will speak in audio a few and speculation of possible presidential boot and found a joke you kidding
we've come to some games with lower your for some random person the scandal gets to run for president that's ridiculous
john for going i'm talking about star me daniels the story of that crazy targeted or rest of her is just like really upsetting anyone that's in ohio i think side john what's your child or magenta was the dumb as i was thinking about this week's news grossman trump
michael cohen and whether it was important to her where it fit in scheme of things and all of that i i was reminded of them
that even given the fact that the president is associated with at least two cases of paying a great deal of money at least among my view of things on thousand those a lot of great deal of money
to two women to hush money essentially that he still i don't think an economist would have to
to counter this in real dollars but you still would not be if those are the only amounts that he paid and hush money would not be the historical leader in hush money payments to women with whom he had affairs i should note quickly that he alleges that are that he says as he is not have those fears but nevertheless he did pay the hush money in that sense it's
apples to apples with warren harding and that drove me to an article by jordan michael smith in politico from august of two thousand and fifteen
which is entitled america's harnessed president i encourage everyone to read it
because it's it's really it's extraordinary what are the wage warren harding behaved we've had fun and hurting his expense
rather regularly i should say on the show
because his letters to his various to the people with whom he had affairs he was married
i have been published
guess i didn't realize the extortion portion of it so carry philips which one of his mistresses was paid about five thousand dollars a month by the republican national committee
but then in the and she was able to somehow for nagel in addition to those payments
a gift from the urgency of about twenty five thousand dollars and so this article says basically one dogs are yeah yeah i'm a lot of money that's exactly right
they the article calculates twenty five thousand dollars from
nineteen i guess this would have been twenty seven the twenties anyway and at about three hundred thousand dollars today so that's why i say that even just with with kerry phillips it would have been him
been more than the totals that we know about from the president's hush money but then also there's man britain with whom harding used to have acid nations in the closet the coat closet of the white house while a secret service
officer
watched guard outside and would knock on the door if mrs harding was a good us off the market
what was a man britain during the secret service
anyway in britain was was shamed
harding guys there's a baby basically to make the money back britain read a blog everybody shames her and says
she's making it all up but then it was finally ultimately to disclose that harding made secret child support payments until he died
and a dna test was done
later proved that she in fact none britain was was it was right anyway warren harding what an amazing
chapter in american history
anyway
send descendants to the child a crowd and ornament request questioning fine for that as a great question i don't think there are descendants of cleveland's love child but but i don't know in this case one of the thing and i would like to recommend is the movie eighth grade
with bo burnham
directed is a fantastic movie
the acting is just amazing if you were a parent it will be both regulatory and terrifying and
there's this one scene where am turned to me
this may be the greatest seen i've ever witnessed
it has to do much and i can't wait to see this movie that was that a good flag
it has to do with chicken midnight
chicken nuggets and the scene and the whole and yeah but definitely see the whole movie it's really
well rendered my chatter and author a listener chatter my chatter is also a recommendation something to watch which i don't think i've recommended before it he tells me i haven't which is succession this show on h b o o
it's sort of under the radar at three
scenery chewing drama about basically about the murdoch family it's about media tycoon and his children in the media tycoon has gone into deep old age but it's still a lion you still are quite powerful lion although failing on in some ways and the jockey and whose children each more
we him each each more ruthless and terrible my next and it's great it is there is amazing amazing scenery chewing as i said especially by brian cox at the patriarch the the the settings are spectacular the there's a lot of wonderful failure
it reminds me a lot of a show i loved a few years ago called kings which was sort of a biblical it was a biblical retelling about sol and david and it's very similar and in fields of you or somebody who like kings you will definitely love attention and it has an incredible soundtrack
soundtrack anything i've heard in years
