get tickets that's like dot com slash live this is a grim spectacle even though standards of twenty seventeen the controversy over whether president trump slandered president obama by accusing him of not coin the grieving families of dead soldiers the related controversy over whether president trumpet then
he told the widow of a green beret killed in new share he knew what he signed up for the implication of the death of a son of gen john kelly and had a president obama may have treat it that the regular diet we've been eating of political and competent of warmongering of private
waste has been bad enough but now we've added a truly stupid grotesque pointless bile showcase involving are dead
service members so john what does the heart of this contrary why did it and emerge it didn't seem considered or pointed it didn't seem the president trumpets this was something he set out to to create and yet it has become a ridiculous big front page story oh my god i forgot the whole thing about the other one with the president trump
had promised in june to pay somebody a family of bit of another dead soldier twenty five thousand dollars and it didn't pay it until yesterday went to washington post called him on it so
anyway
a good thing
delineate of to
put a little corral around just one part of the story and then and then the other two parts
later but one thing that the most striking thing to me as i think what happened basically was the president was asked about if he'd contacted the families of these four dead servicemen and he was it seemed like an in the moment defensive himself
slash elevation of himself over his predecessors
so i think you're right it doesn't feel like a strategy
the military was one of the last into to institutions although we should add the nfl in here because it was used also is one of the last institutions that was kind of protected and it wasn't perfect but certainly relative to our other political debates kind of protected from the political left right blue red thing
in one of the things secretary at us when we interviewed him few months ago and that he said on and on his he thinks one of the greatest dangers and america is that were tearing each other apart
and he is thankful that it hasn't gotten into the military any more than it already has and then he hopes for a day when people can debate and argue and then still be friends again
so now the into important ways the president for his own purposes has brought the military in the middle of these kind of most heated debates we have first by claiming that the people who neil during football games are denigrating the service of those who fought for the flag or fought under the american flag
and then now this claim about calling families he's basically saying that i'm on the side of the military and obama and the democrats are not and that's really dangerous and he did that all on his own he chose to do that and that's that's really playing fire looks get into that in a second job because i think that those are really good framing
it is also you touched on earth a second ago it's also shocking
his need to put himself at the center of this discussion that the whole context if it was this is what i did
moment where you're supposed to mourn those who have served and who have fallen in the service of the country and it's all about who he is right it's a terrible time to be a narcissistic and it's amazing i mean i guess we should lose our capacity for for shock with the narcissism of president trumpet it's pretty incredible that that his entire modem analysis
around the death of those he sent into battle is oh look at what i've done look at me making calls and much better i am not to actually spend time on honoring in their services really shocking
the thing is this is just not a supposed to be a debate because this is my command doing imagine the hates making these phone calls like of course every president finds it difficult to make these calls and they feel like every other former president at least george w and obama talked about how hard these calls and contacts were that i listen to burn
man i mean jack find it really hard to call up the emotional grace to do it and also i fight with all of these military actions they go awry he doesn't want to take responsibility and there's an element of failure that he just wants to run from and so you know
the thing that he's aborted the sad you know he knew that he signed up for as a way of distant saying one south and not taking responsibility and of course you know it's one thing to have someone in private life is like a bouvier it are have that attitude and then it's another thing when it's rather than presidents
we're going to have our government the way it exists
it's not certain that it presents to call every person who falls in the service of their country
that's not been a standard that we've had before in parts because we've had wars where do you know sometimes you'd be on the phone all day affair with the case but the distance between a president in the orders he gives and the people who carry out those orders there's a reason to maintain that because of what you said emily i mean any president the weight of this
and i remember talking to people in the bush administration about how the president had to be careful about who we reached out to no matter how awful the story because he would set the expectation that he would have to then call everyone and if somebody didn't get a call then they would think somehow their service wasn't worthy of the other person's what am i remembering correctly
wasn't there a big scandal in during george bush's presidency about their was embarrassed i can remember this for the woman whose son had died in her test of the arrow towns and
the meet him and he never met with her right yeah right
wasn't she left standing outside of events and that was upsetting but wasn't she also protesting the war cindy sheehan said right
so then you could argue and i'm not criticizing but that the politicizing of the question of morning and meaning with the family is one that's coming from the family whereas this time we're seeing it come from the president i mean one thing i found really unsettling was reading some of the fox news what i guess web coverage i haven't been watching
television him but just reading the way it was being spun as a story in which the politicization came from the family and the democratic congresswoman and from the press like sort of blaming the price for finding that story of person who said that promise twenty five thousand dollars that he didn't give as
if like it's coming from the other side and it just struck me as one more time in which we are seeing alternative facts as well as alternative opinions it's a completely different presentation on the news story i question whether for the for wilson the congress someone who brought that up
should have done the i did think it was a little
i thought it was off those for to take words fundamentally private conversation between the president i'm a widow
and to make good news out of it
i'm sure president trump perfectly perfectly willing to believe that present have handled it poorly and didn't express empathy in a way that you would expect but i'm not sure that anyone who served by that that piece of it becoming the scandal
oh i agree although the widows in the middle of this then said that she confirmed the congress on this account she didn't say i wish that she had never a part of that and it was a call that was on speaker phone i mean that's not really the same thing as a totally private car and then we have trump saying that the congresswoman is lying adding to their so i don't know maybe you think that big
because ms wilson who sort of you know first on this one yeah that that but i think like it's a little much to say i mean if the widow of this fallen soldier had sad like please give me my privacy that's the one thing but that's not actually what happened
you know maybe it was really hard to listen to that call it sounds like it was shouldn't we grant or the privacy maker has to ask for a given that she's dealing with the death of her husband and what's a super hyper charged political moment that she doesn't have a lot of control over
assuming that wilson didn't like just did this spontaneously on around without asking permission and maybe that's true but i don't think we know that well even if she were given permission is this really like is your response to this to throw my you should johnson in the middle of a in the middle of a huge national fight
i mean isn't that up to my asia johnson like that's not exactly the not play angers woman way but i'm not sure that we know that how jobs and doubt about it i mean that's like you're assuming a lot there i think maybe that's the case but i haven't read anything that suggests bad johnson was unwillingly thrust in the middle of this certainly thrust
right well i guess my default position would be don't thrust unless explicitly told to go out and make a big deal about this which teams
oh you know i mean if maybe the maybe that's right maybe you should johnson said go out and tell the world about this i think that
so would surprise me
what do you guys make of president obama been silent in the face all this this president trumps original comments putting down obama greeley infuriated president obama former staffers also muster monaco
predator neighborhood who step in chief of staff for the president for prisoner obama treated this was a fucking lie in the president trump was a deranged animal which was pretty pretty strong words frank frank and honest exchange of views but why do you think the president obama himself has not spoken i guess there's no
no gain right
yeah i mean what's there to say like he tried to handle this differently i also think that john new to the point you made earlier is rate presidents don't call every single phone jar and i think also president obama had other people posting photos of him meeting with the family is in the white house like the wreck the historical record
it is clear and don't know what else he could really say that wouldn't see him again just be adding political fuel to the fire and i think he has been great time pretty are non to do that unnecessarily to you
i think politically john going back to your original point that this dragging the military and attempting to put present trump in the military and one side of the divide and president obama and democrats present and the other do think that is going to be effective in this case it's clear that the military is a conservative it's to should generally
i think if you if you looked at how soldiers i think they vote and officers who they vote for republicans were in the vote for democrats but as a kind of unify national entity is the president going to succeed in fracturing that
i don't know i mean that's the the worry here is that i'm now everybody's gotta take sides and where you're where you take sides depends on who you whether you support president trump or president obama and you kind of have a default position based on that not based on the underlying institution emerges means it's just
like every other damn thing in life now
and the question is who who does the reset hear of this who resets with the simple proposition that presidents all love the people who fight under their command period moving on
the like these stories now that are like the number of people that did color didn't call obama do color didn't call it just
it feels like we're talking about any other thing in itself is bad
do you think we're going to get to the point where everything is political doritos or political shag carpet is political that no matter what thing is that you're going to have to be associated with with one side or another that's what it feels like we're heading
i think we were pretty much
the air with football i mean that i was talking to somebody last night is kind of a republican but not a trump supporter who said you know i'm just really angry i wanted football to be you know that's what i do for fun i don't want to think about politics when i'm watching football and i don't want to think about whether this person he is or isn't
patriotic or does or doesn't respect the troops and want to watch people run towards the end zone and it or not succeed
like all i want
no it's you know permanently a part of our conversation now or not permanently but it's part of our conversation and now the military's in them extend this episode of the first sponsored by get well when you're planning to make a big purchase say a car or a new mattress

the new yorkers unstoppable jane eyre profiled vice president mike pence this week the gist of the piece woes
hey liberals if you think trump is bad pence would be worse a full scale basically competent koch brothers acolyte corporate republicanism
at it's finest with a strong side salad of social conservatism
in marriage telling pence is a bit of a non entity but who harnessed is wagon to the coax ideological movement
as well as his own conservative religiosity and is now infusing the trump administration with coke is
pence his control of the transition processors influence on the transition process brought tolkien like scott pruitt and betsy divorce and to the administration sankey mayor also strongly suggested that pencils preparing for his own presidential campaign which of course he would be in which could come and twenty twenty or twenty
twenty four on one assumes emily was or anything regulatory for you
the the story about pets
what i was really interested in was the sort of tagline back in back and forth of influence from the sort of coke more straight laced you know let's like cut taxes oh by the way you know the koch brothers value when up thirteen billion last year i think to ninety seven billion general is treating that
the speak do so this sense that you know we have these really determined people who want deregulation and want to be able to make as much money as possible essentially and that pants was down for that project but then there's this divide sort of between the coke and trust and the interest sort of
populist part of trump is represents in the form of steve ban and so you have these like critical quotes from ban in and jane mares piece about pets and you can see behind them like the coax on one side and then the murderers who are funding you know the ban and uprising on the other and i don't
totally understand how the weather there are really deep differences between these people or whether they agree on like ninety percent of an agenda and so then they like viciously fight about the last ten percent it's just kind of confusing and it shows you know what happens when you have one party rule which we
right now which is that it magnifies the importance of policy and cultural differences on one side because they're in control
what are those distinctions
they ten certainly seems more socially conservative right so you have you know this anti abortion agenda
he was signing bells that you know the got indiana a lot of embarrassment in the algae b t realm but that's not really coke and now see morally grey that was like pence is on christianity speaking out but then you have ban and basically warning that expenses president will be a tool
all of the koch brothers and that that's very different from donald trump but like in the end policy wise when you look for example at the tax packet of the republicans are trying to pass on much difference is there really here yeah i don't know maybe my pencils a representative of a basically the mainstream of though
republican thought don't trump is not in the mainstream one importantly a problem when can i just started in are up to toronto paul the idea that mike pence who by the standards and ten or fifteen minutes ago
a conservative extremely conservative the idea that he is
the center of mainstream conservative republican brought his role a testament to how far that party has moved a little goodwill but i guess by that by that what i meant was he's for deregulation and tanks he's the sort of the paul ryan
mitch mcconnell whatever we can do to get to these goals and then he on them on the social issue stuff is further to the right now obviously during george bush's presidency he was
he was kind of them you would have put him in the freedom costs if it have existed at the time
so even as i say he's in the mainstream republican pod i guess what i really mean is relative to donald trump who's been all over the lot me don't from came to the job without roster of people he ran as a republican so we picked the republican roster and the republican roster has been supported by and created by
though large funders in the party which is almost certainly the koch brothers in other words if you'd had scott walker you'd have the same cast people most people have been voting republican politics are getting their money from the koch brothers at some level i guess what i'm trying to figure out with this piece and with the administration itself sells is whether my pants was there are not a lot of these people
cool would have found their way into the into the republican ranks one of the things that comes out in
mears piece about pets is that you don't seem to be a nice guy like people think he's he's a nice guy he's always been super ambitious and had his
i'm a main chance but he's he's not he's not a bad human being
but he has put himself in the thrall of a sociopath
and he has been unwilling to do anything to to challenge that are when trump has been called on his grotesque human behavior and behavior that is a christian indecent lascivious pencils done nothing about that it does suggest him when he's not someone who's likely to make any
hard choices
life
well great i mean this is the fast and bargain he can only remain in office i mean i guess this is actually not true he can remain novice forever that's the power he has is that time can't fire him but he can only be a player if he is obsequious that's like that demand that champ seems to require and so you know that
obviously limits isabella you just stand as any kind of moral counterpoint you know there are also some interesting like actual policy moments in jeans piece that illustrated that's like a big fight over whether to admit any syrian refugees and to indiana people who'd been a family have been vetted for years who the catholic church in india
a very much wanted to reset olson's this is cause that is important to catholics and other people of other religions to be welcoming etc and pence blocked it for political reasons and again you have this sort of move toward the easy or a political stance are what seems to be politically required as opposed to
some other kind of large our sense of purpose and so i guess i emerged from his profile with a feeling that's been familiar to me from the beginning of the presidency which is that a pants presidency would have smoother edges like we would not be having some big fight about gold star family is or the nfl it would be much
easier to ignore but presumably the agencies would be humming along make a lot of changes the way they are now the etc the republicans in congress will try be happier and passing something and so it might very well be that you know the basic thesis that liberals would be unhappy or in the and that a lot and would be pa
se wise would be changing but there would be less fuss about it that seems right and then i guess you balance that against what we were talking about earlier which is this really dismaying sense of like the whole social fabric eroding and division for a division sake it's hard to imagine pants been particularly effective in that way he just like that doesn't seem like his thing
the policy would be roughly the same either way one thing though that is that use that in previews parts of his career
vice president has paid a lot of attention to at least though the him no
there were some boundaries and politics obviously after he ran and he took that pledge about no longer doing negative campaigning he had some level hears that call that you're supposed to behave a certain way and then one of the criticisms people have made is that when he then uses his stature to cover them for the president so for after the
after the access hollywood tape when he said he was grateful the president had expressed remorse
the president didn't really express remorse the candidate be the he said it was locker room talk and sort of let's move on
he acts as a cover for some of this behavior but if it were just him i think there would
i guess i'm basically agree with you emily about the gold star families but i also think he would probably work to try to
do what normal presidents normally presidents have done which is try to reach out to the other party and months he he would succeed in them on saying that there would be with thousands of bipartisan bills but
president trump has almost not ever except for the like brief little moment with them schumer and pelosi which was evanescent has not really even nodded to those traditions so i guess that would be one place where you would see
would expect a difference one of the things that struck me in reading about pens and pencils kind of like it doesn't seem like he's particularly smart he's a good talker and he's clearly was a great talk radio host and he has a nice demeanor about him but there's this very effective
local grassroots public policy ideological efforts that have been made he comes out of pens comes out of his heritage backed indiana think tank
there's a lot of ideological training and a lot of resources and preparation that's taking place at a local level of conservatives who want to have a role in politics and pencils kind of a clear a triumph of that and i wonder if that
f can learn anything from what do you think i was i think he's perfectly smart enough rain that if you have these model bells that you can get behind you and you have lots of position papers from the heritage foundation
you know you have backing for whatever positions you want to take the agenda becomes pretty clear and you can exercise power effectively without being like a genius you can kind of roll it out
i think democrats tend to be more divided along those lines and mean an organization like alec the american legislative whatever the he is council which has been so good at creating model bills that than different republican legislators and state has his pass around the country the democrats don't seem to have an operation that work
quite like that although to give them some credit right now the activists i'm on the left has been pretty strong and certainly they have position papers on ideas and like evidence supporting them they don't they just don't tend to get adopted in the same kind of uniform way where you have the feeling that like okay anyone is like pleasant and and good spokes
person could make this agenda propellants i'll forward
funny thing i mean just to the pleasant piece of it the reason pentiums you president is the trump ended up having to spend an extra day in indiana because his plan to retire and the had dinner with the pencils and like them but the trump seems to think that looks like a vice president and there's always talking about how we look at look at what does that he straight of central casting or some other phrase like that
it doesn't isn't some policy genius he's not he's smart enough and he's good looking in a very straightforward this guy looks like a republican presidential candidate kind of way and then to ban and at least and jeans piece band and tax bad him is a kind of like necessary sop to the coke
jokes on his part of the raid and that kind of so that allowed for him to come into trumps tan john let's let's close on the ban and question actually which is do ban and and pent actually represent as we've hinted at two different parts of the republican party and what is ben and up to ben and abandoned supplies the most pungent quote
mer peace and ben and also engaging in this campaign to fund challengers to a lot of
and a lot of senate races
well it is his quotes in the peace or fascinating the most interesting part of the piece i think that at one point he says you know if mike pence became the reason would be bad as if mike dense became president is the dinner then he would be sort of the the president of the koch brothers
we should remember that the president president trial by the candidate was very clear about the relationship between big money and the republican party has republican politicians he said it made them puppets he particularly said anybody who went to the koch brothers annual meeting was there to bow down to their puppet masters and that would then be a puppet of the koch brothers
when he talked about draining swamp in the course of the campaign that's what he was talking about they've changed the definition of what that means for a variety of reasons including the fact that when you need off the shelf staffers to staff up all these agencies you need people who have been lobbyists and presumably if you're draining the swamp you don't fill your administration with lobbyists but
that's when he said like that was the point that's the band and message about corporate interests which have
which are support free trade in which support the policies the koch brothers
well i don't want to say that the relationship between money and getting people to do their bidding and not the bidding to the forgotten man
that's the ban and view and it was the president's view i did but you can't run a presidency that way so that's the tension here but it gets very sloppy because also there were bit several strong quotes in the piece about how mike pence isn't is necessary because there's kind of know crazy chaotic president
doing his disruptive thing which is what he was elected to do and what
he wants to do but but but ban and everybody recognize that that you can't do that alone so you have to have a connection to the rest of the party and that's the mike pence is the bridge
he he's necessary but you wouldn't want him to be president seems to be abandoned view

cbs the sixty minutes and the washington post teamed up on an amazing story this week how the pharmaceutical industry particularly a portion of the industry distributes drugs
rather than makes them or sells them directly but distributes to pharmacies pressured and lobbied congress and the agencies and the president's president obama administration to ease back on trying to limit excessive opiate distribution by pain clinics the
the story comes out of a whistle blower former official named joe joe an apprentice name reddit but you're right
easy who told cbs and the post how he and the drug diversion offer city ran tried to stop these three large distributors from filling obviously shady orders
example incredible example if the pharmacy in west virginia town that has fewer than one thousand people that ordered nine million hydra cota and pills over the course of some years in two thousand and eleven these drug distributors who didn't want to be constrained and who they could distribute to it at what scale started in this telling and cbs and the post
started pushing back against a and tried to get the at ease up on them a little bit and in two thousand and thirteen
pennsylvania congressmen and tom marino and mimic tennessee congresswoman named marsha blackburn both republicans sponsored a bill to get the purpose of which was essentially to take away the da's authority to free suspicious shipments of opie lloyds the bill had been strongly pushed by industry
they spending corn to some numbers one hundred and two million dollars lobbying for this bill to pass it passed without any opposition was signed by president obama has gone into law ran a cc who would oppose this easing up on guard distributors with pushed out of court eat his own telling and tom marino in fact had then been put forth as
the drugs or for president trump there's a lot of moving pieces in this so emily was there scandal here maria with now withdrawn his the name is drugs are after the storm came out and there was outrage about it but is there a scandal here and if so what is it yet
this is really interesting story i mean it seems like there are folks at the da who are furious and feel like their ability to try to address the obesity epidemic by blocking distribution was really hampered by this law and there's like a whistle blower in this story and
long live the arctic all by a farmer yeah are making these claims when you look at actual change in the wording of the legislation as a lay person it's a little hard to see how this change of already had this enormous consequence but it has that flavor of the kind of story that makes you think that congress as passing things where the fine print mean enormous amount
and somehow it didn't break through this law was passed without even an official roll call vote and just sort of snack along and then you get the sounds like maybe dan marino was in the pocket of the drug industry i wonder if there's like are more complicated story about the distribution of opie like that
also includes the doctors who are writing the prescriptions and the prescription services that are filling those prescriptions at huge volumes in a lot of parts of the country i felt like we are only seeing one part of this larger puzzle to explain like the giant apparatus of supply behind on the oprah and
dammit canal is confusing to me but it was interesting to see a story about like a bad law actually have a consequence for potential trump nominee and it made me think i mean first about trump in the administration and no allegiance to this law and particular and i guess they had no real allegiance to marina either
i think yeah i mean i i was confused by this in part because this law only just took effect but obviously the void
epidemic has been rampant for a decade and so the the had these tools for the last decade
they weren't deploying them very actively and effectively if this was such a big deal why haven't they done more to constrain beforehand and i think part of it is that there was a lot of ambiguity in the law that preceded this law when claim of the defenders of the drug distributors was that the problem was that that law was totally ambiguous and that they weren't sure what was going on
they need they wanted to this law in place so it had more clarity and get i share your a little bit of your confusion here that we have the drug manufacturers who are making these making these drugs in the us now makes and consumes eighty percent of the world's supply of opiates eighty percent and were percent of the world's population
asian
and so the drug manufacturers have a role to distribute of all the doctors have all the state regulators have a role it's weird that this blew up as the big story because it doesn't feel like this to me is the the main crime it's going on but i don't know what the main crime is well is nothing else no one thing
it struck me is that you're right at the the pandemic was fully galloping and i guess the this legislation didn't certainly didn't cause that but in the face of that gallup like the fact that it could pass as as i suppose the question in the aftermath of it though what strikes me is that this could have been and should be presumably
if you think about a president who is willing to pick fights seemingly in all kinds of any direction where there are no barriers here's an epidemic that has heard his voters really
you know in a kind of direct way and he's not on the hook for it at all except for having named drugs are who is associated with the story but i mean he's not and he didn't sign the bill and so forth that he could jump all over this that for a guy who likes to do things that show his bases attendance and get them
but
it seemed ready to
in another kind of presidency in another kind of politics where you would have imagined a president jumping on those and there's just been very little rosen sign that at the justice department said he's very concerned about the story and is going to look into the know da needs more tools to carry out its mission that sort of struck me from the
the general was kind of slow fullness of the trumpet administration on the issue overall amazing is just really sad just seems like such an easy trick room to pick up i mean there's sixty four thousand people that we know of who died and then these estimates it's many more here get last year and that the deaths are actually much greater because they're a lot of deaths which aren't be report
period related which probably are and it's something which would have conservative and roll support it's also not going to be i mean the solution in the eighties when it was crack it was just like let's lock up black people with basically the solution and give them really long sentences and that's and so we know that this time it's not going to be for basically for racist reasons is not going to be a
a punishment solution which leaves the opportunity to huge opportunity for conservatives and liberals and rural and urban to come together on something and save lives and produce misery and it's weird that there's been so little that when it's such a huge issue and where everybody everybody's on
the same team why is there so little action
so i would say that because the solution is messy and when choir really sustained paying attention and order to accomplish something and then trumpet set himself up i mean i guess he's really good at praising and and taking credit no matter what the outcome is but it doesn't strike me as the kind of fight he's been interested in reaching i mean why
so what we've seen him get really behind in kind of fits and starts and bursts of energy are taking down obama has legacy and obama his accomplishments right he really likes that and that helps explain climate change actions and ran and obviously repealing obama care but other than that
i mean what's the pro active trump vision
i guess you could say like a trade war but that hasn't really gone anywhere even renegotiating nafta falls and the camp of dismantling the accomplishments of the past i guess that's and bill clinton accomplishment i don't see the way in which trumps really deep and strong connection to his supporters which seems like a
very real and continuing i don't see how that translates into like a real you know let's start this hard war on opiates together like this sort of l b j war on poverty or even the war on drugs those were long marches and i don't see trump going on long policy marches
but why isn't wasn't the why arthur rural state senators who were saying this is our cause we're just kind of this is what we're going to focus on what what are the hard solution them like what does what would need to be done
i think some people like john mansion and claire mccaskill have been talking about ban i'm sure there are republicans i should be putting into this category as well so first of all you do have to figure out a way to have fewer painkiller prescriptions and take those levels down i in the numbers in west virginia alone of how many you know like a small town
with just millions of these pills are pretty staggering and man is like that means you know that involves the doctors and involves the people who write the prescriptions and pharmacies that fell then as much as it does like the wholesale distributors on the back and the obesity epidemic also goes to these deeper
crises of like the american dream and the american soul you know people who feel like their lives are getting worse not better there was an amazing episode as listen to the new york times the daily this week at the rec and factory in indiana where the woman there who had lost her job was
like she was entangled in really difficult family situation she was someone who had i think she was making like in the low fifty thousand a year which was like a good income she didn't finish hate the church yeah gone to college she was really like taking care of the sick granddaughter and a son who wasn't working and trying to get her daughter off to college and just
feeling like they're asked as she was losing this job and you just have this feeling again okay this these were the people she voted for don time she believed his promises that you know in the whole carrier i you treated about her company to but the idea that there's like a sustained solution as opposed to just like getting everyone really mad about who's taking a need
during a football game i don't think we've seen that
i mean some is easier to get people riled up about a for program and to play on him in this politicians have been doing this for centuries get them excited and riled up about a cultural things on the policy changes are different but
still you would just expect it wouldn't be so
the fertile no issue would be something a little bit better them and ask him to
this may be a super and question goes can smoke weed down about this but is one of the problems with the oakwood epidemic is that it doesn't
it doesn't metastasized violence in the same with other drugs do it doesn't seem i'm could be wrong or could be there's a ton of violence that stems out of opium that i'm just not know
but isn't that isn't that a problem for fighting it because it just becomes it's sort of like oh these are people who whose own motives are screwed up but they're not they're not take him in the new you know with property crime probably played or something but they're busy not going out and killing people that is not a lot of drug violence related to this and which which causes
collective action against to but causes a punitive criminal justice on i mean you could argue the opposite it's actually a huge opportunity because we don't have that fans said just usually induces us to put more people in prison we could really be thinking about social services especially because these are mostly white people who you know the american public or at least partition
i tend to be more sympathetic to our that you could see that kind of policy response here that could then maybe translate into helping some people of color in inner cities but instead this is all part of essentially the shredding of the safety net like what people need our services
and some sense that like there's something to fall back on when our lives far apart and that is not something that politicians are excited about promising right now
yeah although again don't trump has promised you're right i don't say live and they don't want a promise that they don't want to actually and supply it about that
yeah i mean and there was a weird lack of funding for rob portman has worked on this issue her a long time that he wanted as a part of the first round of health care reform out of the senate and the reason with the weird fact that he couldn't get the money he wanted for treatment programs that in ohio been he's been working on this issue for
i mean i feel like forever
been talking about it but again just like
doesn't seem like it should be so hard

let's go to cook till chatter when you're sitting in your home john preparing avidly for our chicago show next week but you still have time to to think about other things what are you going to be chattering about to a little person's well in
dolphin news
there are ours homicide you know many thoughts on this but go ahead
last week we talked about dolphin fishing
but there was a forgotten that i had clip a story about scientists essentially when i'm essentially scientists dropping a touch screen into an aquarium as a way to try to understand dolphin language and interaction apparently the barrier so far has been that while scientists know the dolphins
they have their own language and
rich variety of noises and thanks and pops and grants which all mean things and have the dolphins have individual and specific sounds and one of the problems has been apparently when you can crunch dolphins together it's hard to know which one is talking to him at what time and this has been some kind of a barrier to understanding the nature of dolphin language so
back in the eighties they did the submerged and nine by million foot electronic keyboard that was hooked up to an apple two computer and the dolphins learn to use the keyboard to make requests from their human handlers for things like toys or get a belly rub or something
anyway that kind of is being built on with these screens and the dolphins in that are been held totally in captivity are nevertheless able to play whack a mole with fish to learn the game of welcome all were a fish
disappears if you do the right thing and this is you know possibly opening up new ways of understanding what dolphins
how they communicate and if you can figure out how they communicate then of course we can all drop latin and start taking dolphin in elementary school
and
be the first species that we can have you know like start texting at the end of this because we will have learned dolphin language i would definitely taxes and dolphins and be fun
to be more responsible mentions just and dolphin fishing update news i did hear from vessels
who says that when he goes fishing off and they will accidently her could often and the dolphin will take out your line instantly and so you have to cut it fast because if you don't cut it to spend everything out and take iran or something and that they use hooks that will rust out so that the dolphin
suffer
but he's never actually boat it often
emily what does your chatter
oh i thought i would do one of my periodic updates about the state of north carolina which is doing all kinds of interesting things to essentially change the structure of its government in way is that if you worry
one party can draw seem like they they could be a little alarming so the republicans have veto proof control of the legislature in north carolina and so the fact that the governor right cooper as a democrat from their point he was beside the fact and what they're doing right now is changing how they elect judges so for the first time in one hundred years
state is choosing to have judicial candidates identify by party office still to be an r d next to the name of the judge you're voting for
usually think of judiciary is like one step removed from politics this is step in the opposite direction they're also redistricting the judicial districts in a way that will hit a whole bunch of african american judges against each other by the way they're changing the lines and they also want to reduce the size of the state court of appeals so that cooper the governor
or can't name replacements for some republicans who are leaving office and it looks like this will probably go through and it's lake
district restricting the legislative districts in the last few years in north carolina and other changes they made to how people get elected and who controls the councils that do the redistricting that establish where polling places are going to be just we're talking about like the apparatus of government and of future elections and it's one of those efforts to really entrench
party in power by changing like the very shape of the government these signs that or seeing and i wonder if this is a model that other states will be interested in following
that didn't like me mood
macho let's go back to dolphins my cheddar
for tall i want to say happy birthday tomorrow wonderful retarded was father paul pilots who turned to eighty today happy birthday
second of all wonderful
anecdote at the top of a wall street journal story
this week a boat the belt tightening that's what happened in the g under the new ceo
jews squeezing some previously profligate spending and begins with the most incredible example about what the former ceo jeff malt used to do to jeff and i'm old
it was the ceo for sixteen years and often doesn't say how often but often when he was traveling you will always want he travel for g he took a private jet moto g s pro budget and often when he was traveling you didn't take just one private jet
he took a second teach it to follow his jacket
to wherever he was going so that in case of mechanical problems in his first povich it could hop on the second richard and get where he wanted to go
unbelievable can you imagine the level of a what east and profligacy at a company where they're using to private jets to carry one person to business meeting sometimes i take extra sox that's incredible
the flight crews were told not to discuss the empty claim that the people
