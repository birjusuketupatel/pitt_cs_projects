joined by jared kushner and a trump and blessed by some very controversial american pastors bibi netanyahu the prime minister of israel
celebrated the opening of a new us embassy in jerusalem on monday as the celebrations were happening israeli soldiers were firing firing live ammunition and fire and tear gas on thousands of palestinian protesters who were assaulting are protesting at the fence separating gaza is real sick
the palestinians were killed nearly three thousand wounded in the one sided battle there was not a single is really casualty i believe this was just the latest in a series of increasingly tense protests
in gaza someone instigated by hamas or but not entirely stated by hamas which rules gaza
presumably to draw the world's attention to the to conditions in the gaza strip which has been allocated by israel for a decade
generally very unpleasant place to be and live to use the technical term what's going on israel is a fucking mess and if an american jew married to an israeli jew i am gutted by what is happening emily this is just is a terribly complicated and awful story
but let's start with let's start with this question of whether there is a peace process anymore and there can be the us has always been israel best friend but it has also been kind of a potential broker in whatever peace process was going on is that
days over basically pick sides were with israel now and there's no potential for negotiation with the palestinians i think that champ station yes has abdicated the united states traditional role of some kind of but are so previous presidents administration's made clear that a way
our israel's friend and supporter but also maintained enough critical distance to have some kind of credibility as a neutral arbiter and convene or and now that's no longer the case i mean to me and also gutting to hear the white house spokesperson just entirely blame his heart
das en masse now obviously like hamas does bear some responsibility but that just seems to be such a terrible over simplification of what happened all the underlying tensions and currents that led up to these confrontations at the border fence and gaza
you know i think israel has i think the most right wing militaristic government ever had and the united states is giving israel more leeway to act with impunity then i think the united states has ever done before and it's that toxic combination that is leading to the end of
the peace process already was in terrible trouble on again they're all these underlying factors but it does feel mired and hopeless and brutal right now in a way that i am i don't remember being this way before which isn't to say that the intifada weren't terrible on their own right but this guy now
nick feels really awful to me
there's one of the things that i find so disturbing i suppose it's not different in israel at news and a lot of the rest the world is that no one seems to be playing any kind of long game but there's a hamas for short term reasons and to to draw the attention the world does want to provoke israeli retaliation
cause and even cause death of palestinians i mean that is clearly part of the goal is to provoke israel to respond
excessively israel is feeling impunity and no longer has any interest in any kind of peace process of negotiation doesn't isn't there's no punishment or the world is going to carry out against israel i think so
felt free to act however it wants the other arab states are largely indifferent to the palestinian cause not the not that people don't feel sympathy for the palestinians are going through and one should the conditions and gaza on the west bank or horrible
but they don't really they're not invested in doing anything about it it's just
the looming demographic crisis which is that they're going to be there to hugely growing populations in a very small space and one of them has no rights of citizenship and participation in society and that's in his past and and his pals em and that's that's
it's both a moral crisis and a political crisis that is the case and the second group you're talking about are orthodox jews right right to an increasingly right wing increasing the religious israelis who are then facing off against increasingly numerous and disaffected an alien
aided palestinians who are no longer integrated in any meaningful way into the economic life of israel are also which is another problem which is it used to be that palestinians
and israelis had a lot of connection to each other because they to me did a lot of the work and that's less and less and less true it does not like south africa where the foundation of the south african economy was the labour of black africans israel has one of the facts of separation is that separated its economy from of health me
so they don't even care it's like there's no they're not tied up in an economic future together either which is terrible at all it's all back every part of his bad
wait a minute seems like there are moments in this game no one hundred seventy year however you wanna count conflict in which international and domestic and regional forces push toward moderation and then there are moments when they divide and empower the extremists and right now we're in a moment in which extreme
this on both sides are being encouraged and and whatever taken to reach that point like however much you want to say that gardens have been manipulated into this position by arab states by hamas by their own leaders is that it doesn't matter like that it is such a terrible circumstance that the notion that then
israel's responses to open fire just feels a wildly unjust when banks your original question david whether the us is given over its traditional role of is moving though
in the old days the reason the embassy he was in tel aviv was to keep as a part of the future negotiation that the us with her broker the status of jerusalem up in the air by choosing to move the embassy to jerusalem and cells to the palestinians that basically that's been taken care of him even though they think they should have a capital in jerusalem that that's been
settled but the second thing is that what used to pressure you as governments was that the arab reaction to doing that would be so violent that they would be you know the americans didn't want to court battle that outrage from the arab world and that seems to have diminished so if you look at three medical pressure on this continent
duration
obviously there's a lot of strong pressure from donors in in the republican party to do what the president did and so i believe shall nails and was actually at a ceremony so you've got that pressure to do what he did and then the other pressure which would balance things out is going away which is to say that there didn't seem to be much outrage from
the arab world
directed at the united states either for the move or for the israeli reaction to the palestinian protests so it seems like the pressure to get something done is
his moved away conservatively that's that's a really good point john and it's because there's basically now an implicit alliance between a lot of the sunni ever have been gulf states and israel so that the saudis
in their circle and to a lesser extent kind of the jordanians in the egyptians basically are allied against iran a rising iran there's this weird the thing i know maybe you can explain the someone that israel's chief enemy has somehow become iran even though it doesn't share a border with iran and they don't really have any they're not really
at odds they don't allow any conflict with are lacking in funding has blah so i and you know and has ties to other very anti israel group so i i mean i think that's that seems fairly obvious but i think dance point is it really important one and it's always that the middle east like lots
really complicated you have to take into account all these different actors and the way in which these international pressures matter just as much as what's going on domestically what if then suddenly in the trump administration said okay we moved the
the us embassy and now we're going to recognize palestinian claims to be eastern half of jerusalem
that is not going to happen
my no danger
yeah to show an and then why would you ever extend yourself to the palestinians and there's also this problem which which is there there's no lift remaining in the country there's no left for peace that has any influence in the country way and that is domestic arguments going on about you know laws that discriminate against women there are these questions of the rise
power of the orthodox fat consume a lot of energy within israel arguing internally and it's i think easier to kind of block out what's happening in the territories but when you actually like like what's happening in the territories i mean you know in nineteen sixty seven when israel took over the west bank
they could have pulled out they could have prevented jewish settlers from settling they didn't it wasn't some like big deliberate choice in which israel's leadership at the time really thought it through and understood the implications it was a little more i'm an accidental is too strong but it just kind of unfolded and now they're all the settlers there are you know daily battles of our palestinian
plans in which the israeli supreme court rulings that give palestinians the right to plant crops or live live on those lands within the confines of this militarists to control our like shifting all the time on the ground in terms of how the army interpret stand chill man who is one of the and of remaining israel
real doves was writing about this this week and so you know when you read accounts like that it's almost as if you could see like imagine want to be like in the united states if native americans we're currently losing their lands as opposed to like this original sin that happened years ago that you know is a scar on the nation but for better or worse
worse
is a piece of history it's not happening right now there are places in the last bank or it is happening right now
i don't think
leona know you and are both american jews who spent time in his own
i certainly have really relatives and you i don't know if you do but i i certainly don't think it is my place of an american to spend a lot of time trying to shape is really domestic politics
israel's business like my job as an american is to try to influence american decision makers to make better decisions about our foreign policy and foreign policies are listed to israel and as it relates to other countries even when israel is doing things that i find terrible and tragic and believe to be long term mistakes i don't really think is my business telling them not to do
well i guess i wonder what the distinction is i mean sure like then concentrate on you know american government leadership and an america we have such an oversized influence in with israel and in that region that if you trained to the trump administration's policy that would carry enormous weight and so you can chat
all your energy and that direction that feels better to you but i feel like these things bleed into each other that's not the right word to use something written word
choose the right word maybe it is i mean these things the these two issues of like how and whether american jews are supposed to directly comment and have an opinion about israeli policy or whether we just take our feelings about israeli policy and then try to get are jewish organizations or you know that whoever is in
the white house to respond to them it's it doesn't feel that different to me
last question we've we've moved away from the particular tragedy of the week which is the death of death of scores of people
seems to be largely unnecessary slaughter didn't seem to be the groups threat to israeli national security
was it was occurring during these protests
why do you think israel's pursuing such an implacable strategy why why are they shooting to kill people and what do you do in the face of thousands of people seeking to kind of breakthrough offense and broke through border
indeed you do you think their claims bed basically members of hamas are into trading these
protests and that those are the guys you're being shot do you think that's a totally made up or do you think they're over
it was their theory of course right and i think it was probably oversold i doubt it is totally made up i've always thought that the palestinian mean
the palestinian stupidity in all of the protests over the since the first intifada the the way in which they let violence infected if had been simply remained and been able to persist with a non violent strategy and drudgery of violent protests in this case where you just simply go and walk peacefully up to this fence
it would be so much
then what they pursued and i do think they probably did the crowd with people with weapons or or people decided autonomously on their own you know what i'm going to use this opportunity trying to sneak through and do some damage to it so i think that hamas clearly
i was happy to have that happen
have have the crowds be infiltrated but that still does that justify the new the new and of responds by israel i don't know right well that's no i was just trying to figure out what the how to calibrate what happened
hamas has dug the tunnels and we know they have shot the rockets and all that but but that doesn't really tells about what happened on the specific gave sixty people died
by it i mean i think there were other means of crowd dispersal that israel could have used rage shirley i mean water there
but i also feel like
in some ways focusing unless like mrs fletcher picture i mean i agree with you david i think the palestinians would be much better serve with nonviolent protest i also think that is like such a huge thing to ask of people have to her hands on her hind of statesman likely or ship that the palestinians have not had and it demands kind of or
seeing their own feelings that like the violence is justified by well at this point by the power and balanced but before by this kind of historical i'm feeling of of losing their land and losing their place and i don't know like
i look there's so much blame on both sides are all sides in this story but i just feel lonely pan on the palestinians for not having a better strategy at this point when you know we're talking about an israel that is dominant it just feels like it's not a satisfactory answer to me this episode of the first

dot com slash gap first plus to become a member political washington distracted itself for far too much of the past week
with the story of kelly sadler someone i'd never heard of a mid level white house press aide who cracked a morbid and cruel joke about john mccain and his opinion about a director and hospitals nomination i think it was about that didn't matter because he's dying anyway
and a private meeting and this was leaked out and became publicly known that she had said this so there a couple of stories here first if the continuing persistent refusal of the white house to apologize for anything and second the fact that settlers remark leak so quickly
at the white house was way more upset about the leak them the joke
and the meetings about leaking were themselves leaked and then a bunch of white house sources talk to reporters about why they leaked so a lot about leaking so first of all before we get the leaking question i'm actually going to rise to sabotage defense i don't want to belabor at it with a joke in poor taste but honestly
it's a kind of people in politics cynically say all the time it's like that it's the dark cynical joke that political people say all the time privately to each other
all the time when you can hold up neglect lana to sam's sorry but and there's so much sanctimony because it involves mccain and mccain is is has been amazing american leader and he appears to be dying and so there's a there's a kind of holiness surrounding him and so should make a joke about mccain who i am sure has made similar jokes in his life about people certainly fed salt
things and private himself
well okay so there's the question is the is the joke itself wrong or simply the fact that there hasn't been a public apology from south the wrong she may have she i think she did reach out to meghan mccain to apologize i don't know whether that was where the she handled in from of just a purely human standpoint i think you don't you don't i mean you
i mean people are should be free to say stupid and cruel and morally gross things which is to is kind of dilemma but delight in the impending death of someone but your point is you know people in the impending death i you think he was delighted in the impending death i wasn't there
i don't well actually i don't know what is implicit don't think it's not the lighting it's more like it's it's it's a kind of like throwaway line
he's guy and wasn't matter and this was objectionable enough for a few people in the meeting to be so repulsed that they felt they had to leak which is so also once it gets out their view as a white house or a kind of steward of norms and this is one of them which is you respect the dignity of other people and you
maybe respect the dignity of a sitting senator and by the way you've got good news on north korea so why have this be a multi day story
wanna just apologize milan and have everybody focus on the big success you had this week on north korea
right
tactical point which is you make extremely well which someone should have said to them which is that they they should have posted along and that's the reason to apologize and also because it's the humanly decent thing to do i guess i'm still i still would say that it's a completely forgivable excusable
remark and moreover it's just that there's a level of hypocrisy it's a kind of thing that i know because i hang around political journalists all the time i used to be a political journalist and except for a few who are who are quite big hearted i would put you in that category down like every
one says things like this all the time and politics all the time that i i'm not the point like nobody the point is they're kind of to principles at stake there's a basic norms of decency and severity you at john has done an excellent job of napping because he thinks a lot about this and then there's the principle of not upon
isaiah for anything like even when you're shooting yourself in the foot and that his character trait of president chant and now we're seeing it permeate his administration and is that what we want from the president of course of course we do so
let's go to the leak john you are such a student of this kind of stuff does this white house leak in fact more than its predecessor
it's it's not even a water metaphor big enough to contain the way in which this white house leagues so it link ocean will learn and can jam i think an ocean is is too small i think
news about a symbol fall in the in the container we need to and and what is drinking and but the leaking here is obviously there's leaks there's the leaks about leaks and i love the leg long explanation
that a lot of axioms printing of like while the league well and also we have never lets say this we have never had a president who has thrilled so much in leaking himself as a private citizen certainly and perhaps even even as a president now we should we should know that for a long time
for woodrow wilson held that first public press conference
you had presidents who and then even for a long time after that and presidents who leaked in one of the definitions of it which is they tell you something and you just don't attributed him you don't attributed to them and the you just attributed to the administration or to an administration officials so we've had a lot of that with presidents we've had weird things were bill clinton wants to talk to a bunch of reporters and then they cited and in new
illustration official familiar with the president's thinking
but i think is most important substantively about leaking and this administration is that leaks are the sign of a corrosive system inside of an administration and there's the sign of of several different things one so much chaos then that members of the administration feel like they can't get their ideas adjudicated
in the normal channels and so they have to go outside to try to create a situation that fixes the policy debate second thing is it's so corrosive that the president and only listens to things that are put in front of him that have been printed in the new york times so that if you say something and a meeting you will be ignored but if it appears in new york times in front of the president at sea
only way that they see it
those are short of doubled related but then the biggest corrosive part is that this long into an administration if everybody is not rowing in the same direction
it means that there is not the lift of inspiration in the chief executive or in the people around him that makes it a place where you wouldn't dare leak not because somebody to take your job away or punish you are or because it's impossible to do because they've locked away your phones but you don't want to leak because you believe so much in the mission of the person or in the dude
you have to the american people which presumably the executive is trying to carry out that duty
it would be and almost on patriotic thing that you would stop yourself from leaking if that isn't the reaction and yet and in fact we've seen quite the opposite it suggests that people are not policing themselves they're compelled to league because of the corrosion and that is not healthy
there was a really good set of stories about how the clinton administration
shut down the leaking it occurred during the first year and one of the main points was so i think you already amazingly green over the atlantic
and largely if that leon leon panetta came in as chief of staff and he didn't do a massive investigation to root out the the lakers there wasn't there wasn't a kind of public humiliation of the lakers and and a ritual honest execution it was we're all together on the team were going to find
the pride to all work together to believe and what we're doing and we're going to act professionally because it radically because of that sort of the positive approach with what worked and then negative approach oh investigating locking people's phones away threatening people just perpetuates the kind of paranoia
and i'm going to get shift attitude that causes people to to the anyone meant can i mentioned in another kind of leak we had this week ronan taro had an amazing story this week about michael cohen's financial dealings which are connected to the stormy daniels payment but but or even more connected to these pay offs to him to gain influence and
the new administration mm an investigator talked to pharaoh because he was worried that the system that had been flagged several times the banking system that have been flying several times in noticing big payments to cohen and he's moving money around which flagged the the system wide process for
transactions that might be suspicious activity
back in the sack
the watchdog for suspicious finance
it it flag van kind of unrelated not knowing the facts of the case just huge amounts of money moving around and the official that talk to feral was worried that the information was now being withheld from law enforcement because it was disappearing from the database so that's another leak that happened this week which is the another basket of leaks which is not necessarily inside the administration but in the
son of aid
oh kind of in various investigations going on not not any leaking by the way going on by muller but
nevertheless in the various lawyers and on all sides of the various investigation going on related to the president and those around him
emily going back to to jumps very clarifying
deception of leaking at this administration and whites so prevalent is there any realistic hope that as
a trump gets more more of his people in the white house and fewer people he doesn't want which is something he appears to be doing and be he just becomes more comfortable than a job that the culture of leaking will stop i mean it seems like the factional as asian and the fighting it out has been how he's always ran his operation
so why would we expect that change and if anything you might expect it to intensify as more and more i mean i know it seems like he's the people in the white house artists people said i'm really know what that means that done do you imagine this coming down or do you imagine a continuing so many people when we are well into an administration
and the president has not been shy about firing people
getting the way he as fire them or had them fired or exerted pressure on his staff or force them out
his by leaking make the league super of old jeff sessions is really on the chopping block cures to nielsen at the secretary the department of homeland security all she might you know they're looking for replacements now the leak is used as all administration's use them but this one in hyperdrive and also in this specifically personnel related way
to kind of either flow trial balloons or knock people off or prepare the way for their dismissal
you cannot suggest that well once he gets his team in there and this is you know then things will get better i think that this is a this is a byproduct of the way the place runs we've seen so many people change and and yet the leaks continue
going to the apology question emily trump appears to be literally incapable algae
not apologize to any of the people he said disgusting
things about for the last couple of years not to mccain not to carry their con not to judge carry yell
i other people he is impugn and four hundred
that a quality of narcissism or is that that method not necessarily an arsonist this quality it's just something built and to him
i think it's narcissistic i also think he it's part of his whole know yeah right that you have these brawls of people that you revel in the brawls that you never back down and why should he changed that way of operating when it has served him well from his point of view
you know he is all about the idea that he knows best and that he is best served by following his gut instincts especially right now
i didn't it's really amazing to me that he's gotten as far as he has in life without being able to apologize
made me think maybe there's an entirely different way to live and i just don't recognize it's related to the difference between leading through fear and leading through right like it's all
if we want to believe that leaving for your fear doesn't work and when you know when you are my boss you didn't lead that way and you're really good at apologizing and is it served you well so the idea that there's this alternate path and what you never back down and like you get to be you get to fail up to be the president that's depressing well it leaves you know there there's there's collateral damage
edge that that is left when you pay that way and so usually your
you know your conscience kicks him and says i don't want to leave wreckage
i think a piece of wreckage year by the way is kelly sadler she has become an herb her issue is talked about
on and on she tried to make it right called meghan mccain who knows
know whether whether and how she was whether she was any good but it was she did the right thing you say something stupid you apologize
if the administration had apologized and perhaps the president in his world view would see that as a knock against him or something new and heard him but if you're a leader you take the hit yeah your person did something stupid but you take the hit on their behalf everybody who works for you sees you take the hit on their behalf and says you know he's a stand
a guy he's done the big thing and that's a kind of guy i want to work for and that kind of culture then creates a situation which you don't leak because you say why would i want to do something small for my own self aggrandizement when the person i'm working for set this example of doing something big at their own expense
that's not this like exhibit three thousand two hundred and thirty one in human wreckage and shame are not going to in any anyway really affect the current administration and what matters are election results like no other avenue all these kind of small checks civility and norms and decency that we've
lie on in previous presidents to get the president or he calibrate they seem to have almost zero power
you know certain that and seems to me the case now
the question is whether there's any
you know how big the damage is just one one more thing on on the morality of apologies g k chester to him as a great quote about apologies
even apologies and fake apologies he said a stiff apology is a second insult the injured party does not want to be compensated because he has been wronged he wants to be healed because he has been hurt
the front that was a good reminder of why we apologise that can get lost here in the political debate
right

the district attorney's of brooklyn and manhattan
well i'm not going to i'm
even to introduce a i'm afraid that whatever i'm going to say m m
going to tear it apart for emily wanna you introduced the topic
okay so new york is a state in which the possession of marijuana smoking marijuana remains illegal and so we have this interesting situation in which particularly in brooklyn africans are so i've been doing some reporting on for my buck inherited a district attorney's office and much twenty in two thousand and fourteen his
predecessor promise to reduce the prosecution of marijuana possession and so at that blaine forget about manhattan because that day and and hadn't saved answer is not on board for this at that point the idea was that as a way of countering stop and frisk prosecutors in brooklyn we're going to declined to prosecute people who got stopped for
son potentially bogus reason by the cops because a lot of bogus stops were and racially discriminatory and desperate stops were like driving stop and invest and then if if the cops found we it in your pocket you probably wouldn't get prosecuted so it turned out that that policy only sort of went into effect and i think laughed
fall debbie when my did a big story showing that in more than eighty percent of the arrest in brooklyn the cops were still prosecuting for marijuana and the reason for that was there are a bunch of exceptions to this policy that brooklyn days off it as put in place and it mostly affected people who had open war and so are out on probation or
parole or had a criminal history and there was also an exception for smoking in public so and when w n y c that report it turned out that almost everyone who is still getting arrested for marijuana possession was black or hispanic that is true city wide that is a huge problem so fast forward to
now what happened was that the end my pity was claiming that the reason for this racially disparate pattern of enforcement of marijuana is that they're more nine one one cause complaining about weed from predominantly minority neighborhoods and the new york times when it did this analysis were on a precinct
level they compared different places in the city and they found that that explanation from the my he just doesn't hold up because you see the same rate of complaints about marijuana on the upper west side as you know and our neighborhood in harlem and you see many more black people arrested in harlem this predominantly black
fuck place so what the city and in particular guns are since i have bands are wrestling with and let the n y p d really needs to think about is what is the point of this so i'm the one hand it's a funny question for the cops and prosecutors to be asking right because if the state still says marijuana possession is illegal
how do you go around just essentially a deciding not to enforce the law
but the other side is like if they don't act we're going to continue to have her new york will continue to have this racially desperate pattern of enforcement and so i think what we're really seeing here underlying this is that the police are reluctant to give up marijuana arrests as a way to essentially police people they think are bad
guys people who already have records people who are doing things they don't like it's a tool for them
and then the sort of push back when you look at you and you think about that top deck
what exactly like if if the city is coming around a contented few that marijuana enforcement for white people is not something we want anymore why are we still doing it for black people who have these like vague suspicions attached to them especially because we know we really know from the researched the notion that marilyn
arrest reduce serious crime is just not true so that's the sort of underlying situation here
so if if someone's arrested and and it's just on their record for six months and then it gets wiped for their arrested for marijuana and so on the record for six months and it's just wipe so what's the big deal but it is a big deal right because people lose how's a lose jobs they're there they have to go to court and it can we not at all it means they can get in bigger trouble for something
else in that intervening six months like it is attacks it is a tax on poor people it as a tax on black and hispanic people and it leads to the is some of the neighborhoods i've been reporting and in brooklyn you have this funny situation in which i think about it you're like a black had your at nineteen or twenty years old you see that people are not getting any more i mean
all over the city you smell marijuana in a way that i have used to notice that just a few years ago it's true by the way where i live in new haven to so you smell it
people around you are smoking like in the hallway of an apartment building or outside and then the cops come and a big make guess they're responding to complain or they just see people and they come over and they run the names and then they only pick up some of the people that people with these open warrants the people they see is like the bad guys for reasons
you know are a black box like is that feel like to you if you're that that teenager that feels run an unfair and new york which has supposedly ended stop and frisk like this is a vestige of stop and first for the still causing a lot of unhappiness and unfairness
i have a question about whether how this connects to the broken windows theory of police so we heard so much in the nineties about the idea that if you stop nuisance crimes fare dodging minor disruptive chaotic crimes that you put a block against bigger
crimes later
is this part enforcement an example at all of this and be did it turn out that the broken windows theory with nonsense the broken windows theory at this point is much disputed and i would say largely in fact i mean people still make those claims by then so let's talk about new york mark because it had broken windows and also
has become as there's a book that this u c berkeley criminologist name franklin zipping called the see that became safe so new york is had tremendous success and reducing crime and then the question becomes why do we credit broken windows policing for some of that drop and when the criminologists go in and they like try to look at this question it is a
complicated question there is no simple answer for why crime dropped in new york or across the country but giving a lot of credit to broken windows policing looks like a big mistake because broken windows policing was not shown to reduce serious crime and the other amazing thing about new york the headline at least in my view is that new york reduced crime
at a great rate while also reducing mass incarceration at a great rates and the notion that like you pick up all the smoke smell fi offenders you get them off the street for a short amount of time that having some bigger deterrent effect that seems to not be true and now we're having a kind of another test of that he can the city stop enforcing it's marijuana law
without having crime rise the cops are worried about it but it looks like the answer to that is probably yes i mean one thing that has happened in brooklyn since two thousand and fourteen is that the number of arrests for marijuana possession has gone way down so there were still having some of those cases prosecuted when people do get arrested but the idea that we're just like pig
people up because they have waited in their pockets and that means that you know that's going to prevent crime more broadly like that does not look to be true at all because crime is continue to drop in brooklyn and across the city
evidence from to like dc ten temper which have crammed marijuana the prime change and anywhere
crime has not risen in those places as far as i know i should note also though i was surprised when you're reading up for this topic so colorado which is mostly stopped prosecuting people from marijuana also has a problem of racially disparate enforcement when they do arrest people there are three times as likely to be african american and so
look like this is racially desperate law enforcement is just like
a constant nagging problem in our criminal justice system and the question is like how much do we care about it how much does fat fundamental unfairness drive how we shape how we think about our policies and and i would say that it's important to ask those questions against the backdrop of you know recognizing just how
massive mass incarceration remains in the united states i mean it's quintupled are rate of incarceration since the seventies were still way ahead of other developed countries for example in europe and it's just we're causing tremendous destruction especially poor and minority communities and it's really not clear
we're getting from it
either complexities here are the
some of was some suggestion that aggressive enforcement minor league started shooting actually insights
your it's worse in the thing is that time york
broken windows was being informed students here who's being followed by brandon the forty percent reduction them in an employment in the state and so you had massive sociological changes going on there would also contribute to a decrease brought him in crime and then also the thing is that there was there was a drop in crime in other states
they want following broken windows theory about the same time so it's just more evidence of this mess he knows the him
in the data the ground yes good point
you know i'm don't know this data and i'm emily are you obviously are deeply expert on it it is just the lived experience of the cities
broken windows always felt intuitively you write to me though why would you credit those things as opposed to what john just explained about unemployment to climb and these larger social the horses there's a whole social fine earns about her no social cohesion in neighborhoods and how non profit organizations can contribute to that all these things and of
nothing to do with law enforcement that can really affect how safe a city feels like whether people go to the park where of the park it already have any hot lately and that is an honor i mean those are all things
police i think you know i think you're right i know you're right i know you're no you're right on the data
it is very hard to reconcile the idea that this had nothing to do with it with the fact that to me the huge difference in living the american city
twenty years later is feeling the chaos has been diminished and therefore it is safe for is safe in all places at all times in always okay whatever whatever just thinking about this like if you live in a mostly white affluent neighborhood do you want the cops picking your kids up if they are smoking in the park
if you don't why one of the clubs picking up someone else and i lagged no need to know no no totally it's totally right
it's completely fair point
also can on people sitting on her porch you did my neighbors sit on their porch and have a drink
my wrong with the exactly i mean one thing new york has already wrestled with his it's open container laws and why not deal with that through a summons like a ticket right they're all these infractions constantly it's true obviously with so many driving problems right like you get a parking ticket you get a speeding ticket you don't get a criminal record
you get a civil summons like are different ways of dealing with the kind of behavior at are describing the don't entail giving people criminal records that have is negative consequences for it's possible to that there is some contributory
broken windows is just not as big as people claim i mean of there's the spectrum from it incites more violence to it's the solution don't crime grey and one other thing to think about is like why the police and law enforcement or an answer as opposed to a kind your landlord or doing something that has that soft
that's a a way of problem solving and dealing with the you know and i even want to use that were deviant the dealing with behavior you don't like if if you're in an apartment thousand and there's like the smell pot everywhere and you don't want to be there like who do you call and why do you live in a place where i like the cop seem like you're only resort
approximately every two hours one thing in dies in the trunk of

the backlash
people tend to lean the taxpayer dollars
let's go to cocktail chatter when you are sitting on your porch
as i'm sure above on for dickerson and rose and parts of do occasionally with a cocktail
what are going to be chattering about john dickerson remove first to be chattering amount of comes from daniel pink news letter daniel pink gives them a great writer who has a wonderful news letter that includes things
link some suggestions to burst of the things in this came from that and it is it
the story about something that i have a reaction to like this
jani or moral ordeal thing where one person years one thing and one person here a mother to me this would be a life of doom
for the person engaged in it is a life of happiness and this person is engaged in his living on royal caribbean cruises mario so say do good two decades ago two decades ago retired from his job and went on a cruise from which he has never
returned for almost twenty years he has been a permanent resident on the royal caribbean cruises
he has spent more than seven thousand consecutive nights on cruise ships and learned all of this well from the link on danza newsletter but it was in a new york times op dark and little film about consumer super mario life on these cruise ships i suggest you go watch it and
also contemplate what life would be gone a royal caribbean cruise hunger and strangers just don't know he was a for twenty one years i think he was a involved in the corporate world think he did
he traveled a lot to latin american in financial services company or something
when is like a millions or hundreds of millions or billions of million to be millions my brother and my rough the number in my head is two point eight million dollars
so interested to see what when actually if that's fascinating he one thing that's very poignant him at the end of the him
like is he talks about he doesn't want go die and some land hospital so you things when he and i hope
i thought you might attached to this david when he feels as though is at the end is near he would just go scuba diving into just keep going down just kind of just go down and then that would be the end of it once was
and of oxygen ran out or the or the pressure became too mature that would it doesn't go go on land
anyway and nine hundred fifty cruisers oh my god
yeah you like and don't were horrified i where you are well that's my point is when compared to that the audio mean because mean this is obviously great happiness for mario sell say he has achieved the singular thing in life that he wants to do and for me
this would be
like that how honor yeah like that play no exit i mean it would be it would be really not something i would want to do in any possible way
oh my god it looks like know it looks like less than two million dollars
oh my god
getting anxious and asked about author you only get an interior interior cabins which keeps has caused him to there's no way oh my god
i'm not sure you can keep saying i think he may have maxed out with this is really it's like somebody will get upset by are so many worst thing is to get upset by and here i am upset both and living the dream by being on a cruise
i feel worse than and dave think down and when he went through
it's definitely not as penance that so in the long list of things that we should be paying attention to you that are getting lost in the den
there was this really promising bipartisan effort to have federal sentencing reformed have congress passed a law that would address some of the over enforcement problems me were just talking about on a federal level fewer low are mandatory minimum sentences for people who are non violent drug offenders
there were other reforms i was like put a dent in the federal prison population and chuck grassley the republican his head of the judiciary committee in the senate was very much behind this there was a list of bipartisan supporters they had been hammering it out for a couple of years attorney general jeff sessions opposes oppose this legislation
in the face of groups you know including like the koch brothers who had style themselves as criminal justice or farmers and he has succeeded in having it off and so what congress has now considering instead is extremely water down del called the first step act that really only address is like a little bit every entry in a little bit of prison can
auditions like they're no longer going to shackled pregnant women in federal prisons if this law passes and they're going to give women and tampons and tampax and stuff like okay that's good but
really getting all thousands of people out of prison it is small change and that some democrats seem to be basically like going for this to the dismay of groups like the sale you in the brand and center for justice and so and just watch this like to my surprise one of the new york city representatives
kim jeffries is gotten behind this bill sell some other democrats or at least stave voted out of committee i don't think cory booker has spoken out publicly on it yet he was has been one of the main proponents for on bigger criminal justice or foreign but like right now it's like chuck grassley is carrying the banner here and
an idea that you know the first step the first steps there will be future steps but it seems entirely likely that will not happen and all of this energy will get dissipated and kind of dribbled away and to quite a small bill
my chatter is a study published in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences this week and was written up in new york times which is where i thought about a research project led by andrew wilson who an archaeologist oxford
a expert at the desert research institute in reno nevada name joseph mcconnell and what they did is they got in a score from greenland so there's often
as a way of tracking climate and tracking snowfall and precipitation these huge ice cores and greenland and you can go back thousands and thousands of years to serve
debt levels of precipitation other things and they found one they found an ice core which contained ice from the entirety of the roman empire the years of the roman empire and they melted and analyze the water that came out and make a track the water to particular year and they looked at the lead levels and
water and why would you look the lead levels of lead levels in water from the roman empire correlate incredibly closely to the economic activity of the roman empire because wow that's so interesting yeah so lead is used for making pipes and also for making ships and lead is also used when you're when you're making silver coin
the way they'd mind
i guess lead lead and silver were coming you to burn let off to get a silver which you were going to use for your coin
during the great packs romano period lead levels spike in this greenland ice and then because this is all the made the atmosphere it falls as snow falls as part of snow thousands of miles away agreement and then after periods of plague or during periods of chaos and the empire that let bubbles drop precipitously so it's just a cool
cool little bit of finance and i really enjoyed it neat
