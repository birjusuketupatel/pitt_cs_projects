we will talk about the crazy stormy daniel saga and maybe a little bit of them irk maybe there's probably some other legal thing that will appear as were taping to a point on

up there would definitely get in trouble
president trump a zero sum mercantilist in his bones split the country and entirely new way this week returning to a favorite campaign subject
a big where he's actually been consistent he policy views that have held steady the nineteen eighties i believe seems to be his core fundamental belief about policy
i'm headed notion of protectionism and mercantilism us though he and now would you tell people it mercantilism is mercantilism is is is the
economic principle in a butcher this and all or economists listening will can correct me the economic school of thought that
existed really before adam smith came along before before the ideas of a freer markets and the division of labour came along which held that a country was richest by hoarding its own gold by making everything itself by trading as little as possible with its partners right being entirely self sufficient on
a to close closed system and then you have everything yourself you don't have to rely on other nation right right we don't make other nations rich you don't get them rich by giving you giving them your money
this attaches in goods and services in away with the immigration policy to in terms of just to kind of wall theory of the having a whale yeah yet
he really didn't obviously it is entirely at odds with the world order that emerged after world war two in which there was this notion that nations would be better off in a collective on
stable regime of treating everybody benefits remember all trading with each other more the world is like one giant producer and museum and it creates also in addition to creating economic benefit it creates political and
oh no military or non military which is that you're much less likely to go to war over the country where you have economic relationship right and in the wake of world war two we adopted the world adopted that system deliberately in order to try to prevent another world war so now we are going to that cutting and frame our ties so the president announced that he would impose twenty five per
tariffs on imported steel ten percent tariffs on imported aluminum as we were taping on thursday morning is planning to sign them today
president of course has said
most notoriously that there's the trade wars are good and easy to win
their reactions to his announcement about tariffs have come fast and furious and stock market dropped instantly after he announced them out some sort of spontaneously incidentally was sort of it was did not appear to have been a highly well thought out
scheme his top economic advisors the chair of his national council garrett cone resigned the european union announced that they may well be retaliatory tariffs levy against bourbon and motorcycles and orange juice which is wonderful set of things to love it
as meantime highly entertaining running at my house
there was a deliberate kentucky is the home of bourbon whereas senate majority leader mitch mcconnell is the motorcycles are like denials friend paul ryan's district etc an orange juices florida swing state and republicans and congress or see the over these corrupt so john
you just we just saw you interview been sas about this but this is the president's most consistent position isn't should we be surprised that he actually follow through on a it's most consistent position perhaps after immigration
what's interesting hearing with superintendent on immigration is that he can move unilaterally and there is a feeling going back to the gary cone and slapdash nature of the way to put together and i think you put this in when you're evaluating the nature of the president's leadership you put this in the basket with the trans gender decision on the military and also with the first travel ban which is a kind of
slap dash effort meant to show that action is being taken on key priorities
so this is something the president can grab and do and show that he's moving on his relatives and but both the difference with the gender benders that actually a trans gender and the military and on in this case the secretary of commerce is trade representative and is some of the key economic advisors do what do but then the treasury secretary and his top deck and i mean when they just don't
and the secretary of defense ends and state don't want it to unless we those particularly time because the justification nice anglia orange he has no new ideas and this remarkable this guy i mean the justification legally that wilbur asked the commerce and day and the president had put forward is that this is
our national security industry that we need to bolster our steel industry and get mad as our secretary of defense is saying actually there are national security threats for alienating our allies and this and attacking them and us my prison is using his section two thirty two of the trade expansion active nine hundred and sixty two
so that is a little loon corner of this trade law and will the idea behind to trade law and we want to get back to the economics the david and set up in the first place but this goes to emily's point and goes to the sort of really circuitous route to president is trying and using and this by the way using circuitous route to achieve policy goals by other means
used to be something that conservatives railed about with previous administrations because of course that's not what the president is supposed to do you of use laws in ways in which they were not intended in the idea is basically should the u s get into a real war with weapons that means a lot of steel and aluminum they don't want to be in a negative position
to not be able to produce steel and aluminum now are not be able to produce the weapons of war with these materials now the first problem is a mexico china and south korea who provide us with a lot of our weaponry
would be unlikely to stop doing so in the case of a war that's the first thing so it's not a real threat secondly those countries that we would need in client or those are the kinds of countries in addition to the european nations that are that are hurt by this who we would need in live war and third of all we still produce a majority of our own still yeah i instantly enough to take care of the needs of a war and forth of
all the president almost never publicly justifies his actions using section two thirty two he he justifies it on the grounds that david talked about earlier which he's welcome to do but he can't do it should or should not be available to you if your argument is you're doing for national security reasons so he's kind of giving up the game
sometimes he argues it on economic grounds he's giving up the fact that it's obvious that he's doing this for economic reasons and not national security reason and i think also i mean these tasks are not a major factor in the global economy or even the us economy and so the reason there's been a strong reaction to them is this fear of a slippery slope and the national security
justification vacation is part of that story of okay well then what if other countries start invoking their national security interests or trade barriers and what if we get sued by under the rules of the world trade organization and then the trump administration either pulls out of the w t o or ignores the ruling they're all these are we on the brink
of this kind of a large or a trade war questions that i think in some ways are overshadowing the actual all right
magnitude of these have encouraged me one political point which is this is speculation and so should be treated as such good if you look at the fight that the president is picking here and what he is doing with immigration in california and the fact you may travel to california to kind of press this idea that california is sanctuary state
essentially is you see him engaging at least in those cases him to public fights in which as the defender of his positions he can research is connection with his base so it feels like this is all based maintenance
which is shocking it may just be psychological maintenance i want to do stuff i want to be fighting the fights i came into fight but if it is to the extended his base maintenance then it suggests something that we haven't much scene which is actual erosion in the base that needs tending before you know there was the idea the base would never move ever if these are in some ways
offered his way to ten the base then that gives you some sense of really how tough his political straits are not his approval ratings down but even even having to pretend to think it's much more likely john
psychological reassurance for him rather than some grand political strategy i knew somebody who he just needs to be from
i think that
yeah way that i think you're right and also they they're not mutually exclusive
tending to his base also makes him
and i know this because he said it makes him feel psychologically up also there's the eighteenth district
special i yam pennsylvania ray were in this particular place seeming to defend the jobs of co workers is popular and so islander if that's that's strategic element here and then actually that's a perfectly smart thing to do that
it's close but it's seen as rad republican territory and if kind of lamb the democratic challenge or loses that race on this kind of pro union platform that he is running on that will be hailed as a bellwether for a tramp and republican so even if that's what he gets out of that's that's like a short term gain a good point why do you think it is
way to that question which she's going to answer himself first
trump has this view about trade because some people said oh trump has being dragged to this by peter navarro is
economic advisor and by wilbur roth
the trump has been pulled to the but no with is clearly trump has held the news himself for that that wouldn't have our and ross what he's done he's found people who will agree with him and that's why he's elevator them within his administration
in my view about why if it
that japan and nineteen eighty know when well
well that's probably part of it he is a real estate developer and real estate development as i think we've talked about on the show work differently than other forms of economic that and real estate only one person actually can zero some develop something right so if i get the right to develop the land you don't it's not something where we both mutually can do with animals
mutually benefit and and i think that that's not really had a wrestler global economy works the wrestler global economy has these highly interlinked supply change and and divisions of labor and that trumps this is a case where trumps own intelligence and his own success in his business i very rarely
has led him to make conclusions about economics generally that are completely misguided his business experience is the wrong kind of experience because it's based in this list
particular field where the rules of global economics don't really apply way in and of course if i mean he doesn't have to be banned favour by that feeling yet he seems to be he's been fixated on on the trade deficit for a long time rain and one imagines that originally it was this nice club that he was beating president
obama author or whoever was an office that he was angry and and now he's looking at the same numbers in a position to try to do something about it and so he's propelled by that same instinct and i think the other thing is this is an issue in which essentially almost every expert aligns in favor of free trade
and abundant global economy including most republicans sort of acquire conservative principal and he likes to take positions sometimes where he just says of all the experts are wrong i know that because i was elected netherlands that i was going to lose and use it of feel this like is shaking defiance of expertise hear what what's interesting is what he
goes to the mat for and then also what congress goes to the mat for and so congress one hundred republican members have written letter a with the president saying don't do this
efforts to try and perhaps perhaps block him with legislation and it seems to me it sets a benchmark for a presidential effort looks like you know so how hard ovaries he for this and then compare that to other things he says he's concerned about like say school safety and legislation in reaction to the the shooting in portland so as he throne
his back into that as much and if he hasn't why hasn't he and what percentage of energy does he do for these other things relative to this where we see him so active and engaged and then the opposite is true for congress here republicans really motivated and work and hard to press against their president so this sense a bar for the level of n
energy to exert now when they don't exert
that amount of energy for other issues and that gives us some indication how much they really do care about those other issues they say they might care about
do you think it matters that derek i'm left it his departure meaning fallen anyway it doesn't it depend who he is replay a strength and mean if he has replaced by someone who shares his pro free trade views than his particular president seems less important whereas if some you know anti trade web ask you don't allow tape comes and and that seems like a signal
again loss the see at the table i mean in terms of gary can personally and whether were supposed to give him credit for walking out the door it seems to me
you know when you take a stand of conscience about terrorists that you weren't willing to take in the wake of charlottesville are concerned totally disagree really why because charlottesville is not his business charlottesville is not that's not his department he is that his job is to be the economic advisor to the program his job is to give the present the best economic advice and to try to
get the best economic policy and if the president then like so willfully ignores what he believes what he thinks with right then you should leave the president says terrible things and is a racist and and a rabble rouser that's really bad and no one should serve him but the idea of the economic advisor has a special responsibility to quit after charlotte
but the stay after after his his his entire race on get her is is cut from under him comes to me crazy i agree that you didn't have a special responsibility but there was this sort of i think deliberate effort to cast him his troubled by the kind of both sides as and after charlottesville and
because he's jewish that seemed to resonate in some way and he didn't do anything so the fact that he's leaving now after by the way his cashed in his two hundred ninety four million dollars in stock options that you know he got a special deal with in order to serve which is allow we do have to allow a lot of people severed the government that taking a big loss i just in sort
what do you think about gary cone in the world doesn't move me very much
any might also have resigned not necessarily because he was taking a huge stand on trade but just kind of like he got gotten the tax cut bill helped get it passed he's kind of worn out and this is this is a way house when it's a really hard it ain't easy and so is kind of like you know why what's the benefit of sticking around i think the larger point though is of
course when you look at the total pace of departures from the white house it's extraordinary it's three times the pace of the obama administration twice the pace of the reagan administration and that was those no problem with their head their the number as tray and those numbers were even those are those are child low numbers because those numbers don't take into account who picks leading and also a whole bunch
people who have left so much quietly it doesn't take him when he does run porter burn a whole bunch of the blue kind of go in and been pushed down so this is currently clearance other and so are all the job they didn't fill right
that's it i can't leave and that's a great only ever been raided the turnover of a smaller bench but but you so the question what's interesting there to me as a back to this notion of businessman it was always misshapen appalachian to say that you have a businessman and the white house because he's not a businessman of the people meant when they talked about bringing business argument to the white house
a businessman from a huge corporation us to do with management issues and all of that that's different than what president trump is whatever company it was this kind of turnover in a company if it were a public company the share would be trading at about a half a nickel because it's a sign of chaos and the other thing is how do you recruit people i mean it was chaotic and the administration for
early days but there were a lot of people who said it's my duty to the country even though this is crazy i've gotta hang in there but now after more than a year and all this chaos and the what it's done with the reputations of the various people who stuck their neck out for the present only and only to have themselves undermined not to mention big legal fees is robert mother asks to talk to them
do so what what that is not a clarion call that people are in a rush to the employment office to sign up and so then it gets new are really troubling problem because people will get the white house and i think you can make a case if you look at what the president has achieved on taxes if you're a fan of tax cuts then he's done what you want he has gotten
some movement on north korea maybe it's not going to lead to a peace talks but he's gotten some movement on north korea you can make a case if you're apt to support republican candidates that he's gotten some things done and yes it's a circus but the problem then when you talk to students of the white house and you know people worked in previous white house is the reason you need a place to be organized efficiently
is that all presidents are surprised by some big crisis and you need to have the system in place and working so that when the crisis hits you have adults in place you have norms in place and even in under those circumstances it's hell so in this case you have chaos how do you handle that inevitable crisis when it comes
bernard
i want to add one final corner on the tariff korea which is what don't think i found so demoralizing about president this is consistent ability to alienate the people who should be our friends and a friend that people should be our enemies and he's tariffs are classic example of that which is the countries that are most likely to be hurt by this i'm in canada mexico have been temporarily
buchanan mexico to be hit very hard those are two closest allies and many ways certainly our neighbors europe is being hit hard by this or if not our best friends or second best friends and china and russia which are global adversaries are closest things we have are not really
damage at all and it's just and then this is crazy weird blow back around call i don't know if your father's that a lot of steel that has made overseas friends do you assess to his all planned this it's made using high quality us call and so if we are making that steel less attractive
that coal suddenly has value on a marketer their been less demand for that call and therefore the very people the trump has talked about endlessly these coal miners are going to be harmed by it
i mean i think you're going back to your point i might the beginning which is that actually is tariffs are really small beer and the real problem is if they spill into patel asian and there's a lot more of them but that even even within that and and like small beer
no made an incomplete my yes ninety seven percent of the american jobs that depend on steel and downstream industries they're not actually produced and is still a need the cheaper still that's coming from canada or mexico your at etc it just the winners and losers don't even line operate like if these were that forgotten americans and they were willing when winning you could say
but you know if you wanted to help the steel workers who are losing their jobs in pennsylvania in indiana you could have programs where are the government comes in and supports their salaries and some way right there like targeted aid for those people that is not damaging to lots of other working class americans of course we

this week's chaos update you make a care about
that's not for personally
you like to tape that they did it did it did they know you're much better
those inside
land was unclear what you want around men to the next thirty days or the lasers soon we it was for
something else anyway
but you know
under three sound right
so this week's cares update
did it did it
figures and talk he had legal action all kinds of friends all of it weird family family berg a former term campaign aide
of erratic
reddick behavior
under to get bizarre media tour to announce his plan now abandoned planned to defy a subpoena for special counsel muller
there this crazy story in new york times on today thursday about president talking to witnesses who have been speaking to mahler and potentially tampering with although it seems like a strong word enlist you're really not supposed to do that
actually can we will go was india and will get to and then and then probably oh i forgot kelly and conway was accused of hatch checked violations to criminal violations of the hijacked which nothing will happened about that but the main the main trump legal chaos of the week was around former president or pair more are pretty presidential para more store
daniels the porn actress who sued the president this week to avoid the ended and undisclosed argument she had with him to stay silent about that you know a fair the india which was part of an agreement but she was paid one hundred thirty thousand dollars electrically by the president lawyer michael cohen and they're also comes news that
the president's lawyer in fact one in arbitration against her to forbid her from from breaking that and beer and it's very it's quite hard to follow all of this but oh buddy of mine and i'm happy because it took me back to my contacts okay so mm that's grim when was the arbitration by
the way heard in my last week yeah and he won it
yeah he won that she wasn't supposed to do exactly what she did which was file public lawsuit on instead of going into a secret binding arbitration about the terms of the non disclosure agreement icy and so tell us about what this lawsuit sane and why if she's not allowed to file a lawsuit why would she fall off
and if it's one of the mean to not be allowed to file a lawsuit
and then to go ahead and file or well as her she and her later decided not to listen to the arbitrator they didn't like the answer i mean the lawsuit
is it's both a stand and it also is possible it's going to expose this contract as a total fraud and so i'm gonna live for the most part here on sat abramson who has this excellent long and twitter thread about our death so
it seems like if she was worried about the ending a being enforced she was worried that trump or or this fake el al see that michael cohen said we're going to sue her and make her pay a million dollars because that's that
the penalty then she would not be bringing a sausage she would not be talking about this affair
nobody would be doing that but she is banking on none of that happening because in order to enforce the terms of the contract someone has to come forward and say like we signed the contract and we have some rights to protect here so that sort of and then the other thing is michael colonies and south come forward and made statements about this agreement that would seem to also be in violation of
the endear then there's also this great concern to interrupt so she she's betting on there not being somebody willing to actually see her to to enforce their send in get a judgment against her because for trump to see her you trumpet have to say i'm a contract for cohen to see where he'd say i'm party the contract
and for anyone to they'd have to expose themselves to discovery in a lawsuit and bringing publicity more publicity on to it so therefore she would she thinks there won't be a lawsuit potential way and her excuse for find it is that trump are never signed that contract now that's really kind of on
not doesn't look like stone grounds to worry about the validity of the contract because and now i am invoking a first year contracts and lost all contact is off our acceptance consideration like some form of payment and then taking that payment and that happened in this case so the simple missing signature probably doesn't invalidate the contract however
there are many other potential problems at this contract that we can or cannot get into also forgotten also if you abide by the terms of the contract you take the money and then you abide by the terms the country aren't you essentially saying is a valid contract yeah the only ski ski lift tickets he lived through they at the and get same right how
it's very strange contract because of michael collins efforts to distance trump and really himself from this contract their these weird and or clauses about who is binding on and if and cohen is telling so it's also not clear that trump knew about this contract right so if that's true
if cohen never told trump about the contract well that's a clear violation of the ethical rules for lawyers in new york state you don't go around signing contracts for clients i don't know about and also of trump didn't know about it then there was no meaning of the mines that's an essential ingredient of a contract both parties to the contract have to understand what's going on what their do
didn't wasn't cones original position that it was just contract between ham and stormy day and yours he was jumping in front of this thread stormy daniels trump to know anything about it he went did it himself but then what was revealed this week i believe is that there's a side letter in which the pseudonyms used in the agreement are them attached to the actual
people in the agreement and that that's why that's the way in which the president gets attached to this process so it's not just between conan daniels that so the president trump gates and lane and then the signature lions have this additional oddity which is that they talk about the e c l l c they got set up it's not but but
no point is colin sign the contract as trumps layer so it's not really clear who he is and then the other underlying legal problem here is the idea that right before an election someone pays hush money to someone else i mean this got john edwards in dated when that happened right he also had an affair that the national
i enquire was interested in and he also had a supporter who paid off the woman he had the affair with and the you got in big trouble for that i don't really see why this is just friend that a campaign finance violation in his cares yeah but isn't this pretend to know a used campaign money or something and i felt there was sorry that i may be messing it up with no no i think it was
a campaign support array but it shouldn't really matter if cullen need this payment essentially because of the election your them until you can i take i take a very different on which is that i have been unable to determine what the staging of the contacts between daniels and cohen are and so
and how it happened i may be wrong or least slightly off his but to me story daniels is blackmail or terminals has blackmail donald trump and don't trump has done the thing that many people do and they're being blackmailed which is he's paid off the person was blackmailing him and he's done it potentially through which chicanery with
a way that violated campaign finance laws that was it legal but basically he was trying to allay risk about it a fair perfectly legal affair that he had with somebody ten years earlier when when he was president and and his own sexual partners which he didn't want exposed to the world
maybe because he thought it would hurt his chances for election maybe thought it would be embarrassing and so we paid her off and i find the sympathy for story daniels or the or the glee about what she's doing to be very unseemly and misguided like that it's that she is a villain in this to my mind like i don't see well i don't see why we should celebrate what she'd done or be happy
or to feel that this is even a legitimate path for public inquiry any more in maybe the he's ended up breaking the law and michael cohen end up breaking the law but the end up breaking the law basically because they were being black well being blackmailed and then also trying to silence a woman with whom you had an affair with that's just think to term is for the same thing right i mean stymied
daniels on you know hand doesn't leave she telling the truth valuable pieces of information and your rate that she sold them but also in this moment right now much were really rethinking of these non disclosure agreements and the social costs that they bring to bear because and this is in this is not sexual harassment that's it you're going to say that
was a consensual relationship so it's not right in the non disclosure agreement was not something she signed before she had the affair with something that she did afterwards as part of the blackmail agreement way but it also seems clear there was like an enormous power imbalance here she had a terrible liar i mean she should have first of all gotten the love or money from us
absurd
the words and she's gotten a lot more money because she had an affair with the present that she was threatening to reveal that it's it's it's it isn't as as voters as citizens the idea that this bit of information should be commerce that people should be allowed to use this to exploit it and to and to blackmail a presidential candidate over seems to me
disgusting like really
in the sense that it seems like it was worth a lot more on given the stakes bed when i'm also sorry go ahead newman
let me complicate things a little for further which is what if she saw it when she's learning what if there was no her yeah but don't think that like their pictures of them together there's some corroborating evidence is today
all different play i don't think anyone thinks she's lying does it matter if you liner
it's just imagine
our fearless and yeah insert your favorite candidate ever and then somebody comes forward and says i had this affair and you know you're trying to rid of it before the election comes i'm just trying to make it is sort of adding more sympathy to david's argument it seems meets and additionally sympathetic if you change the facts and now and then it's much easier to come down and eight
it's sad but i'm not going to do that
you're saying crazy things and why
encourage people to pay off the other people with him they have affairs right that's not i don't see how that's like some morally upright yes it's legal they signed a contract which was supposed to be binding though it probably only
the center because she blocked because while but i just think the term black now i mean i see why you're using it here but i it's this very morally loaded term for we had an affair i could go and talk about it you don't want me to write i mean another way of thinking about this is like this is a woman who has irrelevant piece of information about a president
talk hand at that could factor into how voter see him and we would have been better off hearing that story before oil election and then you'd say yes it would be we would be better off here it would be good if there were journalistic investigation of the idea that sexual relationships that people had before before there were president before they were presidential campaign
it should be used traded for economic value in this way
growth and disturbing and i think sets a precedent that we don't like i don't think john edwards
should have been prosecuted i think when you when you've done something you've done something sex i am baroness ambient light doesn't actually have a special power know they don't get a special have a lot yes but you also a morally loaded basically kind of yes if you've done something if you've committed a sin which is going to be hugely embarrassing it should not surprise us
people will lie about it and they will pay money to make it go away and then two then fine crime or to find criminal responsibility and that seems to me like like a shitty way to find crime it doesn't
this is the same problem that we will when work clinton gets nothing for lying to to to the grand jury about scaring different things by i mean it of course he's going to lie to the grand jury hush hush money though he didn't have a chance to pay hush money isn't an option or perhaps but but i do think it is
important here that there are campaign finance laws that fair rules about contributions and that's what as far as i can tell where we're wondering about whether was bad valid it and then the other thing is if you are going to signs to contract then you better make sure it's airtight and have good lawyers worked on it really really felt that time to i intend to
side and david on the whole initial blackmail as being the in the original sin of this but i don't but i don't think given where we are now i do think this is actually just fascinating and as a political matter it's it's it's relevant not just because it's the president but because one of the challenges for any republican candidate who will
himself so closely with the evangelical voters is there's a history of claiming that the president and his baby or in office but also throughout his whole life said tomorrow example for the country and so now that this is out there were where is everybody stand on that question they need to ignore it because it isn't their transactions interests to do so
the and then that's an interesting fact because we're talking years presumably about immutable virtues values and since now question for you and me this question of arbitration i'm just trying to figure out who's strategy went right or wrong
he was there an act that story daniels took before before cohen tried to
keep her quiet or was it just that she was talking and he was worried she might take illegal act was there a illegal act he was responding to all yeah i mean a month or two ago the wall street journal ran a story about this affair and this contract and then found the secret our see that con ed set up and then she started talking without talk
rage he started going on and saying i can't talk about this affair
gee now i'm going to go perform in las vegas do you wanna come right and she also said or somebody said on her behalf that she thought that because cohen was talking about it and had avoided the region yeah continental language and layers they're a part of it and the non sign but that was aisle outside of the legal around missouri anything she did in the legal realm to precipitate cohen doing what he
did i don't think so but it's all connected because it's an end yeah she by going going public not quite right
as publicity happened then that could potentially violates the end so then it was presumably yeah we know that it was cohen or whoever is representing this fake l see that went to the the secret arbitrator it was just trying to come to some conclusion about we know that the president has been either litigious or has threaten
nation is a strategy throughout his career and he sounded as president as well and they use and misuse and thread and not thread with litigation has been a strategy and and tool and cohen because it's his lawyers been a part of that and i'm wondering if in this case cohen lose essentially trying to threaten her by calling for this arbitration is using a well worn play
from the playbook yet in this case has landed him in it's a sticky spot because then to have it adjudicated in courts
answers those fact questions which are at issue here which just say was the president in fact involved and i mean rate luck i think it's a stand for daniels and her layer to take it at the courts they're using this lawsuit to publicize facts that pursuant to the end they're not allowed to publicize and a binding arbitrator told them that so in that
sense like you know that if you to take a step back and the way you're doing by invoking this pattern of trumps pro that his reviews of litigation when we go back to trump university he was incredibly aggressive about suing people who said they had damaged by that program their ideas you know
sturm und drang libel law suits that he's brought in the past he isn't it has been an aggressive use user of the courts and so in the sense that there's like a hoisted on your own that hired as this one hundred percent that i was a retard hunting the and also do you think that the the power has flipped on him that he used to be because he wasn't the
president because he had more money
he was able to use the courts in one way and now he can't now he's suddenly that got only medicare and we had seen that in the champ university where he had sat i'm not satellite am not settling on the saber rattling and then they came and they settled right so now we're seeing that again and then you also seeing what happens when you surround yourself with people who perhaps are not actually the best profession
that's where you have someone like michael cohen signing up a contract that than contacts layer goes through and finds like a lot of flaws with even if the problem isn't that you didn't sign the contract so where does this go next and don't so we had a stormy to his lawyer on
as this morning and i said basically using a judge can say to you
sorry to like that
off offer this and why does the country have to suffer through this ugly lawsuit because this is the country because it is the president united states and his his job will be somewhat interrupted just so your client can profit by selling your story which is what she wants to do he denied that she was going to sell it but not so sure they i mean look the gamble is that trump on in four
the contract that there will be ways first army daniels and this layer i think to make money from it perhaps though the indirect somehow maybe she will open up the line of clothing or whatever raid i mean they're all kinds of ways to make money from becoming notorious i meant to use the word notoriety which some like that different bailiff valence from notorious anyway there
many ways for her to try to use her notoriety and were seen some element of that again this is what happens and you surround yourself with the best people are one last question on trump we're going to leave fair number alone
i'm in a padded room
but there was this other weird story in your paper emily
about
trump apparently talking to witnesses who had
been interviewed by modern or in front of them all or grand jury about what they had testified to earth
in interviews
is this
no no no no if a witness tampering is it fine it's probably doesn't rise to the level of witness tampering because for that you would want some truth that trample is trying to change their story is however it's a no no because prosecutors who have lots of power in a situation like this are looking to see if if you have the potential
target or a potential target are trying to get people to coordinate their stories or another word in other ways influence them and one of the
allegations or whatever you want to call it about this talking to witnesses is that trump went toe white house counsel damn again and said hey you never did ted i never did
air jeff sessions are rad rosenstein raid and again was like no you did say that so in fact it does look like he's trying to get began to change his story in a way that would protect against the kinds of facts that build up an obstruction of justice charge and so this is another piece of the most
they're of was there obstruction what does a special counsel need to prove that both to himself
and the country
the also i guess and other than could be if the present ever thinks he's going to sit down with a special counsel he wants to figure out what are the people said so he doesn't say whatever he thinks because for him the truth is whatever has been said in the moment
that's right which is verifiable true because sometimes he says something in the beginning of sense that is different from the end and what he says of the end of a parrot their said and just take this particular instance now he knows that began if he talks tomorrow i can't remember and all this began and interviewed let ever imagine that he has them again let's say yeah trump did tell me that now that's good
potentially presumably mean that trump isn't going to lie about it
right and so then that changes the meaning fullness of the whatever answer he gives because he's he already knows maybe he would have blistered his way into this lie and now presumably he won but it doesn't mean it's because we know that so i can see why the hell with them
you're not supposed to go around like checking your story against other plymouth that he go from know i think this is her add discouraged and it gets prosecutor suspicious so whether it's formally illegal or not if you are a potential target you do not want to do things that make prosecutors think that your sneaking around trying to align
other stories and make your own single your own interests not because at some criminal with a crime it's about whether you're going to get invaded or not it's all that trust rain but also if it wouldn't the case be different if it's a murder and you're trying to get the story straight in this case the underlying thing that is being investigated is whether you were trying to extract justice and therefore
this seems to be closer him an obstruction of justice were with murder it wouldn't be me would be a new charge but this is called a prosecutor save this is evident
you know pieces of evidence fourteen fifteen sixteen in a long story that were telling you about that's way i mean we've been from months
zone of obstruction of justice doesn't mean that were there doesn't mean it's like a slam dunk but in zone and then they're all these facts that are accumulating and you can kind of imagine the kind of story and instruction and diamond could tell if such a document has ever created

attorney general jeff sessions announced in sacramento this week that his department justice suing of california to overturn three laws california recently path to limit power of ice and state
the third law it
two more controversial laws sessions or after one forbid state officials in california from sharing a key information with ice officials notably information about when someone might be released from jail and other information that will get into and the second model which forbids private employer
others from cooperating with ice and revealing certain key employment status information them them
accurate description on one yeah so tell us a little bit more about the flaws why california pass them and what california was hoping to do we get to it
sessions up and do all the first law has been versions of that have passed and other states and other cities as well and the issue here is that you have people have been picked up on relatively minor crimes because california exempted people have committed serious crimes are getting out of print that you have like you know the on driving without a lesson
since the shoplifting folks and they're coming out of jail and i would like to pick them up right there because the administration has been claiming they're going to prioritize getting lawbreakers and criminals out of the country so it doesn't really matter if it's small potatoes crime still counts the let's grab them and their there someone already has them in custody
but if you have a warrant from a judge saying that ice is supposed to take custody a lot of cities and some states have taken the position like sorry we're not holding on to them for extra time for you the not going to tell you when they're getting out and that's become a big bone of contention between ice and on state law and city law enforcement
and so this forbids state officials from conveying information about when people are gonna guess they're not supposed to give a heads up about when they're coming out and in defense of the sessions asked her to give the argument for it there's a federal law that forbids states and cities from with
holding information from the feds about your quote immigration status and so this is going to be a lawsuit that empire turns on what that phrase means it doesn't really seem to me that the obvious reading of immigration status is like when you're getting out of jail but that's the argument right into california said we will tell you information about their immigration stuff
i'll tell you when they're getting out of jail exactly exactly and we won't transfer are people getting out of jail directly into federal custody and what's the second law a private employers which i phone even more confusing yeah that one i know less about i mean i think what's going on here is what can try
that employers disclose to ice how much our workplace raids going to be something that the state tries to prevent by just making the federal government jump through hoops to get information about which companies are implying people without the proper documents had asked to do with like you know when they're allowed to turn over i nines and how that so they can only do it if there is a
a warrant or yeah more formal order that can just do it if someone shows up right exactly on what grounds to the just california make in terms of the federal versus state responsibility on immigration yeah that's a great question i'm in california is saying we know that ice is going to operate we know that's a federal government has the power to him
enforce national immigration laws we don't want our law enforcement folks to help and in defense of california there is a big supreme court decision from must be from the ninety is because i think i was in law school in which this was at the time kind of conservative triumph in which
the federal government was told it cannot commandeer the resources of local law enforcement and do it's work and the idea at the time was that that was very pro federalist pro states
and local government power but now california is using that as the rationale for its law and there's a difference supreme court decision which at the time liberals were happy about involving arizona which and the trump administration has invoked gang and that's the case there was like the show me your papers loss on arizona with it or
pio right
get joe how is he was enforcing at areas like
vehemently with with great excitement but basically arizona was trying to be more restrictive than the federal government and so the obama administration must have been sued to stop arizona from doing that and and then there's the line a helpful now to the truck administration line in which justice kennedy for the majority said that the states
not undermine the federal power and forests immigration laws and so those are the two kind of clashing principles be happier and then obviously we have like a big political battle that both you know jerry brown for the left in california is happy to be shaking his fist and jeff sessions showed up in california to say like
you guys are acting like secessionists in this is lawless and me on have it and so both right and the left in this fight are you know profiting from the legal battle but it is actually really interesting legal question to and the president is potentially going out to california to join in here there's a performance art piece of this between sessions pleasing his boss by
doing some jerry brown and than the president did so they exactly the can see the case for california path and flaws and i can see given the president you started from the nineties but
that said you can come and get the researchers of state and the state shouldn't be forced to spend all their time doing what the what
one wants them to do but
i think the idea of state government can be ordered not to cooperate with the federal government
on matters where the state has a different policy review is is troubling for a little weird and are we going to regret it if we if we may support the hell for a new legislation when this comes to abortion or education
the president is not a great president well so first all on his own thing rant like there's doctrine about immigration love it like is kind of in one lane and in that lane the federal government's powers or added seen it the supreme court said that really clearly you can see all the obvious reasons as the federal government that's responsible for our borders and operates
so yes there is that on the other hand is but the states are doing here really undermining our efforts to secure the borders these are people are inside the country there in the interior raid and the other thing and the add one more factor is the real a very literal meaning of
what the board like that
because doesn't mean it encourages people to come in if they can get into the middle of the country and saying well we already have a bunch of things and immigration law that create that in santa him so i guess you could argue there are problematic but what fact about this than i think is really important what's really at issue here is whether the local sheriff
our law enforcement guy has to hang on to the misdemeanor defendant for forty eight hours without an official warrant from a judge and now do we really want jailers totally hanging on to people for another two days for authority that they have to do that and then the i'll say about this and this is like my on
observation of what's happening in connecticut is ice doing things like showing up in local jails and pretending to be defense lawyers and connecticut and getting lots of information from people because they're trying to get whoever is in custody to inform on other people who may be an undocumented in connecticut there's a lot of like stuff going on with
enforcement
my state and other states they can't believe it's illegal honestly like they show up at your door they can lie about who they are they do all kinds of stuff that just seems like you're hearing about something that should not be legal under american law and so to the extent that states and localities are trying to prevent that from happening
i mean look if you really think that every undocumented person should be looking over their shoulder every damn be made as miserable as possible and that's how we're going to get them to self deport like okay that if you have any kind of hard about these people and their quasi status here and what it's like to live in the shadows this is pretty troubling
the i want to go to the private employer part of it which you said i'm way to your nose red reading about my but i do understand how it's very make sense for a state law saying what its own state officials can do i'm a little bit queasy about the due to the state is telling pro private employers
they can and can't do it forbidding private employers from her cooperating with federal officials even if they want to thing that they may not allow them to do this thing is that made him in his i'm reading forbids them current events them yeah i'm a you can say that that seems that imagine yeah
comply with an f b i and iffy that an f b i agent shows up you may not
you may not talk to them unless he presents this specific set of onerous documents that way i mean the children's occasion is we want to make sure that before workplace raids are conducted all the paperwork in order and that you know because otherwise if you have people knock on your door and asked to see paper as a lot of in players are going to me nervous than just kind of openness other and i was earlier
sure we all had so you can argue that's all they california is doing here i do think this whole question of workplace enforcement and and the role of the employers to the players ever get penalize as opposed to people working there like that's all pretty dicey area of immigration law

okay when
you are
talking to the federal official on your doorstep
and having a drink with a federal official what do you going to shattered our i am a god and amazed by a story in buzz feed this week by my case and candle taggart about a secret list of dirty cops in new york city basically what's happened is that there are a bunch of cops they've gone through internal disciplinary procedures
there's some of them have done some really bad things like slug some down the street or fabricate evidence or lamb the stand and they get a basically slap on the wrist and then they go on to a secret list the prosecutors keep that warns prosecutors against putting these folks is making as using them as witnesses on the stand because of
that happened then they're disciplinary records will come out and this is all possible because of a new york state law called section fifty that forbids the public each issuance issue and forbids the public mention in court of an officers personnel record without judicial approval i can't believe this is the legal and yet
according to the york times just last year a court found that yes this law shields police personnel files meanwhile in philadelphia where there's a new district attorney like krasner he came into office someone league the previous regime had created a similar secret list under court order krasner his office
least at this week and now we have a news story and you coverage in the philadelphia press about these officers and what they've done and it's an important moment of public reckoning of people understanding how poorly some police departments really on
investigate and and treat this kind of music have so much power that the police officers have the notion that cops lie would just go back to work on the next day and then there be some kind of secret essentially work around by prosecutor so that they continue to be out on the street it's real
really alarming and it's going to be interesting there was a press conference this week mer de plaza oh and the police chief commander in new york said you know we really need to get rid of the state law but obviously there are entrenched interests and it's really crazy i think there's gotta be some of our way to try and sue and this practice john what if your
my gender is about the extraordinary news delivered by a variety of people have reported it but hope picks the president's former closest advisors are both in proximity and also just emotional space he was with him for two years really it was responsible for managing his
variety of his moods and was in constantly woven into raising upset
often very regular
he told the house investigating committee the house intelligence committee that her email accounts were hacked and she told the committee that the the tool for accounts personal accounts
including the one she had for the trump campaign had been compromised and she can no longer get into them
so if there was however that way
well i don't know i mean it's unclear from the stories how long it was packed if it was hacked and somebody was looking at it while she was still using it and then what point she got shut out but
it seems to me that
if you were to want to get an email account of a single person in the trump orbit it would be the personal account of hope picks because she would have manage a lot of things on the president's behalf would have short handed things he had said and mrs to various other people i mean
this is just an extraordinary piece of news also obviously it has echoes of the president lampooned john podesta for letting his email get attacked or have during the campaign and get hillary clinton i mean she was secretary of states that that's different
this sounds like the campaign not her texas white house correct correct this is her her personal and different champagne and using her personally account during the transition and you can or even any other and one would assume you would even if you weren't engaged in various activity i mean there is of course the whole question of using the personal versus the private relative to your public job but also like
you know anybody who has multiple accounts like you can do all kinds of stuff inadvertently on one encounter another anyway the point is that like somewhere out there is somebody with an extraordinary trove of material which may have nothing to do with russia and collusion anything else but if they are a bad person then presumably these emails will show up in the
world someday and
the mayor was that even in the new brake know it's been in the news all day thursday we did we did we mentioned it on on on our broadcast this morning
just sort of
i wanted to like stop the presses but there are there are a lot of there was a lot a lot of other news and but i don't mind that i managed to completely miss it
or it might have two one three my self serving or at least rosen party thirty which is that my wife's pod cast invisible yeah
his back for the new season
newton first any drops on thursday and friday excuse me and amazing earliest ana talking about it is amazing
it's amazing i'm sure he says of your own ability is a great broadcast about invisible force as the guide us and honest just been working on some incredible stories her colleagues particularly are cursed at least beagles and working on great story so listen to invisibility a part guess my other chapters i want to flag
really interesting story by andrew romano and downs frankie ruta on yahoo news about a an anti gentrification movement mostly based out of los angeles pay particularly focus on a group called defend boyle heights which is trying to stop the gentrification of a largely mexican american abroad and l a
but this script different boyle heights and others
connected to it are incredibly norton so there's some folks in defend boyle heights who are just engaging than usual forms of public disobedience and public protest about interpretation but there are so group within them who are often anarchists marxists other is a very
sorts who are engaging in civil actions or uncivil actions are that are on violence so they they threatened a bike tour there was a real estate bike tour can go through the neighborhood showing clients how charming it was and they tried to be scrapped because violence was threatened
there are protests in particular
at galleries because they see galleries as being a marker that's placed in a neighborhood that that draws it starts to draw development and draw interpretation
protests caught hip coffee shops made unpleasant for for patrons to be there and it's just it's it's really interesting and i think these movements are like totally wrong headed and threatening and legal one
but it does reflect the incredible rage out there about inequality and about what's happening with thirty so
